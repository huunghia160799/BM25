there are federal regulations that state that as a result it can be assumed that when a loan is paid off notification should be given to the borrower there is not a penalty since schools are pretty good about recovering their money it could be due to a simple human error or glitch in the system i would email them again confirming that your loan had been paid in full just so you have documentation of it

gt;i was referring to earlier whose large legal department said we were legally safe to hire only christian salesmen and board members    safe until someone decides to challenge them with a lawsuit   which they may or may not win   but title vii is pretty thin legal protection for an insurance company given that they as you noted primarily sell insurance   i would think much of the safety comes from economic incentives or the lack there of for a non christian salesman   assuming they are operating in their own interest no salesman who earns off of commission would want a handicap right out of the gate when dealing with christian customers

the bad news is that foreign exchange is ultimately somewhat unpredictable and analyzing the risk of these things is not particularly straightforward i 'm afraid i do n't know what tools exist to analyze these aside from suggesting you look at textbooks for financial analysis classes the good news is that there are other people who deal with multiple currencies international businesses for instance who worry about the same thing as such you can take a look at foreign exchange rate futures and related instruments to estimate what the market as a whole currently expects the values to do the prices of these futures could be a useful starting point

people are willing to pay higher premiums for options when stocks go down obviously the time value and intrinsic value and interests rates of the option does n't change because of this so the remainder is priced into the implied volatility part of the formula   basically anything that suggests the stock price will get volatile sharp moves in either direction will increase the implied volatility of the option for instance around earnings reports the iv in both calls and puts in the nearest expiration dates are very high when stocks go down sharply the volatility is high because some people are buying puts for protection and others are buying calls because they think there will be a rebound move in the other direction people the sleep at night investors not the derivatives traders   tend to be calm when stocks are going up and fearful when they are going down the psychology is important to understand and observe and profit from not to quantitatively prove the first paragraph should be your qualitative answer

gt or are there multiple ways of buying a company   yes there are and it would depend on your definition of what it means to buy a business   if you were intending to acquire a company by being its majority shareholder i.e. equity stake then you would have to buy over its shares from existing shareholders at a negotiated price read not necessarily book value to attain the desired shareholding   however buy a business could also refer to an asset purchase where the target 's fixed assets are bought by the acquirer in which case the target equity might not necessarily be involved in the acquisition

theoretically this concept makes sense   however as recent numbers have shown i do not have the source handy but one can simply obtain this information via the ecb 's website banks have tapped this something in the likes of 500 billion or so and instead of buying sovereign debt they instead prefer to park this money with the ecb paying something like 25 bps on deposits   so instead of using this money to buy sovereigns or perhaps lend to other banks easing the strain on libor banks have just parked this money back with the ecb as the ecb has seen its deposits once again reach record amounts again see the ecb website for proof   just this speaks volumes about the carry trade and how it is evidently not going to achieve its long term goal of bringing spreads down in europe   perhaps in the short run yes but if you look at the fundamentals eurusd the eur basis swap and the libor spread they show how the situation in europe is far from over and the is nothing close to a long term and stable solution

you are correct   credit card companies charge the merchant for every transaction   but the merchant is n't necessarily going to give you discount for paying in cash   the idea is that by providing more payment options they increase sales covering the cost of the transaction fee   that said some merchants require a minimum purchase for using a credit card though this may be against the policies of some issuers in the u.s. i have no idea about india also correct   they hope that you 'll carry a balance so that they can charge you interest on it   some credit cards are setup to charge as many fees as they possibly can   these are typically those low limit cards that are marketed as good ways to build up your credit   most are basically scams in the fact that the fees are outrageous update regarding minimum purchases apparently visa is allowing minimum purchase requirements in the u.s. of $ 10 or less   however it seems that mastercard still does not allow them for the most part   moral of the story research the credit card issuers policies   a further update regarding minimum purchases in the us merchants will be allowed to require a minimum purchase of up to $ 10 for credit card transactions   i am guessing that prompted the visa rule change mentioned above more detail can be found here in this answer along with a link to the text of the bill itself

you need to consult a lawyer in your area generally speaking though if you breach the t&c they do n't have to follow them either which means that whatever they were responsible for in those terms and conditions they 're no longer responsible   so if you get hacked and they can prove you breached t&c by sharing your credentials they are absolutely off the hook for your financial losses so if they detect you 're in breach they may record it and not pursue any other action unless until you have an issue in which case they say they 're in breach see here here and here   or there may be regulations that require they notify you of their detection of the breach   if this sort of regulation exists i suspect that the notification would also include a termination of all accounts as well   i can also picture situation where a company might have such a policy built into the t&c so that they can steer as clear as possible from any situations involving liability and cyber crime in the same sentence my suggestion would be to take the terms and conditions for your banks to some kind of legal clinic and get them to explain the parts that you do not understand

interest rates are market driven they tend to be based on the prime rate set by the federal reserve bank because of the tremendous lending capacity of that institution and that other loan originators will often fund their own lending at least in part with fed loans however there is no mandatory link between the federal reserve rate and the market rate no law stipulates that rates can not rise or fall they will rise and fall as lenders see necessary to use their capital though a lender asking 10 interest might make no loans when others are willing to lend for 9 the only protection you have is that we are mostly economically free as a borrower you are protected by the fact that there are many lenders likewise as a lender because there are many borrowers stability is simply by virtue of the fact that one market participant with inordinate pricing will find fewer counterparties to transact

my primary concerns there seems to still be a fair bit of distressed property etc on the market at current which might well keep prices down for the next year or so that it takes to finish that stuff out of the market   the gist i get from most experts pundits is that there will be good deals around for while to come still i 'd advise you wait   go ahead and do the math to figure out what total you would be paying would be and charge yourself that much a for rent in your current place pocketing the difference in a savings account   you 'll be able to get a feeling for what it 's like to live with that kind of house payment and if you can do it sans any room mate something you ca n't always count on   if you can manage it then you have a much more realistic idea of what you can afford and you 'll have saved up a bunch of money to help with a down payment in the process   if for example your mortgage plus taxes and insurance ends up running around say $ a month plus another $ 150 for the hoa well then that 's charging yourself $ 1600 a month for your rent which means $ 1000 per month going into the bank in two years that 's nearly the same as what you have now in the $ 401 k and you 'd have a really good idea if you can afford that much per month in housing costs if you are bound and determined to do this now then here 's a few other things to consider you might to shop around a bit to see how typical those hoa fees are    yeah you do n't have the expense and hassle of needing to mow the lawn paint the place etc   but still   150 a month translates to around another 1.5 mortgage payments a year you might be able to get around pmi by splitting the mortgage into two pieces and doing a purchase money second of around 15 20 and 75 70 of the value for the main mortgage   that way the on your primary loan is under 80 which could be worthwhile even if the interest rate on that second loan is a little higher at least it 's deductible paying pmi is just money lost to you although trying to do any kind of creative financing these days is a lot trickier

there are some economic signs as there are in all economic and business cycles such as interest rates rising however a more effective way is to actually look at price action itself the definition of an uptrend is higher highs followed by higher lows the definition of a downtrend is lower lows followed by lower highs so if you are looking to invest for the long term you can look at the weekly or even the monthly chart of the market say over the past 10 15 or 20 years using these definitions on say the s&p500 if the price continues to make higher highs and higher lows then stay in the market if the price makes a lower high than the previous high then this is a warning sign that the trend may be about to end the trend has not broken yet but it is a warning sign that it could be ending soon if the price makes a higher low next followed by a higher high then the trend continues and you just need to keep an eye on things if however the price makes a lower low after the lower high this is a signal that the uptrend is over and you should get out of the market if the price makes a lower low directly after a higher high then be cautious and wait for confirmation that the uptrend is over if you then get a lower high this is confirmation that the uptrend is over you would then sell if prices drop below the previous low if you invest in individual shares then you should keep an eye on the charts for the index and individual shares as well the index chart will give you an indication if the uptrend is over for the whole market then you can be more cautious in regards to the individual shares you can then plan exit points on each individual share if their trends are broken too if you have stop losses employed and the trend reverses on the index this would be a good time to tighten your stop losses on individual shares you can then buy back into the market when you determine that the downtrend is broken and prices start to show higher highs and higher lows again will there be occasions when the uptrend reverses and then after a short period starts trending up again yes there might be but the worse that will happen is that you pay a bit of extra brokerage to get out and then back into the market and you might have to pay some capital gains tax on any profits made but remember no one ever went broke making a profit the most important thing to remember when investing is to conserve and protect your capital i would rather pay some extra brokerage and some capital gains tax than see my portfolio drop by 50 or more then take 5 years or more to recover and remember paying tax is a good thing it means you made money if you do n't want to pay any tax it means you will never make any profits because if you make profits you will have to pay tax one day

to receive unemployment benefits you must be registered with an employment agency and be actively seeking work and be willing to accept work should it be offered to you as a full time cornell university student as you describe yourself this does not seem a likely scenario also you need to have established a state of residence it is not clear to me that you have done so given your travel between the south pacific new york north carolina etc you should check with your local state unemployment office in new york state or perhaps north carolina although i do n't know if you satisfy residency requirements in either state they will be able to confirm however are your parents claiming you as a dependent on their federal income taxes if so i do not believe that you will be able to file for unemployment benefits regardless of your student status at cornell university   one more issue to consider have you filed tax returns for the income you received from your television production work i am uncertain of the amount as you said that you worked for two intervals making $ 10,000 that implies $ 20,000 of earnings over two years yet your bullet point number 7 states that you made 10 grand each of the four months if that means that you made $ 10,000 per month for four months then you earned $ 40,000 per summer for a total of $ 80,000 for two summer 's worth of work i do n't think unemployment benefits are intended for individuals in your situation

for the type of market neutrality you desire free from crash risk it 's best to hedge the shares with covered calls when implied volatility is expensive and puts when implied volatility is cheap with the nearest at the money expirations   a put only strategy can be very expensive and should only be used with the longest term options available since they can cost many tens of per year securities become almost perfectly correlated during a crash therefore market crash risk of one security is essentially equal to the market crash risk so hedging the security itself makes a position market neutral for crash risk this strategy will have intermittent opportunity cost risk in the form of slower returns during market expansion to pay for smaller losses during a crash however the expected long run return hedged this way should be greater than the underlying 's expected long run return with less volatility

you 're misunderstanding the concept of retirement savings ira distributions are taxed in their entirety as ordinary income if you withdraw before the retirement age additional 10 penalty is added investment income has preferential treatment long term capital gains and qualified dividends are taxed at lower rates than ordinary income however ira contributions are tax deductible i.e. you do n't pay taxes on the amounts contributed to the ira when you earned the money only when you withdraw in the mean time the money is growing tax free based on your investments anything inside the ira is tax free including dividends distributions from funds to your ira not from ira to you capital gains etc this is very powerful when taking into account the compounding effect of reinvesting your dividends sale proceeds without taking a chunk out for taxes consider you make an investment in a fund that appreciated 100 in half a year you cash out to reinvest in something less volatile to lock the gains in a regular account you pay taxes when you sell based on your brackets in the ira you reinvest all of your sale proceeds that would be ~25 35 more of the gains to reinvest and continue working for you however if you decide to withdraw you pay ordinary rate taxes on the whole amount if you would invest in a single fund for 30 years in a regular account you 'd pay 20 capital gains tax on the appreciation not the dividends in the ira if you invest in the same fund for the same period you 'll pay your ordinary income rates however the benefit of reinvesting dividends tax free the blow somewhat but that 's much harder to quantify bottom line if you want to plan for retirement plan for retirment otherwise ira is not an investment vehicle also consider roth ira conversions roth ira has the benefit of tax free distributions at retirement if your current tax bracket is at 20 for example contributing $ 5 k to roth ira instead of a traditional will cost you $ 1 k of taxes now but will save you all the taxes during the retirement for the distributions from the roth ira it may be very much worth your while especially if you can contribute directly to roth ira there are some income limitations and you can withdraw contributions but not earnings from roth ira something you can not do with a traditional ira

i think the primary reason it is so pricey now is that it is an inflation hedge and considering how shaky the economies and out of control the spending is in many countries right now people are running to it as a safe harbor the increased demand raises the price as it does with any asset   this brings us to the question why does gold have value the same reason anything has value there is someone out there who wants it enough to trade something else of value to get it   it is in the news so much because it is so high right now which unfortunately is going to cause a lot of people to foolishly invest in it at likely the worst possible time

with a long enough time horizon no matter when you buy equities almost always outperform cash and bonds there 's an article here with some info holding period where shares have beaten cash   there was a similar study done which showed if you picked any day in the last 100 years no matter if the market was at a high or low after 1 year your probability of being in profit was only 0.5 but after 10 20 years it was almost certainly 1.0   equities compound dividends too and the best place to invest is in diversified stock indices such as the s&p500 or indices funds which pay dividends the best way to capture returns is to dollar cost average e.g. place a lump sum then add $ x every month to re invest dividends and oh to forget about it in an ira or sipp self invested pension or other vehicle which discourages tampering with your investment   yes values rise and fall but we humans are so short sighted if we had bought the s&p in 2007 and sold in 2009 in fear we would have missed out on the 25 gain excluding dividends from 2007 2014 that 's about 3 a year gain even if you bought the 2007 high cash or bonds even after the financial crisis now imagine had you dollar cost averaged the entire period from 2007 2014 where your gain would be your equity curve would have the same shape as the s&p with its drastic dip in 2009 but an accelerated growth after there are studies if you dig that demonstrate the above from experience i can tell you timing the market is nigh impossible and most fund managers are unable to beat the indices far better to dca and re invest dividends and not care about market gyrations

a board authorizes the repurchase of shares because they feel the stock in undervalued the hope is that the stocks will rise either directly by their repurchase or in the near term due to the realization that the company is in better shape then the market thought eventually those shares will be resold back into the market thus bring in more cash at a later date   they will set limits on them maximum they will pay they will also spread the repurchases out over a time period so they do n't overwhelm the market

you could be in a bit of a bind   i would n't push it any more until you read your loan papers very carefully going back to the lender for a refinance after you converted it to a rental presumably without their knowledge is risky   i doubt they 'd let you refinance anyway as the house is underwater if the loan is performing then i would n't think they 'd look too hard for reasons to upset the flow of checks by calling the loan due but if you advertise the change of property use to them they may reconsider read your loan papers carefully to see what they can do before you lean on them too much as for managing the finances on that property i 'd build up a cushion to deal with the fact that your payment is going to shoot up considerably in year 8   also consider building up a side business to get another income stream going to compensate as well   you have a little time before it shoots up

short answer is yes all the firms are required to keep enough resources on hand to pay claims that may arise from even extreme events like the recent hurricanes   insurance firms are rated based on their claims paying ability and it is absolutely critical for them to maintain enough cushion to pay claims   if lose confidence they wo n't be able to write any more business and they are done   in addition to manage tail risks primary insurers like allstate will often purchase reinsurance   so for example allstate might go to swiss re and buy a policy that kicks in once allstate 's liability exceeds $ for a given event

you can have as many ira accounts as you want whether roth or traditional so you can have a roth ira with american funds and another roth ira with vanguard if you like one disadvantage of   having too many ira accounts with small balances in each is that most custodians   including vanguard charge an annual fee for maintaining ira accounts with small balances but waive the fee if the balance is large so it is best to keep your roth ira in just one or two funds with just one or two custodians until such time as investment returns plus additional contributions made over the years makes the balances large enough to diversify further remember also that you can not contribute the maximum to each ira the sum total of all your ira contributions does n't matter whether to roth or to traditional iras for any year must satisfy the limit for that year you can move money from one ira of yours to another ira of the same type of yours without any tax issues to worry about such movements called rollovers or transfers are   not contributions and do not count towards the annual contribution limit the easiest way to do move money from one ira account to another ira account is by a trustee to trustee transfer where the money goes directly from one custodian american funds in this case to the other custodian vanguard in this case the easiest way of accomplishing this is to call vanguard or go online on their website tell them that you are wanting to   establish a roth ira with them and that you want to fund it by transferring money held in a roth ira with american funds give vanguard the account   number of your existing american funds ira tell them how much   you want to transfer over $ 1000 or $ 20,000 or the entire balance as the case may be and tell vanguard to go get the money   in a few days time the money will appear in your new vanguard roth ira and the american funds roth ira will have a smaller balance possibly a zero balance or might even be closed if you told vanguard to collect the entire balance   do not approach american funds and tell them that you want to transfer money to a new roth ira with vanguard they will bitch and and drag their heels about doing so because   they are unhappy to lose your business and will probably screw up the transfer talk to vanguard only they are eager to get their hands on your ira money and will gladly take care of the whole thing for you at no charge to you do not cash in any stock shares or mutual fund shares or whatever is in your roth ira in preparation for cashing out of the old account there is a method where you take a rollover distribution from your american funds roth ira and then deposit the money into your new vanguard roth ira within 60 days but i recommend most strongly against using this because too many people manage to screw it up it is 60 days not two months the clock starts from the day american funds cuts your check not when you get the check and it is stopped when the money gets deposited into your new account not the day you mailed the check to vanguard or the day that vanguard received it   and so on in short do not try this at home   stick to a trustee to trustee transfer and avoid the hassles

to add to @keshlam 's answer slightly a stock 's price is made up of several components the only one of these that is known even remotely accurately at any time is the book value on the day that the accounts are prepared even   completed cashflows after the books have been prepared contain some slight unknowns as they may be reversed if stock is returned for example or reduced by unforeseen costs   future cashflows are based on amongst other things how many sales you expect to make in the future for all time exercise for the reader how many iphone will apple sell in even known future cashflows have some risk attached to them customers may not pay for goods a supplier may go into liquidation and so need to change its invoicing strategy etc estimating the risk on future cashflows is highly subjective and depends greatly on what the analyst expects the exact economic state of the world will be in the future investors have the choice of investing in a risk free instrument this is usually taken as being modelled by the 10 year us treasury bond that is guaranteed to give them a return to invest in anything riskier than the risk free instrument they must be paid a premium over the risk free return that they would get from that the risk premium is related to how likely they think it is that they will not receive a return higher than that rate calculation of that premium is highly subjective if i know the management of the company well i will be inclined to think that the investment is far less risky or perhaps riskier than someone who does not for example since none of the factors that go into a share price are accurately measurable and many are subjective there is no right share price at any time let alone at time of ipo each investor will estimate these values differently and so value the shares differently and their trading based on their ever changing estimates will move the share price to an level in comments to @keshlam 's answer you ask if there is enough information to work out the share price if a company buys out the company before ipo dividing the price that this other company paid by the relative ownership structure of the firm would give you an idea of what that company thought that the company was worth at that moment in time and can be used as a for market price but it will not and can not accurately represent the market price as other investors will value the firm differently by estimating the criteria above differently and so will move the share price based on their valuation

working for a lot of startups i have seen this cycle really it has little to do with making the ipo look good because of number of employees and is more about making the ipo look good because of planning for the future many times an ipo is released it will be valued at $ 1.00 made up and the market will soar and spike now stock shares are valued at $ 3.00 great till after the dust settles a bit and stocks are valued at $   this is normal and good   it would be better if the stocks ended a little higher than their initial value but such is life   now the initial value of the stock is made up of basically the value of the company 's assets and employees are part of those assets and its earning power they are also a liability but that has less impact on initial value than assets sales right after ipo are based on how well a company will do part of that is growth so it looks nicer to say we have 500 employees and have been growing by 20 per month than to say we have 100 employees in other words before ipo employees may be hired to make the company look like it is growing they may be hired because the budget is projected based on expected growth and expected valuation   after ipo you get a concrete number you have your budget it may be more than you thought or it may be less in our example the real budget from capital is only 28 of the entire projected budget and 85 of the initial value it 's time to make some budget cuts   also normally there is a period of adjustment company wide as a company goes from vc funding here have as much money as you want to real world funding with stricter limits and less wiggle room

first of all it 's great you 're now taking full advantage of your employer match i.e. free money next on the question of the use of a life cycle target date fund as a hedge life cycle funds were introduced for hands off one stop shopping investors who do n't like a hassle or do n't understand   such funds are gaining in popularity employers can use them as a default choice for automatic enrollment which results in more participation in retirement savings plans than if employees had to opt in   i think life cycle funds are a good innovation for that reason but the added service and convenience typically comes with higher fees   if you are going to be hands off make sure you 're cost conscious   fees can devastate a portfolio 's performance in your case it sounds like you are willing to do some work for your portfolio   if you are confident that you 've chosen a good equity glide path that is the initial and final stock bond allocations and the rebalancing plan to get from one to the other   then you 're not going to benefit much by having a life cycle fund in your portfolio duplicating your own effort with inferior components   i assume you are selecting great low cost liquid index funds for your own strategy   life cycle are neat but replicating them is n't rocket science however i see a few cases in which life cycle funds may still be useful even if one has made a decision to be more involved in portfolio construction similar to your case you have a company savings plan that you 're taking advantage of because of a matching contribution   chances are your company plan does n't offer a wide variety of funds   since a life cycle fund is available it can be a good choice for that account   but make sure fees are n't out of hand   if much lower cost equity and bond funds are available consider them instead let 's say you had another smaller account that you were unable to consolidate into your main account   e.g. a traditional ira vs. your roth and you did n't necessarily want to convert it   even if that account had access to a wide variety of funds it still might not be worth the added hassle or trading costs of owning and rebalancing multiple funds inside the smaller account   there perhaps the life cycle fund can help you out while you use your own strategy in your main account finally let 's assume you had a single main account and you buy partially into the idea of a life cycle fund and you find a great one with low fees except you want a bit of something else in your portfolio not provided by the life cycle fund e.g. some more emerging markets international or commodity stock exposure   is this one reason you 're doing it yourself in that case where the life cycle fund does n't quite have everything you want you could still use it for the bulk of the portfolio e.g. 85 95 and then select one or two specific additional etfs to complement it   just make sure you factor in those additional components into the overall equity weighting and adjust your life cycle fund choice accordingly e.g. perhaps go more conservative in the life cycle to compensate i hope that helps additional references

in a sentence stocks are a share of equity in the company while bonds are a share of credit to the company when you buy one share of stock you own a typically percentage of the company you are usually entitled to a share of the profits of that company and/or to participate in the business decisions of that company a particular type of stock may or may not pay dividends which is the primary way companies share profits with their stockholders the other way is simply by increasing the company 's share value by being successful and thus desirable to investors a stock also may or may not allow you to vote on company business you may hear about companies buying 20 or 30 interests in other companies they own that percentage of the company and their vote on company matters is given that same weight in the total voting pool typically a company offers two levels of stocks common stock usually has voting rights attached and may pay dividends preferred stock usually gives up the voting rights but pays a higher dividend percentage maybe double or triple that of common stock and may have payment guarantees if a promised dividend is missed in one quarter and then paid in the next the preferred stockholders get their dividend for the past and present quarters before the common shareholders see a penny governments and non profits are typically prohibited from selling their equity if a government sold stock it would basically be taxing everyone and then paying back stockholders while non profit organizations have no profits to pay out as dividends bonds on the other hand are a slice of the company 's debt load think of bonds as kind of like a corporate credit card when a company needs a lot of cash it will sell bonds a single bond may be worth $ 10 $ 100 or $ 1000 depending on the investor market being targeted this is the amount the company will pay the bondholder at the end of the term of the bond these bonds are bought by investors on the open market for less than their face value and the company uses the cash it raises for whatever purpose it wants before paying off the bondholders at term 's end usually by paying each bond at face value using money from a new package of bonds in effect rolling over the debt to the next cycle similar to you carrying a balance on your credit card the difference between the cost and payoff is the interest charge on this slice of the loan and can be expressed as a percentage of the purchase price over the remaining term of the bond as its yield or apy for example a bond worth $ 100 that was sold on jan 1 for $ 85 and is due to be paid on dec 31 of the same year has an apy of 100 = typically yields for highly rated companies are more like 4 6 a bond that would yield 17 is very risky and indicates a very low bond rating so called junk status

there are two ways to measure the value of money in the past 1 as victor mentioned there are inflation statistics covering the last 100 or so years that value the currency against an ever changing basket of goods this is sufficient when measuring general inflation over the period of the hundred years where there is data this is how it was measured in your example 2 for older time periods or where a value comparison is required between specific items particularly where these were not in the basket of goods used for the inflation calculation historical records of the price of comparable goods can be used this is in effect the same as mark to market valuations for illiquid financial instruments and requires through records to find the price of either a comparable basket of goods to one that would be used for inflation calculations today or a comparable set of items an example of this is finding the value of a particular type of house say a house in london in the 19th century compared to the same house today by finding records of how much comparable houses would sell for on average then and now this second measure is also used where the country in question did n't or does n't keep reliable inflation statistics which may well be true of colombia in the 90s this means that there is a chance that this way of estimating 's wealth in today 's terms may have also been used another notable reason to use this methodology is that unless you are using exchange rates in purchasing power parity terms the value of money held in different currencies is different this is even true today as the value of $ 1 in inr in india is likely to be higher than the value of a dollar in the us in terms of what you can buy using this methodology allows for a more accurate comparison in values where different countries and currencies are involved

the benefit is that your earnings in the 401k are not subject to income tax until you make withdrawals this allows you to grow your money faster than if you made equivalent investments in a taxable account and had to pay taxes on dividends and capital gains along the way also the theory is that you will be in a lower tax bracket in retirement and thus you will pay lower taxes overall if this is not true especially if you will be in a higher tax bracket in retirement then there may not be any advantage for you to contribute to a 401k one advantage over the traditional ira is the higher contribution limit some 401k plans also allow you to take loans from the plan i do n't think this is possible with a traditional ira an alternative to both the 401k and traditional ira is the roth version of either plan with a roth you pay taxes up front but your withdrawals during retirement are tax free

you do n't need pay any taxes for you amount in nre account since this amount is already taxed i also think you do not need to pay taxes on the interest earned on nre account however you need to disclose the amount in your indian bank(s if at any point of time exceed $ 10 k when converted from inr to $ this is fbar sending money to non nre account would come under indian tax scanner for instance if your parents use that money to pay or any huge purchase then that might cause an issue most of the times these type of purchases go unnoticed however the party who is taking money may ask for source especially if its a financial institution or govt bodies also for non nre accounts you need to pay taxes and on interest earned hope this helps

my answer might be out of date due to the affordable health care law   i will answer for the way things were prior to that law taking effect in my experience hospitals have a financial assistance program you can apply for   if you can show a financial need the hospital will only charge you a certain percentage of your bill   a person with a very low income will likely only be charged 5 or 10 of the theoretical balance   that would be assuming the person is at or near the poverty level which has an official definition but to give you an idea your cashier at mcdonald 's is probably at or near the poverty level also note that sometimes it takes a while for hospital charges to be submitted to insurance and to be approved and paid   thus many people have learned through experience to ignore the first bill that comes in from a hospital and wait a month before paying there can be a dramatic drop in the what you owe line after the insurance company responds and the billing office adjusts the bill to the negotiated amount and subtracts off what the insurance company covered

it has been hinted at in some other answers but i want to say it explicitly volatility is not risk volatility is how much an investment goes up and down risk is the chance that you will lose money for example stocks have relatively high volatility but the risk that you will lose money over a 40 year period is virtually zero in particular if you invest in index funds bonds on the other hand have basically no volatility their cash flow is totally predictable if you trust the future of your government but there is a significant risk that they will perform worse than stocks over a longer period so volatility equals risk only if you are day trading a 401(k is literally the opposite of that for further reading never confuse risk and volatility also investing is not gambling gambling is bad because the odds are stacked against you you need more than average luck to actually win and the longer you play the more you will lose investing means buying productive capital that will produce further value the odds are in your favor even if you do a moderately bad job at investing the longer you stay the more you will win

buy term and invest the difference is certainly the standard recommendation and for good reason when you start looking at some sample numbers the buy term and invest the difference strategy starts to look very good here are the rates i found 27 yr old in texas with good health non smoker etc $ 200k term life $ $ 200k whole life $ if you were to invest the difference in a retirement account for 40 years assuming a 7 rate of return many retirement planning estimates use 10 you would have $ at the end of that period if you use 10 that figure jumps to over $ needless to say $ 400k in a retirement account is better than a $ 200k death benefit especially since you ca n't get the death benefit and the cash value certainly one big difficulty is making sure you invest that difference the best way to handle that is to set up a direct deposit that goes straight from your paycheck to the retirement account before it even touches your bank account the next best thing would be an automatic transfer from your bank account you may wonder what if i can no longer afford to invest that money first off take a second and third look at your finances before you start eating into that but if financial crisis comes and you truly ca n't afford to fund your own life insurance retirement account then perhaps it will be a good thing you 're not locked into a life insurance policy that forces you to pay those premiums that extra freedom is another benefit of the buy term and invest the difference strategy it is great that you are asking this question now while you are young because it is much easier to put this strategy into play now while you are young   as far as using a cash value policy to help diversify your portfolio i am no expert in how to allocate long term investments after maxing out my ira and 401k my ira maxes out at $ 5k year another $ 5k for my wife 's another $ for my 401k before i maxed that out i would have my house paid for and kid 's education saved for and by then it would make sense to pay a financial adviser to help you manage all those investments they would be the one to ask about using a cash value policy similar to 's description   i believe you should never put your money into something you don't understand cash value policies are complex and i do n't fully understand them i should add that of course my calculations are subject to the standard disclaimer that those investment returns are n't guaranteed as with any financial decision you must be willing to accept some level of risk and the question is not whether to accept risk but how much is acceptable that 's why i used 7 in my calculation instead of just 10 i wanted to demonstrate that you could still beat out whole life if you wanted to reduce your risk and/or if the stock market performs poorly

in this equation the withdrawal rate is the percent you must pull from your savings to meet your expenses for example if your savings is $ 100,000 and you need $ 10,000 annually for your living expenses then your withdrawal rate would be 10 where 10k is 10 of 100k   to complete this formula you need to know how much savings you need to be financially independent before you can use this formula to find out how long it will take you

make sure to check the language describing the discount the company may be matching your contribution by 5 instead of a discount   you will likely be taxed on the match as compensation and your benefit would net to less than 5    the next risk is that you 've increased your exposure if your company does poorly   in the worst case scenario you could lose your wages to a layoff and your portfolio to a falling share price   investing in other companies will diversify this risk as for benefits you get the 5 less taxes for free which is n't a bad thing in my book just do n't put everything you own into the stock   it should be part of your overall investing strategy

there are non financial costs to having a debt you need to remember to make monthly payments perhaps keep track of changing interest rates be aware of conditions of the debt archive the related paperwork life is simpler with fewer debts and that has value of course if the difference in interest rate is large then that is more important and the higher interest should be paid off first but if the difference is only half a percentage point or so you may decide that having fewer debts is in itself worth the bit of extra interest you pay

i will add one thought on to this thread   this is a financial concept called net present value   in plain english it means what 's the best use for your money right now so let 's say you have an extra € 300/month which is not being spent on living expenses if you leave that money under your pillow or spend it on beer or fancy electronics instead of paying off your early that is costing you per month every month   so € or €   this is cumulative for the life of your loan   so not paying € 300 this month will ultimately cost you € 120 assuming you keep the loan open for 10 years   if you 're saying pay my debts or spend the money on a smartphone the answer is that you should pay your debts now here 's the important part   let 's suppose you have a better use for the money than beer or electronics   let 's suppose you have a mutual fund which will reliably provide you with a return of 10 a year if you put that € 300/month into a high yield fund and if the returns are consistent you are still paying that € because you invested elsewhere and did n't pay your debts but you are realizing profits of on the invested money   € 2.5 which is a net gain   so in some cases paying off your debt may not be the best use of your money there are a number of other questions involved which are related to your exposure to capital gains taxes incentives or disincentives for holding debt c. c.   these are generally country specific   a poster above who seems to be familiar with netherlands law did a good explanation of some of those incentives   i 'm in the us and our incentive and disincentive system is different tl;dr   it depends

that would imply that a 30y us treasury bond only yields 2.78 which is low those are annualized yields   it would be more precise to say that a 30y us treasury bond yields 2.78 per year annualized over 30 years but that terminology is implied in bond markets so if you invest $ 1,000 in a 30-year t bond you will earn roughly 2.78 in interest per year also note that yield is calculated as if it compounded meaning that investing in a 30-year t bind will give you a return that is equivalent to putting it in a savings account that earns 1.39 interest half of 2.78 every 6 months and compounds meaning you earn interest on top of interest the trade off for these low yields is you have virtually no default risk   unlike a company that could go bankrupt and not pay back the bond the us government is virtually certain to pay off these bonds because it can print or borrow more money to pay off the debts in addition bonds in general and especially treasuries have very low market risk meaning that their value fluctuates much less that equities even   s&p 500 indices may move anywhere between and 50 in any given year while t bonds range of movement is much lower between -10 and 30 historically

you should check with your broker for details but you can generally specify which lot you are selling   where i 've seen it that 's done by concurrently sending a letter of instruction documenting your choice of lot concurrent with the sale but different brokers may handle this differently   i would think this should work for the case that you describe in addition the default rule used by your broker is probably first in first out which will do what you want here note that this may come into play even in a margin account to the extent that you might want to specify a lot in order to obtain or set yourself up for later benefit of favorable tax treatment under the long term capital gains rules

if you 're fiscally responsible go ahead and use a   honestly in all of the horror story experiences i 've seen where someone went into honest details they were trying to skate by with risky decisions at the extreme bottom end of the financial spectrum nearly all of the complaints boil down to overdraft fees for people who run their account down to less than $ 10 and then get upset when something unexpected happens   for example when banks re order purchases from largest to smallest so that users would have to pay a larger quantity of overdraft fees that can literally only happen if you 've tried to spend more than you have in the account it 's mathematically not possible for that to happen any other way so yes i think everyone can agree re ordering is shitty but those overdrafts are also 100 preventable by not trying to spend more than you   most people just want to jump on the gripe train and they are n't going to share the real details of their situation if they even understand them

the tax cost at election should be zero   the appreciation is all capital gain beyond your basis which will be the value at election irc 83 applies to property received as compensation for services where the property is still subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture   it will catch unvested equity given to employees stops taxation until the substantial risk of forfeiture i.e. no tax until stock vests since the item is and not yet truly income   83(b allows the taxpayer to make a quick election up to 30 days after transfer firm deadline to waive the substantial risk of forfeiture e.g. treat shares as vested today the normal operation of 83 takes over after election and the taxable income is generally the value of the vested property minus the price paid for it   if you paid fair market value today then the difference is zero and your income from the shares is zero the shares are now yours for tax purposes though not for legal purposes   that means they are most likely a capital asset in your hands like other stocks you own or trade   the shares will not be treated as compensation income on vesting and vesting is not a tax matter for elected shares if you sell them you get capital gain with tax dependent on your holding period over a basis equal to fmv at the election   the appreciation past election fmv will be capital gain rather than ordinary income   this is why the 83(b election is so valuable   it does not matter at this point whether you bought the restricted shares at fmv or at discount or received them free that only affects the taxes upon 83(b election

after seeing your most recent comment on the original question it looks like others have answered the question you intended and described the extreme difficulty of getting the timing right the way you 're trying to since i 've already typed it up what follows answers what i originally thought your question was which was asking if there were drawbacks to investing entirely in money market funds to avoid stock volatility altogether money market funds have the significant drawback that they offer low returns one of the fundamental principles in finance is that there is a trade off between low risk and high returns while money market funds are extremely stable their returns are paltry under current market conditions you can consider them roughly equivalent to cash on the other hand though investing in stocks puts your money on a roller coaster returns will be on average substantially higher since people often invest in order to achieve personal financial stability many feel naturally attracted to very stable investments like money market funds however this tendency can be a big mistake the higher returns of the stock market do n't merely serve to an investor 's greed they are necessary for achieving most people 's financial goals for example consider two hypothetical investors saving for retirement over the course of a career the first investor apprehensive adam invests $ 10k per year in a money market fund the second investor brave barbara invests $ 10k per year in an s&p 500 index fund reinvesting dividends let 's be generous and say that adam 's money market fund keeps pace with inflation in reality they typically do n't even do that at the end of 40 years in today 's money adam will have $ 10,000 40 = $ 400,000 not nearly enough to retire comfortably on on the other hand let 's assume that barbara gets returns of 7 per year after inflation which is typical though not guaranteed barbara will then have using the formula for the future value of an annuity $ 10,000 1 0.07 or about $ 2,000,000 which is much more comfortable while adam 's strategy produces nearly guaranteed results those results are actually guaranteed failure barbara 's strategy is not a guarantee but it has a good chance of producing a comfortable retirement even if her timing is n't great over these time scales the chances that she will have more money than adam in the end are very high i wo n't produce a technical analysis of this claim as it 's a bit complicated do more research if you 're interested

you are forgetting one crucial point regarding the money supply   the us federal reserve increases the money supply meaning some of the money is not really loaned it just appears out of nowhere   at first glance this seems even worse over the short term the fed changes the money supply to help the economy in whatever way it sees fit   but over the long term the money supply increases to reflect economic growth   as new technology is introduced more can be accomplished with the same labor and resources and thus the money supply needs to be increased   money is really just a convenient replacement for the barter system so if there are more things to barter for goods and services then there should also be more things to barter with money also keep in mind inflation   the cost of goods and services goes up over time due to the inflation of currency and so the money supply must also be increased so that those goods and services do not artificially increase in value which would be very bad

most brokers have a margin maintenance requirement of 30   in your example it would depend on how much money you 're borrowing from your broker on margin consider this you have $ 250 and short aapl at $ 500 on margin this would be a common scenario federal law requires investors to have at least 50 of their margin equity when opening a transaction if your broker had a requirement of 30 they would require that for your $ 500 position you have at least $ 500 .3 = $ 150 equity since you are currently above that number at $ 250 you will not be hit with a margin call say the price of aapl doubles and now your position is worth $ 1000 $ 1000 .3 = $ 300 which is $ 50 above your initial equity your broker will now consider you eligible for a margin call most will not execute the call right away you will often have some time to either sell cover stock or add funds to your account but not all brokers will warn you if you are breaking margin requirements and sometimes margin calls can take you by surprise if you are not paying attention also many will charge interest on extra margin borrowed

one issue which i do n't see addressed in the answers so far is how to structure bank accounts to get the highest return possible what you 're describing sounds like a certificate of deposit cd ranging from 1 for 9 months to 2.3 for 5 years there is a concept which was once more common called a cd ladder which still allows you to access your money while also giving you the highest interest rate offered by the bank    to set one up you divide your account into 5 equal parts then open 5 cds with different periods 1 5 years   each time a new cd matures once a year you purchase another 5 year cd with those funds plus any new money you want to save    thus you 're getting a higher and higher rate until all of your accounts are earning the 5 year cd rate and you 're never more than a year away from getting money out of the account if a need comes up

when you invest in a property you pay money to purchase the property you did n't have to spend the money on the property though you could have invested it in the stock market instead and expected to make a 4 annualized real rate of return or thereabouts so if you want to know whether something 's a good investment ask whether your annual net income will be more or less than 4 of the money you put into it and whether it is more or less risky than the stock market and try to judge accordingly predicting the net income though is a can of worms doubly so when some of your expenses are n't dollar denominated e.g. the time you spend dealing with the property personally and others need to be amortized over an unpredictable period of time how long will that furnace repair really last moreover your annualized capital gain and rental income is also unpredictable rent increases in a given area can not be expected to conform to a predetermined mathematical formula ultimately it is impossible to predict in the general case if it were possible we probably would have skipped that last housing bubble so no single simple formula exists

yes your tax bracket is 25   however that does n't mean that your take home pay will be 75 of your salary   there is much more that goes into figuring out what your take home pay will be first you have payroll taxes   this is often listed on your pay stub as fica   the social security portion of this tax is 6.2 on the first $ 118,500 of your pay and the medicare portion is another 1.45 on the first $ 200,000   your employer also has to pay additional tax that does not appear on your stub   so 7.65 of your salary gets removed off the top in addition to the federal income taxes that get withheld you may also have state income taxes that get withheld   the amount varies with each state also the 25 tax bracket does not mean that your tax is 25 of your entire salary   you step through the tax brackets as your income goes up   so part of your salary is taxed at 10 part at 15 and the remainder is at 25 the amount of federal income tax that is withheld from your paycheck is really a rough estimate of how much tax you actually owe   there are lots of things that can reduce your tax liability personal exemptions deductions credits or increase your tax investment income penalties   when you do your tax return you calculate the actual tax that you owe and you either get a refund if too much was taken out of your check or you need to send more money in if too little was taken out

gt can i use venture like that in a financial context or does it refer specifically to venture capital   yes any business is a venture so to speak    gt so they would receive a smaller return yes   possibly yes   mezzanine investors are well middle investors they 're beyond seed and venture capital but before more late stage private investment that does n't necessarily mean they 're after a seed or venture capital investment it can mean that or it can simply mean the business is a little more advanced than a pure idea or pre revenue etc   let 's say a company is pre destined to get to $ 100 m in value if it can secure funding naturally later investors will have a smaller return of course private investments are generally for smaller younger companies and thus are more risky so an investor can still lose value in a private equity investment   gt is mezzanine investing particularly profitable   yes absolutely you have to understand with investments in private equity firms and individuals are often looking for a multiple of their investment i.e. if an investor invests $ 1 m they expect $ 2 m $ 3 m etc back this is not necessarily for all levels of private equity but many levels will attempt this generally the idea as far as i 'm aware is a 20 irr which means that generally the investment grows by 20 compounding yearly    gt secondly why is dilution so important further down the road is it to do with valuation   absolutely let 's think of our example earlier where you me and joe each own 33 at $ 300 total value   if suddenly another company wants to buy all of our equity for $ 600 then we 're all pretty happy each of us will get $ 200 however let 's say joe had n't come along if that other company then made an offer for $ 600 we 'd both get $ 300 for the company    there 's some other things about dilution too such as the possible loss of control but we 'll save that for later   gt finally at what point would a company aim to meet an ipo is it case specific or is there a general understanding of the best time   it 's very case specific in most cases depending on the industry the company will be relatively a bit older have both revenue and profitability and a history of operations in some cases companies like this will choose to never go ipo such as the big 4 auditing firms for one among others    there are of course exceptions many smaller are pre revenue and are traded on the market tesla is getting revenue but not profitable and it 's on the markets as well these are naturally riskier investments but at least you 've got liquidity to help a bit with that    when a private equity pe firm is looking to exit sell their stake through an ipo they will try to engineer the company to be as attractive as possible to public investors in fact many pe firms will stipulate specific terms and possibly get control of the company from the owner when they initially invest but there 's a lot that goes into it perhaps /u or /u can go into a bit more detail on pe exits as while it 's my chief interest and my career goal it 's not quite where i 'm at yet

well the idea of good practice is subjective so obviously there wo n't be an objectively correct answer i suspect that whatever article you read was making this recommendation as a budgeting tool to physically isolate your reserve of cash from your spending account(s as a means to keep spending in check this is a common idea that i 've heard often enough though i do n't think i am alone in believing that it 's unnecessary except in the case of a spender who can not be trusted to stay within a budget   i suppose there is a very small argument to be made about security where if you use a bank account for daily spending and that account is somehow compromised the short term damage is limited in the end i would argue that if you 're in control of spending and budgeting have a single source of income that is from regular employment and you use a credit card for most of your daily spending there 's no compelling reason to have more than one bank account   some people have a checking and savings account simply for the psychological effect of separating their money some couples have 3 4 accounts for income personal spending and savings other people have separate accounts for business self employment funds and a few people like having many accounts that act as hard limits for spending in different categories of course the other submitted answer is correct in noting that the more accounts that you have the more you are opening yourself up to accounting issues if funds do n't transfer the way you expect them to assuming you 're the accounts often some banks are more lenient with this however and may offer you the option to freely overdraft by pulling funding from another pre designated account that you also hold at the same bank

in a money market fund one share is worth $ 1 for your fund you 'll earn $ a year per share or 0.10   that is all that you will earn the apy is just another number to represent this interest rate not a separate income stream if you were expecting extra money from a separately credited dividend you were mistaken usually the apy is a slightly different number than the interest rate to reflect the way that the interest is compounded over the course of the year in this case the compounding is too slight to notice with just 2 decimal places if you were investing in a regular savings account you would see the rate you are paid expressed as an apy also but not as a dividend as no shares are involved and use that number to compare the two if you were buying a bond fund or stock fund that did not have a fixed price you could calculate the dividend yield based on the current stock price but you would not probably see an apy listed money market funds are kind of an odd hybrid of fund and savings so they list both

run your credit reports for the 3 major agencies to find out which of them have the debt was reported on and initiate the dispute process with each agency that reports the invalid debt this will cause the person who put it on the report to either prove that it is valid or remove it from your report ignoring debt collector calls is not a good option regardless of whether the debt is valid they obviously think the debt is yours so their response is naturally to put it on your credit report in most cases it is a good idea to respond in writing that it is not your debt i doubt you have much recourse against the creditor for one thing they did try to contact you and you dodged them that is not their fault secondly it is unlikely you would prevail unless you could prove that they maliciously put false information on your credit or through gross incompetence did so more likely is that they are you to a debt from someone with a similar name or there is an accounting error somewhere or possibly you owe the debt and no one ever sent you a bill it happens with medical bills all the time

the reason i do n't know of any banks who would offer this to you even if you held the investment account with their bank is that there is no upside to the bank it is a good idea for you but what would they have to gain from this arrangement   the reason banks require a down payment is underwriting quality if you can afford a significant down payment they know that there is a significantly lower chance that you will default however if you were to provide an investment account as collateral you would receive all the upside and any downside would reduce their collateral as a percent of the amount loaned this sort of idea could potentially work along the lines of a margin call ie you have to provide additional capital if your asset value drops but this would have the effective of leveraging the bank 's risk when their objective is to lower their risk through requiring a down payment i do n't see a reason why the bank would take on the risk that you would need to provide additional capital down the road with no upside for them additionally many banks have backed away from the kinds of zero down payment and negative amortization arm loans that got them or the people they sold them to in trouble over the last few years in an effort to reduce how much risk they take on i think that in theory you 'd have to offer a lot more benefit to the bank and that in practice it 's probably a non starter right now

yesterday i was reading in the travel stackexchange about an indian guy who was about to hand his passport over to his employer in africa his problem was that he had taken an unauthorized trip back to india against orders but still he was about to hand over his passport to his foreign employer and he had nothing on his mind other than how to please his employer to keep his job    this is the reality for a lot of people they either do n't have leverage or do n't know what leverage they do have i 'm a programmer and i know because i 've been told reading engaging in the community and gaining real experience     remember that other people can be younger less skilled more naive more easily intimidated and it does n't make them stupid or worse people    why would anyone let their employer stick a chip in their body because they do n't know any better because the employer is an authority or they want the job or the are scared of the consequences if they do n't    posting that it 's a bad idea is a good step to helping people they can google should i let my employer stick a microchip into my body and find this call out three square market and their stupid idea

gt;no it has the intellectual rigor of saying that if you want to claim something then you have to prove it not parrot some propaganda that has been repeated endlessly without any proof   where 's my proof where 's my proof    you 're the one arguing for a change away from the status quo here to something that not only is entirely untested but requires everyone to do it at once and everyone to think just like you do for it to work properly it 's nothing but hypotheticals yet you 're saying the burden of proof is on me to prove that your hypothetical scenarios wo n't work    that 's not a thing you can do you ca n't prove a negative all i can do is say look around at all the free markets and populations we have now living in perfect harmony with each other and the environment oh wait they do n't exist because they do n't work in the real world    any advantage is going to be used to the competition with until you have a monopoly quasi state and it relies on the population being informed in and believing in the system enough to make a conscious effort to not buy the cheaper goods at the store with the bad business practices or potentially drive further to a different store if it 's the store doing the bad practice    charter free market you can only have one    so you 're saying there can never be a truly free market then because it strikes me that companies trading without regulatory oversight as the british dutch portuguese spanish etc did is pretty much as close as we can get they made huge huge profits of course but at the cost of a lot of human misery in fact you can look at a lot of what the british did in the 19th century as semi case studies for this as they had a proper hard on for the free market no government bailout for the famine in ireland because they did n't want to foster dependency on the state let private charities do it instead look it up people donated but not anywhere near enough to alleviate the human misery it also got all caught up in religious bullshit which did n't help matters you had little kids getting their arms ripped off by textile looms for fucks sake people working 14 hour days but it made more money than working in the fields so worth right    gt;in what way people do n't suddenly cease to have resources to deal with these things just because their resources are not forcibly centralized that does n't follow   because the pooling of vast resources for disaster relief is something that states do because there are efficiencies of scale to be had with the military the us military was a huge player in the disaster response to disasters like the boxing day tsunami and hurricane you have like and the red cross doing great and very quickly but they just ca n't provide the same resources a modern navy can in the same time wiki it turns out you face a lot of the same problems in a modern as you do in a humanitarian crisis again charities just do n't get the funding to do this sort of thing on the same scale there was a huge amount of funding dropped on the 2004 tsunami from many countries but you ca n't build a hospital ship in two weeks or a nuclear reactor to provide monumental amounts of fresh water or the helicopters and operational procedures to tie everything together many thousands more would have died without their presence    gt;what evidence or reason you have to believe that hundreds of millions of people would have died in a century without governments   this is my point neither you nor i have any evidence to base this off rather than a tendency for people to be utter bastards to each other looking at history you 're that if all governments in a puff of smoke there would n't be huge conflict in the resulting power vacuum    did not try to carry out genocide   yeah good one there were n't any anarchists in a position to do any of that great straw man    and that statement by is just that a statement why is the burden of proof on the statists it 's the anarchists who are arguing for the change in the status quo you 're the one making the claim that it would be a better system here with nothing to back it up but well people probably would n't start murdering each other pretty low bar there tbh   but if you want reasoning see my previous point if it 's such a better system if people wo n't exploit every advantage they can get and distort the free market if people would n't try and the system for their own personal gain why do we have states right now would any anarchist state region not have simply outperformed neighbours if it 's so much more efficient

with permanent contract in germany you should n't have any problem getting a loan it 's even more important than how much do you earn generally you should ask for a house mortgage with annuity as a type of credit to save on interest besides you usually get a better conditions with a saving bank sparkasse or a popular bank situated in the area where your house is situated you also should n't combine your credit with extra products the simpler is the product the better is for you maybe i 'll write later an extra piece on the common pitfalls in this regard probably you could find a bank that would give you such a loan but it would be very expensive you should save at least 40 because then the bank can refinance your loan cheaply and in return offer you a low interest taxes depend heavily on the place where you buy a house when you buy it you pay a tax between 3.5 and 6 look up here then you pay a property tax it depends on community how much do you pay the leverage is called here 's example notary would cost ca 1.5 of the house price all and all you should calculate with 10 a country independent advice if you want to save on interest in the long run you should take an annuity loan with the shortest maturity pay attention to effective interest rate now to germany specifics do n't forget to ask about extra amortization an option to amortize usually banks offer 5 p.a the interest rate is usually fixed for 8 years however ask about it this period is called it sound ridiculous but in southern lands you usually get better conditions as in berlin or the gap could be as big as 0.5 p.a of effective interest rate in germany they often use so called initial rate of as a parameter

as other answers have pointed out professional real estate investors do own residential investment properties however small residential units typically are not owned by professional real estate investors as your experience confirms this has a fairly natural cause the size of the investment opportunity is insufficient to warrant the proper research due diligence to which a large investment firm would have to commit if it wanted to properly assess the potential of a property for a small real estate fund managing say $ 50 mm it would take 100 properties at a $ 500 k valuation in order to fully invest the funds this number grows quickly as we decrease the average valuation to reflect even smaller individual units it is unlikely that you will find large institutional investors buying stocks with market caps of $ 20 mm they simply can not invest a large enough portion of total aum to make the diligence make economic sense   as such institutional real estate money tends to find its way into large multi family units that provide a more convenient purchase size for a fund

how i understand it is supply demand affect price of stock    negatively positively respectively correct volume is the amount of buying selling activity in these stocks more    volume = more fluctuation right sort of   higher volume means higher liquidity   that is a stock that is traded more is easier to trade   it does n't necessarily mean more fluctuation and in the real world it often means that these are well understood stocks with a high amount of analyst coverage   this tends towards these stocks not being as volatile as smaller stocks with less liquidity company revenue and profit will help an investor predict company    growth that is one factor in a stock price   there are certain stocks that you would buy without them making a profit because their future revenue looks potentially explosive   however these stocks are very risky and are bubble prone if you 're starting out in the share market it 's generally a good idea to invest in index funds i am not a broker my advice should not be taken as financial advice   these funds aggregate risk by holding a lot of different companies   also statistics have shown that over time buying and holding index funds long term tends to dramatically outperform other investment strategies particularly for people with low amounts of capital

you said should i make a side contract with the realtor to pay me the commission at closing i would imagine that in most if not all states that is illegal this is because selling real estate is an activity that requires passing an exam on real estate laws and obtaining a state issued license you are not bringing a buyer because you are not an agent   if you decide to go directly to the realtor that has the listing there is a possibility that the agent might agree to lowering their commission in order to make the sale however the agent is entitled to both sides of the commission because they bear all the administrative and marketing costs of the transaction   the listing agent might choose to enter into a dual agency agreement where they would have to fairly represent both sides but they can not reveal information that would be helpful to you as a buyer e.g. why the seller is choosing to sell other material facts about the property that are not public knowledge etc if there is no written dual agency agreement then the listing agent only represents the seller   in either scenario you lose the benefit of a full fiduciary relationship with an agent so if you choose to deal directly with the listing agent you are making one of the biggest purchases of your lifetime without the benefit of professional representation do you really want that put another way would you use your spouse 's attorney in a divorce so that you could save money

one way to value companies is to use a dividend discount model in substance it consists in estimating future dividends and calculating their present value so it is a methodology which considers that an equity is similar to a bond and estimates its current value based on future cash flows a company may not be paying dividends now but because its future earnings prospects are good may pay some in the future in that case the model will give a non zero value to that stock if on the other hand you think a company wo n't ever make any profits and therefore never pay any dividends then it 's probably worth 0 take microsoft as an example it currently pays ~3 dividend per annum the stock has been listed since 1986 and yet it did not pay any dividends until 2003 but the stock has been rising regularly since the beginning because people had priced in the fact that there was a high chance that the company would become very profitable which proved true in the long term + 60,000 including dividends since the ipo

you probably bought the stock near the peak because it 's been up a lot lately that 's the easiest way to lose money you need to go back and do some basic research the stock appears to have been expensive around 75 why is that the stock seems to be in a comfortable level around 45 why is that maybe it 's too expensive around 45 based on the p e ratio or other measures maybe you should buy more at 45 where it is cheap even though 75 is too expensive the key is to study the stock where it is today 45 47 ask yourself what you would do at today 's price and today 's fundamentals that will also save you from paying 75 for a stock worth 45 and should save you from paying 45 for a stock if it is only worth 35

yes there are a lot of places you can research stocks online google finance yahoo finance reuters etc it 's important to understand that the price of the stock does n't actually mean anything   share price is just a function of the market capitalization divided by the number of shares outstanding   as an example take two companies that are both worth $ 1 million but company a has issued 10,000 shares and company b has issued 100,000 shares   company a has a share price of $ 100 while company b has a share price of just $ 10   comparing share price does nothing to indicate the relative value or health of company a versus company b.    i know there are supposed to be no product recommendations but the dictionary area of investopedia.com is a good source of beginner investing information   and as joe points out below the questions here with the stock tag would also be a good place to start   and while i 'm on a roll the book a random walk down wall street is a good starting point in investing in the stock market

i 'll just add this in the best hedge funds and proprietary trading funds stock selection is approached very scientifically in order to minimize losses maximize gains researchers think of a trading idea and carefully test it to see which methods of stock selection work and how well and finally they combine them every day researchers update their models based on the past performance of each indicator   all this is just too much work to be done manually firms use machine learning methods to understand markets they try to figure out what is normal what did not happen correctly at a specific time what will happen in future for instance they use deep learning networks to look at data and figure out what is normal and what is not these networks can analyze an of noise and separate out the signal this is very relevant to finance and markets because finding the patterns and anomalies in market data has been the bread and butter of traders for decades deep learning networks give us applications like feature learning by features i 'm referring to certain attributes in data that indicate an event by anticipating them we can help predict future price movements new technology is allowing us to break new ground in managing risk to be a typical and manage risk in ever improving ways it 's the responsibility of every trader whether working for themselves or others to take advantage of this technology to improve the collective investing experience i care very deeply about this i have many close friends in the finance world and without who have lost large amounts of money to poor trade tools and lack of transparency

thanks for your service    i would avoid personal investment opportunities at this point   reason being that you ca n't personally oversee them if you are deployed overseas   this would rule out rentals and small businesses   revisit those possibilities if you get married or leave the service    if you have a definite time when you would like to purchase a car you could buy a six or twelve month cd with the funds that you need for that   that will slightly bump up your returns without taking much risk   if you do n't really need to buy the car you could invest that money in stocks   then if the stock market tanks you wait until it recovers note that that can be five to ten years or until you build up your savings again   that increases your reward at a significant increase in your risk   the risk being that you might not be able to buy a car for several more years    build an emergency fund   i would recommend six months of income   reason being that your current circumstances are likely to change in an emergency   if you leave the service your expenses increase a lot   if nothing else the army stops providing room for you   that takes your expenses from trivial to a third of your income   so basing your emergency fund on expenses is likely to leave you short of what you need if your emergency leaves you out of the service    army pay seems like a lot because room and board when deployed are provided   without that it 's actually not that much   it 's your low expenses that make you feel flush not your income   if you made the same pay in civilian life you 'd likely feel rather poor    $ 30,000 sounds like a lot of money but it really is n't   the median household income is a little over $ 50,000 so the median emergency fund should be something like $ 25,000 on the income standard   on the expenses standard the emergency fund should be at least $ 15,000   the $ 15,000 remainder would buy a cheap new car or a good used car   the $ 5000 remainder from the income standard would give you a decent used car    i would n't recommend taking out a loan because you do n't want to get stuck paying a loan on a car you ca n't drive because you deployed   note that if you are out of contact in the hospital or captured you may not be able to respond if there is a problem with the car or the loan   if you pay cash you can leave the car with family and let them take care of things in case of a deployment    if you invested in a roth ira in january of 2016 you could have invested in either 2015 or 2016   if 2015 you can invest again for 2016   if not you can invest for 2017 in three months   you may already know all that but it seemed worth making explicit    the thrift savings plan tsp allows you to invest up to $ 18,000 a year   if you 're investing less than that you could simply boost it to the limit   you apparently have an extra $ 10,000 that you could contribute   a 60 or 70 contribution is quite possible while in the army   if you max out your retirement savings now it will give you more options when you leave the service   or even if you just move out of base housing    if your tsp is maxed out i would suggest automatically investing a portion of your income in a regular taxable mutual fund account   most other investment opportunities require help to make work automatically   you essentially have to turn the money over to some individual you trust   securities can be automated so that your investment grows automatically even when you are out of touch

unrealistic assumption but i 'll play along ultimately dividends would exist because some innovative shareholder of some company at some time would desire income from their investment and could propose the idea of sharing the profit like minded investors also income could vote for dividends to come into existence or rather vote for a board of directors that supports enactment of the idea in your fictitious world shareholders do still control the corporation right in this world though dividends would n't be called dividends a terrible name that 's too for the inhabitants of that world rather they would institute a quarterly or annual shareholder profit share governments would enact legislation to approve of nay encourage such an innovation because it becomes a new source of recurring income they can tax alternatively even if the idea of a cash dividend did n't occur to anybody in that world investors would realize the stock price is depressed and could propose and vote for the board to institute share buybacks the company repurchasing some portion of shares periodically would provide income to shareholders participating in the buyback if the buyback were they could structure it fairly pro rata participation etc alternatively shareholders would pressure the board or fire them and vote in a new board to put the company up for sale and find a larger buyer who would purchase the shares for cash this ca n't scale forever though so the pressure will increase for solutions like 1 and 2

you need to run awareness campaign on facebook even something like $ can have a huge impact on letting people know you exist then post frequently at least 1 daily picture of something for sale in the shop    second collect emails at the counter a simple pen and paper list works surprisingly well get a free email account and email coupons once a week in the beginning you 'll want strong offers as you are building the list do n't waste peoples time with lame or no offers come hard with a huge coupon or they will after the first email this might cost you some money but do n't think of it as selling something for a loss think of it as a marketing expense   try groupon you are desperate this is where desperate local businesses go make a smart offer limit how they can spend it i would suggest focusing it on the cold brew as that has enough margin   partner with local coffee cup cake shops pretty much any one who will have you and give them free shelf space and get them to market to their facebook ig twitter followers about your location and that they can buy stuff there also this is huge and you can capitalize your local market   finally get over the attitude of no one supports local people do n't owe your mom their business just because she 's local she has to compete on price service and selection just like anyone else even amazon so reevaluate your prices your profit margins and start talking to the customers to see what they want in the store

the situation you 're proposing is an over simplification that would n't occur in practice orders occur in a sequence over time time is an important part of the order matching process orders are not processed in parallel otherwise the problem of fairness already heavily regulated would become even more complex first crossed and locked markets are forbidden by regulators   crossed orders are where one exchange has a higher bid than another 's ask or a lower ask than another 's bid   a locked market is where a bid on one exchange is equal to the ask on another   hfts would be able to make these markets because of the gap between exchange fees since these are forbidden and handling orders in parallel would ensure that a crossed or locked market would occur orders are up processed in order of price time priority so the first to cross the market will be filled with the best oldest opposing order regulators believe crossed or locked markets are unfair   they would however eliminate the bid ask spread for many large securities thus the bid ask cost to the holder

if the 6 credits per semester working part time schedule includes no loans consider this   yes it may take you twice as long to finish but you 'll have a lot of working experience and zero student loans when you 're done compare this to someone who graduates in four years and has 20k in student loans   if they set up a 20 year repayment for the loans they 'll still have 16 18k left to pay and 4 years of job experience    you 'll have 8 years of half time job experience and zero debt   the key would be to find a job in your area of interest   more ideal would be one that pays for classes as a benefit   then you might increase your class load and decrease the total time to graduate and have relevant job experience when you graduate

on top of the given answers the type of referral will also factor in when you 're up for renewal and go to a comparison site in the uk confused and struggle accurately through all their lists of questions you see that some of the data differs e.g. not all the same jobs can be entered if you have had an accident not all ask whose fault it was and/or do n't leave the option not yet resolved forcing you to guess which way it will be and/or what the total repair cost was   so as these feed slightly different data to roughly the same set of insurance providers you will get slightly different quotes on the same providers and expect your own provider to offer a slightly better quote than you 'll get in reality for renewing the 's one time cut has to be still taken off but they count it as a new client so somebody gets a bonus for that you they disregard as a captive client and give what boils down to a loyalty penalty case in point i had an car accident resolved months later in my favour with all honest data including claim and its cost and putting my accident free years factor at 0 instead of 7 my old provider quoted about 8 more than the previous year on comparison sites but my renewal papers quoted me 290 more upon telephone enquiry the promised to refund the difference if court found in my favour though they refused to give this in writing so no thanks then the other set of referrals they get is from you directly going to their website asking for a quote they know what type of link you 've followed banner or google result etc they may know some info from your browser 's cookies time spent where or other tracking service and from your data they may guess how tech savvy and shop wise you are and scale your offer accordingly comparison site shoppers are lumped together at a relatively high savvy level of course companies breaking down your data and their own in a particular way can find advantages and hence offer you better terms as said in the main answer this is like arbitration in stock exchanges ensuring a certain amount of sanity if there 's something to exploit somebody will and everybody will follow it may be that they find a certain group of people maybe more accident prone but cheaper to deal with more flexible in repair times or easy to bully in accepting shared fault when they were n't at fault or they want a certain client for women for civil servants for drivers for homeowners often for cross selling other insurance services or they claim to want pensioners because the company can offer them a familiar voice same account manager always contacting them while they 're easier to and less likely to shop around when offered a rubbish deal also 100 straight comparison of competing offers is n't possible as the fine details of the t&cs terms conditions would differ as well as various little in the claims handling process   and depreciation of a car and various ways of dealing with it you insure it for the buying prices but two years later it 's worth about 40 less on paper so in case of total loss replacing like for like will cost you still at least 80 of the value for which you 've been insuring it while they 'll probably offer you the 100 60 mostly because instead of your trusted car you have something unknown that may have hidden defects or been mistreated and about to die case in point my old dealer bought car 's died just outside the warranty period notwithstanding its inspection you can rely on in the end the national brand agreed to refund the parts 15 of what i paid for the car but not the labour a few hours and any car model 's value differs in descending order from its price private selling price part exchange price and auction price depending on your may happily insure you for price = what you paid to dealer but then point out that the value of that car is the theoretical p x value i.e. the car without anybody 's profit far less than you 've been paying for conversely if you crash it after insuring below market value they can pay you your stupidly low figure

i dug up an old article on motley fool and one approach they mention is to get the stock certificates and then sell them to a friend if the company was liquidated you should receive a 1099-div form at     year 's end showing a liquidating distribution treat this as if you    sold the stock for the amount of the distribution the date of sale    is the date that the distribution took place using your original cost    basis in the shares you can now compute your loss if the company has n't actually been liquidated you 'll need to make    sure it 's totally worthless before you claim a loss if you have    worthless stock that 's not worth the hassle of selling through your    broker you can sell it to a friend or cousin aunt or uncle for    pennies however you ca n't sell the stock to a spouse siblings    parents grandparents or lineal descendants here 's one way to do    it send the certificate to your stock transfer agent explain that the shares have been sold and ask to cancel the old shares and issue    a new certificate to the new owner some brokerages will offer you a quicker alternative by buying all of your shares of the stock for a penny they do it to help out    their customers in addition over time some of the shares may    actually become worth more than the penny the brokers paid for them by selling the shares you have a closed transaction with the stock and can declare a tax loss meanwhile your friend relative or    broker for a pittance has just bought a or liner

it 's not necessary to convert it back for the changes to affect value     lets say you have a euro account with 1000 euro and a gbp account with gbp the accounts are equal in value given current exchange rates   you could exchange either account for usd     if you exchange the euro account for usd and say the euro gets stronger against the pound and dollar and subsequently the pound and dollar are weaker against the euro then if you would've kept the 1000 euro it would now be worth more than gbp and more than usd and you would've been better off exchanging the gbp account for usd   barring some economic event exchange rates between well established currencies do n't radically change over a few weeks trip so i would n't really worry about it one way or the other

let me start with something you might dismiss as trite correlation does not mean causation   a money manager charging say 1 is n't likely to take on clients below a minimum level   on the other hand there 's a long debate regarding how on average managed funds do n't beat the averages   i think that you should look at it this way people that have money tend to be focused on other things a brain surgeon making $ 500k yr may not have the time nor the inclination to want to manage her own money   i was always a numbers person i at the difference between raising 1.1 to the power getting i.e. getting times your investment after 40 years at 10 vs at 9 that 1 difference feels like nothing but after a lifetime 1/3 of your money has been skimmed off the top the data show that one can do better by simply putting their money into a mix of s&p index and cash and beat the average money manager over time regardless of convoluted 12 asset class allocations   similarly there are people who use a tax guy in quotes because i mean this as an individual whom they go to year after year not a storefront my used to go to one and i was curious what they got for their money each year he sent them a form 3 pages they needed to fill in every cell made its way into the guy 's tax program the last year i went with them to pick up the tax return i asked him if he noticed that they might benefit from small roth conversions each year or by making some of their ira rmd directly to charity he kindly told me that 's not what we do here and us away i planned both questions in advance the roth conversion was a strategy that one could agree made sense or dismiss as convoluted for some clients but the rmd issue was very different they did n't have enough schedule a deductions to itemize therefore the $ 3000 they donated each year was n't impacting their return by donating directly from their iras this money would avoid tax it would have saved them more than the cost of the tax guy who charged a hefty fee in my opinion it seemed to me this particular strategy should be obvious to one whose business is preparing returns

aiui this is not terribly abnormal there are sometimes to as pending charges or holds and actual charges an authorisation reserves money but does n't actually take it normally what happens when you pay by card is that the merchant gets an authorisation immediately then some time later the authorisation is converted into an actual charge when the merchant takes the money sometimes merchants are slow in taking the actual charge either deliberately some merchants wo n't charge your card until they actually supply the goods to reduce the chance of having to process a refund or because of administrative somewhere when this happens the authorisation can time out before the actual charge is taken so you get the pattern you see first the authorisation appears then it times out and and finally the actual charge shows up

as sdg said the consensus is that the cpp is pretty solid   an actuarial report is submitted to parliament every three years and it 's worth getting the numbers from that report so you know where your cpp contributions are invested   you may think there 's more risk in cpp 's portfolio than they let on   either way your own savings and investments are the best defense against of the cpp   but you should be careful as the cpp mostly invests in the same stuff the retail investor does equity and fixed income   so the typical investor will be exposed to the risks as the cpp fund however cpp is not the only source of retirement income for canadians   there is also the guaranteed income supplement and old age security and they are funded differently from cpp   cpp benefits are funded by returns from the investment fund as well as contributions   and oas are paid out of the government of canada 's revenue each year   in my opinion those programs are more vulnerable than cpp as they could just be legislated out of existence in tough economic times   however i also see that as unlikely because the elderly are a pretty powerful block of voters

the question you should be asking yourself is this why am i putting money into a 401(k for many people the answer is to grow a large nest egg and save for future retirement expenses investors are balancing risk and potential reward so the asset categories you 're putting your 401(k contribution towards will be a reflection on how much risk you 're willing to take per a us news world report article ultimately investors would do well to remember one of the key tenants    of investing diversify the narrower you are with your investments    the greater your risk says vanguard 's diversification    does n't ensure against a loss but it does help lessen a significant    loss generally investing in your employer 's stock in your 401(k is considered very risk in fact one forbes recommends not putting any money into company stock finra notes simply stated if you put too many eggs in one basket you can expose yourself to significant risk in financial terms you are under diversified you have too much of    your holdings tied to a single investment your company 's stock    investing heavily in company stock may seem like a good thing when    your company and its stock are doing well but many companies    experience fluctuations in both operational performance and stock    price not only do you expose yourself to the risk that the stock    market as a whole could but you take on a lot of company    risk the risk that an individual firm your company will falter or    fail in simpler terms if you invest a large portion of your 401(k funds into company stock if your company runs into trouble you could lose both your job and your retirement investments for the other investment assets vehicles you should review a few things personally i prefer to keep my portfolio simple and just pick just a few options based on my own risk tolerance from your fund examples without knowing specifics about your financial situation and risk tolerance i would have created a portfolio that looks like this when i was in my 20 's i avoided the bond and income money market funds because the growth potential is too low for my investing horizon like some of the other answers have noted the target date funds invest in other funds and add some additional fee overhead which i 'm trying to avoid by investing primarily in index funds again your risk tolerance and personal preference might result in a completely different portfolio mix

i used to own a few investment properties so i 'm pretty familiar with this   as mrchrister mentions lenders see investment mortgages as higher risk people who fall into financial trouble are much more likely to let their investment properties go than their personal residence   consequently the interest rates and downpayment requirements are generally higher typically a mortgage for an investment property will require 20 down vs. as low as 3 5 down for a personal residence   with excellent credit and some shopping around you could probably do 10 down   interest rates are typically about a half percent higher as well you 'll also find that the more investment properties you have the harder it becomes to finance new ones   banks look at debt to income ratios to determine if you are over extended   typically banks like to see that your housing payments are less than 20 or so of your income   however with rental properties housing payments generally account for far more than 20 of your rental income   other income you have can offset that but after buying 2 3 houses or so your dti generally into the range where lenders are uncomfortable lending to you anymore   this is why you 'll find that many rental properties are bought on land contracts with owner financing rather than with mortgages

first what structure does your index fund have   if it is an open end mutual fund there are no bid ask spread as the structure of this security is that it is priced once a day and transactions are done with that price   if it is an exchange traded fund then the question becomes how well are authorized participants taking advantage of the spread to make the fund track the index well   this is where you have to get into the creation and redemption unit construct of the exchange traded fund where there are in kind transactions done to either create new shares of the fund or redeem out shares of the fund   in either case you are making some serious assumptions about the structure of the fund that do n't make sense given how these are built index funds have lower expense ratios and are thus cheaper than other mutual funds that may take on more costs   if you want suggested reading on this look at the investing books of john c. bogle who studied some of this rather extensively in addition to being one of the first to create an index fund that became known as bogle 's where a couple of key ones would be common sense on mutual funds new for the intelligent investor and bogle on mutual funds new perspectives for the intelligent investor in the case of an open end fund there has to be a portion of the fund in cash to handle transaction costs of running the fund as there are management fees to come from running the fund in addition to dividends from the stocks that have to be carefully re invested and other matters that make this quite easy to note   vanguard 500 index investor has in cash as an example here where you could look at any open end mutual fund 's portfolio and notice that there may well be some in cash as part of how the fund is managed   it ’s the execution stupid would be one of a few articles that looks at the idea of tracking error or how well does an index fund actually track the index where it can be noted that in some cases there can be a little bit of active management in the fund just as a minor side note when i lived in the us i did invest in index funds and found them to be a good investment   i 'd still recommend them though i 'd argue that while some want to see these as really simple investments there can be details that make them quite interesting to my mind how is its price set then the price is computed by taking the sum value of all the assets of the fund minus the liabilities and divided by the number of outstanding shares   the price of the assets would include the closing price on the stock rather than a bid or ask similar pricing for bonds held by the fund derivatives and cash equivalents   similarly the liabilities would be costs a fund has to pay that may not have been paid yet such as management fees brokerage costs etc is it a weighted average of all the underlying stock spreads or does    it stand on its own and stems from the usual supply demand laws there is n't any spread used in determining the net asset value for the fund   the fund prices are determined after the market is closed and so a closing price can be used for stocks the liabilities could include the costs to run the fund as part of the accounting in the fund that most items have to come down to either being an asset something with a positive value or a liability something with a negative value something to consider also is the size of the fund   with over $ in assets a .01 amount is still $ 700,000 which is quite a large amount in some ways

there are several types of financial advisors some are associated with brokerages and insurance companies and the like their services are often free on the other hand the advice they give you will generally be strongly biased toward their own company 's products and may be biased toward their own profits rather than your gains remember anything free is being paid for by someone and if you do n't know who it 's generally going to be you there are some who are good but i could n't give you any advice on finding them others are not associated with any of the above and serve entirely as experts who can suggest ways of distributing your money based on your own needs versus resources versus risk tolerance without any affiliation to any particular company   consulting these folks does cost you or if it 's offered as a benefit your employer some money but their fiduciary responsibility is clearly to you rather than to someone else they are n't likely to suggest you try anything very sexy but when it comes to your primary long term savings exciting is usually not a good thing the folks i spoke to were of the latter type they looked at my savings and my plans talked to me about my risk tolerance and my goals picked a fairly standard strategy from their files ran simulations against it to sanity check it and gave me a suggested mix of low overhead index fund types that takes almost zero effort to maintain rebalance occasionally between funds has acceptable levels of risk and i admit i 've been lucky has been delivering more than acceptable returns nothing exciting but even though i 'm relatively risk tolerant i 'd say excitement is the last thing i need in my long term savings i should actually talk to them again some time soon to sanity check a few things they can also offer advice on other financial decisions whether when i might want to talk to charities about gift annuity plans whether roth versus traditional 401(k makes any difference at all at this point in my career and so on

you appear to be thinking of option writers as if they were individuals with small holdings and a particular view on what the underlying is going to do   this is not the best way to think about them option writers are typically large institutions with large portfolios and that provide services in all sorts of different areas at the same time as they are writing calls on a particular stock they are writing puts on it and options on other stocks   they are buying and selling the underlying and all kinds of different derivatives   they are not necessarily writing the option because they are expecting or hoping to benefit from a price move   it 's just small part of their business   they write the option if the option price is good enough that they think they are selling it for very slightly more than it 's worth    asking why an option writer creates a call is like asking why a grocery store keeps buying groceries from their distributors   do n't they know the price of food may not always rise   sure but their business is selling the food for slightly more than they pay for it not speculating on what will happen to its price   most option writers are doing the same thing except what they are buying and selling is sets of cash flows and risk    as a general rule the business model of option writers is to profit from the few cents of spread or mispricing not from aggregate changes in the price of the underlying   they should and often do maintain balanced portfolios so their option writing activities do n't expose them to a lot of risk also note that there could be lots of reasons for writing options even if you do have a particular view   for example perhaps the option writer thinks volatility of the underlying will decrease   writing a call could be part of an overall strategy that profits from this view

in your particular condition could buy the condo with cash then get your mortgage on your next house with less than 20 down i.e. with mortgage insurance but it would still be an owner occupied loan   if you hate the mortgage insurance you could save up and refi it when you have 20 available including the initial down payment you made i.e. 80 ltv ratio total   or perhaps during the time you live in the condo you can save up to reach the 20 down for the new house   or perhaps you can just rent somewhere then get into the house for 20 down and while there save up and eventually buy a condo in cash later   or perhaps buy the condo for 50 down non owner occupied mortgage ianal but some things that may come in handy you do n't have to occupy your second residence owner occupied mortgage for 60 days after closing on it   so could purchase it at month 10 i suppose   in terms of locking down mortgage rates you could do that up to 3 months before that even so i 've heard    it 's not immediately clear if rent backs could extend the 60 day intent to occupy or if so by how long 1 month might be ok but 2 dunno also you could just buy one or the other or both of your mortgages as a 20 down conventional non owner occupied mortgage and generate leeway there ex buy the home as non owner occupied and rent it out until your year is up though non owner occupied mortgage have worse interest rates so that 's not as appealing   or buy one as a secondary residency mortgage   consult your loan officer there they like to see like geographic distance between primary and secondary residences i 've heard if it 's hud fha mortgage the owner occupancy agreement you will sign is that you will continue to occupy the property as my primary residence for at least one year after the date of occupancy unless extenuating circumstances arise which are beyond my control ref i.e. you plan on living in it for a year so you 're kind of stuck in your case   maybe you 'd want to occupy it as quickly as possible initially to make the year up more quickly apparently you can also request the lender to agree to arbitrarily rescind the owner occupancy aspect of the mortgage half way through though i 'd imagine you need some sort of excuse to convince them   might not hurt to ask

tax advantaged accounts mean you pay less tax you fundamentally pay less tax on iras and 401ks than other accounts that 's their benefit you keep more money at the expense of the government it makes sense for the government to limit it if you do n't understand why you pay less tax you must consider the time value of money the principal now is the same value of money as the principal + earnings later with iras and 401ks you only pay income tax once with roth iras and 401ks you pay tax on the entire amount of money once when you earn it with pre tax traditional iras and 401ks you pay tax on the entire amount of money once when withdraw it however with outside accounts you have to pay tax more than once you pay once when you earn it and pay tax again on the earnings later earnings that grew from money that was already taxed which when considering time value means that the earnings have already been taxed but is taxed again for things like savings in a bank it 's even worse interest which grew from money already taxed is taxed every year which means some money you pay tax on n times if you have it in there n years if you do n't understand the above you can see with an example we start with $ 1000 pre tax wages and for simplicity will assume a flat 25 income tax rate and a growth rate of 10 per year and get the cash assume it 's a qualified withdrawal in 10 years

the difference is that yahoo is showing the unadjusted price that the security traded for on that date while google is adjusting for price splits this means that google is showing how much you would have had to pay to get what is now one share since 1979 jnj has split once and 2-for-1 four times = 48 if you bought 1 share at that time you would now have 48 shares today yahoo is showing a price of $ 66 for what was then 1 share $ = which google rounds to you can see this if you get the prices from may 14 21 1981 the stock split and the price dropped from 108 to yahoo 's adjusted close column has not been accurate since they re wrote the finance website it now just represents the closing price the other relevant field on yahoo is the adj close this adjusts for splits but also adjusts for dividends hence why this does n't match either the google or yahoo numbers

it sounds like this is an entirely unsettled question unfortunately   in the examples you provide i think it is safe to say that none of those are substantially identical a small overlap or no overlap certainly should not be considered such by a reasonable interpretation of the rule this article on goes into some detail on the topic   a few specifics first former publication explains ordinarily shares issued by one mutual fund are not considered to be substantially identical to shares issued by another mutual fund of course what ordinarily means is and this is no longer a current publication so who knows the article goes on to explain that the irs has n't really gone after wash sales for mutual funds over the years the irs has not pursued wash sale abuses against mutual funds perhaps because it just was n’t very feasible to crack down on them or perhaps because it just was n’t perceived as that big of an abuse after all while the rules might allow you to loss harvest a particular stock you could n’t have otherwise it also limits you from harvesting any losses if the overall fund is up in the aggregate since losses on individual stocks ca n’t pass through to the mutual fund shareholders but then goes to explain about etfs being very different sell spy buy ivv or vti and you 're basically buying selling the identical thing 99 or so correlation in stocks owned    the recommendation by the article is to look at the correlation in owned stocks and stay away from things over 95 that seems reasonable in my book as well ultimately there will no doubt be a large number of grey and murky situations but i suspect that until the irs provides better guidance or congress updates the wash sale rules altogether in the near term the easiest red flag warning is simply to look at the correlation between the original investment being loss harvested and the replacement security at correlations above 0.95 and especially at 0.99 + it ’s difficult to argue that the securities are not substantially identical to each other in performance basically use common sense and do n't do anything you think would be hard to defend in an audit but otherwise you should be okay

traditional insurance agent guy here   there is no right answer in my opinion because your individual needs can not be generalized      there are a variety of factors that influence the price charged to you including but not limited to your past claims history geographic location credit profile and the carrier 's book of business itself   this is just a small sampling in reality their pricing calculations may be far more complicated   the point is there is no one size fits all carrier    my agency works with 15 different carriers   sometimes we can offer the best combination of coverage and cost to a prospective client that beats their existing coverage other times we are nowhere close to being competitive    the most important thing you can do is find a person site company you can trust and one that does not take advantage of you   insurance policies are complex and getting the best deal may oftentimes mean lessening coverage without realizing it   so i would recommend using whatever service channel online phone local agent that 's most convenient and for you and otherwise shop around once every year or two to make sure you 're still getting the most for your money

there are many technical answers above but the short story to me is that very few active fund managers consistently beat the market look at the results of actively managed funds depending on whose analysis you read you will find out that somewhere between 80 90 of fund managers in a given year do not beat passive index funds so go figure how you will do compared to a mutual fund manager who has way more experience than you likely have so that in itself is moderately interesting but if you look at same manager performance over several consecutive years it is rare to find anyone that goes beats the market for more than a few years in a row there are exceptions but go pick one of these guys good luck getting in and out of the market is a loser this is because there is no way to see market spikes and down turns there are many behavioral studies that have been done that show people do the wrong thing they sell after losses have occurred and they buy after the market has gone up missing an up spike and not being in before the spike is as devastating as missing a down turn and not getting out in time there is another down side if you are trading in a personal account rather than a tax deferred account going in and out of stocks has tax complications in short a broad based equity index will over time beat about anything out there and it will do it in a tax efficient manner   exchange traded funds etfs are a wonderful way to obtain diversification immediately at very low cost

that 's tricky actually first as the section 1015 that you 've referred to in your other question says you take the lowest of the fair market value or the actual donor basis why is it important consider these examples so if the relative bought you a brand new car and you 're the first title holder i.e. the relative paid but the car was registered directly to you you can argue that the basis is the actual money paid in essence you got a money gift that you used to purchase the car if however the relative bought the car took the title and then drove it 5 miles to your house and signed the title over to you the irs can argue that the car basis is the fmv which is lower because it is now a used car that you got you 're the second owner that may be a significant difference just by driving off the lot the car can lose 10 15 of its value if you got a car that 's used and the donor gives it to you your basis is the fair market value unless its higher than the donor 's basis in which case you get the donor 's basis you always get the lowest basis for losses and depreciation is akin to a loss now consider the situation when your relative is a business owner and used the car for business he did n't take the depreciation but he was entitled to irs can argue that the fact that he did n't take is irrelevant and reduce the donor 's basis by the allowable depreciation that may bring your loss basis to below the fmv i suggest you take it to a tax professional licensed in your state who will check all the facts and circumstances of your situation your relative might be slapped with a gift tax as well if the car fmv is above certain amount currently the exemption is $ 14000

today typically a business needs to hold accounts in more than one currency banks in certain countries are offering what is called a dual currency account it is essentially 2 accounts with same account number but different currency so one can have an account number say and have it in say aud and usd so the balance will always show as x aud and y usd if you deposit funds electronic check or cash in usd your usd balance goes up likewise at the time of withdrawal you have to specify what currency you are withdrawing interest rates are calculated at different percentage for different currencies   so in a nutshell it would like operating 2 accounts with the advantage of remembering only one account number designate a particular currency as default currency so if you do n't quote a currency along with the account number it would be treated as default currency otherwise you always quote the account number and currency of course bundled with other services like free fx advice etc it makes the entire proposition very attractive edit if you have aud 100 and usd 100 if you try and withdraw usd 110 it will not be allowed unless you also sign up for a auto sweep conversion   if you deposit a gbp check into the account by default it would get converted into aud assuming aud is the default currency

the answer is that other than a small number of applications the approx 10 of gold production that goes to industrial uses gold does not have intrinsic value beyond being pretty and rare and useful for making jewelry   there are a number of industrial applications and uses for gold see other answers for a list but the volume consumed this way is fairly small especially relative to the capacity to mine new gold and reclaim existing gold if you removed investment and jewelry usage especially driven jewelry usage then there 's no way the remaining uses for industry and dentistry could sustain the price levels we currently see for gold   furthermore and perhaps more importantly the best data i can find for this shows the total number of tons consumed for industrial uses has been shrinking for several years now and that was prior to recent price increases so it is difficult to tie that reduced demand to increasing prices   and one might postulate in a collapsed society you seem to be referring to in your question that a lot of the recent industrial demand e.g. the 50 cents of gold in each cellphone could quite possibly disappear entirely    the argument many people use for gold having value is usually been used as money for thousands of years   but this confuses gold having a value of its own with the reasons why something makes a useful currency   gold has a large number of characteristics that make it an ideal currency and of all the elements available it is perhaps the best physical element to serve as a currency but just as with a dollar bill just because it is a good currency does not give it an intrinsic value any currency is only worth what someone will trade you for it   the value is set by the economy etc not the medium used as a currency    so yes people will probably always use gold as money but that does n't make the money worth anything it 's just a medium of exchange incidentally two other things should be noted   the first is that you have a problem when the medium itself used for a currency becomes worth more than the face value   hence why we stopped using silver in coins and there were concerns over pennies due to the price of copper this leads to the second point which is that currently gold is too rare to suffice as a world currency hence why all countries went off the gold standard years ago   the size of national and global economies was growing faster than the supply of gold and hence it was becoming impossible to have enough gold to back all the currencies inflation concerns aside

here would be the big two you do n't mention time how much of your own time are you prepared to commit to this are you going to find tenants handle calls if something breaks down and other possible miscellaneous issues that may arise with the property are you prepared to spend money on possible renovations and other maintenance on the property that may occur from time to time financial costs you do n't mention anything about insurance or taxes as in property taxes since most municipalities need funds that would come from the owner of the home that would be a couple of other costs to note in having real estate holdings as if something big happens are you expecting a government bailout automatically if you chose to use a property management company for dealing with most issues then be aware of how much cash flow could be impacted here are you prepared to have an account to properly do the books for your company that will hold the property or would you be doing this as an individual without any corporate structure do you have lease agreements printed up or would you need someone to provide these for you

the complaint is n't based on facts it 's based on pure protectionism boeing does n't even build this class of airplane the bombardier c series would compete with the which boeing has n't built in over ten    the delta air lines deal the airline began talking with boeing about used e-190s and used boeing 717s boeing had 19 e-190s to dispose of having committed to take them in on trade as part of an order with air canada for the 737 max delta purchased the 19 e-190s but rejected the 717s because none was available during the period it required and there were not enough used 717s in any event delta called the 737 7 max uneconomical vs rooted in 1960s design and an inefficient shrink   testified boeing never offered any new build aircraft because boeing does n’t have an offering in the 100 125 seat sector and it did n’t have any available delivery positions in the period required    ironically boeing holds the 1 spot on the most heavily subsidized companies in the us so even if their allegations were true for boeing to suggest that another company benefits from subsidies is a case of a very very very large pot calling a teeny tiny kettle black      to respond in kind to boeing and the trump administration the canadian government should be cancelling it 's $ boeing super order and exert pressure on other aerospace deals perhaps a 300 import tax would convince air canada to dump its $ order for 61 boeing 737 max news business air canada you know to be fair because boeing is heavily subsidized and all     lastly lockheed martin might be interested in following this aerospace for trade war canada ’s involvement in the f-35 program has not been popular at home and represents another $ planned spend that could very easily be called cancelled

i 'm not sure the term actually has a clear meaning we can think of what does this mean in two ways its broad semantic meaning and its mechanical what actual variables in the market represent this quantity net buying selling have a clear meaning in the former sense by analogy to the basic concept of supply and demand in equilibrium markets it 's not as clear what their meaning should be in the latter sense roughly as the top comment notes you could say that a price decrease is because of net selling at the previous price level while a price rise is driven by net buying at the previous price level but in terms of actual market mechanics the only way prices move is by matching of a buyer and a seller so every market transaction inherently represents an instantaneous balance across the bid ask spread so then we could think about the notion of orders actual transactions only occur in balance but there is a whole book of standing orders at various prices so maybe we could use some measure of the volume at various price levels in each of the bid ask books to decide some notion of net buying selling but again actual transactions occur only when matched across the spread if a significant order volume is added on one side or the other but at a price far away from the bid offer far enough that an actual trade at that price is unlikely to occur should that be included in the notion of net buying selling presumably there is some price distance from the bid offer where the orders do n't matter for net buying selling i 'm sure you 'd find a lot of buyers for brk.a at $ 1 but that 's completely irrelevant to the notion of net buying selling in maybe the closest thing i can think of in terms of actual market mechanics is the comparative total volumes during the period that would still have been executed if forced to execute at the end of period price assuming that traders valuations are fixed through the period in question and trading occurs on the basis of fundamentals which i know is n't a good assumption in practice but the impact of price history upon future price is too complex for this analysis we have two cases if price falls we can assume all buyers who executed above the last price in the period would have happily bought at the last price saving money while all sellers who executed below the last price in the period would also be happy to sell for more the former will be larger than the latter if the price rises the reverse is true

the most likely answer to your question regarding what the market expects is perhaps that the market expects that currently linked in like a lot of other startups has been almost it makes into building the business and brand   so right now the net profits are pretty low percentage of income roughly 1.5 of revenue   given the size of the other numbers it does n't take a lot of movement in the right direction to get a big change in that tiny final number   the other factor is the gap between their net and the income available   i think but i 'm making a logical guess here a large part of that gap was paying off the losses of the prior two years   if that 's the case and everything else is static then next year 's available number ought to at least triple   in order to grow the net all li needs is to either continue current trends of growth in expenses relative to costs   keep expenses steady and experience a slight growth in income or find a way to reduce expenses without having it impact income or something in between those three    if we take the first case as an example income has been roughly doubling every year but expenses growing less than that   if they were to continue that but manage to get some economy of scale and have expenses grow at a slower rate then the jump in net income ought to be substantial most of the trends you could project end up with a big growth in the bottom line but yeah i got ta admit none of that gets you growth in a single year   so the conclusion i would draw is that the market is trending a few years out and being pretty optimistic given the current pe ratio   of course you could also conclude that the market is social network happy and represents one of the few opportunities for the average investor to get in on that given that facebook and myspace are not trading on the open market

the simple answer is technically bonds do n't have earnings hence no p e. what i think the op is really asking how do i compare stock and bond etfs some mature stocks exhibit very similar characteristics to bonds so at the margin if you are considering investing between 2 such investments that provide stable income in the form of dividends you might want to use the dividend price ratio d p of the stock and compare it to the dividend yield of the bond if you go down to the basics both the bond and the stock can be considered   the present value of all future expected cashflows the cash that accrues to the owner of the stock is future dividends and for the bond is the coupon payments if a company were to pay out 100 of its earnings then the dividend yield d p would be conveniently e p. for a company with p e of 20 that paid out it 's entire earnings one would expect d p = 1/20 = 5 this serves as a decent yard stick in the short term ~ 1 year to compare mature stock etfs with stable prospects vs bond funds since the former will have very little expected price growth think utilities hence they both compete on the cashflows they throw off to the investor this comparison stops being useful for stock etfs with higher growth prospects since expected future cashflows are much more volatile this comparison is also not valid in the long term since bond etfs are highly sensitive to the yield curve interest rate risk and they can move substantially from where they are now

apartments in according to range from £ 750 850 which is us$ and for that many bedrooms you 'd be hard pressed to find that kind of deal in a good neighborhood of the dfw metro and good luck getting anywhere close to downtown new york la miami chicago etc for that price what job do you do and how are you expected to dress for it depending on where you shop and what you buy a quality dress shirt and dress will cost between us$ each assuming real costs are similar for the same brands between us and uk that 's £ per shirt and pair of pants for quality brands i maintain about a weeks wardrobe at this level of dress my job allows me to wear much cheaper and most days and i have about 2 weeks wardrobe of those and i typically have to replace due to wear or on average 2 of these outfits a year i 'm hard on clothes and my is expanding adding in 3 business casual outfits each year plus casual outfits shoes socks and call it maybe $ in wardrobe that does n't generally get out as a monthly allowance the monthly amount would barely buy a single dress shirt or pair of but if you 're socking away a savings account and buying new clothes to replace old as you can afford them it 's a good average i generally splurge in months when the utilities companies give me a break and when i get extra paychecks means two months have 3 checks effectively giving me a free check that neither pays the mortgage nor the other major bills now that 's just to maintain my own wardrobe at a level of dress that wo n't get me fired my wife currently stays home but when she worked she me and her work clothes were basic black to outright replace all the clothes i wear regularly with brand new stuff off the rack would easily cost a grand and that 's for the average u.s. software dev who does n't go out and meet other business types on a daily basis if i needed to show up for work in a suit and tie daily i 'd need a two week rotation of them plus dress shirts and even at the low end of about $ 350 £ 225 per suit $ 400 £ 275 with dress shirt and tie for something you wo n't be embarrassed to wear we 're talking $ 4000 £ 2600 to replace and $ 800 £ 520 per year to update 2 a year not counting what i wear underneath or on the weekends and if i wore suits i 'd probably have to update the styles more often than that so just go ahead and double it and i turn over my wardrobe once every 5 years none of this includes laundering costs which increase sharply when you 're taking suits to the cleaners weekly versus just throwing a bunch of cotton in the washing machine what hobbies or other entertainment interests do you and your wife have a movie ticket in the u.s. varies between $ depending on the size of the screen and vs 3d my wife and i currently average less than one theater visit a month but if you took in a each weekend with your wife with a decent $ 50 dinner out that 's between $ £ 165 270 monthly in entertainment expenses not counting babysitting for the little one the going rate in the us is between $ 10 and $ 20 an hour for at home child sitting depending on who you hire and for how long how often worst case without babysitting that 's less than 5 of your gross income but possibly more than 10 of your take home depending on uk effective income tax rates your marginal rate is 40 according to the hmrc unless you find a way to deduct about £ 30k of your income that 's just the traditional american date night which is just one possible interest playing organized sports is more or less expensive depending on the sport soccer sorry football just needs a well kept field two goals and and a ball golf while not really needing much more when you say it that way can cost thousands of dollars or pounds a month to play with the best equipment at the best courses hockey requires head to toe padding sticks and ice time american football typically is n't an amateur sport for adults and has virtually no audience in europe but in the right places in the u.s. beginning in just a couple years you 'd be your son out head to toe not dissimilar to hockey minus sticks and at a similar cost and would keep that up at least halfway through high school i 've played them all at varying amateur levels and with the possible exception of soccer they all get expensive when you really get interested in them how much do you eat and of what my family of three 's monthly grocery budget is about $ 300-$400 £ depending on what we buy and how we buy it americans have big often more than one there 's three in my house of varying sizes we buy in bulk as needed every week to two weeks we or freeze a lot of what we buy and we eat and drink a lot of high corn syrup based crap that 's excise taxed into non existence in most other countries i do n't have real world experience living and grocery shopping in europe but i do know that most shopping is done more often in smaller quantities and for more real food you might expect to spend £ 325 $ 500 or more monthly in fits and starts every few days but as i said you 'd probably know better than me what you 're buying and what it 's costing to educate myself i went to which has what i assume are typical uk food prices mostly from tesco and it 's a real eye opener in the u.s. alcohol is much more expensive for equal volume than almost any other drink except designer coffee and energy drinks and we the heck out of everything anyway so a low budget food approach in the u.s. generally means beer and wine in favor of milk fruit juices sodas and kool aid or just plain ol' tap water a quick search on shows that wine prices average a little cheaper accounting for the exchange rate as in the states that varies widely even in the u.s. as local and state taxes for beer wine and spirits all differ beer is similarly slightly cheaper across the board especially for brands local to the british and even the coors lite crap we 're apparently shipping over to you is more expensive here than there but in contrast milk by the gallon seems to be virtually unheard of in the uk and your half are just a few pence cheaper than our going rate for a gallon unless you buy organic in the us which carries about a 100 markup juices are also about double the price depending on what you 're buying a of innocent oj roughly equivalent in presentation to the u.s. brand simply orange is £ 3 while simply orange is about the same price in usd for 2 and u.s brand drinks are similarly at a premium £ over $ 3 for a bottle of coca cola with the general preference for room temperature alcohol in europe giving a big advantage to the longer shelf lives of beer and wine i 'm going to guess you guys drink more alcohol and water with dinner than americans beef is cheaper in the u.s. depending on where you are and what you 're buying prices for store brand ground beef you guys call it of the grade we 'd use for hamburgers and is about £ 6 per kilo in the uk which works out to about $ when we 're paying closer to $ in most cities i actually ca n't remember the last time i bought fresh chicken on the bone but the average price i 'm seeing in the uk is £ $ which sounds pretty steep anyway it sounds like shopping for american tastes in the uk would cost on average between 25 30 more than here in the us so applying that to my own family 's food budget you could easily justify spending £ a month on food

of course the rationale is exactly the same as always profit is taxed the fact that you use intermediate barter to make that profit is irrelevant to clarify as it seems that you think it makes a difference that no money changed hands consider this situation so far your cost is $ 10000 how will the tax authority address this they will look at the fair market value of the barter you got gold worth of $ 20000 so from their perspective you got $ 20000 and immediately exchanged it into gold what does it mean for you that you 're taxed on the $ 10000 gain you made on your product x the $ 20000 worth of barter that you received minus the $ 10000 worth of work material expenses that you spend on producing the merchandise and that you have $ 20000 basis in the gold that you now own if in a year when you plan to sell the gold its price drops you can deduct investment losses if its price goes up you 'll have investment gain but for the gain you 're making on your product x you will pay taxes now because that 's when you realized it sold the and received in return something else of a value

the right time to buy real estate is easy to spot it 's when it is difficult to get loans or when real estate agents selling homes are tripping over each other it 's the wrong time to buy when houses are sold within hours of the sign going up the way to profit from equities over time is to dollar cost average a diversified portfolio over time while keeping cash reserves of 5 15 around when major corrections strike buy a little extra you can make money at trading but it requires that you exert a consistent effort and stay up to date on your investments and future prospects

you could buy some call options on the usd inr that way if the dollar goes up you 'll make the difference and if the dollar goes down then you 'll lose the premium you paid   i found some details on usd inr options here looks like the furthest out you can go is 3 months note they 're european style options so they can only be exercised on the expiration date as opposed to american style which can be exercised at any time up to the expiration date alternatively you could buy into some futures contracts for the usd inr those go out to 12 months with futures if the dollar goes up you get the difference if the dollar goes down you pay the difference   i 'd say if you were going to do something like this stick with the options since the most you could lose there is the premium you put up for the option contracts with futures if it suddenly moved against you you could find yourself with huge losses note that playing in the futures and options markets are an easy way to get burned it 's not for the faint of heart

if it 's just an ordinary credit card i 'd think he could merely dispute the charges since he 's saying they created which i presume means applied for and received a card it should not affect his accounts directly   and especially since application details may be bogus he should be able to prove it was not him even if they got his credit card number he should be able to dispute those charges that are not his especially if they went to a different address or were charged someplace like another city where he was not present at that time otoh if they created a debit card that was linked to his bank account somehow well then that could be a lot more difficult to recover from but even then if it 's not his signature that was used to apply for the card or on any charges that had to be signed for etc he should be able to dispute it and get the bank to put the money back in his account since it will be a case of forgery etc the big problem with id theft is people tend to ruin your credit rating and you end up having to fend off bill collectors etc the primary thing it costs you speaking from experience of having checks stolen and forged using a fake drivers license is the time and hassle of getting everything straightened out and put right   in my case it took a few hours at the credit union and all the money was back in a new account the old one having been closed when i left   dealing with all the poor merchants that were taken and with bill collectors on the other hand took months   but i never once in the process needed quick money from anyone so the need for quick money seems a bit doubtful   i 'd want a lot more details of exactly why he needs money from you refer your friend to this federal trade commission site and make sure he takes the steps listed and especially pays attention to the parts about keeping notes of every single person he talks with including name date time and pertinent details of the conversation   if he has some idea how this happened as in a robbery then report it to the proper authorities and insist on getting a case number talking with bill collectors is the worst just trying to get ahold of them when they send you letters and talk to a person not a recorded number with instructions on how to pay them is sometimes nearly impossible google was my friend   and a lot of times they did n't want to back off till i gave them the case number with the police that somehow magically made it real to them and not just my telling them a story

if you are worried about an increase in volatility then go long volatility volatility itself can be traded here in the us there is an index vix that is described as tracking volatility what vix actually tracks is the premium of s&p 500 options which become more expensive when traders want to hedge against volatility in the us you can trade vix options or invest in vix tracking etfs like vxx apparently there are similar etfs listed in canada such as volatility itself is quite volatile so it is possible that a small volatility long position would cover the losses of a larger long position in stocks if you do choose to invest in a volatility etf be aware that they experience quite a lot of decay you will not want to hold it for very long

the short answer is no you do not have to pay $ at the end of your first year that is only the amount if you decide to exercise   fine print but if you leave or get let go which happens quite frequently at top tier silicon valley firms you lose anything that you do n't exercise you 're basically chained by a pair of golden handcuffs in other words you 're stuck with the company until a liquidation event such as ipo or secondary market selling you can expect to spend a few years before getting anything out of your stocks now it 's hard to say whether or not to exercise at that time especially given we do n't know the details of the company you only should exercise if you foresee your quitting anticipate getting fired and you strongly feel that stock price will keep going up if you 're in sf bay i believe you have 10 years until your options expire at which point they are gone forever but that 's 10 years and usually companies ipo well within 7 years i would recommend you get a very good tax advisor someone that understands amt and stock options tax loopholes rules like the back of their hand   i 'm going to take a long shot and assume that you got an amazing offer and that you got a massive amount of isos from them so i 'll give this as an advice first congrats on owning a lot on paper today if you 're still there you chose to be an early employee at a good tech company however you should be more worried about amt alternative min tax you will get enslaved by the irs if you exercise your shares and ca n't pay the amt suppose in your fictional scenario your stock options increase 2x on paper you now own $ 1 mil in options but you would be paying $ in taxes if you chose to exercise them right now now unless you can sell that immediately on the secondary market i would highly advise you not to exercise right now only exercise your isos when you can turn around and sell them either waiting for ipo or if company offers secondary market approved trading

this is a slightly different reason to any other answer i have seen here about irrationality and how being rationally aware of one 's irrationality in the future or in different circumstances can lead you to make decisions which on the face of it seem wrong first of all why do people sometimes maintain balances on high interest debt when they have savings standard advice on many money management sites and forums is to withdraw the savings to pay down the debt however i think there is a problem with this suppose you have $ 5,000 in a savings account and a $ 2,000 credit card balance you are paying more interest on the credit card than you get from the savings account and it seems that you should withdraw some money from the savings account and pay off the cc however the difference between the two scenarios other than the interest you lose by keeping the cc balance is your motivation for saving if you have a credit card balance of $ 2,000 you might be obliged to pay a minimum payment of $ 100 each month if you have any extra money you will be rewarded if you pay more in to the credit card by seeing the balance go down and understanding that you will soon be free from receiving this awful bill each month to maintain your savings goal it 's enough to agree with yourself that you wo n't do any new spending on the cc or withdraw any savings   now suppose that you decide to pay off the cc with the savings there is now nothing forcing you to save $ 100 each month when you get to the end of the month you have to motivate yourself that you will be adding spare cash to your $ 3,000 savings balance rather than that you have to pay down your cc yes if you spend the spare cash instead of saving it you get something in return for it but it is possible that spending $ 140 on small scale discretionary spending things you do n't need actually gets you less for your money than paying the credit card company $ 40 interest and saving $ 100 you might even be tempted to start spending on your credit card again knowing that you have a 0 balance and that you can always pay it off out of savings it 's easy to this to a situation with two types of debt suppose that you have a $ 2,000 debt to your parents with no interest and a $ 2,000 loan at high interest and you get a $ 2,000 windfall let 's assume that your parents do n't need the money in a hurry and are n't you to pay them otherwise you could consider the guilt or the hassle as a form of emotional interest rate might it not be better to pay your parents off if you do you are likely to keep paying off your loan out of necessity of making the regular payments in 20 paychecks or whatever you might be debt free if you pay off your loan you lose the incentive to save after 20 months you still owe your parents $ 2,000 i am not saying that this is always what makes sense just that it could make sense note that this is an opposite to the debt snowball method that method says that it 's better to pay off small debts because that way you have more free cash flow to pay off the larger debts the above argues that this is a bad idea because you might spend the increased cash flow on junk it would be better to keep around as many things as possible which have minimum payments because it restricts you to paying things rather than gives you the choice of whether to save or spend

the following is from wikipedia term life insurance with very minor editing because term life insurance is a pure    death benefit its primary use is to    provide coverage of financial    responsibilities for the insured    such responsibilities may include but    are not limited to consumer debt    dependent care college education for    dependents funeral costs and    mortgages term life insurance is    generally chosen in favor of permanent    life insurance because it is usually    much less expensive depending on the    length of the term many financial    advisors or other experts commonly    recommend term life insurance as a    means to cover potential expenses    until such time that there are    sufficient funds available from    savings to protect those whom the    insurance coverage was intended to    protect for example an individual    might choose to obtain a policy whose    term expires near his or her    retirement age based on the premise    that by the time the individual    retires he or she would have amassed    sufficient funds in retirement savings    to provide financial security for    their dependents this suggests the questions why do you have this policy also how many term life policies do you need or how much insurance do you need clearly you will be better off investing the premiums in the market   your beneficiaries may be better off either way depends when you die and to a lesser extent on market performance if you are not able to retire now but expect to be able to later you should strongly consider having sufficient insurance to provide income replacement for your spouse   this is a fairly common why

the s&p 500 is an index this refers to a specific collection of securities which is held in perfect proportion the dollar value of an index is scaled arbitrarily and is based off of an arbitrary starting price side note this is why an index never has a split lets look at what assumptions are included in the pricing of an index all securities are held in perfect proportion this means that if you invest $ 100 in the index you will receive shares of ibm shares of general motors etc also if a security is added dropped from the list you are immediately rebalancing the remaining money zero commissions are charged when the index is calculated they are using the current price last trade of the underlying securities they are not actually purchasing them therefore it assumes that securities may be purchased without commission or other liquidity costs also closely related is the following the current price has full liquidity if the last quoted price is $ 20 for a security the index assumes that you can purchase an arbitrary amount of the security at that price with a counterparty that is willing to trade dividends are distributed immediately if you own 500 equities and most distributed dividends quarterly this means you will receive on average 4 dividends per day management is free all equities can be purchased with zero research and administrative costs there is no gains tax trading required by the assumptions above would change your holdings constantly and you are exempt from short term or long term capital gains taxes each one of these assumptions is of course invalid and the fund which endeavors to track the index must make several decisions in how to closely track the index while avoiding the problems costs caused by the assumptions these are shortcuts or each shortcut leads to performance which does not exactly match the index management fees fees are charged to the investor as load annual fees and/or redemptions securities are purchased at real prices if facebook were removed from the s&p 500 overnight tonight the fund would sell its shares at the price buyers are bidding the next market day at this could be significantly different than the price today which the index records securities are purchased in blocks rather than buying shares of general motors each time someone invests a dollar they wait for a few people and then buy a full share or a round lot securities are substituted with lots of analysis it may be determined that two stocks move in tandem the fund may purchase two shares of general motors rather than one of general motors and ford this halves transaction costs debt is used as part of substitution equities may be replaced by options option pricing shows that ownership of options is equivalent to holding an amount of debt other forms of leverage may also be employed to achieve desired market exposure see also beta   dividends are bundled vfinx the largest s&p 500 tracking fund pays dividends quarterly rather than immediately as earned the dividend money which is not paid to you is either deployed to buy other securities or put into a sinking fund for payment there are many reasons why you ca n't get the actual performance quoted in an index and for other more exotic indices like vix the volatility index even more so the best you can do is work with someone that has a good reputation and measure their performance

's response is generally correct you would n't have to pay taxes on insurance benefits since those are in fact bringing you whole to what you 've lost however in some cases you do need to consider taxes specifically if the insurance payout is higher than your cost basis in the lost property while you may think that this never happens why would the insurance company pay more than what it cost you it in fact quite frequently does specific example would be a car used in your business if you used your car as part of your business and deducted car depreciation on your tax return your cost basis was reduced by the depreciation getting a full car cost payout form insurance would in fact constitute taxable income to you for the difference between your cost basis adjusted for the depreciation and the payout another example would be collectibles say you bought a car 20 years ago at $ 5000 you maintained it well during the years assume you spend another $ 5000 on repairs and it is now insured at fmv of $ 50000 but alas it got destroyed by a mountain lion who climbed over the fence and pushed it over a cliff you got a $ 50000 payout from your insurance company because you insured it for full fmv coverage as a collectible should be insured of which $ 40000 will be taxable to you there may be more specific cases where insurance payouts are partially taxable however as a general rule they 're not as long as they 're at or below your cost basis level

already touched on this but generally speaking there is a tendency in this country to lump unions together and put the shortcomings of one local or one unit or one member onto all of them an example would be the issue of corruption many people cry about rampant corruption in unions when in fact only somewhere between 1 2 of locals have ever had any corruption charges whereas i 'd be willing to bet that the corruption rate is much higher in the corporate world   gt honestly i ca nt think of any reason for minimum wage paying jobs to have a union if you think the wages are too low for cost of living then the minimum wage should be raised these people have no special skills little to no training and usually no education   genuine question what reasons do you think someone would could have for joining a union why would base pay education skill level of the job be a consideration     just so we 're on the same page collective bargaining came about because workers in certain areas were pissed off enough that they realized that to improve their situation they had to come together as a group because only as a group did they have any leverage all workers have the right to collective bargaining rights which were signed into law because pissed off workers were doing it anyway and the regulation of the practice helped smooth it out and drastically cut down on violence and debilitating drops in production     it takes quite a feeling of injustice and exploitation when not friends not family but colleagues some of which may not even like each other start seeing that they share common problems and decide to tie the fate of their working lives to one another and give up like 1 2 of their paychecks especially in a country with an culture like the us    so if workers at certain wal feel like working conditions are that bad for them then i ca n't see why they should n't organize

a quick excel calculation tells me that if you are earning a guaranteed post tax return of 12 in a liquid investment then it does n't matter which one you pick according to the following excel formula you would be able to invest now at 12 interest and you could withdraw every month for 24 months   which means that the option and the option are essentially the same this of course is depending on that 12 guaranteed return   where i come from this type of investment is unheard of   if i was sure i 'd still be using the same service two years from now i would choose the payment option you asked in the comments how to change the formula to account for risk in the investment   risk is a hard thing to quantify   however if you are certain that you will be using this service in two years from now you are essentially achieving 13 in a guaranteed return by pre paying your fee   in my experience a 13 guaranteed return is worth taking   trying to achieve any more than that in an investment is simply a gamble that having been said at the amount we are talking about each percent difference in return is only about   the biggest risk here is the fact that you might want to change services before your term is up   if these amounts are relatively small for you then if there is any chance at all that you will want to drop the service before the 2 years is up just pay the monthly fee

automation starting from steam engines most hard labor is gone mechanical looms there goes all fabrics made by hand cars there goes horses and computers there goes most clerical work still have not cause catastrophic unemployment today new jobs and new industries were invented instead   but i agree with robots and ai it will not be easy to find new things for people to do especially most people who are not very skilled and educated   so the solution must be restrictions on the use of robots and ai   for example all interaction with people customer service must be done by humans or every group of robots working must be supervised by a human   but no limits on robots and ai when it comes hard labor and basic work agriculture yard maintenance cleaning etc they can be done by robots without any restrictions    in any case the costs of running a business will be so much lower as almost all the work is done by robots so people can create and have more and more specialized businesses and services   p s1 we need to restrict robots and ai for other reasons too for example we ca n't have a country or a person have a robotic army to kill other people but mostly if we do not restrict people will become lazy spoiled and mindless   p s2 some people are unemployable in a future society not bright enough not reliable enough mental issues or disabled for them i can see basic income as the only solution   p s3 read the science fiction book by frank of a future society where thinking machines are not allowed and the reasons why they were not allowed i will let you guess why they were not allowed

do you need to do anything special when you receive such a huge amount of money yes absolutely 1st hire a lawyer retain him preferably one who has experience with high net worth clients 2nd hire a financial advisor wealth manager similarly one who has experience with high net worth clients 3rd tell no one else that you won i can not stress this point enough do these things before you even claim your prize winning the lottery seems like a great thing to people who have n't won but statistically speaking most people end up worse off most people not just lottery winners but people who come into large sums of money unexpectedly just do n't know how to handle it hire people who do know how to handle that sort of thing and get them on your side if you win the lottery protect yourself go here and read the top comment

par value of common stock is essentially a historical artifact it is a price at which the company will redeem shares directly   if common stock has any par value at all it is always so low that no one would ever redeem preferring to sell in the market at a better price   par is obviously much more relevant to debt securities than equities so you do need a strike price   's letter is a typical one in that companies often make the strike price for granted options a formula based on the market price of the stock at the time of the grant say 100 of market or 110 of market   but you will obviously need to find out what strike your company is offering

background graduated highschool last june and am currently working a construction job making $ working 45 50 hr weeks i 'm working the full year to save up money for university currently paying off $ 10000 loan for my car   question so i roughly need $ 40000 for school and figure i 'll still be short of that amount saved even if i work the full year do you guys think it 's smart for me to take a 2nd gap year and make another $ that would not only finish paying off my school but would also sit in a blue chip stock account making me some income while attending school should i take the 2nd gap year or enroll in university next september thanks

your question is a bit odd in that you are mixing long term fundamental analysis signals which are generally meant to work on longer time frames with medium term trading where these fundamental signals are mostly irrelevant   generally you would buy and hold on a fundamental signal and ride the short term fluctuations if you believe you have done good analysis if you would like to trade on the 2 6 month time scale you would need a signal that works on that sort of time scale   some people believe that technical analysis can give you those kind of signals but there are many many many different technical signals and how you would trade using them is highly dependent on which one you believe works some people do mix fundamental and technical signals but that can be very complicated   learning a good amount about technical analysis could get you started   i will note though that studies of non professionals continuously show that the more frequently people trade the more on they underperform on average in the long term when compared with people that buy and hold an aside on technical analysis michael 's comment is generally correct though not well explained   say bob found a technical signal that works and he believes that a stock that costs $ 10 dollars should be $ 11   he buys it and makes money two months later when the rest of the market figures out the right price is $ 11 and he sells at that price   this works a bunch of times and he now publishes how the signal works on stack exchange to show everyone how awesome he is   next time bob 's signal finds a different stock at $ 10 that should be $ 11 but anna just wrote a computer program that checks that signal bob published faster than he ever could   the computer program buys as much as it can in milliseconds until the price is $ 11   bob goes to buy but now it is too late the price is already $ 11 and he ca n't make any money eventually people learn to anticipate adjust for this signal and even anna 's algorithms do n't even work anymore and the hunt for new signals starts again

with 100 k i would dump the first 95 k into something lame like a tax advantaged bond or do as the others here suggested   my alternative would be to take the remaining 5 k and put into something leveraged   for instance 5 k would be more than enough to buy long term leaps options on the spy etf     time of post you could get 4 contracts on the dec 2017 leaps at the $ 225 strike roughly 10 out of the money for under $ 1200   possibly $ 1100 if you them 4 $ 1200 = $ 4800 at risk 4 $ = $ 90,000 = amount of spy stock you control with your $ 4800 if the market drops spy never reaches $ 225 in the next 3 years and you are out the $ 4800 but can use that to reduce capital gains and still have the $ 95 k on the sidelines earning $ 950 or so per year   basically you 'd be guaranteed to have $ 97 k in the bank after two years if the market goes up significantly before 2018 you 'll still have 95 k in the bank earning a measly 1 but you 've also got 4 contracts which are equal to $ 90 k shares of s&p 500   almost as if every single dollar was invested   bad news if spy goes up 20 or more from current levels over the next three years you 'll unfortunately have earned some taxable income   boo freaking

you would put your earnings and expenses do n't forget on schedule c and then do a schedule se for self employment tax 1040es is n't used to compute taxes it 's used to pay taxes generally you are supposed to pay taxes as you go rather than when you file there are exceptions where you wo n't be penalized for paying when you file most taxpayers will avoid this penalty if they owe less than $ 1,000 in tax after subtracting their withholdings and credits or if they paid at least 90 of the tax for the current year or 100 of the tax shown on the return for the prior year whichever is smaller from   i.e. there 's a safe harbor as long as you pay as much as you owed the year before if you owe a lot at the end of the year a second time in a row then you get penalized

you seem to think that stock exchanges are much more than they actually are but it 's right there in the name stock exchange it 's a place where people exchange i.e. trade stocks no more and no less all it does is enable the trading and thereby price finding supposedly they went into mysterious bankruptcy then what will happen to the listed companies   absolutely nothing they may have to use a different exchange if they 're planning an ipo or stock buyback that 's all and to the shareholder 's stock who invested in companies that were listed in these markets   nothing it still belongs to them trades that were in progress at the moment the exchange went down might be problematic but usually the shutdown would happen in a manner that takes care of it and ultimately the trade either went through or it did n't and you still have the money it might take some time to establish this let 's suppose i am an investor and i bought stocks from a listed company in nyse and nyse went into bankruptcy even though nyse is a unique business meaning it does n't have to do anything with that firm which i invested in how would i know the stock price of that firm   look at a different stock exchange there are dozens even within the usa hundreds internationally and will i lose my purchased stocks   of course not they will still be listed as yours at your broker in general what will happen after that   people will use different stock exchanges and some of them get overloaded from the additional volume expect some inconveniences but no huge problems

most of the answers here reflect a misunderstanding of what gold actually is from a financial perspective   i 'll answer your question by asking two questions and i do challenge you to stop and think about what we mean when we say cash or unit of exchange because without understanding those you will completely miss this answer in 1971 the dxy was 110   for people who do n't know the dxy is the us dollar index it weighs the strength of the us dollar relative to other currencies   hey look it 's a pretty graph of the dxy 's history in 1971 gold was $ 35 an ounce the dxy is 97 today gold is $ an ounce today now the questions if shares of company a in 1971 were $ 10 a share but now are $ 100 a share and some of this is because the company has grown but some of it is because of inflation and the dxy losing value what would the value of the company be if it was held in grams of gold and not dollars benjamin graham who influenced warren buffett is a supposed critic of gold yet what percent of his life were we not on a gold standard   in his day the dollar was backed by gold why would you buy gold if every dollar represented gold finally consider how many us dollars exist and how few metric tonnes of gold exist   even paul volcker admitted that a new gold standard would be impossible because the value of gold if we did it today would put gold in the $ range which is absurd to get on a gold standard technically now an old fashioned gold    standard and you had to replace all the dollars out there in foreign    hands with gold god the price you buy gold because the price of    gold would have to be enormous so you 're all left hoping the federal reserve figures how to get us all out of this mess without causing trouble otherwise let me just kindly say you will realize the value of gold then as the old saying goes a fool and his money are soon   i could be wrong but i 'd say that those who 've been buying gold since 1971 for their cash holdings not index funds are n't the suckers

if you do n't want to employer a smoker that 's fine it 's pretty common in my secondary line of work to not even employee cigarette smokers      but that does n't mean it 's necessarily the best policy for all jobs or that it should be a default policy without further examination    i 'm judging this based on time spent working in call centers when i was younger and going to school i was in workforce development at the place i have in mind so part of my job was tracking productivity they tried so hard to screen for marijuana but still failed pretty hard but ended up with so many people who were addicted to opiates and/or using meth   ideally the perfect work force would be totally drug free have no medical or mental health conditions and all have experience and intelligence but in a metro area that ranks in the bottom 10 for educational achievement and where $ 10 12 an hour is considered good pay that 's not what they 're going to get

for a company the size of amazon a 1 increase in prices is substantial   many of their products are in competitive price sensitive markets   there are some products that people would notice a 1 difference from competitors   so the actual increase would have to be concentrated on a smaller subset of products that are not as price sensitive   however that would still mean reduced sales   in short i do n't think amazon is foregoing a 50 bump in profits if they could get it   also a 5 sga cut is absolutely enormous for a lean organization   in any one year that would mean an effective ~10 cut once you factor in inflation

this just keeps getting   from the press release currently prescribe a course of cancer treatment based on the location of the cancer   no treatment is based on location grade stage and molecular profile    a patient with breast cancer could benefit from the positive results discovered from a patient with lung cancer if the underlying molecular involving both cancers were the same    yes this is already well known for at least the past decade and it 's why testing for is already performed on non small cell lung cancer    gt;the inability to utilize sequencing to guide treatment has been due to the inability to convert a patient ’s dna into actionable information in actionable time    this is not really true you 're still going to need to detect the and obtain tissue in order for sequencing to be done which takes time   and you either have to sequence it yourself or send it out for which is what they 're advocating here   uploading that information to a central network in no way impacts the time or cost associated with sequencing except insofar as it saves on postage for sending the results what this group is trying to do is the business of molecular analysis which is currently performed in a fully satisfactory fashion at individual institutions and just report that information back to the institution for a huge fee no institution in their right mind would agree to this as they would be then paying for something they could in turn bill for by performing themselves     the only difference seems to be that you 'd be getting a full genome instead of just the that we currently know to have or significance is this good no it 's way too much information and has real ethical legal implications what happens when we find other   this is a purely business venture that has very little to do with improving medicine

never take the first quote consider what it would really cost to replace the house to rebuild and pay for living while you do so including demolition etc and/or pay off the mortgage and return your equity if it is a financed property   most insurances will have a limit on how much coverage you can get based on the property value and your goods value estimates   shop around for a company that will give you a good price but also good customer service and a smooth claims process   they should be solvent able to pay your claim if say a hit the whole neighborhood   and they should cover your reasonable replacement costs and remember insurance is about the big losses like fires know what you are comfortable self insuring higher or lower deductibles optional coverages etc and you will have an easier time getting the coverage you need for the price you want to pay

so i 've been actively looking for work in my field education since graduation 2013 with little success but i 'll give it a shot since no one else has yet some tricks i 've picked up along the way with little success mind you   nothing nothing gained if you do n't do the work and begin the process of applying and feeling out their interest for a candidate you wo n't learn how much they are willing to buy your labor for    they have a price in mind before you apply they look at your credentials and determine if you will do the job and exceed expectations based on your status age current position other known facts of your life married kids they all bring and expectations to the table that they may or may not consider or know but can affect yours and their expectations and bring a or dynamic to the table depending on the at hand do you like them and can you see yourself liking to work for them   so what kind of do they want to be most likely they want to be on the bleeding edge if their new and cut away from the flock but realistically they can probably hardly afford to pay for a 's portion of your current position without some heavy backing them who is backing them   so you will need to go in expecting a dollar gained for the company is a dollar given to you hopefully down the road if you take 5 pay cut this year you better be getting a 5 20 increase in the following 5 years based on performance but how do you sell yourself as a facet of the team that achieves these longterm goals how do you fit therefore if you do n't gain this round make sure you have or written of compensation in the future to follow up with when due   on top of this dynamic look at similar advertised recently on various other websites to anchor your asking price aim higher and you 'll hopefully land on the moon if not the stars normally i would go to linkedin to check out the history and glassdoor but not sure that s needed in this case since you know them already and its a newer company with that in mind ask yourself is this a job i would and could see myself eager to be challenged by the next 3 years

the prices quoted are for currency pairs traded on the foreign exchange market for currencies traded on these exchanges the exchange rates of a given currency pair are determined by the market so supply and demand investor confidence etc all play a role and reuters are the two primary trading platforms in the foreign exchange market and much of the data on exchange rates comes from them websites will usually get their data either from these sources directly or from a data provider that in turn gets it from reuters or another data source like bloomberg or analytics these data sources are n't free however   in the us many contracts transactions etc that involve exchange rates use the exchange rate data published by the federal reserve you might see this in contracts that specify to use the exchange rate published by the federal reserve at 12 pm noon on date you can also look at the federal reserve economic data which maintains data series of historical daily weekly and monthly exchange rates for major currency pairs these data are free although they are n't realtime data for each business day is mostly updated the next business day
