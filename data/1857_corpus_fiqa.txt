disclaimer my answer is based on us tax law but i assume australian situation would be similar the irs would not be likely to believe your statement that i would n't have gone to the country if it was n't for the conference   a two week vacation with a two day conference in there certainly looks like you threw in the conference in order to deduct vacation expenses   at the very least you would need a good reason why this conference is necessary to your business if you can give that reason it would then depend on the specifics of australian law   the vacation is clearly not just incidental to the trip the registration for the conference is always as a business expense

you can deduct this if the main purpose of the trip is to attend the seminar   travel expenses relating to the attendance at conferences seminars and other work related events are deductible to the extent that they relate to your income producing activities you will need to your travel expenses where you undertake both work related and private activities travel costs to and from the location of the work related event will only be deductible where the primary purpose of the travel was to attend the event accommodation food and other incidental costs must be apportioned between work related and private activities taking into account the types of activities that you did on the day you incurred the cost you might like to consider in advance what you would tell them if they questioned this for instance you might say if they are true

assuming us irs if you filed on time and paid what you believed was the correct amount they might be kind and let it go but do n't assume they will if you ca n't file on time you are supposed to file estimated taxes before the deadline and to make that payment large enough to cover what you are likely to owe them if there is excess you get it back when you file the actual forms if there is a shortfall you may be charged fees essentially interest on the money you still owe them calculated from the submission due date if you fail to file anything before the due date then the fees interest surcharge is calculated on the entire amount still due effectively the same as if you had filled an estimated return claiming you owed nothing note that since the penalty scales with the amount still due large errors do cost you more than small ones and before anyone asks no the irs does n't pay interest if you submit the forms early and they owe you money i 've sometimes wondered whether they 're missing a bet there and if it would be worth rewarding people to file earlier in order to spread out the work a bit better but until someone sells them on that idea

because amazon is not even close to being a monopoly look at wal mart revenue to amazon revenue even with   aws and everything else not even close to being the largest retailer they are just the largest e commerce retailer even there they still are n't a monopoly   add in the fact that a lot of amazon sales are marketplace sales other online vendors selling through amazon and you see that amazon is n't even close to being a monopoly   amazon is just really good at retail being so good at something that you gain market share is not covered under anti trust law

i strongly doubt that being executor will make the assets of the estate vulnerable to a suit against him personally the estate is it 's own separate legal entity with its own tin only creditors against the estate itself can make claims against it and after all creditors are paid then the balance is distributed in accordance with the terms of the will unless he has commingled assets and treated estate assets as his own the legal separation should be quite strong   whether his personal assets are at risk remember that the opposition will likely overstate their case to try to scare him into settling if the business was organized as an llp or llc his personal assets should be pretty safe if it was a sole proprietorship he has occasion to worry

gt the essential reason for this is that rising premiums in silver plans would trigger an increase in tax credits for low income individuals whose premium paying responsibilities are limited by the aca   so if i 'm understanding this correctly a reduction in subsidies for silver plan recipients would result in higher premiums overall which would result in low income individuals losing enough income to qualify for other tax benefit programs that would cancel out these higher premiums    if that is the case what an odd take on that scenario it 's finding the one silver lining in a very very bad situation the case described would push a lot of people off the cliff of self sufficiency and the headline makes that sound like a good thing

my answer is not specific or even maybe applicable to microsoft companies do n't want to cut dividends so they have a fixed expense but the cashflow that funds it might be quite or cyclical depending on the industry another more general issue is that taking on debt to retire shares is a capital allocation decision a company needs capital to operate this is why they went public in the first place to raise capital debt is a cheaper form of capital than equity equity holders are last in line in a bankruptcy bondholders are at the front of the line to compensate for this equity holders require a larger return often called a hurdle rate so why does n't a company just use cheaper equity and no debt some do but consider that equity holders participate in the earnings where bondholders just get the interest nothing more and because lenders do n't participate in the potential upside they introduce conditions debt covenants to help control their downside exposure for a company it 's a balance very much the same as personal finances a reasonable amount of debt provides low cost capital which can be used to produce greater returns but too much debt and the covenants are breached the debt is called due immediately there 's no cash to cover and bankruptcy a useful measure if a bit difficult to calculate is a company 's cost of capital and the return on that capital cost of capital is a blended number taking both equity and debt into account good companies earn a return that is greater than their cost of capital seems obvious but many companies do n't succeed at this in cases where this is persistent the best move for shareholders would be for the company to dissolve and return all the capital unfortunately as in the railroad tycoon example above managers incentives are n't always well aligned with shareholders and they allocate capital in ways advantageous to themselves and not the company

that 's a loaded question   economists ca n't even agree on an answer from a purely economic point of view   i will say this   i think that many people who are advocating radical cutbacks in spending republicans and tea partiers are themselves in two important ways   1 that it 's possible to balance the budget without raising revenues   i do n't think very many economists agree with this premise   even paul ryan 's plan to balance the budget should one take a hard look at the number clearly show how impossible it is   there would either have to be tax hikes or we slash the military to a fraction of its size now and leave no money for pretty much anything else like roads highways air traffic control food safety inspections education farm subsidies oil subsidies etc   2 more importantly i think there is an implicit and fundamental belief among right that the world will somehow stop what it 's doing while the us balances its budget   the belief goes that once we are fiscally healthy we will remain a superpower and ruling the world like we have for 100 years   this is fundamentally wrong   i think most people even tea partiers fail to appreciate how fundamentally important america 's debt has been to our history   we have essentially borrowed our way into power   should the right win the day and put in place radical cuts in spending america 's economic political diplomatic cultural and military influence around the world will be among to go   the dollar will and so will our standards of living   our gdp will not be able to support a a political economy that can maintain superpower status   now i do not mean to say that i do not agree with the right   from a purely economic point of view they may very well be right   i 'm not even sure there is an option   in fact a part of me is ready to accept america becoming what france and the uk are now still having relatively good standards of living but nowhere near the height of their historical powers   maybe the world will be better for it   i just do n't think tea partiers appreciate the ultimate result of what they want to see happen

canadian here the us is our biggest customer so we were impacted economically i expected that within a year or two of the us housing collapse we would also be hit but something else happened when the us dropped interest rates like a stone we were also forced to drop interest rates this meant that suddenly money was being handed out for very very cheap so cheap it was almost free if you had a decent job and good credit the housing market here for a brief moment and then continued climbing it never stopped until some new rules were implemented aimed mostly at foreign buyers and investors and put in place this year it appears however that this current drop in prices may be a temporary dip the average cost of a home in toronto is still around $ 1 m cad and our real estate is still among the most expensive in the world if you look at how much we pay compared to our incomes   in some places houses have basically tripled over the past decade   my point here is that canadian home owners were not impacted negatively by the 2008 crisis in fact once the free money started flowing and prices went up accordingly canadian home owners were enriched as a direct result of the 2008 us housing crisis the situation is clearly unsustainable and the market is irrational it 's easy to say that we are in a bubble but it is   impossible to tell when it will crash in canada it 's harder to walk away from mortgage debt if you 're underwater on your home and the bank forecloses on you and sells the house for less than you owe you still owe the bank the remainder of the money in most provinces

in some jurisdictions you can donate the development rights you and the family still own it but nothing can ever be built on it in some cases you will still be able to build a cabin or similar structure on a few acres but the bulk has to be left natural   the advantage is that by giving away the logging or other development rights the land loses much of its value thus reducing the tax value of the land there are some hoops that you need to jump through but this is not an unusual transaction another choice it to see if the land touches any similar conservation areas it can be possible to donate the land to the government or other conservation group but it would revert to the family if they ever tried to sell or develop the land because you do n't own it you would not have to pay taxes but and could still use it by donating the land to the same organization a your neighbors it can streamline the paperwork for people who want to through hike

that price is the post tender price which already reflects arbitrage   it 's less than $ 65 on the market because that 's the highest offer out there and the market price reflects the risk that the $ 65 will not be paid   it also reflects the time value of money until the cash is disbursed including blows to liquidity in other words you are buying the stock burdened with the risk that it might rapidly deflate if the deal falls through or gets at a lower price or that your money might be better spent somewhere other than waiting for the i bank to release the tender offer amount to you two months ago traded around $ 55 and four months ago it traded around $ 50   if the deal fails then you could be stuck either taking a big loss to get out of the stock or waiting months or longer in the hope that another deal will come along and pay $ 65 which may leave you with npv loss from today   the market seems to think that risk is pretty small but it 's still there if the payout is $ 65 then you get a discount for time value and a discount for failed merger risk   that means the price is less than $ 65   you can still make money on it if the merger goes through   some investors believe they have a better way to make money and no doubt the tender offer of the merger of two publicly traded companies is already heavily arbitraged   but that said it may still pay off tender offer arbitrage is discussed in this article

my advice would be to invest that 50k in 25 batches across 4 different money markets batch 1 lend using a peer to peer account 12.5k the interest rates offered by banks are n't that appealing to investors anymore at least in the uk peer to peer lending brokers such as zopa provide 5 to 6   annual returns if you 're willing to hold on to your investment for a couple of years despite your pre these investments are relatively safe although not guaranteed i must stress this zopa state on their website that they have n't lost any money provided from their investors since the company 's inception 10 years ago and have a safeguard trust that will be used to pay out investors if a large number of borrowers defaulted i 'm not sure if this service is available in australia but aim for an interest rate of 5 6 with a trusted peer to peer lender that has a strong track record batch 2 the stock market 12.5k an obvious choice this is by far the most exciting way to grow your money the next question arising from this will likely be how do i pick stocks this 12.5k needs to be further divided into 5 or so different stocks my strategy for picking stock at the current time will be to have 20 of your holdings in blue chip companies with a strong track record of performance and ideally a dividend that is paid bi quarterly another type of stock that you should invest in should be companies that are relatively newly listed on the stock market but have monopolistic qualities that is that they are the biggest best and only provider of their new and unique service examples of this would be tesla and just eat moreover i 'd advise another type of stock you should purchase be a sin stock to hedge against bad economic times if they arise a sin stock is one associated with sin i.e. cigarette manufacturers alcohol suppliers providers of gambling products these often perform good while the economy is doing well but even better when the economy experiences a 2007 2008 and type of meltdown finally another category i 'd advise would be large cap energy provider companies such as exxon mobil bp duke energy primarily because these are currently cheaper than they were a few months ago and the demand for energy is likely to grow with the population which is definitely growing rapidly batch 3 funds 12.5k having some of your money in funds is really a no brainer a managed fund is traditionally a collection of stocks that have been selected within a particular market at this time i 'd advise at least 20 of the 12.5k in emerging market funds as the prices are ridiculously low having fallen about 60 unless china brazil india just self destruct or get they will slowly grow again within the next 5 years i imagine quite high returns can be had in this type of funds the rest of your funds should be high dividend payers but i 'll let you do your own research batch 4 property 12.5k the property market is too good to not get into but let 's be honest you 're not going to be able to buy a flat house apartment for 12.5k the idea therefore would be to find a crowd funding platform that allows you to own a part of a property alongside other owners the uk has platforms such as property partner that are great for this and i 'm sure australia also has some such platforms invest in the capital city in areas as close to the city 's center as possible as that 's unlikely to change barring some kind of economic collapse or an strike i think the above methods of investing provide the following 1 diversified portfolio of investments 2 hedging against difficult economic times should they occur and the only way you 'll lose out with diversification such as this is if the whole economic system collapses or all out nuclear war although i think your investments will be the least of your worries in a nuclear war anyway this is the method of investing i 've chosen for myself and you can see my reasoning above feel free to ask me if you have any questions

fundamentally these are my opinions i am expressing even though i try to remain as factual as possible and have significantly modified my opinion over the years as a result of apparently factual information it 's still technically just opinion   gt my view is not so much that labour and finance capital returns need to be balanced although that is probably a great thing to aim for but that creation of wealth capital needs to be intrinsically linked with the creation of real value   by the way when i say capital it 's not generally just finance capital but all operational capital goods which includes factories and all means of production a certain amount of financing is needed to keep it operational and more is needed to increase the means of production to grow overall wealth   have you ever heard of the 's wiki basically you ca n't really push this ratio very far if consumer demand dries up then production will get cut back to meat demand overproduction of stuff they ca n't sell is not what they are in business for likewise is demand exceeds the capacity of production to keep up it pushes inflation which drives up cost to reduce demand so this ratio remains very nearly a constant even though this ratio was at historic highs in the 1970s and historic lows today   what happens when you artificially dry up labor returns through excessive supply side policies is that demand for production falls hence production is cut back to meet that demand this of course reduces employment and increases job competition which puts more downward on wages exacerbating the situation only once labor cost fall low enough it effectively subsidizes inefficient production methods which limits the falling wages at a reduced overall productivity note that this is under present circumstances not those of the 1970s this adaptive matching between production and demand insures that the ratio is never too far off of its historical averages even if productivity is driven well below its potential   more or less the same effect occurs for the opposite reason if capital return ratios are too low though with opposite effects on the inflation rate and such when consumer demand is high enough capital will pay whatever labor cost is required to meet that demand so long as it remains profitable enough i.e. they get a reasonable ratio of the market return consumer demand with sufficient capital profit margins is what drives full employment not the sheer volume of capital returns as present policies essentially assume yet you ca n't have a broad based consumer demand to drive employment without sufficient labor returns as those labor returns is what finances that demand needed to drive employment   so not only does labour and capital returns need to be balanced economics does not allow it to be unbalanced at least for long even if balancing requires the economy to shrink productivity to fall etc that is exactly what it will do to remain balanced no choice given no matter how draconian the regulations to force it this is true under purely economies of the past pure communism and even this is why i am a capitalist because nature gives me no choice but acceptance of that fact does not require me to have an ounce of tolerance for cronyism   the only thing we can do is not push this balance in either direction to destructive levels because destruction is what will happen for the balance to remain because so much of our productive capacity has been in productivity gains since the 1990s and wages and demand have as yet not matched these productivity gains we have a huge latent wealth capacity that continues to grow as we fail to take advantage of it so far our supply side policies have n't so much destroyed wealth and productivity rather it has prevented us from seeing the potential gains from the latent productivity growth from technologies over the few decades     the last part you mention about wealth capital needing to be intrinsically linked with the creation of real value you are absolute 100 entirely correct perhaps even more than you know ever heard of planned obsolescence or the light bulb light bulb that link is a documentary on the issue that will make you mad we could almost certainly pay a flat 90 tax rate on everything and still not come close to what this issue cost us that 's not the only means this issue imposes cost but it is extreme    of course just because an appliance still works does n't mean people will not replace it with newer better models but the trash pile insures there is a much more limited secondary market for poorer people consumption debt cost is also a far bigger issue than people recognize debt to finance capital goods for production is fine as this feeds productivity and wealth in a manner that itself even as the debt is paid consumption debt is an entirely different beast creating a significant section of the population that feeds on peoples income without producing a thing only to let allow people to consume income they have n't earned yet   this generally falls under the category of rent seeking behavior yeah the lack real value creation turns my stomach that people will knowingly spend money on temporary non essential and such is all fine and dandy but renting our base appliances for a certain number of uses is outrageous in my book

let 's divide all bank accounts into savings and checking the main difference is that checking is easy to get money from savings is hard to get money from because of this the federal reserve requires that banks keep more money on hand to cover transactions in checking accounts here is a related question from a banking customer regarding a recent notice on their bank statement deposit it seems that the bank was moving the customer 's money between hidden sub accounts to make it look like the checking account was really a savings account and thus reduce the amount of funds we are required to keep on deposit at the federal reserve bank if they did n't have to transfer the money many times the bank could keep less cash on hand but once they did 5 hidden transactions the rest of the money in the hidden savings account would be moved by the bank the 6 transaction limit is done to not allow you to treat savings like checking here is a relevant quote from the federal reserve savings deposits   savings deposits generally have no specified maturity    period they may be interest bearing with interest computed or paid    daily weekly quarterly or on any other basis the two most    significant features of savings deposits are the reservation of    right requirement and the restrictions on the number of    convenient transfers or withdrawals that may be made per month or    per statement cycle of at least four weeks from the account in order    to classify an account as a savings deposit the institution must    in its account agreement with the customer reserve the right at any    time to require seven advance written notice of an intended    withdrawal in practice this right is never exercised but the    institution must nevertheless reserve that right in the account    agreement in addition for an account to be classified as a savings    deposit the depositor may make no more than six convenient    transfers or withdrawals per month from the account convenient    transfers and withdrawals for purposes of this limit include    automatic transfers including but not limited to    transfers from the savings deposit for overdraft protection or for    direct bill payments and transfers and withdrawals initiated by    telephone or computer and transfers made by check debit     card or other similar order made by the depositor and payable to    third parties other less convenient types of transfers such as    withdrawals or transfers made in person at the bank by mail or by    using an atm do not count toward the six per month limit and do not    affect the account âs status as a savings account also a withdrawal    request initiated by telephone does not count toward the transfer    limit when the withdrawal is disbursed via check mailed to the    depositor   should be particularly wary of a bank âs practices    for handling telephone transfers as noted an unlimited number of    telephone initiated withdrawals are allowed so long as a check for    the withdrawn funds is mailed to the depositor otherwise the limit    is six telephone transfers per month the limit applies to    transfers to move savings deposit funds to another type of deposit    account and to make payments to third parties

for simplicity let 's start by just considering cash back in general cash back from credit cards for personal use is not taxable but for business use it is taxable sort of i 'll explain later the reason is most personal purchases are made with after tax dollars you typically are n't deducting the cost of what you purchased from your personal income so if you purchase something that costs $ 100 and you receive $ 2 back from the cc company effectively you have paid $ 98 for that item but that would n't affect your tax bill however since businesses typically deduct most expenses that same $ 100 deduction would have only been a $ 98 deduction for business tax purposes so in this case the $ 2 should be accounted for note you should not consider that $ 2 as income though that would artificially inflate your revenue it should be treated as a negative expense similar to how you would handle returning an item you purchased and receiving a cc refund now for your specific questions part 1 as a small business owner i wish to attend an annual seminar to improve my business i have enough credit card reward points to cover the airfare hotel and rental car will those expenses still be deductible at the value displayed on the receipt effectively no these expenses are not deductible if you deduct them they will be completely counter acted by the refund you receive for the payments part 2 does it matter if those points are accrued on my personal credit card rather than a business credit card this is where it gets hairy suppose your company policy is that employees make purchases with their own personal credit cards and submit receipts for reimbursement in this case the employer can simply reimburse and would not know or care if the employee is racking up rewards points cashback the trick is as the employee you must always purchase business related items normally so you have receipts to show and if you receive cashback on the side there seems to be a do n't ask do n't tell rule that the irs is ok with it works the same way with heavy business travelers and airline the free vacations those users get as perks are not treated as taxable income however i would not go out of my way to abuse this loophole typically things like travel airfare hotel car rental meals are expected but i would n't go purchase 100 company laptops on your personal card and ask the company to reimburse you the company should purchase those 100 laptops on a company card and effectively reduce the sale price by the cashback received or more realistically negotiate a better discount with your account rep and just cut them a check part 3 would there be any difference between credit card points and brand loyalty points if the rental car were paid for with points earned directly on the rental car company 's loyalty system not a cc would that yield a different result there is no difference perhaps the simplest way to think about this is you can only deduct an expense that you actually incur in other words the expense should show up on a bank or cc statement this is why when you volunteer and work 10 hours for a charity you ca n't call that a donation of any amount of money because there is no actual payment made that would show up on a bank statement instead you could have billed the charity for your 10 hours of work and then turned around and donated that same amount back to them but it ends up being a wash

when a house is sold at a foreclosure auction the selling bank usually does not provide the guarantees that a normal house seller provides   furthermore the previous owner may have neglected the property and/or damaged the property   bank owned properties are often neglected and/or   banks are usually too short sighted to properly market the real estate they own and do a poor job of making it easy to buy the property thus foreclosure sales usually happen at a price that is significantly below the fair market value of sales between competent households   it is common for a house that is worth $ 125,000 even in a depressed market to sell for only $ 100,000 in a short sale or foreclosure it is possible that this property sold for an even larger discount   it is also possible that the tax assessor is inadvertently comparing a run down property with well maintained properties that have extra expensive features without fully adjusting for the properties conditions and features   in the latter scenario the property owner can ask the tax assessor to re consider the assessment   usually this request is called an appeal

shorting stocks borrowing the shares to sell now then buying them back when the price drops   risk if you are wrong the stock can go up and if there are a lot of people shorting the stock you can get stuck in a short squeeze   that means that so many people need to buy the stock to return the ones they borrowed that the price goes up even further and faster   also whoever you borrowed the stock from will often make the decision to sell for you put options risk put values do n't always drop when the underlying price of the stock drops this is because when the stock drops volatility goes up and volatility can raise the value of an option and you need to check each stock for whether or not these options are available lists whether a stock is optional or not and for shorting you also need to find a broker that owns shares that they are willing to lend out

when evaluating a refinance you need to figure out the payback time refinancing costs money in closing costs the payback time is the time it takes to recover the closing costs with the amount of money you are saving in interest   for example if the closing costs are $ 2,000 your payback time is 2 years if it takes 2 years to save that amount in interest with the new interest rate vs. the old one   to estimate this look at the difference in interest rate between your mortgage and the new one and your mortgage balance for example let 's say that you have $ 100,000 left on your mortgage and the new rate is 1 lower than your current rate in one year you will save roughly $ 1,000 in interest if your closing costs are $ 2,000 then your payback time is somewhere around 2 years if you plan on staying in this house longer than the payback time then it is beneficial to refinance   there are mortgage refinance calculators online that will calculate payback time more precisely   one thing to watch out for when you refinance if you expand the term of your mortgage you might end up paying more interest over the long term even though your rate is less and your monthly payment is less for example let 's say you currently have 8 years left on a 15-year mortgage if you refinance to a new 15-year mortgage your monthly payment will go down but if you only pay the new minimum payment for the next 15 years you could end up paying more in interest than if you had just continued with your old mortgage for the next 8 years to avoid this refinance to a new mortgage with a term close to what you have left on your current mortgage if you ca n't do that continue paying whatever your current monthly payment is after you refinance and you 'll pay your new mortgage early and save on interest

if i have a house that its market value went from $ 100k to $ 140k can i get heloc $ 40 k maybe the amount that you can borrow depends on the market value of the house so if you already have $ 100k borrowed against it it will be tough to borrow another $ 40k without paying a higher interest rate since there is a real risk that the value will decrease and you will be underwater    can i again ask for heloc after i finish the renovation in order to do more renovation and maybe try to end up renovating the house so its value raises up to $ 500k i doubt you can just renovate a house and increase its market value from $ 140k to $ 500k.   much of a house 's value is determined by its location and you can quickly a neighborhood   if you put $ in improvements in a neighborhood where other homes are selling for $ 140k you will not realize nearly that amount in actual market value   people that buy $ 500k houses generally want to be in an area where other homes are worth around the same amount    if you want to to a major renovation such as an addition i would instead shop around for a home improvement loan   the main difference is that you can use the expected value of the house after improvements to determine the loan balance instead of using the current value once the renovations are complete you roll it and the existing mortgage into a new mortgage which will likely be cheaper than a mortgage + heloc the problem is that the cost of the improvements is generally more than the increase in market value   it also helps you make a wise decision versus taking out a $ 40k heloc and spending it all on renovations only to find out that the increase in market value is only $ 10k and you 're now underwater so in your case talk to a contractor to plan out what you want to do which will tell you how much it will cost   then talk to a realtor to determine what the market value with those improvements will be which will tell you how much you can borrow   it 's highly likely that you will need to pay some out of pocket to make up the difference but it depends on what the improvements are and what comparable homes sell for

in england currently and for most of the last fifty years the standard length of the mortgage term is 25 years a mortgage can be either a capital and interest mortgage or interest only in the former you pay off part of the original loan each month plus the interest on the amount borrowed in the latter you only pay interest each month and the original amount borrowed never reduces you pay premiums on a life insurance policy additionally which is designed to pay off the original sum borrowed at the end of the 25 years no one in england thinks that a 25 year loan has any drawbacks the main point to appreciate is that the longer the period of the loan the less you need to pay each month because you are repaying the original loan the capital over a longer period of time thus in principle a mortgage is easier to repay the longer the term is because the monthly payment is less if you have a 12 year mortgage you must pay back the original amount borrowed in half the time the capital element in your payment each month is double what it would be if repaid over 25 years i.e. if repaid over a period twice as long only if the borrower is less than 25 years away from retirement is a 25 years mortgage seen as a bad idea by the lender because obviously the lender relies on the borrower having an income sufficient to keep up the repayments there are many complicating factors an interest only mortgage where you pay back the original amount borrowed from the maturity proceeds from a life policy puts you in a situation where the original capital sum never reduces so you always pay the same each month but on a straight repayment mortgage the traditional type you pay less and less each month as time goes by for you are reducing the capital outstanding each month and because that is reducing so is the amount of interest you pay each month as this is calculated on the outstanding capital amount there are to avoid if you can for example some mortgage contracts impose penalties if the borrower repays more than the due monthly amount hence in effect the borrower faces a possibly heavy financial penalty for early repayment of the loan but not all mortgages include such a condition if house prices are on a rising trend the market value of the property will soon be worth considerably more than the amount owed on the mortgage especially where the mortgage debt is reducing every month as each repayment is made so the bank or other lender will not be worried about lending over a 25 year term because if it forecloses there should normally be no difficulty in recovering the outstanding amount from the sale proceeds if the borrower falls behind on the repayments or house prices fall he may soon get into difficulties but this could happen to anyone it is not a particular problem of a 25 year term where a default in repayment occurs the bank will often suggest the mortgage term from 25 years to 30 years in order to reduce the amount of the monthly repayment as a means of helping the borrower so longer terms than 25 years are in fact a positive solution in a case of financial difficulty   of course the longer the term the greater the amount that the borrower will pay in total but the longer the term the less he will pay each month at least on a traditional capital and interest mortgage so it is a question of balancing those two competing factors   as long as you do not have a mortgage condition that the borrower for paying off the loan more quickly it can make sense to have as long a term as possible to begin with which can be shortened by increasing the monthly repayment as fast as circumstances allow in england we used to have tax relief on mortgage payments and so in times gone by it did make sense to let the mortgage run the full 25 years in order to get maximum tax relief the rules were very complex but it tended to maximise your tax relief by paying over the longest possible period but today with no income tax relief given on mortgage payments that is no longer a consideration in this country the practical position is of course that you can never tell how long it might take you to pay off a mortgage it is a gamble as to whether your income will rise in future years and whether your job will last until your mortgage is paid off you might fall ill you might be made redundant you might be mortgage interest rates might rise it is never possible to say that you can pay off the loan in a short time   if you hope to do so the only matters that actually fall within your control are the conditions of the mortgage contract itself get a good lawyer tell him to watch out for early redemption penalties get a good financial adviser tell him to work out what you will need to pay in additional premiums on your life policy if you are considering taking an interest only mortgage try to fix your mortgage rate in the first few years for as long as possible so that in your most vulnerable period with the greatest amount owing you are insulated against unexpected interest rate fluctuations only the initial conditions can be controlled so it might be prudent to take as long a term as possible even though a prudent borrower will leave himself room to reduce that term and a prudent lender will leave room to extend it in case of unpredictable changes in the financial circumstances in england most lenders are in my experience reluctant to grant mortgages for less than 25 years that is simply a policy rightly or wrongly the borrower usually has no choice about the length of the term hence in the uk it can be difficult to find a choice of interest rates based on differing mortgage terms i am aware that the situation in the usa is rather different but if i personally were faced with the choice i would be uncomfortable about taking on a short term mortgage because of the factors i have outlined above

one major concern with moving out on your own is can you afford rent each month be it an apartment or a house payment you 'll hear people say that anywhere from 25 to 40 of your monthly after tax income should go to housing 40 seems very high to me and quite risky i 'd go for closer to 30 of your monthly after tax income and not any higher but that 's just my opinion   i had a friend that moved out of his parents house about the same time that i did he bought himself a house and then he immediately started looking for roommates to help pay for his house it really was a good idea and i wish that i 'd been in a position to do the same because i 'm sure that it saved him a lot of money for the first couple of years apart from that my only advise would be to get a house if you can afford it 1 interest rates are very low right now and 2 if you 're paying rent to someone for an apartment or whatever then you 're just throwing your hard earned money away good luck

there is a distinct difference between having a degree and being genuinely smart and business savvy if you 're genuinely smart and business savvy you could theoretically break into the business world with no degree and make a decent salary the trouble there is that many people are n't smart and business savvy until they get a degree   on the other hand it 's very possible to get a degree and be completely oblivious about how to conduct your career poor resume interviewing skills no business sense etc in that case an mba might not be totally useful but probably still will be to a degree however if you are smart about how you conduct your career an mba should help you immensely

i wrote a longer reply then deleted it socialism as a term has developed so many conflicting definitions that it has become almost completely useless that being said i do n't believe that a group of countries where several still have their royal and noble classes and their economy is a commodity and market driven economy qualify as meeting the basic tenets of marx 's socialism on the other hand they are certainly leftist and their model is working well for them and many western countries could be better if they moved toward the nordic model but again they are not true socialism

your problem is one that has challenged many people   as you said there are two aspects to balancing a budget reducing expenses or increasing income   and you state that you have done all the cost cutting that you can find   looking at ways to increase your income is a good way to balance your budget how big is your problem   do you need to find another $ 100/month or do you need $ 1000/month   there are many part time jobs you could obtain fast food retail grocery you could obtain a sales job cars real estate even working for a recruiting firm where you could connect buyers and sellers   if your need is $ 100/month a part time job on weekends would fill the gap when i was trying to solve my budget problems a few years ago i thought that i needed to increase my income   and i did increase my income   but then i realized that my expenses were too high   and i re evaluated my priorities   i challenge you to revisit your expenses   often we assume that we need things that we really can not afford   consider a few of your possible expenses my problems included mortgage debt auto loans high utilities high car insurance too much spending on kids activities and a few other problems

for a company the size of amazon a 1 increase in prices is substantial   many of their products are in competitive price sensitive markets   there are some products that people would notice a 1 difference from competitors   so the actual increase would have to be concentrated on a smaller subset of products that are not as price sensitive   however that would still mean reduced sales   in short i do n't think amazon is foregoing a 50 bump in profits if they could get it   also a 5 sga cut is absolutely enormous for a lean organization   in any one year that would mean an effective ~10 cut once you factor in inflation

since you mention bounced checks in the beginning of your piece it 's worth mentioning that bounced checks can land you in prison depending on various circumstances    in this case it 's because you 're committing a fraud namely offering someone a piece of paper and claiming it 's worth $ 500 or whatever when it 's really worthless because you do n't have the funds   simply owing a debt is not considered criminal but payment that is not actually valid is considered defrauding the person you are trying to pay this check fraud information site discusses the different penalties in each state as this is primarily covered by laws at the state level   it is never until you have repaid the check of course it is in most states a < = 1 year in jail though some states do make it a felony for larger amounts or repeat violations   these penalties are also typically at the judge 's discretion and in many cases you are only fined some states have a minimum dollar amount for it to be a criminal offense most seem to be around $ 500 or so though there is quite a lot of variability some real world examples of this include former nba player walker and former nfl player porter

i have about $ 1 k in savings and have been told that you should get into investment and saving for retirement early i make around $ 200 per week which about $ 150 goes into savings that 's $ 10k per year   the general rule of thumb is that you should have six months income as an emergency fund   so your savings should be around $ 5k   build that first    some argue that the standard should be six months of living expenses rather than income   personally i think that this example is exactly why it is income rather than living expenses   six months of living expenses in this case would only be $ 1250 which wo n't pay for much   and note that living expenses can only be calculated after the fact   if your estimate of $ 50 a week is overly optimistic you might not notice for months until some large living expense pops up    another problem with using living expenses as the measure is that if you hold down your living expenses to maximize your savings this helps both measures   then you hit your savings target and your living expenses increase   so you need more savings   by contrast if your income increases but your living expenses do not you still need more savings but you can also save more money   does n't really change the basic analysis though   either way you have an emergency savings target that you should hit before starting your retirement savings    if you save $ 150 per week then you should have around $ 4k in savings at the beginning of next year   that 's still low for an emergency fund by the income standard   so you probably should n't invest next year   with a living expenses standard you could have $ in savings by april 15th deadline for an ira contribution that appears in the previous tax year   that 's $ 5000 more than the $ 1250 emergency fund so you could afford an ira probably a roth that year    if you save $ 7500 next year and start with $ 4k in savings under the income standard for emergency savings that would leave you with $ 11,500   take $ 5500 of that and invest in an ira probably a roth   after that you could make a $ 100 deposit per week for the next year   or just wait until the end    if you invested in an ira the previous year because you decided use the living expenses standard you would only have $ 6500 at the end of the year   if you wait until you have $ you could max out your ira contribution   at that point your excess income for each year would be larger than the maximum ira contribution so you could max it out until your circumstances change    if you do n't actually save $ 3k this year and $ 7500 next year do n't sweat it   a college education is enough of an investment at your age   do that first then emergency savings then retirement    that will flip around once you get a better paying long term job   then you should include retirement savings as an expected cost   so you 'd pay the minimum required for your education loans and other required living expenses then dedicate an amount for retirement savings then build your emergency savings then pay off your education loans above the minimum payment   this is where it can pay to use the more aggressive living expenses standard as that allows you to pay off your education loans faster    i would invest retirement savings in a nice diversified index fund or two since maintaining the correct stock bond mix of stocks is less risky than investing in just bonds much less just stocks   investing in individual stocks is something you should do with excess money that you can afford to lose   secure your retirement first   then stock investments are gravy if they pan out   if they do n't you 're still all right   but if they do you can make bigger decisions e.g. buying a house    realize that buying individual stocks is about more than just buying an app   you have to both check the fundamentals which the app can help you do and find other reasons to buy a stock   if you rely on an app then you 're essentially joining everyone else using that app   you 'll make the same profit as everyone else which wo n't be much because you all share the profit opportunities with the app 's system   if you want to use someone else 's system stick with mutual funds   the app system is actually more dangerous in the long term    early in the app 's life cycle its system can produce positive returns because a small number of people are sharing the benefits of that system   as more people adopt it though the total possible returns stay the same   at some point users the app   all the possible returns are realized   then users are competing with each other for returns   the per user returns will shrink as usage grows    if you have your own system then you are competing with fewer people for the returns from it   share the fundamental analysis but pick your stocks based on other criteria   fundamental analysis will tell you if a stock is overvalued   the other criteria will tell you which undervalued stock to buy

you need to find out if the credit card has been reporting these failed automated payments as late or missed payments to your credit report to do this go to annualcreditreport.com the official site to get your free credit reports and request your report from all three bureaus if you see late or missing payments reported for the months where you made a payment but then they did an automatic payment anyway you should call up the credit card company explain the situation and ask them to retract those negative reports if they refuse you should dispute the reports directly with the credit bureaus if they have been reporting late payments even though you have been making the payments that will impact your credit much more than the fact that they closed your account   unfortunately they can turn off your credit account for any reason they like and there is n't much you can do about that find yourself another job as soon as you can get back on your feet pay off your debt and think very carefully before you open another credit card in the future do n't start a new credit card unless you can ensure that you will pay it off in full every month

a straddle is an options strategy in which one buys or sells options of the same maturity expiry date that allow the buyer or seller to profit based on how much the price of the underlying security moves regardless of the direction of price movement ie a long straddle would be you buy a call and a put at the same strike price and the same expiration date your profit would be if the underlying stock moves far enough down or then the premiums you paid for the put + call options in case one waits till expiry profit = expiry level strike price premium paid for bought options straddle

there 's no objective definition of what your house is worth between sales   if you sell it for $ 107 k then that 's the current functional definition of its worth   there is not extra money to be had because you sold it for less than it was worth   if the buyer is able to flip it for more then the value of the house effectively went up and he will pocket the difference when he sells it edit this turned out to be unexpectedly controversial so let me be more precise in my answer   i think this is important because it seems like many people misunderstand equity and how it figures or does n't into the value of their home which then leads to significant confusion and errors in what 's many people 's largest single investment at any given time there are several possible ways to put a dollar value on your home   a non exclusive list that includes some of these obviously are more official than others it would not be strange for these different values to vary by quite a bit at any given time this is what i meant in my original answer when i said there 's no objective definition of what your house is worth between sales the interesting thing and what i meant in my original answer when i wrote current functional definition of its worth is that none of these factor directly into the transaction that the op described of selling his house except for the last   using the numbers from the op 's example that means the $   wherever the op got the number $ 155 k either from one of the options on my list above or somewhere else it wo n't be directly part of the sale between him and his friend for completeness with a nod to eric 's comments on my original answer some of these numbers may indirectly influence the sale   for example the buyer typically wo n't be able to get a mortgage for a value greater than the appraised value of the house and so that might influence what he 's willing and able to bid   there may also be tax consequences if the price is artificially low like say a gift   as further below however that 's not directly relevant to answering the op 's stated question now the op seemed to believe that there is an extra $ 48 k in cash up for grabs in this scenario   that comes from the $ 155 k value that the op claims his house has and the $ 107 k price of the actual proposed sale   this is a complete misconception   when the buyer and seller sit down at closing and the title agent sums up who owes and who receives cash in this transaction the $ 155 k theoretical value will not enter into the calculation and therefore no one will pocket it subsequently however after the buyer takes possession he may sell it   if it 's true that he got a deal on the transaction at $ 107 k then he maybe able to flip it and turn a profit   but if that happens it will be in a completely separate subsequent transaction even if you look to this hypothetical second sale however the $ 155 k does n't really figure   the new owner will have to find his own buyer and they will have to agree on a price   that might happen to be $ 155 k but there 's no real reason to believe that it will or it wo n't

lots of good advice on investing already you may also want to think about two things a bausparvertrag you can set this up for different monthly saving rates you 'll get a modest interest payment and once you have saved up enough the contract is you will be eligible for a loan at a low rate however you can only use the loan for building buying or renovating real estate with interest rates as low as they are right now this is not overly attractive however depending on your salary you may qualify for subsidies and these could indeed be rather attractive this may be helpful in german a this is a subsidized saving scheme you save something every year and again get subsidies at the end of the year i think the salary thresholds where you qualify for a subsidy are a bit higher for the than for a bausparvertrag and even if you do n't qualify for a subsidy your contributions will be deducted from your taxable income i would n't invest all my leftover money in these considering that you commit yourself for the medium to long term but they might well be attractive options for at least part of your money say 20 25 of what you aim at saving every month finally as others have written banks and insurance companies exist to make money and they live off their provisions get an independent financial advisor you pay by the hour who does n't get provisions and have him help you

10 seems to be a little bit too optimistic but annually on average is doable 1 is way too little you 're doing something wrong unless you mean real return i.e. after adjustment for inflation and even then it 's not too high at any given year it may be easy or difficult but the point is that we 're talking about long term averages for example if you look at the dji for the last 30 years you 'll see a rise of 1300 give or take which annually is ~40 in the last 3 years the rise is even steeper but in the last week it is negative so it depends on your time line and the way you manage your investments you 've got to balance between stocks and bonds and cash but even if you park your money in cash you can get more than 1 right now capitol one on line savings is 1.15 and that 's with the lowest rates ever so getting 1 over time does mean that you 're doing something wrong imho

inflation and stock returns are completely different things the cpi tracks the changes in the prices of a basket of goods a consumer might buy the s&p 500 tracks the returns earned by investors in the equity of large companies   the two are very different things and not closely linked example a world without inflation consider a world in which there was no inflation   prices are fixed   should stocks return zero   certainly not   companies take raw materials and produce goods and services that have value greater than that of the raw materials   they create new wealth   this wealth becomes profit for the company which then is passed on to the owners of the company equityholders either in the form of dividends or more commonly price increases example a world with no inflation and no economic growth note that i have not implied above that companies have to grow in order for returns to outperform inflation   total stock returns depend on the current and expected profit of the firm   firms can remain the same size and continually kick out profits   total returns will be positive in this environment even if there is no growth and no inflation   if the firms pay the money out as dividends investors get a cash flow   if they retain these earnings the value of the firm 's equity increases   total returns take both types of income into account   technically the s&p 500 is not a total return index but in our current legal and corporate culture environment there is a preference for retaining profits rather than paying them out   this causes price increases risk bearing in principle if profit was assured then investors would bid up stock prices so high that profit would have to compete with the risk free rate which often is close to inflation like right now   however profit is not assured   firm profit swings around over time and constitutes a significant source of risk   we can think of the owners of the firm as being the bondholders and equityholders   these assets are structured such that almost all the profit risk is born by equityholders   we can therefore think of equityholders as being compensated for bearing the risk that would otherwise   be born by bondholders   because equityholders are bearing risk stock prices must be low enough that stocks have a positive expected return above the risk free rate which is presumably not significantly below inflation   this is true for the same reason that insurance premiums are positive people have to be compensated for bearing risk see my answer to this question for a discussion of why risk means we should expect stock prices to increase indefinitely even if inflation the s&p is not a measure of firm size or value the s&p measures the return earned by investors not the size of us companies   true if constituent companies grow and nothing else changes the index goes up but if a company shrinks a lot it gets dropped out rather than dragging the index down by the way please note that dollars put into equities are not stuck somewhere   they are passed on to the seller who then uses it to buy something even if this is a new equity issuance and the seller is the firm itself   the logic that growth of firms somehow sucks money out of usage is incorrect

there are three or four ways that a company can grow crowdfunding is a relatively new in mainstream businesses alternative financing method where people will finance a company with the expectation that they will benefit from the product or service that they provide obviously a startup has no prior income to use so it must either raise money through equity or debt people say that one must borrow contingent on their salary banks lend money based on the ability to pay the loan back plus interest   for individuals their income is their primary source of cash flow so yes it is usually the determining factor in getting a loan   for a business the key factor is future cash flows   so a business will borrow money say to buy a new asset like a factory that will be used to generate cash flows in the future so that they can pay down the debt   if the bank believes that the use of the money is going to be profitable enough that they will get their money back with interest they 'll loan the money equity investors are essentially the same but since they do n't get a guaranteed payback they only get paid through non guaranteed dividends or liquidation their risk is higher and they are looking for higher expected returns so the question i 'd have as a bank or equity investor is what are you going to do with the money   what is your business strategy what are you going to do that will make profits in the future   do you have a special idea or skill that you can turn into a profitable business   crowdfunding would be similar people are willing to give you money based on either the social or personal benefit of some product or service so any business either starts small and grows over time which is how the vast majority of businesses grow or has some special idea asset skill or something that would make a bank willing to take a risk on a huge loan i know again that people here tend to turn blind eyes on unfortunate realities but people do make giant businesses without having giant incomes the unfortunate reality is that most startups fail   which may sound bad but also keep in mind that most startups are created by people that are ok with failing   they are people that are willing to fail 9 times with the thought that the 10th one will take off and make up for the losses of the first 9    so i would say if you have some great idea or skill and a viable strategy and plan to take it to market then go for it you do n't need a huge salary to start off   you need something that you can take to market and make money   most people myself included either do not have that idea or skill to go out on their own or do n't have the courage to take that kind of risk   but do n't go in assuming all you need is a loan and you 'll be an instant millionaire   you might but the odds are very long

unless you are buying millions of dollars worth of a stock at a time your transaction is a drop in the bucket unlikely to have any effect on the stock price as ian says it 's more likely that you are just remembering the times when the price dropped after you bought if you keep careful track i suspect you will find that the price goes up more often than it goes down or at least that the stocks you buy go up as often as the average stock on the market goes up if you actually kept records and found that 's not true the most likely explanation is bad luck or that someone has placed a voodoo curse on you i suppose one could imagine other scenarios like if you regularly buy stock based on recommendations by well known market pundits you could expect to see a temporary increase in price as thousands or millions of people who hear this recommendation rush to buy and then a few days or weeks later people move on to the next recommendation the market down and the price reverts to a more normal level in that case if you 're on the tail end of the buying rush you could end up paying a premium i 'm just speculating here i have n't done a study to find if this actually happens but it sounds plausible to me

according the fscs if the bank fails fscs would refund the maximum under our rules currently Â£ 75,000 per person   any credit balance over and above this would be offset against the mortgage by the insolvency practitioner responsible for the winding up of the bank fscs would play no part in that process unless the savings were larger than the debts but then it would n't make sense to have them in a zero interest offset account so the money would not be completely lost as such whether that would count as an overpayment is an open question but perhaps a moot point anyway if the bank went under finally arguably a pension or other investment might also be better for such amounts

this is a speculative question and there 's no correct answer but there are definitely some highly likely outcomes let 's assume that the united states defaults on it 's debt it can be guaranteed that it will lose its aaa rating although we do n't know what it will drop to we know it will be aa or lower   a triple a rating implies that the issuer will never default so it can offer lower rates since there is a guarantee of safety there people will demand a higher yield for the lower perceived security so treasury yield will go up   the us dollar or at least forex rates will almost certainly fall since us treasuries will no longer be a safe haven the dollar will no longer be the safe currency it once was and so the dollar will fall the us stock market and international markets will also have a strong fall because so many institutions financial or otherwise invest in treasuries so when treasuries tumble and the us loses triple a investments will be hurt and the tendency is for investors to overreact so it is almost guaranteed that the market will drop sharply financial stocks and companies that invest in treasuries will be hurt the most a notable exception is nations themselves for example china holds over $ 1 trillion in treasuries and a us default will hurt their value but the yuan will also appreciate with respect to the dollar thus other nations will benefit and be hurt from a us default now many people expect a double dip recession worse than the crisis if the us defaults i count myself a member of this crowd nonetheless we can not say with certainty whether or not there will be another recession or even a depression we can only say that a recession is a strong possibility so basically let 's pray that washington gets its act together and raises the ceiling or else we 're in for bad times and lastly a funny quote i could end the deficit in 5 minutes    you just pass a law that says that    anytime there is a deficit of more    than 3 of gdp all sitting members of    congress are ineligible for       warren buffett

think of options as insurance an insurance company makes money by selling the policies at a rate slightly higher than the average payout   most options expire worthless this is because most options are purchased by hedge funds to hedge means taking out insurance in case your position goes against you so the sellers of options obtain a price that covers their averaged losses plus provides them with a profit for their trouble   an option has an amount that it declines in value each day called theta at the expiration date the option is worth zero if it is out of the money so it is option writers that typically make money in the options market as they are the sellers of insurance if they did n't make money selling options they would not sell them   for example the february call option on spy strike 200 traded at on since then it has in value to 0.14 the option writer currently stands to make a huge profit   so just as with insurance you generally never make money by buying insurance but the sellers of insurance tend to make money as do the writers of options   edit theta investopedia

you could try to refine your options strategy   for instance you could buy the usd 750 call you mentioned and at the same time sell short call options with a higher strike price which is above the share price level you expect that apple will trade at in one year for instance usd 1,100   by doing this you would receive the premium of the call with the higher option which in turn would help you finance buying your usd 750 the net effect of this trading strategy would be that you would give up the extra profit you would earn if apple would rose above usd 1,100 the strike price of the call option sold short your total risk would be even less than with your actual strategy in my view

ditto just to get concrete i just checked one bank in india and they say they are paying 4 on savings accounts i do n't know what you 're getting or if 4 is typical in india but it 's at least an example so if the bank pays interest based on average daily balance and you left the money in the bank for a week you 'd get = so on rs 95,000 that would be rs 73 i live in the us where typical interest on a savings account today is about 1 so an equivalent amount of money i think that would be about $ 1,500 would get of 1 or 29 cents   do n't leave the lights turned on while you do the calculations you 'll spend more on the electricity than you make on the interest addendum this suddenly reminds me i read a news story a few years ago about a man who was expecting a tax refund check from the irs of a few hundred dollars and when the check arrived it was for several million well obviously it was a mistake but he came up with the clever idea deposit the check in an interest bearing account promptly contact the irs inform them of the mistake and ask how and where to go about returning the money hope that it takes at least a few days for them to figure everything out then keep the interest accumulated on the several million dollars for the time that he had the money and as he contacted them immediately about the error they ca n't say he was trying to hide anything it was a nice try but it did n't work they demanded he send them the interest as well as the principle

there 's no demand of course there 's demand demand is infinite in the sense that everyone wants things to make their lives better sure maybe there are some people that have maxed out their credit and physically ca n't buy any more stuff but they still need to buy food clothes housing the problem is not a demand problem it is a supply side problem central banks have over levered the system to a point where investors and entrepreneurs do not know what the govt is going to do next to try to fix it is there a huge tax increase on the horizon is more reactionary legislation going to be passed many established businesses have a hard enough time keeping up with the regulations that are already on the books and in many industries such as the financial industry it is physically impossible to get through an audit without paying fines for doing something wrong because no one can follow every single rule they ve written so yes the regulatory environment is far more uncertain than it was even a decade ago let alone 30 or 40 years ago

excel has two functions you can use your question has the cd with a apr and the savings account that mentions both apr and apy so convert them both to apy to compare them the savings account apy will return more money based on the numbers in your question vs the previous part was the math part of the answer the following takes into other considerations for this case the savings account will return a larger amount of money if the conditions do n't change the cd rate is guaranteed but the savings account could change every business day the savings rate could go up or down if you expect the savings account rate to rain higher than the cd you might not want to lock into the cd if you expect the savings rate will drop then get the cd of course   there are penalties if you cash in the cd early

forget the math 's specifics for a moment here 's some principles additional housing for a renter gives you returns in the form of money additional housing for yourself pays its returns in the form of here is a nice house live in it which do you need more of   if you do n't need the money get a nicer house for yourself if you need or want the money get a modest house for yourself and either use the other house as a rental property or invest the proceeds of its sale in the stock market but under normal circumstances + + do n't expect that buying more house for yourself is a good way to increase how much money you have it 's not + + the exception being during situations where land housing value rises quickly and when that rise is not part of a housing bubble which later collapses generally long term housing values tend to be relatively stable the real returns are from the rent or what economists call imputed rent when you 're occupying it yourself

the time value of money is very important in understanding this issue   money today is worth more than money next year two years from now etc it 's a well understood economics concept and well worth reading about if you have some well time not only is money literally worth more now than later due to inflation but there is the simple fact that assuming you have money for the purpose of doing something being able to do that thing today is better than doing that same thing tomorrow   a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush gets to this rather directly having it now is better than probably having it later   would you rather have a nice meal tonight or eat beans and rice tonight and then have the same nice meal next year that 's why interest exists in part you 're offered some money now for more money later or in the case of buying a bond you 're offered more money later for some money now   the fact that people have different discount rates for money later is why the loan market can exist people with more money than they can use now have a lower discount for future money than people who really need money right now to buy a house to pay their rent whatever    so when choosing to buy a bond you look at the money you 're going to get both over the short term the coupon rate and the long term the face value and you consider whether $ 80 now is worth $ 100 in 20 years plus $ 2 per year   for some people it is for some people it is n't and that 's why the price is as it is $ 80   odds are if you have a few thousand usd you 're probably not going to be interested in this or if you have a very long term outlook there are better ways to make money over that long term   but if you 're a bank needing a secure investment that wo n't lose value or a trust that needs high stability you might be willing to take that deal

i worked for a major shoe retailer 's e commerce division   our return rate on shoes was nearly 70 shoe manufacturers do not size consistently at almost any price point customers had no idea what their size was and would often order a size up and a size down 3 pairs of shoes and return all three   they were unable to measure their feet because there are really no standard measurements for feet   we thought about a 3d scanner from feet but customers would have to come into the store for that then we 'd have to scan every shoe   shoes can be high margin but they are extremely expensive to sell online there really is no silver bullet here foot locker has nice stores and a great selection they are cash positive and ebitda profitable   if amzn cuts into any body 's shoe business my guess would be walmart target or    imo the biggest threat to is just general death of the mall but whatever model replaces malls could just as well have a fl    i think the market has dramatically this is n't sears it 's a profitable business that 's missed earnings a couple quarters i bought in and i am long

there 's no such thing as true passive income you are being paid the risk free rate to delay consumption i.e. the super low rate you are getting on savings accounts and cds and a higher rate to bear risk you will not find truly risk free investments that earn more than the types of investments you have been looking at most likely you will not keep up with inflation in risk free investments for a person who is very risk averse but wants to make a little more money than the risk free rate the solution is not to invest completely in slightly risky things   instead the best thing you can do is invest partially in a fully diversified portfolio   a diversified portfolio containing stocks bonds etc will earn you the most return for the given amount of risk   if you want very little risk put very little in that portfolio and keep the rest in your cds put 90 of your money in a cd or something and the other 10 in stocks bonds   or choose a different percentage you can also buy real assets like real estate but you will find yourself taking a different type of risk and doing a different type of work with those assets

this depends on the terms and conditions of your ira account and those of the investments you have chosen in general you are better off investing as quickly as is feasible given those terms   money in your cash account does n't earn much of a return so the quicker you get money into something earning a return the better however pay attention to the fees and costs associated with investing   if there is a per transaction fee you may want to consolidate as it may be more efficient to do so after all if you contribute $ 500 at a shot and it costs you $ 5 to make a trade you 're paying 1 off the top to make that trade if you make 11 of them versus 0.1 to make 1 so the question is do you earn that 1 back over the course of the six months   that will depend on what you are investing in    more than likely you 're going to earn more than 1 over the course of the six months so it 's probably worth investing it in pieces still in that situation but if the transaction cost is higher or the time differential lower you may have a less clear cut answer   i invest at vanguard in their funds and have no transaction fees so i have a more obvious answer invest as soon as possible you also need to consider whether you have minimums to pay attention to maybe your investment is something you can only buy whole shares of for example or you might have a much higher fee if you make small transactions   in that case you should wait until you have the minimum to make that transaction if the fee is more than the return you 'll get so the answer is make the transactions as early as you can subject to considering the fees you will pay for making them

how can they reduce the number of shares i hold they may have purchased them   you do n't say what stock it is so we can only speculate   let 's say that the stock is called penny   so they may have taken your 1600 penny shares and renamed them to 1600 shares   then they created a new $ 5 penny share and gave you shares of that in exchange for your 1600 shares   this suggests that your old shares were worth $ or less than a tenth of a cent each    as an example mylan did this in 2015 as part of their tax inversion moved official headquarters from the us to europe   they did not change the number of shares at that time but mylan is not a penny stock    this is the kind of thing that might happen in a bankruptcy    a reverse split where they give you one share in exchange for more than one share is also possible although you received an odd amount for a reverse split   usually those produce numbers   a number like sounds more like a market price as those can be bizarre

usually not the total interest but all interest accrued and unpaid to date this is called the loan payoff amount and repays the bank their principal plus the true cost of capital on that principal since your last amortized payment which is probably never since you just signed the loan papers there may also be a prepayment penalty this is something that should have been disclosed to you if it exists but it 's fairly rare in u.s. mortgages anymore   the theory is the bank got the money they paid you at the start of the loan by selling a bond package backed by your mortgage and others of similar credit history and/or about the same time a mortgage backed security by turning around and paying early you meet your obligation but the bank is now stuck with at least 10 years of quarterly coupon payments on that bond which they were expecting to pay using your mortgage interest for their trouble you would pay an additional amount that either covers their call price on the portion of the bonds used for your principal or simply buys them the time to re issue a new mortgage using your repaid principal to back the bond again in the modern housing market such a prepayment penalty is very rare because so many lenders are willing to give you a mortgage without one and so many buyers balk at the thought of having to pay more if they pay early the whole point is to pay less by paying early just something to look up in your mortgage documentation

it sounds to me like you may not be defining fundamental investing very well which is why it may seem like it does n't matter   fundamental investing means valuing a stock based on your estimate of its future profitability and thus cash flows and dividends   one way to do this is to look at the multiples you have described   but multiples are inherently backward looking so for firms with good growth prospects they can be very poor estimates of future profitability when you see a firm with ratios way out of whack with other firms you can conclude that the market thinks that firm has a lot of future growth possibilities   that 's all it could be that the market is overestimating that growth but you would need more information in order to conclude that   we call warren buffet a fundamental investor because he tends to think the market has made a mistake and overvalued many firms with crazy ratios   that may be in many cases but it does n't necessarily mean those investors are not using fundamental analysis to come up with their valuations fundamental investing is still very much relevant and is probably the primary determinant of stock prices   it 's just that fundamental investing encompasses estimating things like future growth and innovation which is a lot more than just looking at the ratios you have described

in the united states the general policy is that the irs would consider it income when you have access to the money i work for a company that has a contract with another company near the end of the year i turn in a time card that has my hours that i worked as of that date because they do n't pay me until early january the money on the check is counted in the new year i could n't touch the money until they issued the check if they had paid me on december 31st it would have counted as the old year even if i only had a short window to have access to it before the year ended it would even count as old year money if i held on to the december check but did n't deposit it until march so it would become income when you could use it so if you could access it via a check or debit card or transfer it to the bank it is now income of course that is in the united states you would need to see what the situation is in singapore the edge cases always depend on the country

# 502686
thanks for your question definitely pay the car down as soon as possible reasoning to follow in fact i would go even further and recommend the following why 1 make money risk free the key here is risk free by paying down the loan now you can avoid paying interest on the additional amount paid toward principal risk free imagine this scenario if you walked into a bank and they said if you give us $ 100 we 'll give you $ 103 back today would you do it that is exactly what you get to do by not paying interest on the remaining loan principal 2 the spread you might make by investing is not as large as you may think let 's assume that by investing you can make a market return of 10 however these are future cash flows so let 's discount this for inflation to a real 8 return then let 's assume that after fees and taxes this would be a 7 real after tax return you also have to remember that this money is at risk in the market and may not get this return in some years assuming that your friend 's average tax rate on earned income is 25 this means that he 'd need to earn $ 400 pre tax to pay the after tax payment of $ 300 so this is a 4 risk free return after tax compared to a 7 average after tax return from the market but one where the return is at risk the equivalent after tax risk free return from the market think t bills is much lower than 7 you are also reducing risk by paying the car loan off first in a few other ways which is a great way to increase peace of mind first since cars decline in value over time you are minimizing the possibility that you will eventually end up under water on the loan where the loan balance is greater than the value of the car this also gives you more flexibility in terms of being able to sell the car at any point if desired additionally if the car breaks down and must be replaced you would not need to continue making payments on the old loan of if your friend loses his job he would own the car outright and would not need to make payments finally ideally you would only be investing in the market when you intend to leave the money there for 5 + years otherwise you might need to pull money out of the market at a bad time remember annual market returns vary quite a bit but over 5 10 year periods they are much more stable unfortunately most people do n't keep cars 5 10 + years so you are likely to need the money back for another car more frequently than this if you are pulling money out of the market every 5 10 years you are more likely to need to pull money out at a bad time 3 killing off the buy now pay later mindset will result in long term financial benefits stop paying interest on things that go down in value save up and buy them outright and invest the extra money into things that generate income dividends this is a good long term habit to have people also tend to be more prudent when considering the total cost of a purchase rather than just the monthly payment because it feels like more money when you buy outright as a gut check for whether this is a good idea here is an example that dave ramsey likes to use suppose that your friend did not have the emergency fund and also did not have the car loan and owned the car outright in that case would your friend take out a title   loan on the car in order to have an emergency fund i think that a lot of people would say no which may be a good indicator that it is wise to reduce the emergency fund in order to wipe out the debt rather than maintaining both

the first 3 are the same as owning stock in a company would be measured in shares and would constitute some percentage of the overall shares outstanding if there are 100 shares in the company in total then owning 80 shares is owning 80 is the same as owning 80 of the common stock this would be the typical ownership case though there can also be restricted stock as something to note here convertible debt would likely carry interest charges as well as the choice at the end of becoming stock in the company in this case until the conversion is done the stock is n't issued and thus is n't counted taking the above example one could have a note that could be worth 10 shares but until the conversion is done the debt is still debt some convertible debt could carry options or warrants for the underlying stock as there was the berkshire convertible notes years ago that carried a negative interest rate that was studied in the negative coupon bond if you want an example here options would have the right but not the obligation to buy the stock where there are incentive stock options to research this in more depth in this case one could choose to not exercise the option and thus no stock changes hands this is where some companies will experience dilution of ownership as employees and management may be given options that put more shares out to the public issuing debt would n't change the ownership and is n't direct ownership unless the company goes through a restructuring where the creditors become the new stock holders in the case of a chapter 11 situation in the us note that this is n't really investing in a small business as much as it is making a loan to the company that will be paid back in cash if the company runs into problems then the creditor could try to pursue the assets of the company to be repaid

from indian context there are a number of factors that are influencing the economic condition and the exchange rate interest rate etc are reflection of the situation i shall try and answer the question through the above indian example india is running a budget deficit of 4 odd for last 6 7 years which means that is spending more than their revenue collection this money is not in the system so the govt has to print the money either the direct 4 or the interest it has to pay on the money it borrows to cover the 4 do n't confuse this with us printing post 2008 after printing the supply of inr is more compared to usd in the market inr is current a c convertible value of inr usd falls in simplistic terms there is another impact of this printing it increases the money supply in domestic market leading to inflation and overall price rise to contain this price rise reserve bank of india rbi increases the interest rates and increases compulsory reserve ratio thus trying to pull lock up money so that overall money supply decreases but there is a limit to which rbi can do this as overall growth rate keeps falling as money is more expensive to borrow to invest the above in simplistic term how this is working however there are many factors in economy and the above should be treated as it is intended to a simplistic view only

based on past case law a check made payable to qualified charity and delivered e.g. placed in the mail on 12/31 would count as delivered as it is out of the hands of the donor would fall under the constructive receipt doctrine however for non charitable gifts e.g. gifts to family members it is the date the check is cashed honored by the receiving bank   this is important as the annual gift exclusion is just that annual   therefore if i gift my child $ 14,000 by writing a check on but they deposit it on then i have used my annual gift exclusion for 2015 and not 2014   this means i could not gift them anything further in 2015 btw the annual gift amount is for all gifts cash and non cash   most people do n't seem to realize this   if i give $ 14,000 of cash to my child and then also give them christmas gifts with a value of $ 1,000 i have exceeded my annual gift exclusion to that child   usually there are ways around this issue as i can give $ 14,000 to each and every person i want and if married my spouse can do the same   this allows us to give $ 14,000 from each of us to each child plus $ 14,000 from each of us to their spouse if married and $ 14,000 from each of us to each of their children if they have any

dollar cost averaging is beneficial if you do n't have the money to make large investments but are able to add to your holding over time if you can buy the same monetary amount at regular intervals over time your average cost per share will be lower than the stock 's average value over that time this wo n't necessarily get you the best price but it will get you on the whole a good price and will enable you to increase your holdings over time if you 're doing frequent trading on a highly volatile stock you do n't want to use this method a better strategy is to buy the dips know the range and place limit orders toward the bottom of the range then place limit orders to sell toward the high end of the range if you do it right you might be able to build up enough money to buy and sell increasing numbers of shares over time but like any frequent trader you 'll have to deal with transaction fees you 'll need to be sure the fees do n't eat all your profit

that depends really generally speaking though roth iras are the place for stock market mutual fund investing all the off the wall or not so off the wall things like real estate investments or buying up gold or whatever other ideas you hear from people they may be good or bad or whatnot but your roth ira is maybe not the best place for that sort of thing   the whole philosophy behind iras is to deliberately set aside money for the future anything reasonable will work for this explore interesting investment ideas with today 's money not tomorrow 's money that being said at your age i would go for the riskier options within what 's available   if i were in your situation and i have been recently i would lean toward low fee mutual funds classified as growth funds   my own personal opinion this is not advice is that small cap international funds are the place to be for young folks that 's a generalized opinion based on my feel for the world but i do n't think i 'm personally competent to start making specific stock picks so mutual funds makes sense to me in that i can select the fund that generally aligns with my sense of things and assume that their managers will make reasonably sound decisions within that framework of course that assumption has to be backed up with reputation of the specific mf company and the comparative performance of the fund relative to other funds in the same sector as to the generalized question how else can you work toward financial stability and independence outside of your roth ira find ways to boost your earning potential over time and buy a house before the next bubble within the next 18 months i 'm guessing

the current stock price you 're referring to is actually the price of the last trade   it is a historical price but during market hours that 's usually mere seconds ago for very liquid stocks whereas the bid and ask are the best potential prices that buyers and sellers are willing to transact at the bid for the buying side and the ask for the selling side   but think of the bid and ask prices you see as tip of the iceberg prices   that is the bid is an indication that there are potential buyers bidding $ for up to 200 shares   their bids are the highest currently bid and there are others in line behind with lower bid prices   so the bid you 're seeing is actually the best bid price at that moment   if you entered a market order to sell more than 200 shares part of your order would likely be filled at a lower price the ask is an indication that there are potential sellers asking $ for up to 1000 shares   their ask prices are the lowest currently asked and there are others in line behind with higher ask prices   so the ask you 're seeing is the best asking price at that moment   if you entered a market order to buy more than 1000 shares part of your order would likely be filled at a higher price a transaction takes place when either a potential buyer is willing to pay the asking price or a potential seller is willing to accept the bid price or else they meet in the middle if both buyers and sellers change their orders note there are primarily two kinds of stock exchanges   the one i just described is a typical order driven matched bargain market and perhaps the kind you 're referring to the other kind is a quote driven over the counter market where there is a market maker as johnfx already mentioned   in those cases the spread between the bid ask goes to the market maker as compensation for making a market in a stock   for a liquid stock that is easy for the market maker to turn around and buy sell to somebody else the spread is small narrow   for illiquid stocks that are harder to deal in the spread is larger wide to compensate the market maker having to potentially carry the stock in inventory for some period of time during which there 's a risk to him if it moves in the wrong direction     finally if you wanted to buy 1000 shares you could enter a market order in which case as described above you 'll pay $   if you wanted to buy your shares at no more than $ instead i.e. the so called current price then you would enter a limit order for 1000 shares at $   and more to the point your order would become the new highest bid price until somebody else accepts your bid for their shares   of course there 's no guarantee that with a limit order that you will get filled your order could expire at the end of the day if nobody accepts your bid

yes this will reduce your total interest but not by much scenario 1 you run up bills for the month totaling $ 750 and then at the end of the month you get paid and pay $ 750 scenario 2 you pay $ 750 at the beginning of the month then over the course of the month you run up bills totaling $ 750 assume you have carryover debt of over $ 750 so you do n't have a credit balance at any point either way the net change in your balance for the month is zero assuming you spent about the same amount of money each day the difference in your average daily balance will be $ 750 if you 're paying 18 i think that 's a fairly typical credit card rate that 's 1 1/2 per month so the difference in interest will be about $ 10 note this is the most extreme case the difference between paying on the first day of the billing period and paying on the last day of the billing period and assuming that you pay all your bills by credit card so in real life the difference in the interest will probably be less you 're talking about a technique to save maybe five bucks a month i suppose every dollar helps but the real solution is to get your credit cards paid off so you 're not paying any interest

do n't use a credit repair agency they are scams one of the myriad of ways in which they work is by setting you up with a bogus loan which they will report you as paying on time they 'll pretend to be a used car dealer or some other credit based merchant for a time this will actually work this is called false reporting the problem is the data clearinghouses are not stupid and eventually realize some hole in the wall car dealer with no cars on the lot yes they do physical inspections as part of the process just sometimes they 're a little slow about it is reporting trade lines worth millions of dollars per year it 's a major problem in the industry but eventually that business loses its fraudulent reporting ability those trade lines get revoked and your account gets flagged for a fraud investigation the repair agency has your money and you still do n't have good credit bad news if this all goes down while you 're trying to close on a house you 're better off trying to settle your debts usually for 50 or declaring bankruptcy altogether the latter is n't so bad if you 're in a stable home because you wo n't be able to get an apartment for a while credit cards or a good deal on auto financing   ed i just saw what one agency was charging and can tell you declaring bankruptcy costs only a few hundred dollars more than the repair agency and is 100 guaranteed to get you predictable results as long as you name all your debts up front and are n't getting by student loans and considering you ca n't stomach well guess what now you 'll have a lawyer to deal with them for you anything you accomplish through an agency will eventually be reversed because it 's fraudulent but through bankruptcy your credit will start improving within two years the tradeoff being that you wo n't be able to get a mortgage at all or apartment easily during that so find a place to down for a few years before you declare

of course you 've already realized that some of that is that smaller estates are more common than larger estates   but it seems unlikely that there are four times as many estates between $ 10 and $ 11 million as above that range    people who expect to die with an estate subject to inheritance tax tend to prepare    i do n't know how common it is but if the surviving member of a couple then the new spouse gets a separate exemption   and of course spouses inherit from spouses without tax   in theory this could last indefinitely   in practice it is less likely   but if a married couple has $ 20 million the first spouse could leave $ 15 million to the second and $ 5 million to other heirs   the second spouse could leave $ 10 million to a third spouse after and another $ 5 million to children with the first spouse   all without triggering the estate tax    people can put some of their estate into a trust   this can allow the heirs to continue to control the money while not paying inheritance tax   supposedly ford of ford motor company took that route    another common strategy is to give the maximum without gift tax each year   that 's at least $ 14k per donor and recipient per year   so a married couple with two kids can transfer $ 56k per year   plus $ 56k for the kids spouses   and if there are four grandchildren that 's another $   great grandchildren count too   that 's more than a million every five years   so given ten years to prepare parents can transfer $ 2 million out of the estate and to the heirs without tax    consider the case of two wealthy siblings   they 've each maxed out their gifts to their own heirs   so they agree to max out their gifts to their sibling 's heirs   this effectively doubles the transfer amount without tax implication    also realize that they can assets at the current market rate   so if a rich person has an asset that is currently undervalued it may make sense to transfer it immediately as a gift   this will use up some of the estate exemption   but if you 're going to transfer the asset eventually you might as well do so when the value is optimal for your purpose    these are just the easy things to do   if someone wants they can do more complicated things that make it harder for the irs to track value    for example the bezos family invested in amazon.com when jeff bezos was starting it   as a result his company could survive capital losses that another company might not   the effect of this was to make him rich and his parents richer than they were   but he wo n't pay inheritance tax until his parents actually transfer the estate to him and i believe they actually put it in a charitable trust   if his company had failed instead he still would have been supported by the capital provided by his parents while it was open e.g. his salary   but he would n't have paid inheritance tax on it    there are other examples of the same pattern   fred smith of fedex donald trump bill gates of microsoft etc   the prime value of the estate was not in its transfer but in working together while alive or through a family trust   the child 's company became much more valuable as a result of a parent 's wealth   and in two of those examples the child was so successful that the parent became richer as a result   so the parent 's estate does count   meanwhile another company might fail leaving the estate below the threshold despite a great deal of parental support    and those are n't even   those children started real companies and offered their parents real investment opportunities   a family that wants to do so can do a lot more with arrangements   of course the irs may be looking for some of them    the point being that the estate might be more than $ 11 million earlier but the parents can find ways to reduce it below the inheritance tax exemption by the time that they die

i would say that you should keep in mind one simple idea   leverage was the principal reason for the 2008 financial meltdown   for a great explanation on this i would highly recommend michael lewis book the big short which does an excellent job in spelling out the case against being highly leveraged as dale m. pointed out losses are greatly magnified by your degree of leverage that being said there 's nothing wrong with being highly leveraged as a short term strategy and i want to emphasize the short term part   if for instance an opportunity arises where you are n't presently liquid enough to cover then you could use leverage to at least stay in the game until your cash situation improves enough to de leverage the investment   this can be a common strategy in equities where you simply substitute the term leverage for the term margin   margin positions can be scary because a rapid downturn in the market can cause margin calls that you 're unable to cover and that 's disastrous interestingly it was the 2008 financial crisis which lead to the undoing of bernie madoff   many of his clients were highly leveraged in the markets and when everything began to unravel they turned to him to cash out what they thought they had with him to cover their margin calls only to then discover there was no money   not being able to meet the redemptions of his clients forced madoff to come clean about his scheme and the rest is history the banks themselves were over leveraged sometimes at a rate of 50 1 and any little hiccup in the payment stream from borrowers caused massive losses in the portfolios which were magnified by this leveraging   this is why you should view leverage with great caution   it is very very tempting but also fraught with extreme peril if you do n't know what you 're getting into or do n't have the wherewithal to manage it if anything should go wrong in real estate i could use the leverage of my present cash reserves to buy a bigger property with the intent of de leveraging once something else i have on the market sells   but that 's only a wise play if i am certain i can unwind the leveraged position reasonably soon seriously know what you 're doing before you try anything like this   too many people have been by not understanding the pitfalls of leverage simply because they 're too by the profits they think they can make   be careful my friend

if you engage in any kind of dangerous activity the training courses will often state that an accident is not the result of a simple error   examples of this include and motorcycle training   properly maintained equipment and training will mitigate many emergencies   recently my dive buddy was 60 down and ran out of air due to a tank o ring failure   she did not panic and all of the dive team rallied to get her to the surface without anyone getting hurt or even coming close to it financial are similar   in some cases a single event triggers an avalanche of events that leads to tragedy   for example hard economic times may lead to an employer doing 5 pay cuts across the board   however they also cut bonuses and other ancillary pay items   this leads to a real cut of 20 25 of income   leading a true cash flow emergency   as such cutbacks are needed and this might put a strain on an already shaky relationship this leads to that relationship ending requiring more cash   perhaps a car dies in this process or some household item needs repairing   sure one can borrow money but this tends to the avalanche rather than solve it     having a low debt and a liquid emergency fund stops the avalanche in its tracks in the case cited above issues would have been solved if the person lived off of 50 of their income rather than the way most people live paycheck to paycheck   also if there were savings for the car repair then that becomes a pain but not a true stress think of a liquid emergency fund as properly maintained equipment   it allows you to build a financial life on a solid foundation    in my own case i attempted to live and invest without an emergency fund   it just did not work   i often had to liquidate investments at in opportune times and could never really hold onto money   with the foundation of an emergency fund one can build a prosperous life for one 's self you are welcome to try it your way but if you fall hopefully you will remember this answer and build your foundation first

yep you 're single you 're possibly still a dependent on your parent 's taxes in lieu of rent and you 're finally bringing home bacon instead of bacon bits welcome to the working world let 's say your gross salary is the u.s. median of $ 50,000 with bi weekly checks 26 a year common practice you 're getting $ per paycheck in the 2013 percentage method tax tables here 's how your federal withholding is calculated as a single person paid biweekly federal taxes are computed the amount up to a is taxed at x% then the amount between a and b is taxed at y% so if you make $ c between a and b the tax is + c the amount is included in the base amount for ease of calculation back to our example let 's say you 're getting $ gross wages per check that puts you in the 25 marginal bracket you pay the sum of all lesser brackets which is the base amount of the 25 bracket plus the 25 marginal rate on every dollar that falls within the bracket that 's + .25 = + .25 = + = $ per paycheck the effective tax rate on the total amount as if you were being charged a flat tax is and this is just for the federal income tax add to this ma state income taxes 5.25 flat tax fica aka medicare 1.45 flat and aka social security 6.2 up to a wage base that $ 50k does n't even approach and your effective tax rate on each dollar you earn is + 5.25 + 1.45 + 6.2 = this does n't include any state unemployment taxes that may be withheld separately but as the rate i come up with is pretty darn close to what you 've figured meaning i slightly overestimated your gross income and thus your effective tax rate my bet is that 's either employer paid in ma or it 's just part of ma state income tax it gets better at least at the federal level the amount of your state income taxes is tax deductible at the federal level if you itemize your deductions that may not be a factor for you as you 'd have to come up with more than $ of other tax deductible expenses to make itemizing the better option than taking the standard deduction big ticket items are mortgage expenses other than principal payments hospital stays such as for or major accident and state and local taxes such as sales property and income if you can claim yourself as a dependent meaning your parents ca n't then $ 150 of each check $ 3,900 of your annual salary is no longer taxed for federal withholding lowering the amount of money taxed at the 25 marginal rate you effectively save $ biweekly $ annually in taxes get married and file jointly and your spouse her personal exemption and an extra standard deduction amount if you do n't itemize go on your taxes the tax rates for married couples filing jointly are also lower they 're currently calculated or were in 2012 to be the same as if two equal earners were to file separately so if your spouse does n't work your taxes on the single income are calculated at the rates you 'd get if you earned half as much it does n't work out to half the taxes but it is a significant marriage advantage have kids and each one is another little $ 3,900 tax write off it 's nowhere near the cost of having or raising the child but it helps and having kids is n't about the money owning a home making charitable deductions having medical expenses etc are a toss up the magic number in 2013 is $ for a married couple $ for a single person if your mortgage interest insurance premiums property taxes medical expenditures charitable donations any contributions from your take home pay to a tax deferred savings account typically these accounts are paid into by your employer as a pre tax deduction and never show up as taxable income but you could just as easily move money from your take home pay into tax deferred savings and any other tax deductible payments add up to more than 12 large then itemize if not take your standard deduction as a single taxpayer just starting out in life you probably do n't have any of these types of expenditures certainly not enough to give up the sd i did the math on my own taxes in 2012 and was surprised at how little the government actually gets of my paycheck when all 's said and done remember back in the summer of 2012 when everyone was mad at romney for making millions and only paying an effective income tax rate of 14 which was compared to the middle class 's marginal rate of 25 28 well my family of 3 living on a little more than the median income from one earner me taking the married standard deduction three personal exemptions and a little extra for student loan interest paid an effective federal income tax rate of something like 3.5 of course the fica and ss taxes do n't allow any deductions not even for retirement savings so add in the 4.2 ss in 2012 and 1.45 fica and the full federal gimme was more like 9 10

there is no penalty for foreigners but rather a 30 mandatory income tax withholding from distributions from 401(k plans you will get it back when you file the income tax return for the year and calculate your actual tax liability including any penalties for a   premature distribution from the 401(k plan you are of course a us citizen and not a foreigner and thus are what the irs calls a us person which includes not just us citizens but permanent immigrants to the us as well as some temporary visa holders but it is entirely possible that your 401(k plan does not know this explicitly this irs web page tells 401(k plan administrators who can i presume is a us person    a retirement plan distribution is presumed to be made to a u.s. person only if the withholding agent a payment that does not meet these rules is presumed to be made to a foreign person   your ssn is presumably on file with the 401(k plan administrator but perhaps you are retired into a country that does not have an income tax treaty with the us and that 's the mailing address that is on file with your 401(k plan administrator if so the 401(k administrator is merely following the rules and not presuming that you are a us person so how can you get around this non presumption the irs document cited above and the links therein say that if the 401(k plan has on file a w-9 form that you submitted to them and the w-9 form includes your ssn then the 401(k plan has valid documentation to associate the distribution as being made to a us person that is the 401(k plan does not need to make any that you are a us person has been proved beyond reasonable doubt so to answer your question will i be penalized when i later start a regular monthly withdrawal from my 401(k yes you will likely have mandatory 30 income tax withholding on your regular 401(k distributions unless you have established that you are    a us person to your 401(k plan by submitting a w-9 form to them

it 's important because it shows that the amount you owe does not decrease linearly with each payment and you gain equity as a correspondingly slower rate at the beginning of the loan and faster at the end this has to be figured in when considering refinancing or when you sell the place and pay off the mortgage it also shows why making extra payments toward principal if your loan permits doing so is so advantageous unlike a normal payment that lowers the whole curve by a notch reducing the length of time over which interest is due and thus saving you money in the long run possible lost costs of course

after searching a bit and talking to some investment advisors in india i got below information so thought of posting it so that others can get benefited this is specific to indian mutual funds not sure whether this is same for other markets even currency used for examples is also indian rupee a mutual fund generally offers two schemes dividend and growth the dividend option does not re invest the profits made by the fund though its investments instead it is given to the investor from time to time in the growth scheme all profits made by the fund are back into the scheme this causes the nav to rise over time the impact on the nav the nav of the growth option will always be higher than that of the dividend option because money is going back into the scheme and not given to investors   how does this impact us we do n't gain or lose per se by selecting any one scheme either we make the choice to get the money regularly dividend or at one go growth if we choose the growth option we can make money by selling the units at a high nav at a later date if we choose the dividend option we will get the money time and again as well as avail of a higher nav though the nav here is not as high as that of a growth option say there is a fund with an nav of rs 18 it declares a dividend of 20 this means it will pay 20 of the face value the face value of a mutual fund unit is 10 its nav in this case is 18 so it will give us rs 2 per unit if we own 1,000 units of the fund we will get rs 2,000 since it has paid rs 2 per unit the nav will fall from rs 18 to rs 16 if we invest in the growth option we can sell the units for rs 18 if we invest in the dividend option we can sell the units for rs 16 since we already made a profit of rs 2 per unit earlier what we must know about dividends the dividend is not guaranteed if a fund declared dividends twice last year it does not mean it will do so again this year we could get a dividend just once or we might not even get it this year remember though declaring a dividend is solely at the fund 's discretion the is not certain nor is the amount fixed

are you interested in your rented home here in singapore if you are struggling with financial difficulties you can apply for a renovation loan offered by banks most banks in singapore offer renovation loans and home loans only to those who own a property it is very hard to find a renovation loan for a rented home   home loans for renovation   you can take a home loan for your rented property and top up your home loan to finance your renovation project if you already have a home loan all you need to do is ask your bank representative to add extra financing to your home home for renovation purpose applying for a home loan for a rented property is simple you can use an online loan calculator and compare home loans provided for a rented property according to your repayment capacity and financial requirements you can choose a home loan and use it for renovation make sure you have a good credit score while applying so that your home loan gets approved easily   personal loans for renovation   if you are not able to find too many home loans or renovation loans for rented property you need not worry have you considered taking a personal loan to make awesome home improvement measures that âs right you can apply for a personal loan and use the funds to renovate your the best thing about a personal loan is that a lender does not enquire about the purpose for your loan application so you can use your personal loan for any of your needs   eligibility criteria for personal loans   the general criteria to be qualified for a personal loan in singapore are the applicant should be 21 to 65 years old the applicant should be a or a permanent resident or a foreigner the minimum income requirement for a or pr is generally p.a and p.a for a foreigner   when are personal loans ideal for renovation   there are a few situations when a personal loan is the best option for renovating your rented property many banks give personal loans with attractive promotions such as interest free loan for a certain period you can take this loan and even repay the full amount before the zero interest period expires this will help you save efficiently on your renovation project the minimum income required to secure a home loan is generally higher than the income requirement for a personal loan hence a personal loan is a better option a home loan generally gives a higher sum of money than a personal loan this high amount is suitable for a construction project but will be excessive for renovation work therefore it makes more sense to apply for a personal loan to give the perfect makeover to the in your home the approval process for a home loan is typically very lengthy personal loan applications get approved within 24 hours by most banks in singapore so now you can apply for a personal loan without any tension and remodel your to have a party at home sweet home personal loan rates are generally lower than home loan rates you can refurbish your living space by paying your loan at an interest rate not more than 4 now you would have got a fair idea about how to finance your work always remember to enquire about every loan âs terms and conditions never sign any loan contract without being absolutely clear about the loan âs features

in addition to having separate income for federal and state tax purposes things can get really complicated if you ever have capital gains and losses suppose you sell taxable stocks for a loss of $ 5000 and meanwhile have capital gains of $ 1000 in your hsa from the federal perspective the gains in the hsa do n't exist so you deduct $ 3000 of the loss and then carry over the remaining $ 2000 however from the state perspective $ 1000 of the capital loss went to canceling out the gains in the hsa therefore you only carry over $ 1000 assuming you continue to have losses and gains this will carry on forever you 'll have to track completely independent sets of gains and losses and carryover losses for federal and state purposes forever even if you no longer use the hsa therefore i 'd recommend not investing hsa proceeds at all if you live in a state that does n't recognize hsas it 's just too complicated to be worth it especially since your provider wo n't track any of this for you

i wish that were the case he did things that had one of my own employees done it i would have fired them he was is able to act with impunity because his boss just wants things done he gets them done but there are often problems things need to be explained upwards and downwards confusion and resentment ensue and people are not communicated with who have active relevant roles in things that need to be communicated about

maybe it would turn into an oligopoly on it 's own but regulation as that pervasive is what i 'm trying to avoid here   i advocate worker co ops as the best examples for these firms because they actually allow a sense of welfare taken up by the workers who can self provide with actual trades and because their co ownership allows a voluntary loophole in minimum wage laws you get a real chance to prove adam smith 's theory of flexible prices and wages based on economic activity   with self provided welfare the government can pull out of both transfer payments as well as financial regulations because these markets have become more differentiated to a diversity of opinions so government can step back and focus on its more important role of researcher and developer which it tends to do better at than other roles   firms ca n't do this if they are breaking even like they would in perfect competition

i 'm not sure how this gets entered in turbotax but this income from the company should be included in the schedule c or c ez line 1 gross receipts total along with all of your 1099-misc income from your business and any other income that your business took in you do n't need a 1099 from them and the irs does n't care at least from your perspective if you got a 1099 or not in fact they probably expect you to have some income   we do n't know why the company chose not to issue 1099 forms but luckily it is n't your concern you can fill out your tax return properly without it   note this answer assumes that you did n't have any tax withheld from your checks from this company if you did have tax withheld you 'll need to insist on a 1099 to show that

in response to one of the comments you might be interested in owning the new home as a rental property for a year   you could flip this thinking and make the current home into a rental property for a period of time 1 year seems to be the consensus consult an accountant familiar with real estate this will potentially allow for a 1031 exchange into another property although i   believe that property ca n't then be a primary residence all potentially not worth the complication for the tax savings but figured i 'd throw it out there also the 1031 exchange defers taxes until some point in the future in which you finally sell the for cash

depends on how the money is invested within the 401k but in general prices move both up and down with a long bias toward up   think of it this way with fund shares priced lower now you are getting shares cheaper than when you entered the plan so this dip is actually working in your favor as long as you are comfortable trusting that long term view and trusting the funds your 401k money is going into believe me it 's even when you 're nearer your target retirement date and a 10 dip may be six figures but it 's all theoretical until you actually start drawing the money back out and you have to learn to accept some volatility as part of the trade off   for getting returns better than bonds

all the other answers posted thus far discuss matters from the perspective of us tax laws and are unanimous in declaring that what the op wants to do is indeed a very bad idea i fully agree it is a bad idea from the perspective of us tax laws and is likely a bad idea from the perspective of indian tax laws too but what the op wants to do is   or used to be common practice in india in more recent times india has created a permanent account number pan number for each taxpayer for income tax purposes and each bank account or investment must have the owner 's or first named owner 's in case of a joint account pan number associated with it   this most likely has decreased the popularity of such arrangements or has led to new being used the op has not indicated the residence and citizenship of his family or his own status for that matter but if they are all indian citizens resident in india and are then there might be one mechanism for doing what the op wants to do apply for a pan number in the name of the hindu undivided family and use this number to carry out the investments in the name of the hindu undivided family   there presumably are similar statuses for undivided families for other religions but i am not familiar with them there are lots of matters here which are more legal questions than personal finance questions e.g. if the op is a us tax resident then the family presumably will not be able to claim hindu undivided family status since the op has been divided from the family for tax purposes or so i think even if status is available the op might not be able to act as the while his father is alive and so on   consultation with tax lawyers not just chartered accountants in india is certainly advisable

you 're circling around the answer   the only real difference between a loddar and a privately issued promissory note is that the loddar is issued by a recognized third party with better credit credibility the whole merchant priest farmer cartel thing    private entities absolutely can and do issue their own promises to pay and accept them and in turn rely on those promises to make other promises it 's what you do when you charge something to a credit card on the basis of your employer 's promise to pay you charge new tires the tire store promises to pay its employees based on your cc company 's promise to pay the tire store which is based on your promise to pay the credit card company which is based on your employer 's promise to pay you which is based on your employer 's contracts with its customers and so on   in fact often as not the whole chain never actually gets reconciled with printed cash the central bank never has to print or even know about these transactions it 's just checks and electronic transfers promises all the way down maybe with occasional cash withdrawals for popcorn at the movies or to tip the or something    that does n't mean it 's not real money it absolutely is those promises are buying groceries and tires and making mortgage payments and paying dentist bills and getting people to dig up stuff out of mines that will be fashioned into ipads and all kinds of stuff   where this hurts most people in the brain is that they kind of accept dollar bills as and intrinsically valuable so trying to explain in reverse how they are the same as promissory notes or credit certificates is like trying to convince them that a plane ticket is the same as an airplane which is obviously not true    that 's why i started with this imaginary world without money if you let go of any and stop trying to think through the analogies and do n't read it trying to look for the outcome conclusions if you just read it and follow the story through it is obvious that the only intrinsic difference in that imaginary world between apple certificates loddars and privately issued ious is the credibility of the   trying to understand this stuff via analogy will make your head spin taking it all the way back to the thread topic and the question at the top of the page what makes it so difficult is the tendency and mental impulse to money as a thing that is somewhere and therefore has to go somewhere    but that 's an intrinsically and substantially imperfect analogy which is what makes it hard to explain to a five year old and you ca n't make the reality fit that analogy and stay sane even if you refuse to accept all this abstraction and insist on only doing transactions with physical cash or gold pieces the value of those markers is still 100 contingent on everyone accepting that everyone else will continue to believe that everyone else will continue to accept that currency   money is essentially a promise that other people will keep instead of giving you food your employer gives you a universal gift certificate that you can redeem anywhere and everyone else will accept it because they can in turn redeem it anywhere else the only difference between using a bank draft or printed dollar bill versus writing a promise to make good yourself is the credibility of the issuer    that 's a really difficult premise for most people to accept because it 's invisible and abstract and seems to conflict with tangible interactions you 've been doing all your life so we have this sort of tendency to try and force the reality to fit preconceived conceptual analogies like someone who keeps rejecting explanations of how airplanes can fly because that still does n't explain how metal can be lighter than air it 's demanding that the reality must fit a hypothesis that does n't apply    hope that helps

gt;are you saying they did commit fraud but it 's hard too pin on any one person you say there is little evidence there was fraud but that it 's too hard to prove there was fraud so what did they do if it was n't fraud   i am saying both i am saying that as a general matter criminal fraud is difficult to prove and expensive to litigate fraud requires intent you have to know or reasonably know that what you are doing is fraudulent and you do it anyway proving that mens rea is extremely difficult in this situation risky does not mean fraudulent the entire market was bundling mortgage backed securities fannie mae and freddie mac government backed entities were the largest buyers of mbs   the point is that if the banks honestly believed that they mbs were secure and the regulators at the time did not see a problem with them then how can you prove criminal fraud we are only displaying hindsight bias because the subprime market did indeed implode and it did affect the wider mortgage market and the economy but it was n't known that would happen at the time no financial models projected that everything would fail   you can blame lack of foresight or whatever but risky losses is not criminal corporations are allowed the business judgment rule which is arguably the strongest presumption in all of law there were bad models but they were n't fraudulent    now there could have been fraud in certain circumstances but in no way was it systematic it was bad modeling and bad economics   again bernanke has multiple bernanke saying there was no problem how can the bank 's actions be fraudulent when the top regulator is saying nothing is wrong and the market is working as intended

theoretically yes you can only buy or sell whole shares which is why you still have shares in your account you ca n't sell that fraction on the open market this is especially true for voting stock stock which gives you voting rights in company decisions makes each stock one vote so effectively whomever controls the majority of one stock gets that vote however various stock management policies on the part of the shareholder brokerage firm or the issuing company can result in you owning fractional shares perhaps the most common is a retirement account or other forward planning account in such situations it 's the dollar amount that counts when you deposit money you expect the money to be invested in your chosen mix of mutual funds and other instruments if the whole shares rule were absolute and you wanted to own for instance berkshire hathaway stock and you were contributing a few hundred a month it could take you your entire career of your contributions sitting in a money market account essentially earning nothing before you could buy even one share you are virtually guaranteed in such situations to end up owning fractions of shares in an investment account in these situations it 's usually the fund manager 's firm that actually holds title to the full share part of a pool they maintain for exactly this situation and your fractional ownership percentage is handled purely with accounting they give you your percentage of the dividends when they 're paid out and marginal additional investments increase your actual holdings of the share until you own the whole thing if you divest the firm sells the share of which you owned a fraction or just holds onto it for the next guy fractionally investing in the stock no need to pay unnecessary broker fees and pays you that fraction of the sale price   another is dividend reinvestment the company may indicate that instead of paying a cash dividend they will pay a stock dividend or you yourself may indicate to the broker that you want your dividends given to you as shares of stock which the broker will acquire from the market and place in your account other common situations include stock splits that are n't x companies often are n't looking to halve their stock price by offering a two for one split they may think a smaller figure like 50 or even smaller is preferable to fine tune their stock price and thus p e ratio and eps figures similar to industry competitors or to companies with similar market capitalization in such situations they can offer a split that 's x for y with x > y like a or similar these are relatively uncommon but they do happen home depot 's first stock split in 1987 was a other ratios are rare and msft has only ever been split 2-for-1 so it 's most likely that you ended up with the extra sixth of a share through dividend reinvestment or a broker policy allowing fractional share investment

from what these people are saying it is impossible for you to put $ 5,500 in if it were a roth though because the money has to be taxed you are correct that this is wrong   you can still put $ 5,500 in a roth the tax payment comes when you file not when you make the investment   this is when the roth is better than a traditional ira when you can invest the max either way   yes you get the tax break for the traditional investment and if you invest the tax savings you 'll be in the same spot all else being equal if you only have a certain amount after taxes to invest say $ 3,000 in a 25 marginal tax bracket then it works out the same either way   you can either invest $ 3,000 in a roth and let it grow tax free or put $ 4,000 in a traditional ira since you can deduct $ 1,000 15 from your taxes when you file then your tax adjusted balance when you withdraw is the same since you 'll have a lot more 33 more in fact in your traditional ira but will have to pay tax on the withdrawals

funds especially index funds are a safe way for beginning investors to get a diversified investment across a lot of the stock market they are not the perfect investment but they are better than the majority of mutual funds and you do not spend a lot of money in fees compared to the alternative buying individual stocks based on what a friend tells you or buying a hot mutual fund it 's a great choice for a lot of people if you are willing to do some study you can do better quite a bit better with common stocks as an individual investor you have some structural advantages you can take significant to you positions in small cap companies while this is not practical for large institutional investors or mutual fund managers   however you can also lose a lot of money quickly in individual stocks it pays to go slow and to your homework however and make sure that you are investing not speculating i like as a good place to start and subscribe to a couple of their newsletters i will note that investing is not for the faint of heart to do well you may need to do the opposite of what everybody else is doing buying when the market is down and selling when the market is high a few people mentioned the efficient market hypothesis there is ample evidence that the market is not efficient the existence of the .com and mortgage bubbles makes it pretty obvious that the market is often not rationally valued and a couple of hedge funds profited in the billions from this

the number one rule of thumb that will generally answer the is it taxable question for any money you may have or receive did you pay taxes on it already pretty much any money you actually get in your paycheck dd has already been taxed or at least the projected amount of tax has been withheld is your money to dispense with as you will or according to your pre arranged obligations for most of it deposits paid are one such example if you wrote a check or obtained a money order that they then cashed that 's still your money until it is n't the contract states that it is being held effectively in escrow though the landlord has free use of it so long as he can pony up according to the contract anything not used to pay for damages is yours and you get it back the atm fee refund is trickier but basically this is a benefit offered to you as a service by your bank you front for the atm fees incurred when withdrawing and then those fees are refunded to you by your bank effectively increasing the number of atms you can withdraw from for free as long as there is no net income it 's treated like a mail in rebate you did n't gain any money so there 's nothing new to tax there are a couple of specific exceptions to this otherwise overarching rule of thumb one is roth iras typically on investments you either pay income tax on the money going in and capital gains tax on the money coming out or you pay nothing going in and income tax coming out with a roth however you pay income tax going in and nothing coming out even though you 're eventually getting back more than you put in   another is gifts whoever gave you the gift paid the taxes on it or the money to buy it however if they give you a gift valued more than a certain limit changes every year and there 's a lifetime limit they have to pay an additional gift tax of 35 on any amount over the limit that 's taxing taxed income usually   there are other examples but for the overwhelming majority of situations if it 's money you already had after any and all applicable taxes it 's not taxable even if you have n't seen that money for a while

bloomberg suggests that two fidelity funds hold preferred shares of snapchat inc preferred shares hold more in common with bonds than with ordinary stock as they pay a fixed dividend have lower liquidity and do n't have voting rights because of this lower liquidity they are not usually offered for sale on the market whether these funds are allowed to hold such illiquid assets is more a question for their strategy document than the law it is completely legal for a company to hold a non marketable interest in another even if the company is privately held as snapchat is the strategy documents governing what the fund is permitted to hold however may restrict ownership either banning non market holdings or restricting the percentage of assets held in illiquid instruments since ipo is very costly funds like these who look to invest in new companies who have not been through ipo yet are a very good way of taking a diversified position in   start ups since they look to invest directly rather than through the market they are an attractive low cost way for start ups to generate funds to grow the fund deals directly with the owners of the company to buy its shares the of the stock value reflects the accounting principle of marking to market financial assets that do not have a trade price so as to reflect their fair value this implies that fidelity believe that the total npv of the company 's net assets is lower than they had previously calculated this probably reflects a lack of revenue streams coming into the business in the case   of snapchat edit by the way since there is no market for start up stocks pre ipo my heart sinks a little every time i read the title of this question i 'm going to be sad all day now

most of the gold prices at international markets are usd denominated hence the prices would be same in international markets where large players are buying and selling however this does not mean that the prices to the individuals in local markets is same the difference is due to multiple things like cost of physical delivery warehousing local taxation conversion of local currency to usd etc so in essence the price of gold is similar to price of crude oil the price of oil is more or less same on all the markets exchanges though there is small difference this is because of the cost of delivery shipment which is borne by the buyer however the cost of oil to retail individual varies from country to country

market makers shortened mm in an exchange are generally required to list both a bid and ask price to allow both buyers and sellers to trade and keep the market moving   however a more general idea of a mm may includes companies off an exchange say large banks acting as broker dealers in an over the counter market are not required to give a simultaneous bid ask but often will on request   so it might depend on where you are getting this data but likely the bid ask was quoted simultaneously an exchange like the nasdaq for instance may have multiple mms for a given market   the market spread will be from the highest bid to the lowest ask over all the mms   the highest bid and lowest ask may come from different mms and any particular mm often will have a larger spread the size of the spread gives a rough idea of how much a mm is trying to make off of a round trip trade buying than immediately selling to someone else or selling than immediately buying from someone else   of course immediate round trip trades are not always possible and there are many other complications   however half the spread is a rough indicator of how much they hope to make off of a single trade

this is rob bennett the fellow who developed the valuation informed indexing strategy and the fellow who is discussed in the comment above the facts stated in that comment are accurate i went to a zero stock allocation in the summer of 1996 because of my belief in robert shiller 's research showing that valuations affect long term returns the conclusion stated that i have said that i do not myself follow the strategy is of course silly if i believe in it why would n't i follow it it 's true that this is a long term strategy that 's by design i see that as a benefit not a bad thing it 's certainly true that vii presumes that the efficient market theory is invalid if i thought that the market were efficient i would endorse buy and hold all of the conventional investing advice of recent decades follows logically from a belief in the efficient market theory the only problem i have with that advice is that shiller 's research the efficient market theory there is no one stock allocation that everyone following a vii strategy should adopt any more than there is any one stock allocation that everyone following a buy and hold strategy should adopt my personal circumstances have called for a zero stock allocation but i generally recommend that the typical middle class investor go with a 20 percent stock allocation even at times when stock prices are insanely high you have to make adjustments for your personal financial circumstances it is certainly fair to say that it is strange that stock prices have remained insanely high for so long what people are missing is that we have never before had claims that buy and hold strategies are supported by academic research those claims caused the biggest bull market in history and it will take some time for the widespread belief in such claims to diminish we are in the process of seeing that happen today   the good news is that once there is a consensus that buy and hold can never work we will likely have the greatest period of economic growth in u.s. history the power of academic research has been used to support buy and hold for decades now because of the widespread belief that the market is efficient turn that around and investors will possess a stronger belief in the need to practice long term market timing than they have ever possessed before in that sort of environment both bull markets and bear markets become logical emotional extremes in one direction emotional extremes in the other direction the stock market has been more emotional in the past 16 years than it has ever been in any earlier time this is evidenced by the wild p numbers that have applied for that entire time period now that we are seeing the losses that follow from investing in highly emotional ways we may see rational strategies becoming exceptionally popular for an exceptionally long period of time i certainly hope so the comment above that this will not work for individual stocks is correct this works only for those investing in indexes the academic research shows that there has never yet in 140 years of data been a time when valuation informed indexing has not provided far higher long term returns at greatly diminished risk but vii is not a strategy designed for stock pickers there is no reason to believe that it would work for stock pickers thanks much for giving this new investing strategy some thought and consideration and for inviting comments that help investors to understand both points of view about it rob

the other option apart from the above which i feel is quite good is travel card also called forex card issued in usd these cards are like prepaid debit cards they are available from almost quite a few indian banks like hdfc icici the limit for students is around 100 k usd per year   the card can be by any amount i think the minimum is usd 100 by visiting the branch or certain forex agents there loading fee is inr 75 the fx is typical card rate prevailing on the day in us this card can be used as a credit card for almost everything i have used this without any avoid using the card for blocking anything at hotel for room booking or initial block at car rentals although its mentioned that there is a withdrawl fees i was never charged anything for withdrawls the card comes with an internet based login to monitor account balance and transactions any unused funds can be withdrawn in india the payment will be make in inr

gt;at 15 k per year for the 40 + years of work from 22 or so to 65 it will be    hah you ca n't take nominal terms like that even if you take just inflation at say 2 a year and a modest required rate of return of 8 the present value of 15 k a year for 40 years is so basically if you expect to get only 15 k a year more for the next 40 years you can only afford to pay dollars for tuition + forgone income today that 's just to break you even and many people invest much more than that

risk is the capital you have in pursuit of profit the danger is that you lose what you have risked   for some bets risks you can get insurance to cover for losses   now the game of landlord and tenant requires you to play fully by the rules set forth by your legislators in your case that is the legislators of the state of texas without knowing those rules you could be liable open to civil prosecution for violating those rules tenants could be savvy to those rules or savvy enough to hire someone a lawyer who knows those rules as well in the game of landlord and tenant you must ascertain the creditworthiness of your would be tenant if the tenant fails to pay rent that tenant can the residence you will incur additional outlays to gain possession of your property ownership in your rental now the game of landlord vs landlord is different you ca n't pick up houses easily enough and even if you could likely the expense of doing so could wipe out any would profits from having the house as a rental so in landlord vs landlord you get constrained by where your rental sits thus you must forecast what will the neighborhood look like in five ten fifteen years

and i 'm reading through the pack of stuff   there should be a soft copy of terms and conditions if so please put up a link generally 0 apr comes with some strings attached the literature on the bank of america site shows 0 apr only for balance transfers done with 60 days   on one of the comparison sites the bank of america card shows 0 only for balance transfers and purchases done in first 60 days 0 introductory apr for 12 billing cycles for purchases and for any balance transfers made in the first 60 days then variable apr 3 fee min $ 10 applies to balance transfers which means that if you spend say $ 200 in first 2 months you can repay this $ 200 in next 12 months at 0 apr however if you spend another $ 100 in 3 month this should be paid in full along with a portion of $ 200 else interest would start for all of $ 300 generally 0 apr do n't make sense as there are lots of hidden terms and conditions and the real benefit may not be that great   edits the literature looks quite confusing on the main page it says introductory apr    0 for 12 billing cycles    applies to purchases and to any balance transfers made within 60 days of opening your account this would mean say you do a balance transfer within 60 days of 120 and say you make purchases with 60 days of 120 total liability is 240   scenario 1 assume you do not use this card then you can safely keep making payments of 20 per month for next one year scenario 2 in 3rd month you swipe for 100 more now the total due will be 100 + 20 if you make the payment of 120 then fine if you make a payment of only say 50 then the interest will be calculated for 240 40 payments for 2 of current month i.e. on 250 however the detailed terms of conditions seem to limit this only to balance transfer of 120 in first 60 days and not to any purchases in first 60 days with terms so vague my suggestion do n't get this card for these benefits get this if you need a regular card

call up vanguard and tell them you want to do a rollover   they walk you through the process   spend some time on reading up on asset allocation and benefits of indexing    1.5 every year is steep and what do you have in return   the advisor 's word that he 'll make it up   how much did he manage to return during the last lost decade    it 's a lose win situation   he 'll get his 1.5 no matter how the market does but that 's not the deal you are getting go with vanguard   you are already thinking correctly diversification rebalancing low cost

historically the market 's average rate of return has been about 8 's 6 to 10 is essentially the same number you should be able to get into that range for long term investments with minimal risk 5 or 6 companies unless you know a heck of a lot about those companies is fairly high risk if any one of those runs into trouble a considerable amount of your net investment is riding on it of course if any of them the next big thing you could hit it big that 's the tradeoff diversification is n't sexy but it buffers you from single company disasters and if you diversify across kinds of investment that buffers you from single sector disasters index funds are n't sexy but they 're a low cost way to diversify especially if you go with a mix of funds in different categories large cap small cap bond international real estate or a fund which has that mix built into it such as a target date fund

sure for starters you can put it in a savings account do n't laugh they used to pay noticeable interest you know back in the olden days   you could buy an i bond from treasury direct they 're a government savings bond that pays a specified amount of interest currently 0 i believe plus the amount of the inflation rate something like 3.5 currently i believe you do n't get paid the money the i bond grows in value till you sell it you can open a discount brokerage account and buy 1 or more shares of stock in a company you like discount brokerages generally have a minimum of $ 500 or so but will waive that if you set the account up as an ira trade for instance an ira in case you did n't know is a type of account that 's tax free but you ca n't touch it till you turn 59 1/2 it 's meant to help you save for retirement incidentally watch out of small account fees that some brokerages might charge you generally they 're annual or monthly charges they 'd charge you to cover their costs on your account since they 're certainly not going to make it in commissions that ira at trade is no fee speaking of commissions those will be a big chunk of that $ 100 it 'll be like $ to buy that stock a pretty big bite however many of these discount brokerages also offer some mutual funds for no commission those mutual funds in turn have minimums too but once again if your account 's an ira many will waive the minimum or set it low like $ 100

fuck exempt salary positions   the necessary reform is overtime for anyone who is n't a partial owner   if you own a company and want to work a 100 hour week fine   but you can not hire an exempt employee and work them 100 hours because of some classification   any non owner should get overtime   that would fix the massive unemployment problem straight away   if businesses ca n't force people to work two jobs for the pay of one they 'll have no choice but to hire more people   the other problem is unpaid internships   if someone works they get minimum wage   probably more   remember people fought and died for 40 hour weeks and fair labor laws   asshole corporations have fought to deny this   i 'm surprised they have n't tried to repeal child labor laws yet   most of them would be happy with ten year olds working ten hour days for nothing

gt nonsense is so rare   edited to reflect what i actually said and to respond is rare but it 's not non existent being proactive about making yourself a poor choice of targets is important to staying safe your arguments have shown a pattern of this lack of sight so far i 'm not going to spend my life going in circles with you   gt i am saying that cards that require you to enter a pin can not be used used when stolen or copied yes or no   gt on the other hand cards that require signature can be used when stolen or copied because signature is a worthless method to validate the charge yes or no   i think you 've broken and it is clear that you are the one trying to keep the argument going for the sake of it so i 'm done   gt do you see there are so many ways to make this system so much more secure and fraud proof but on purpose   yep but on purpose

the short answer is no you can only deduct actual expenses the long answer is that it would be impossible for the irs to determine the value of your time and it would open the tax system to an enormous amount of fraud think of being able to make up time spent or writing off time spent volunteering at a soup kitchen or any other charity now you can write off expenses you have involved in doing the work equipment and supplies used to do the work along with any wages you paid an employee or contractor to do said work

based on what you 've said i think buying a rental is risky for you it looks like you heard that renting a house is profitable and zillow supported that idea vague advice + a website designed for selling + large amounts of money = risky at the very least that does n't mean that rental property is super risky it just means that you have n't invested any time into learning the risks and how you can manage them once you learn that your risk reduces dramatically in general though i feel that rental property has a good risk reward ratio if you 're willing to put in the time and energy to learn the business then i 'd encourage you to buy property if you 're not willing to do that then rentals will always be a crap shoot one thing about investing in rental property is you have the ability to have more impact on your investment than you do dropping money in the stock market which is good and bad

you should have a separate business account mixing business and personal funds is a bad practice shop around you should be able to find a bank that will let you open a free checking account especially if you are going to have minimal activity e.g. less than 20 of checks per month and perhaps maintain a small balance e.g. $ 100 or $ 500

you have left out the most important piece of information are you an american citizen if you are then pfic rules mean you need to be very careful not to invest in any foreign index funds etfs that means it will probably be easiest for you to just leave the money in the us and continue to invest it there if you do not have us citizenship and have never had a green card then you will qualify for non resident alien status after you 've been gone for 3 years once that happens you wo n't owe us capital gains tax though you will owe it in aus you will owe 30 tax on dividends though much more at investopedia
