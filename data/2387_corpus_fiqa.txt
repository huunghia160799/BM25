1 are the definitions for capital market from the two sources the same yes   they are from two different perspectives   investopedia is looking at it primarily from the perspective of a trader and they lead off with the secondary market this refers to the secondary market a market in which individuals and institutions trade financial securities this refers to the primary market organizations institutions in the public and private sectors also often sell securities on the capital markets in order to raise funds also the investopedia definition leaves much to be desired but it is supposed to be   so you are comparing apples and oranges to some extent   one is an article as short as it may be this other one is an entry in a dictionary 2 what is the opposite of capital market according to the definition in investopedia   it 's not quite about opposites this is not physics   however that is not the issue here   the investopedia definition simply does not mention any other possibilities   the wikipedia article defines the term more thoroughly   it talks about primary secondary markets in separate paragraph 3 according to the wikipedia 's definition why does stock market belong to capital market given that stocks can be held less than one year too if you follow the link in the wikipedia article to money market as money became a commodity the money market is nowadays a component of the financial markets for assets involved in short term borrowing lending buying and selling with original maturities of one year or less the key here is original maturities of one year or less here 's my attempt at explaining this financial markets are comprised of money markets and capital markets    money is traded as if it were a commodity on the money markets   hence the short term nature in its definition   they are more focused on the money itself      capital markets are focused on the money as a means to an end companies seek money in these markets for longer terms in order to improve their business in some way a business may go to the money markets to access money quickly in order to deal with a short term cash crunch   meanwhile a business may go to the capital markets to seek money in order to expand its business note that capital markets came first and money markets are a relatively recent development    also we are typically speaking about the secondary capital market when we are talking about the stock or bond market   in this market participants are merely trading among themselves   the company that sought money by issuing that stock bond certificate is out of the picture at that point and has its money    so facebook got its money from participants in the primary market the underwriters   the underwriters then turned around and sold that stock in an ipo to the secondary market   after the ipo their stock trades on the secondary market where you or i have access to trade it   that money flows between traders   facebook got its money at the beginning of the process

just to clarify in wikipedia when it says   it is defined as a market in which money is provided for periods longer than a year they are referring to the company which is asking for money so for example the stock market provides money to the issuing company of an ipo indefinitely meaning the company that just went public is provided with money for a period longer than a year the definition in investopedia basically says the same thing wikipedia does it is just phrased slightly different and leaves out the for periods longer than a year   for example wikipedia uses the term business enterprises and governments while investopedia uses the term private sector and public sector in this context business enterprise is private sector and governments is public sector   so in the sense of the length debt is issued yes money market would be the opposite of a capital market but both markets still offer a place for governments and companies to raise money and both are classified as financial markets

i ’m not an expert on the visa us tax or insurance but you 're making enough mistakes in terms of all the associated costs involved in owning and renting houses apartments that this already looks potentially unwise at this stage of your investment career renting cheap properties to students involves the property constantly being trashed often being empty and requiring extremely close management which you either have to pay someone a lot to do or do yourself and lose other potential earning time if doing yourself you will also make lots of mistakes in the vetting managing marketing process etc at first as this is a complex art in itself   costs on this type of rental can often get as high as 25 a year depending exactly how lucky you get even if you do it all yourself and will typically be in the 5 15 range every year once everything you have to constantly maintain replace and is up that 's all pre what you could be earning in a job etc so if you could earn a decent clip elsewhere in the same time also have to deduct that lost potential send it all to third parties so all upkeep by hired contractors all renting by an agency you will be lucky to even break even off a year per property rents to students you ’re not seeming to price in any transaction costs which usually run at ~5 a time for both entrance and exit that s between half and one years rent gone from the ten per property on these numbers sell before ten is up its even more on point three rounding projections in house price rises to one decimal place is total gibberish no one who actually has experience investing their own money well ever makes or relies on claims like this no idea on pittsburgh market but sound projections of likely asset changes is always a ranged and figure that can not and should n’t be counted on for much even if it was it ’s also completely unattainable in property because you have to spend so much money on upkeep post costs and changes in size standard house values generally roughly track inflation have a look at this chart and play around with some reasonable yearly upkeep numbers and you will see what i mean renting property is an absolute for inexperienced investors and if you do n't know the stuff above already and it 's less than 10 of what you need to know to do this profitably vs other uses of your time you will nearly always be better off investing the money in more passive investments like diversified bonds reits and stock

generically interest rates being charged are driven in large part by the central bank 's rate and competition tends to keep similar loans priced fairly close to each other interest rates being paid are driven by what 's needed to get folks to lend you their money deposit in bank purchase bonds so it 's again related there certainly is n't very direct coupling but in general interest rates of all sorts do tend to swing very roughly in the same direction at very roughly the same time so the concept that interest rates of all types are rising or falling at any given moment is a simplification but not wholly unreasonable if you want to know which interest rates a particular person is citing to back up their claim you really need to ask them

as the option approaches expiry the delta will approach zero or one depending on whether you 're in or out of the money this might be easiest to if you look at the option value as a function of the stock price and then realise that the delta is the slope of that curve now as we get closer to expiry time value fades away and we get closer and closer to the intrinsic value which looks like this hockey stick as you see close to expiry if you 're out of the money you have nothing with delta zero while if you 're in the money you have a forward with delta one

given that we live in a world rife with geopolitical risks such as brexit and potential eu breakup would you say it 's advisable to keep some of cash savings in a foreign currency probably not   primarily because you do n't know what will happen in the fallout of these sorts of political shifts   you do n't know what will happen to banking treaties between the various countries involved if you can manage to place funds on deposit in a foreign bank country in a currency other than your home currency and maintain the deposit insurance in that country and not spend too much exchanging your currency then there probably is n't a downside other than liquidity loss if you 're thinking i 'll just wire some whatever currency to some bank in some foreign country in which you have no residency or citizenship consideration without considering deposit insurance just so you might protect some of your money from a possible future event i think you should stay away

any publicly traded financial instrument can be sold short in theory   there are however many regulations associated with short sales of us equities that may prevent certain stocks from being sold short at certain times or through certain brokers some examples the most basic requirement this is n't a regulation it 's just the definition of a short sale is that you or your broker must have access to someone willing to loan you his her shares   if you are interested in shorting a security with few shares outstanding or low trade volume there may simply not be enough people in the world willing to loan you theirs   alternatively there may be a shareholder willing to loan shares but your broker may not have a relationship with the clearing house that shareholder is using   a larger better different broker might be able to help threshold securities list since 2005 each day certain securities are not allowed to be sold short based on their recent history of liquidity   basically if a certain number of transactions in a security have not been correctly settled over the past few days then the sec has reason to believe that short sales which require extra transactions are at higher risk of falling through circuit breaker a.k.a alternative uptick since 2011 during certain market conditions exchanges are now required to reject short sales for certain securities in order to prevent market crashes market abuse

ignoring the complexities of a and regulated market a futures contract is simply a contract that requires party a to buy a given amount of a commodity from party b at a specified price the future can be over something tangible like pork or oil in which case there is a physical transfer of stuff or it can be over something intangible like shares the purpose of the contract is to allow the seller to lock in a price so that they are not subject to price fluctuations between the date the contract is entered and the date it is complete this risk is transferred to the seller who will therefore generally pay a discounted rate from the spot price on the original day in many cases the buyer actually wants the stuff futures contracts between farmers and manufacturers being one example the farmer who is growing say wool will enter a contract to supply 3000 kg at $ 10 per kg of a given quality etc there are generally price adjustments detailed for varying quality with a textile manufacturer to be delivered in 6 months the spot price today may be $ 11 the farmer gives up $ 1 now to shift the risk of price fluctuations to the manufacturer when the strike date rolls around the farmer delivers the 3000 kg and takes the money if he has failed to grow at least 3000 kg then he must buy it from someone or trigger whatever the penalty clauses in the contract are for futures over shares and other securities the principle is exactly the same say the contract is for 1000 shares of xyz stock party a agrees to sell these for $ 10 each on a given day to party b. when that day rolls around party a transfers the shares and gets the money party a may have owned the shares all along may have bought them before the settlement day or if push comes to shove must buy them on the day of settlement notwithstanding when they bought them if they paid less than $ 10 they make a profit if they pay more they make a loss   generally speaking you ca n't settle a futures contract with another futures contract you have to deliver up what you promised be it wool or shares

yes there are several downsides to this strategy you are n't taking into account commissions if you pay $ 5 each time you buy or sell a stock you may greatly reduce or even eliminate any possible gains you would make from trading such small amounts this next point sounds obvious but remember that you pay a commission on every trade regardless of profit so every trade you make that you make at a loss also costs you commissions even if you make trades that are profitable more often than not if you make quite a few trades with small amounts like this your commissions may eat away all of your profits commissions represent a fixed cost so their effect on your gains decreases proportionally with the amount of money you place at risk in each trade since you 're in the us you 're required to follow the sec rules on pattern day trading from that link finra rules define a pattern day trader as any customer who executes four or more day trades within five business days provided that the number of day trades represents more than six percent of the customer ’s total trades in the margin account for that same five business day period if you trip this rule you 'll be required to maintain $ 25,000 in a margin brokerage account if you ca n't maintain the balance your account will be locked do n't forget about capital gains taxes since you 're holding these securities for less than a year your gains will be taxed at your ordinary income tax rates you can deduct your capital losses too assuming you do n't repurchase the same security within 30 days because in that case the wash sale rule prevents you from deducting the loss but it 's important to think about gains and losses in real terms not nominal terms the story is different if you make these trades in a tax sheltered account like an ira but the other problems still apply you 're implicitly assuming that the stock 's prices are skewed in the positive direction remember that you have limit orders placed at the upper and lower bounds of the range so if the stock price decreases before it increases your limit order at the lower bound will be triggered and you 'll trade at a loss if you 're hoping to make a profit through buying low and selling high you want a stock that hits its upper bound before hitting the lower bound the majority of the time unless you have data analysis not just your intuition or a pattern you 've talked yourself into from looking at a chart to back this up you 're essentially gambling that more often than not the stock price will increase before it decreases it 's dangerous to use any strategy that you have n't backtested extensively find several months or years of historical data either intra day or daily data depending on the time frame you 're using to trade and simulate your strategy exactly this helps you determine the potential profitability of your strategy and it also forces you to decide on a plan for precisely when you want to invest do you invest as soon as the stock trades in a range which algorithms can determine far better than intuition it also helps you figure out how to manage your risk and how much loss you 're willing to accept for risk management using limit orders is a start but see my point above about positively skewed prices limit orders are n't enough in general if an active investment strategy seems like a no brainer or too good to be true it 's probably not viable in general as a retail investor it 's foolish to assume that no one else has thought of your simple active strategy to make easy money i can promise you that someone has thought of it trading firms have quantitative researchers that are paid to think of and implement trading strategies all the time   if it 's viable at any scale they 'll probably already have utilized it and arbitraged away the potential for small traders to make significant gains trust me you 're not the first person who thought of using limit orders to make easy money off volatile stocks the fact that you 're asking here and doing research before implementing this strategy however means that you 're on the right track it 's always wise to research a strategy extensively before deploying it in the wild to answer the question in your title since it could be interpreted a little differently than the body of the question no there 's nothing wrong with investing in volatile stocks indexes etc i certainly do and i 'm sure many others on this site do as well it 's not the investing that gets you into trouble and costs you a lot of money it 's the rapid buying and selling and attempting to time the market that proves costly which is what you 're doing when you implicitly bet that the distribution of the stock 's prices is positively skewed to address the commission fee problem assuming a fee of $ 8 per trade and a minimum of $ 100 profit per sale commissions are n't your only problem and counting on $ 100 profit per sale is a significant assumption look at point 4 above through your use of limit orders you 're making the implicit assumption that more often than not the price will trigger your upper limit order before your lower limit order here 's a simple example let 's assume you have limit orders placed at + 2 and -2 of your purchase price and that triggering the limit order at + 2 earns you $ 100 profit while triggering the limit order at -2 incurs a loss of $ 100 assume your commission is $ 5 on each trade   if your upper limit order is triggered you earn a profit of 100 10 = 90 then set up the same set of limit orders again if your lower limit order is triggered this time you incur a loss of 100 + 10 = 110 so your net gain is 90 110 = -20 this is a perfect example of why when taking into account transaction costs even strategies that at first glance seem profitable mathematically can actually fail   if you set up the same situation again and incur a loss again 100 + 10 = 110 you 're now down -20 110 = to make a profit you need to make two profitable trades without incurring further losses   this is why point 4 is so important whenever you trade it 's critical to completely understand the risk you 're taking and the bet you 're actually making not just the bet you think you 're making also according to my algorithm a sale only takes place once the stock rises by 1 or 2 points otherwise the stock is held until it does does this mean you 've removed the lower limit order if yes then you expose yourself to downside risk what if the stock has traded within a range then suddenly starts declining because of bad earnings reports or systemic risks to name a few if you have n't removed the lower limit order then point 4 still stands   however i never specified that the trades have to be done within the same day   let the investor open up 5 brokerage accounts at 5 different firms for safeguarding against being labeled a pattern day trader each account may only hold 1 security at any time for the span of 1 business week how do you control how long the security is held you 're using limit orders which will be triggered when the stock price hits a certain level regardless of when that happens maybe that will happen within a week or maybe it will happen within the same day once again the bet you 're actually making is different from the bet you think you 're making can you provide some algorithms or methods that do work for generating some extra cash on the side aside from purchasing s&p 500 type index funds and waiting when i purchase index funds it 's not to generate extra liquid cash on the side i do n't invest nearly enough to be able to purchase an index fund and earn substantial dividends i do n't want to get into any specific strategies because i 'm not in the business of making investment recommendations and i do n't want to start furthermore i do n't think explicit investment recommendations are welcome here unless it 's describing why something is a bad idea and i agree with that policy i will make a couple of points however understand your goals are you investing for retirement or a shorter horizon e.g. some side income you seem to know this already but i include it for future readers   if a strategy seems too good to be true it probably is educate yourself before designing a strategy research fundamental analysis different types of orders e.g. so you fully understand that you do n't have control over when limit orders are executed different sectors of the market if that 's where your interests lie etc personally i find some sectors fascinating so researching them thoroughly allows me to make informed investment decisions as well as learn about something that interests me understand your limits how much money are you willing to risk and possibly lose do you have a risk management strategy in place to prevent unexpected losses what are the costs of the risk management itself backtest backtest backtest ideally your backtesting and simulating should be identical to actual market conditions and incorporate all transaction costs and a wide range of historical data get other opinions evaluate those opinions with the same critical eye as i and others have evaluated your proposed strategy

it sounds good but perhaps they 've overlooked several things that would need to be addressed before anything like this could work well   1 if there is a leak in the overall flow such as a hft hedge fund sucking money out of the markets at an enormous rate into a tax haven such a system would just perpetuate the existing rise of the entities they still get richer without spending much in return   2 as described they have only talked about one government one nation one monetary recycling system as if nations are closed boxes they are not money flows across borders with ease nations compete to maximise the amount of assets they hold within their borders at any given time these can be fixed capital assets too so nothing prevents the global equity investment they mention from starting to resemble all the powerful corporations concentrated in a single nation over time that would represent a lot of political power concentrated in ways that are not necessarily favourable to individual sovereign national legal systems elsewhere   it is possible that this could mean that nations would compete to lower taxes to zero to attract corporations thereby risking bankrupting governments unless the income from the global equity index compensated enough at 6 it wo n't match current tax rates   the second point also means that nations can not unilaterally decide to implement this unless they have a guaranteed additional income from activities that could compensate for excessive outflow

i 've never invested in penny stocks my 1 investing rule buy what you know and use   people get burned because they hear about the next big thing go invest to just end up losing everything because they have no clue in what they 're investing in from what i 've found until you have minimum of $ 5k to invest put everything in a single investment the reason for this as others have mentioned is that commissions eat up just about all your profits   my opinion do n't put it in a bond returns are garbage right now however they are safe because this is $ 1000 we 're talking about and not your life savings put it in a equity like a stock to try and maximize your return i aim for 15 returns on stocks and can generally achieve 10 15 consistently the problem is when you get greedy and keep thinking it will go above once you 're at 10 15 sell it sell it right away if it drops down -15 you have to be willing to accept that risk the nice thing is that you can wait it out i try to put a 3 month time frame on things i buy to make money   once you start getting a more sizable chunk of money to play around with you should start to diversify in canada at least once you have a trading account with a decent size investment the commissions get reduced to like $ 10 a trade with your consistent 10 returns and additional savings you 'll start to build up your portfolio keep at it and best of luck

it 's not mentioned in the article but the state will invariably pay for infrastructure upgrades and maintenance around a project like this the only way this pays off is if the tax revenue generated is enough to pay for any additional expenditure by the state and the fact that foxconn has a track record of not living up to its promises is what prevents this from being a no brainer we 'll need to revisit the topic in 15 years when this deal has reached its conclusion to know if the gamble was worth it the thing that is working to foxconn 's advantage here is that there were several states competing for this

there are obviously lots of complexities here and there are rules against price or market manipulation that are somewhat due to the rules inclusion of the 's intent but generally speaking you can publicly promote the value of a company whose stock you own provided that you now if you the value of a company publicly and sell it immediately thereafter pump and dump the regulators might suggest that your actions imply that you did n't believe it was so wonderful and were misleading the public to move the price      that said a fair might be that you loved it for all the reasons you said at lower price but thought it had run its course once it got to higher price    again if it can be demonstrated that your reason for praising it was to push the price higher your intent may land you in hot water this is n't legal advice or a full analysis but if essentially declared his honest reasons for loving a stock in which he is invested and discloses that investment letting others know he is biased he 's probably ok especially if he intends to hold it long term

first your professor should learn proper grammar should be why do   second it looks like you 're dealing with synthetic securities you can create a synthetic t bill by doing a combination of long short calls puts   but ignore all that just think about this without the technical jargon we know that the risk free rate is typically what t bills are yielding right and we know that since options are inherently more risky than us government debt investors will demand a higher interest rate to compensate them for the risk so as the risk free rate increases the value of a call will move the same direction otherwise investors would stop dealing with call options and would instead buy safer less risky riskless investments   it 's not really an options question just one of basic finance risk understanding of interest rates etc

you almost never want to repay a student loan early as you 've realised you can put the money in an isa instead and earn more interest than you 're paying on the loan if you withdrew money from the isa each month to replace the repayments being taken from your salary there 'd be money left in the isa when you finished repaying the loan this is also the cheapest debt you 'll ever have so if you repay it now and then end up borrowing money elsewhere in the future you 'll probably be worse off in particular if you expect to have a mortgage at some point you 'll probably be better off keeping the money to add to a deposit rather than repaying it now and then borrowing more on the mortgage you should also consider how long it 'll take you to repay the loan normally if you do n't expect to finish repaying within 25 years you 'd be throwing money away by repaying early this is more of an issue for the larger loans

say the company has created 500 shares or whatever number you have 10 shares equivalent of 2 now when new capital is needed generally more shares are created say they create 100 more shares and sell it to venture capital to raise funds after this happens total shares 500 + 100 = 600 you own 10 shares your ownership = down from 2 like wise for other older shareholder the new venture guy gets of ownership    more funds would mean more growth and overall the value of your 10 shares would be more depending on the valuation

i would add to the other excellent answers that another factor besides just high unemployment numbers is the fear people have regarding the financial aspects of the country that is the value of stocks and the value of the dollar   when the economy is sluggish it means people are n't buying enough therefore companies are n't making enough therefore their profits are too low and people start to divest from them and stock prices drop   or even the fear of this happening can induce people to sell off shares    the point is people are worried in this economy because if due to unemployment low spending consumer confidence the stock market crashes again as it did in that represents a lot of savings lost e.g. 40 50 of what one was counting on to retire with particularly if you panic sell at the bottom   now suddenly it 's as if you had a huge robbery and you will have to work longer into your retirement years than you 'd planned   similarly if due to monetary policy the u.s. inflates the dollar what one saved for retirement may not be sufficient   these arguments are true for shorter periods than just one 's retirement but just taking that as an example so it 's not just unemployment that is worrisome in this economy   this said i agree with george that one ought to be careful and plan well regardless of the winds of the economy   i guess for most people and companies though in this economy means they ca n't get away with the kind of they might have during a boom

an investment portfolio is typically divided into three components all three of those can be accessed through mutual funds or etfs a 401(k will probably have a small set of mutual funds for you to pick from mutual funds may charge you silly expenses if you pick a bad one look at the prospectus for the expense ratio if it 's over 1 you 're definitely paying too much if it 's over 0.5 you 're probably paying too much if it 's less than 0.1 you have a really good deal us stocks are generally the core holding until you move into retirement or get close to spending the money on something else if it 's not invested for retirement international stocks are riskier than us stocks but provide opportunity for diversification and better returns than the us stocks bonds or fixed income investments are generally very safe but have limited opportunities for returns they tend to do better when stocks are doing poorly when you 've got a while to invest you should be looking at riskier investments when you do n't you should be looking for safer investments a quick and rough rule of thumb is that your age should match the portion of your portfolio in bonds so if you 're 50 years old and approaching retirement in 15 years or so you should have about 50 in bonds roughly   people whose employment and future income is particularly tied to one sector of the market would also do well to avoid investing there because they already are at risk if it performs badly for instance if you work in the technology sector loading up on tech stocks is extra risky if there 's a big bust you 're not just out of a job your portfolio is dead as well more exotic options are available to diversify a portfolio while many portfolios could benefit from these sorts of holdings they come with their own advantages and disadvantages and should be researched carefully before taking a significant stake in them

i 'll concede that you 're probably speaking in good i genuinely believe that you 're original statement was one that meant to point out that the ruling class seek to squeeze all the value they can out of being the ruling class which includes maximizing the size of the rest of the population to drive down wages and get the most labor out of payrolls as possible to maximize profit i can concede that completely and never suspected that you felt otherwise   that said reasonable people are often to deal with extreme or academic scenarios using reason alone my entire point of came from the use of the term commodity as it refers to things of value who 's value arises from their ability to be traded at a profit your statement regarding people fitting this definition was true in the time of pushing that definition back to the idea that the labor of people was tradable but people owned themselves was a major improvement in human rights happening for different people at different points in history i drew a point of contention because it 's an important and historical point of contention that should never slip backwards ever without being pointed out

i 'm not expert here but a method used by quite a few people i went to school with was to save as much as possible before starting and continue to save as you go better explained if you are able to save a years worth of tuition or in a better case save even more you can pay as you or in this case your child classes and continue to add money to that account if your child can hold down a part time job during school as many college students do they can even help by saving some money into that account and it can allow them to exit college free and clear of any loans or at least mostly clear should you fall a little short   it 's not the best option but given a short time frame it can work and i 've seen it work

unfortunately you ca n't use your hsa to pay for expenses in year a. qualified medical expenses for an hsa must occur after the date the hsa account was established established typically means the date the account was opened in your name the other answers already mostly answered your other questions but i want to really hit home some particular points that many people may not realize the most important thing to do when you are eligible to have an hsa account is to open an hsa account asap this is true even if you do n't put any money in it and you leave it empty for years the reason is that once the account is established all qualified medical expenses that occur after that date are eligible for distributions even if you wait years before you fund your hsa account the second most important thing to do is to keep track of all out of pocket medical expenses you incur after you open the hsa account all you need is a simple spreadsheet and a place to store your receipts once you have the account and are tracking expenses now you can put money into your hsa and take it out whenever you 'd like with you ca n't put in more than the contribution limit for a single tax year and you ca n't take out more than your eligible expenses to date helpful tip many people do n't fund their hsa because they ca n't afford to set aside extra money to do so fortunately you do n't have to for example suppose you have some dental work and it costs you $ 500 once you get the bill before you pay it put the $ 500 into your hsa account the next day take the $ 500 back out and pay your dental bill with it most hsa accounts will give you a debit card to make this even easier to pay the bill by putting the money into your hsa for 1 day you just received a $ 500 tax deduction alternatively you can always pay out of pocket like you normally would track your receipts and wait until the end of the year or up until april 15 of the next year i like this option because i can pay all of my medical bills with a credit card and get cash back then at the end of the year i add up the expenses deposit that much into my hsa and if i 'd rather put that money somewhere else i just pull it out the next day if you decide you do n't need the money right away that 's even better since you can leave it in the hsa account and invest it like a roth account you do n't pay tax on the growth you achieve inside of an hsa another tip if your employer offers the service of automatically making deposits into your hsa by reducing your paycheck you should definitely try to do that if you can afford it rather than manually making contributions as i described in the previous tip when your employer makes the contributions for you your wages are reduced by that amount on your w2 so you end up saving an additional 7 in fica taxes

on this the best thing you can do is ask current analysts for help you 're new and people expect you to ask dumb questions at this point so ask them now while you still get a pass   with that being said there 's a strategy to it before you ever ask a question spend at least 5 minutes trying to figure out the answer on your own op did a google search which is great so many people wo n't do this finally the way you ask the question is key i would go to an analyst and say boss asked me to get a list of all us apartment flooring companies i looked on google to see if i could find anything there if you were doing this where would you go to find the information   they 'll usually even walk you through how to do it if there 's something special with the service you have for the task you 'll also make them feel important and you 'll get the task done fast   also if you run into trouble with the boss after presenting it you can always back yourself up by saying you asked around the office for what tool to use and people told you to use that but be strategic with how you say it because you do n't want to throw anyone under the bus

quantitative easing explained the short of it is that you 're right the fed or another country 's central bank is basically creating a large amount of new money which it then injects into the economy by buying government and institutional debt this is in fact one of the main jobs of the central bank for a currency to manage the money supply which in most fiat systems involves slowly increasing the amount of money to keep the economy growing if there is n't enough money moving around in the economy it 's reflected in a slowdown in gdp growth while controlling inflation the devaluation of a unit of currency with respect to most or all things that unit will buy including other currencies inflation 's primary cause is defined quite simply as too many dollars chasing too few goods when demand is low for cash because you have a lot of it while demand for goods is high the suppliers of those goods will increase their price for the goods because people are willing to pay that higher price and will also produce more with quantitative easing the central bank is increasing the money supply by several percentage points of gdp much higher than is normally needed this normally would cause the two things you mentioned inflation inflation 's primary cause is too many dollars chasing too few goods when money is easy to get and various types of goods and services are not people bid up the price on these things to get them this usually happens when sellers see high demand for a product and increase the price to take advantage and to prevent a shortage this often happens across the board in a situation like this but there are certain key drivers that can cause other prices to increase things like the price of oil which affects transportation costs and thus the price to have anything shipped anywhere whether it be the raw materials you need or the finished product you 're selling with the injection of so much money into the economy rampant inflation would normally be the result however there are other variables at play in this particular situation chief among them is that no matter how much cash is in the economy most of it is being sat on in the form of cash or other safe havens like durable commodities gold and t debt so most of the money the fed is injecting into the economy is not chasing goods it 's repaying debt savings and generally being hoarded by consumers and institutions as a hedge against the poor economy in addition despite how many dollars are in the economy right now those dollars are in high demand all around the world to buy treasury debt one of the biggest safe havens in the global market right now so much so that buying t debt is considered saving this is why the yields on treasury bonds and notes are at historic lows it 's bad everywhere and u.s. government debt is one of the surest things in the world market especially now that euro bonds have become suspect currency devaluation this is basically specialized inflation when there are more dollars in the market than people want to have in order to use to buy our goods and services demand for our currency the medium of trade for our goods and services drops and it takes fewer euros yen or yuan to buy a dollar this can happen even if demand for our dollars inside our own borders is high and is generally a function of our trade situation if we 're buying more from other countries than they are from us then our dollars are flooding the currency exchange markets and thus become cheaper because they 're easy to get again there are other variables at play here that keep our currency strong first off again it 's bad everywhere nobody 's buying anything from anyone relatively speaking and so the relative trade deficits are n't moving much in addition devaluation without inflation is self if currency devalues but inflation is low the cheaper currency makes the things that currency can buy cheaper which encourages people to buy them at the same time the more expensive foreign currency increases the cost in dollars of foreign made goods all of this can be beneficial from a money policy standpoint devaluation makes american goods cheaper to americans and to foreign consumers alike than foreign goods and so a policy that puts downward pressure on the dollar but does n't make inflation a risk can help american manufacturing and other producer businesses china knows this just as well as we do and for decades has been artificially fixing the exchange rate of the b yuan lower than its true value against the dollar meaning that no matter how cheap american goods get on the world market chinese goods are still cheaper because by definition the yuan has greater purchasing power for the same cost in dollars in addition dollars are n't only used to buy american made goods and services the u.s. has positioned its currency over the years to be an international medium of trade for several key commodities like oil and the primary currency for global lenders like the imf and the world bank that means that dollars become necessary to buy these things and are received from and must be repaid to these institutions and thus the dollar has a built in demand pretty much regardless of our trade deficits   on top of all that a lot of countries base their own currencies on our dollar by basically buying dollars using other valuable media like gold or oil and then holding that cash in their own central banks as the store of value backing their own paper money this is called a dollar board their money becomes worth a particular fraction of a dollar by definition and that relationship is very precisely with 10 billion dollars in the vault and 20 billion issued from 's central bank a is worth $ .50 print an additional 20 billion and the value of one decreases to $ .25 buy an additional 10 billion dollars and the 's value increases again to $ .50 quite a few countries do this mostly in south america again creating a built in demand for u.s. dollars and also tying the u.s. dollar to the value of the exports of that country if 's goods become highly demanded by europe and its currency increases relative to the dollar then the u.s. dollar gets a boost because by definition it is worth an exact fixed number of and also because a country with a dollar board typically has no problem accepting dollars as payment and then printing to maintain the exchange rate

b. 's answer is good but there 's an important note to consider for tax purposes   it 's too large for a comment so i 'm adding it as an answer and that is you can not claim the property as a rental property under certain conditions   this affects things like claiming mortgage interest which you do n't have and depreciation in value which a rental is allowed see irs topic for details but i 've included an important excerpt below with emphasis added if you rent a dwelling unit to others that you also use as a residence limitations may apply to the rental expenses you can deduct you 're considered to use a dwelling unit as a residence if you use it for personal purposes during the tax year for more than the greater of      a day of personal use of a dwelling unit is any day that it 's used by talk to a tax accountant to better understand the ramifications of this but it 's worth noting that you ca n't just rent it to her for a paltry sum and be able to take tax advantages from this arrangement

yes if you gift him with a large amount you may be liable for gift tax i believe the current limit is still $ 17k per person per person per year so between you and your spouse you could give him up to $ per year without triggering gift tax if you want to give a larger sum the standard workaround is an intra family loan for that phrase to learn more about it but basically you loan the money and then gift the payments on the loan this gives him the money up front spreading the gift over subsequent years it requires that you declare the interest that he is supposedly paying you as income there is a lower limit on the interest rate for these loans but it 's a fraction of a percent so this generally is n't a significant cost if you are able to structure the loan as a mortgage he may be able to deduct the interest from his taxes that usually requires a few hundred dollars if paperwork to set up i 've done it it works and one of the advantages is that it puts the exact terms of the on paper where everyone can agree to them which could be useful should there be arguments later on   when doing business with friends and relatives keeping it on a clear business contract basis is the best way to avoid destroying the friendship

the fees with trading cfds are usually lower than standard share trading there is usually no joining fee to join a broker and start trading with them you must be talking about the minimum required to fund your account to trade with   what country are you in because if you are in the usa i believe cfd trading is not allowed there also there is no margin fee associated with trading cfds the margin is what you put in to buy or sell the cfd when you open a position for example if you were to open a position in a share cfd where the underlying share had a price of $ 10 and you were looking to buy 1000 units to buy the shares outright your outlay would be $ 10000 plus brokerage if the cfd provider had a 10 margin on these share then your initial margin to open a cfd position would be 10 of $ 10000 or $ 1000 if the price of the shares went up to $ 11 and you sold the shares you would get $ $ 1000 profit if you sold the cfds you would get $ 2000 $ 1000 profit if on the other hand the shares went down to $ 9 and you sold the shares you would get $ 9000 $ 1000 loss if you sold the cfds you would get $ 0 $ 1000 loss you have to be careful with margin it is a two edged sword it can multiply your gains as well as multiply your losses the only fees you should be charged with cfds is brokerage which should be less than for share trading and overnight financing costs this is charged for everyday you hold a long position overnight you should not be charge any overnight financing cost for holding short positions overnight and if interest rates were higher you might actually get paid an overnight financing for holding short positions overnight you may have been closed out of your bitcoin position because you did n't have enough funds in your trading account to open the size trade that you opened from your question it seems like you are not ready to trade cfds you should really learn more about cfds and the trading platform s you plan to use before trading with your valuable money you could probably open up a simulation account whilst you are learning the ropes and become more familiar with the trading platform and with cfds and if you are not sure about something ask your broker they usually have training videos and seminars

the reason people buy earthquake insurance is not because normal insurance goes straight to the lender it does not but because oftentimes earthquake damage is not covered under normal homeowner 's insurance natural disasters are often not covered under regular insurance this is why people buy flood insurance if your pipes burst and flood your house your home owner 's insurance will typically cover if the local river floods and floods your house oftentimes insurance will not cover this is why a lot of state federal agencies have separate pools of insurance all earthquake insurance in california is technically through the state agency though you may go through your homeowner provider to get it i pay $ 200 a year for mine i would n't say it 's very expensive my concern is not a giant earthquake that destroys my house my concern is a large earthquake that might cause cracks in my slab or structural damage that my regular insurance is in no way obligated to cover but i need to fix i think if you live in an earthquake prone area it 's as reasonable as getting flood insurance if you live in an area known to flood

when they make the most money off of charging interest on late payments this is incorrect do you have any data to back this in the past decade there was a tendency by financial institutions to make money from late payments and there were certain rewards incentives for people who paid late however the bubble cracked soon enough and there were huge losses in the card industry today most of the revenue for card companies is from margins on customers who pay on time and growth avenues are promoting to pay every transaction by card why do they actively seek people who pay their bills on time as evidence by requiring good credit scores to get approved for a card instead of they opposite as indicated above remember if one customer defaults it wipes out margins made by tons of customers in spite of giving credit to people with good credit score the average credit card debit an us individual holds is still quite high

a statistical measurement is still more honest than no measurements at all for economics we do n't have a reference frame for the absolute truth there is no way to judge the absolute accuracy of a theory given that at least a theory that matches real observational data is more real than something that does not match observations    and quantitative easing has been in many ways one of the largest economic experiments there were competing theories on what it would do and one thing was certain monetary velocity is inversely related to wealth even kansas was an experiment something was predicted by gov. brown back and that something turned out to be wrong in the light of observations i find it astonishing to hold on to a theory whose predictions have just not panned out   monetary velocity may still be wrong but on a relative scale of it is still much less inaccurate than the laffer curve

to many question and they are all treated differently i was wondering how the logistics of interest and dividend payments are handled on assets such as mortgages bonds stocks    what if the owner is some high frequency algorithm that buys and sells bonds and stocks in fractions of a second when the company decides to pay dividends does it literally track    down every single owner of that stock and deposit x cents per share in    that person 's bank account this sounds absolutely absurd and seems    like it would be a logistical nightmare in stocks the dividends are issued periodically the dividend date is declared well in advance as on end of the day on dividend date the list of individuals or entities who own the stock is available with the stock exchange registrar of the companies to this list the dividends are credited in next few days weeks via banking channel most of this is automated what if the owner is some high frequency algorithm that buys and sells bonds and stocks in fractions of a second on bonds things work slightly differently an bond is initially issued for say 95 discount of 5 and payment of 100 after say 5 years so when the person sells it after an year he would logically look to get a price of 96 of course there are other factors that could fetch him a price of or so every change in ownership factors in the logical rate of interest the person who submits in on maturity gets 100   for the homeowner i 'm assuming he she still makes mortgage payments to the initial bank they got the mortgage from even if the bank no longer owns the mortgage in this case does the trader on the secondary market who owns the mortgage also come back to that bank to collect his interest payment this depends on how the original financial institution sells the mortgage to new institutions generally the homeowner would keep paying initial financial institution and they would then take a margin and pay the secondary investor if this was collateral as mortgage backed security it is a very different story

if you deposit the money in your account it will count against the gift tax exclusion for you not your daughter as such you should open a bank account for your daughter   assuming she already has a social security number this will not be complicated   otherwise apply for one as mhoran notes before the end of the year the kind of account you should open depends on the purpose of the money but likely it should be opened as a uniform gift to minors act or uniform transfer to minors act account   this means it is your daughter 's account not yours but you designate one or more custodians who are the ones who can actually make withdrawals   any money in this account must be spent in your daughter 's interest but it 's not required to be spent with her approval even as an older child nor on a specific thing it 's not just college money like a 529 account is before you do so you should consider how to set up   some parents simply make themselves custodians some ask another relative to be custodian or joint custodian or even someone like a or close trusted friend   having a joint custodian is helpful if you feel like it may be challenging to not dip into the account if you had financial difficulties as both custodians must sign off on withdrawals finally you should consider whether you want this to be a simple bank account or whether you might want to consider something like vanguard or fidelity investment account   if it 's likely to contain over $ 10,000 or whatever the reduced no fee limit is at the investment firm you choose it may well be worth your while to do this as you can earn significant returns fairly safely assuming the money is intended for longer term use for college or other later in life uses note that for tax purposes this gift will count for 2016 taxes regardless of when you actually set up the account as you have constructively received the gift when the check was given to you   so there 's no rush to work this out before the end of the year you can still deposit it next year   however your daughter needs a ssn to be able to be claimed as a dependent on your taxes so that at least needs doing before the end of the year

the fine print of your credit card agreement will always tell you exactly in what order things are paid off you should have a copy of the agreement and it 's easy to get one if you do n't in most cases i believe the order is this applies to your minimum payment as well as any excess the minimum is n't a separate kind of payment it 's just the minimum you are allowed to make

in the eu prices on consumer focussed sites are quoted inclusive of vat in the usa prices are   quoted exclusive of sales tax consumer pricing is usually driven at least partly by psychological concerns some are more appealing to certain types of buyers than others   the euro vs dollar exchange rate has fluctuated a bit over the years but it 's generally averaged somewhere around 1.2 dollars per euro over the last decade vat has varied around in most cases put these things together and the same headline price points are generally appropriate in both the usa and the eurozone otoh the pound has been worth substantially more than the dollar or the euro so it makes sense to have a lower headline price in the uk b2b focussed sites often quote prices exclusive of vat you need to be aware of this when comparing prices

there are two reasons why most options are n't exercised   the first is obvious and the second less so the obvious an option that 's practically worthless does n't get exercised options that reach expiry and remain unexercised are almost always worthless bets that simply did n't pay off this includes calls with strikes above the current underlying price and puts with strikes below it a heck of a lot of options if an option with value was somehow left to expire it was probably a mistake or else the transaction costs outweighed the value remaining not quite worthless but not worth it either the less obvious an option with value can be cancelled any time before expiration a trader that buys an option may at some point show a gain sooner than anticipated or a loss in excess of his tolerance if a gain he may want to sell before expiry to realize the gain sooner similarly if a loss he may want to take the loss sooner in both cases his capital is freed up and he can take another position and this is the key part the other end matched up with that option sale is often a buyer that had created written exactly such an option contract in the first place the option writer and who is looking to get out of his position option writers are the traders responsible in the first place for creating options and increasing the open interest   anybody with the right kind and level of options trading account can do this a trader that writes an option does so by instructing his broker to sell to open a new instance of the option the trader then has a short position negative quantity in that option and all the while may be subject to the obligations that match the option 's exercise rights the only way for the option writer to get out of that short position and its obligations are these not by choice   to get assigned that is to say a buyer exercised the option the writer has to fulfill his obligation by delivering the underlying if a call to the option holder or buying the underlying if a put from the option holder not by choice the option expires worthless this is the ideal scenario for a writer because 100 of the premium received less transaction costs is profit by choice the writer is free to buy back exactly the same kind of option before expiry using a buy to close order with their broker once the option has been purchased with a buy to close it eliminates the short position and obligation   the option is cancelled   the open interest declines options thus cancelled just do n't live long enough to either expire or be exercised

i 'm sad those programs because 10 20 years ago when i used to fly there would always be a chance for anyone to be randomly upgraded to first class when you are at the gate they would always fill any leftover premium seats with people from economy that were chosen at random no matter what airline or where you were flying you had a decent chance at being selected every so often   now they just give all their free upgrades to people who are in their elite preferred member clubs and regular everyday folk never get them i mean i can obviously see the sense in this plan and i ca n't blame the logic of it but it 's just kinda sad people who are in those executive premium clubs already get to first class through their trips or through frequent flier upgrades meanwhile all the plebs who only fly once a year after saving up to take their family on vacation never get to indulge in first class they only had the chance before through the random upgrades but those are n't a thing anymore since the buisness frequent fliers with the executive clubs are all the upgrades

right the definition of made with 100 chicken changes depending on whether that particular company sources soy protein and chicken separately and mixes them vs purchasing it already mixed the consumer does n't care if this particular company is putting the chicken and the soy together all they care about is what 's in the package that 's what i mean by the fact that at some level everything with chicken is made with 100 chicken legally they ca n't say that it 's made with 100 chicken unless one of the items they purchase from a supplier is just chicken but morally biologically and logically it is the same whether they put the chicken into their mixing pot or an upstream supplier does   lets take a concrete example this breakfast products sandwiches smoke chicken sausage egg whites and cheese sandwiches is made with 100 chicken obviously the entire food product is not chicken but i would n't be surprised if someone walking down the aisle and picking it up thought subconsciously that the patty on it was 100 chicken is it actually no it is chicken and water and other stuff but what we are actually supposed to infer from that language is that the company who makes this sandwich purchases 100 chicken whatever that is and mixes it with the rest of the ingredients to made something which is mostly chicken in legal land that is all that can be inferred from the statement it 's not exactly deceptive but it 's definitely not the clearest terminology that could be employed and it definitely implies something that simply made with chicken does not imply   i agree with you that the package almost always has all the information i would reasonably want on it though and in many cases it is obvious that same sandwich lists all of the ingredients of the patty on the back so the information is right there if you want to go to the small text

banks ca n't simply make loans in the void this is how the cash flow works generally   1 add cash into the bank the bank now has cash 10 of that cash is held on reserve per law this cash is held on the balance sheet as an asset cash and a liability demand deposits    2 someone requests a loan the loan is funded from the non reserved cash of these deposits this results in a lessening of an asset cash and the creation of a new asset loan   3 traditionally as the debtor pays back the loan the interest is distributed in some sort of split between the bank and the depositors this means cash in from the loan and interest and a liability deposits also go up   4 alternatively while the above still happens the bank can securitize the loan and sell that to investors investors then get access to the loan and its income and the bank collects a fee however this means more cash on hand for the bank to originate additional loans without going near the reserve requirement    if a bank extends too many loans and its reserve is threatened it must borrow either from the fed or from other banks these loans must be paid back

one thing that has not been pointed out as a disadvantage of using credit cards   people tend to spend more   you can see this study and this one plus about 500 others   on average people tend to spend about 17 more with credit cards then with cash   this amount any perks one gets by having a credit card    the safest way to use one is to only use them for purchases where you can not make a decision to spend more   one example would be for utility bills that do n't charge a fee or at the gas pump using them at amazon might have you upgrade your purchase or add some extra items   using them at restaurants might encourage you to order an extra drink or two   using them at the coffee shop might have you super size your coffee or add a    of course this extra spending could lead you into a debt cycle exacerbating the financial hit many struggle with   please tread carefully if you decide to use them

say you have $ 15,000 of capital to invest you want to put the majority of your capital into low risk investments that will yield positive gains over the course of your working career   $ 5,000 government bonds and mutual funds split how you want   $ 9,500 low risk trusted companies with positive historical growth if the stock market is very unfamiliar for you i recommend google finance yahoo finance and 's to learn about smart investments you can make you can also research the investments that hedge fund managers and top investors are making google warren buffett or carl icahn portfolio and this will give you an idea of stocks you can put your money into do not leave your money into a certain company for more than 25 years rebalance your portfolio and take the gains when you feel you need them you have no idea when to take your profits now but 5 years from now you will be a smart and experienced investor a safe investment strategy to start is to put your money into an etf that the s&p 500 over the past 20 years the s&p 500 has yielded gains of about 270 during the financial crisis a few years back the s&p 500 had lost over 50 of its value when it reached its low point however from when it hit rock bottom in 2009 it has had as high percentage gains in six years as it did in 12 years from 1995 to 2007 which about 200 the market is very strong and will treat your money well if you invest wisely $ 500 medium high risk speculative stocks there is a reason this category accounts for only approximately 3 of your portfolio this may take some research on the weekend but the returns that may result can be extraordinary speculative companies are often innovative low priced stocks that see high volatility gains or losses of more than 10 over a single month the likelihood of your $ 500 investment being completely evaporated is very slim but if you lose $ 300 here the thousands invested in the s&p 500 low risk stocks government bonds and mutual funds will more than recuperate the losses   if your pick is a winner however expect that the $ 500 investment could easily double triple or gain even more in a single year or over the course of just a few perhaps 2 4 years will see a very large return i hope this advice helps and happy investing sending your money to smart investments is the key to financial security freedom and later a comfortable retirement good luck matt

i 'd lean toward using the $ 3,000 from the emergency fund although depending on your monthly bills a $ 2,000 emergency fund or even a $ 5,000 one may be a bit small but here are a couple of other options for you zero interest balance transfers if you have cards and have a zero balance on them your credit card companies are keen to see you put a balance on them find out if they 're offering any 12 months no interest on balance transfers offers or if any of their rivals is since of course the car loan is an outstanding balance you can transfer you 're not asking them for cash put the $ 3,000 on that zero balance transfer option get rid of the car and pay the $ 300/mo to pay down the balance on the card 10 months later two months before the end of the free period you 're at zero again   without dipping into your emergency fund you 'll also now have a history with that card company of paying back which may lead them to attempt to entice you to go into more debt which you 'll resist of course by increasing the limit if you do n't want a higher limit just tell them to reduce it again a $ 3,000 unsecured loan with no pre payment penalty provided the math works out the interest may be expensive unless you find something with a teaser rate for the first x months but if you find an option do the math on it to see if it 's actually more expensive than carrying the car payments insurance etc on a depreciating asset it may not be as expensive as the 20 rate or whatever makes it sound but again do the math and if you apply your $ 300/mo to it within say 11 months you 're clear again   with a nice little paid back loan on your credit report both of these ensure that you still have your emergency fund at your disposal and both capitalize on the fact that right now you 're probably a good credit risk if you dip into your emergency fund and an emergency happens like loss of a job and you find yourself short of funds you may have trouble securing further credit at that point to cover the gap in your emergency fund

boomers have also bid up the prices of a lot of things everything from stocks to housing simply because they as a bulge were all attempting to in the aggregate buy basically the same things at essentially the same time   basically a lot of demand chasing and driving a supply this often made the previously acquired assets i.e. the early boomer contingent who got there amp bought in first appear to increase quickly in price   the opposite effect will happen as they retire die off either they or their heirs will choose or need to sell off their various accumulated assets   then suddenly the supply will begin to bulge instead selling off portfolios of stocks even required as pensions need to be paid or as boomers reach + 70 1/2 and are mandated by law to begin selling off amp cashing in specific 's of their 401 k and ira holdings and likewise with housing aging boomers will downsize selling off the which they never really needed and which in retirement will be burdensome to maintain and trying to move into or selling off the several second amp third vacation homes   end result will be a big dump of supply of housing onto the market a supply that genx does not have the demographic numbers to consume and which it does not appear the frugal minded genx even want to buy at anything like the same rates the boomers did even if they were capable of paying the price which it also appears they can not having been in career amp salary gains by the bulge of boomers in positions above before them and then the echo boomers which while larger than x are not the equivalent of the original boomers and who are carrying an huge house sized debt load but minus the house and in many cases as debt which can not be erased as it is in student loan form from the beginning of their careers in which they are being paid significantly less than previous generations and who are delaying and then limiting the formation of households as a result   and that is just how demographic play out it was all entirely predictable and was in fact predicted by many

question 1 yes question 2 there is no simple formula car insurance is mostly statistics because you have so many millions of cases that the variance is really low this also means that because the cost can be estimated so precisely it is difficult to make an offer better than the competitors for that reason every insurance company makes there own arbitrary segmentation of the data which leads them identify low risk groups they can offer a bonus to common ones are type of car or and driving experience but it could be anything that is not forbidden by anti discrimination laws also additional perks like towing insurance etc may give them an opportunity do differentiate themselves or to make easy profit   in fact it is a common tactic to offer prices that make close to no profit to fill up your book then raise tariffs in then following years an make you profit with those who are to lazy to switch

i stopped using pre authorized payments for things like telephone etc because it made it more possible likely for a fraudulent charge to sneak by but if there is an occasion for choosing pre authorized payments like charities and places of exact fixed price i use my credit card because then i also get points furthermore i reason perhaps wrongly that if there is intermediary step between actual money bank account and the source of the bill then it gives me better chance of catching and hence a little safer   i am sure other members here will laugh my naivety but there you have it

modern banking is operated under central banking which is critical for a stable economy   without central banking the economy is prone to the boom and bust cycle typical of early industrialization     our money is not backed by nothing it is backed by the faith and credit of the governments issuing them   private banks do n't issue anything   what fractional reserve banking does is say that for ever x amount of dollars you have in your vaults you can make y amount of loans   this ratio is set by the central bank in what is called the reserve ratio   if the fed sets the reserve ratio at 10 and they know the us economy has $ 10 trillion in circulation than $ 100 trillion dollars is going to eventually emerge through fractional reserve banking   this explains inflation   of course the central bank could also raise the reserve ratio forcing banks to call in existing loans   this is deflation    now if you 're a bank and have $ 1 million dollars in the bank a reserve ratio of 10 means you can make up to $ 10 million in loans without getting in trouble with the fed   if the bank makes $ 10 million in loans and only recuperate $ 9 million in loans than they fall below the 10 reserve rate ratio and become insolvent prior to 2008 these banks would go bankrupt but the fed has evolved it 's roll into either bailing a bank out for it to recover and learn from it 's mistakes or to let it go bankrupt   all people 's deposits at these banks however are safe up to $ 250,000 thanks to the fdic to protect from bank runs typical of the early century that boom and bust cycles     please do n't bring in the federal reserve into this unless you want me to prove how stupid you are even more   i 'm poor broke college student with nothing better to do with my time than to win internet arguments right now you ca n't win    too stupid did n't read banks need to make successful loans or they go out of business they do n't create anything out of thin air   they just listen to whatever the central bank tells them what to do

why do people keep talking about 401 k 's at work   that is not dollar cost averaging   dca refers to when you have a large sum of money   do you invest it all at once or spread it out over several smaller purchases over a period of time   there really is n't a when should i use it   it is simply a matter of where your preferences lie on the risk reward   dca has lower risk and lower reward than lump sum investing   in my opinion i do n't like it   dca only works better than lump sum investing if the price drops   but if you think the price is going to drop why are you buying the stock in the first place example your uncle wins the lottery and gives you $ 50,000   do you buy $ 50,000 worth of apple now or do you buy $ 10,000 now and $ 10,000 a quarter for the next four quarters if the stock goes up you will make more with lump than you will with dca if the stock goes down you will lose more with ls than you will with dca if the stock goes up then down you will lose more with dca than you will with ls if the stock goes down then up you will make more with dca than you will with ls so it 's a tradeoff   but like i said the whole point of you buying the stock is that you think it 's going to go up so why pick the strategy that performs worse in that scenario

options reflect expectations about the underlying asset and options are commonly priced using the black scholes model   and are probability functions s is the spot current price of the asset k is the strike price r is the risk free rate and t t represents time to maturity   without getting into the mathematics it to say that higher volatility or expectation of volatility increases the perceived riskiness of the asset so call options are priced lower   and put options are priced higher think about it intuitively if the stock is more likely to go downwards then there 's an increased chance that the call option expires worthless so call options must be priced lower to accommodate the relative change in expected value of the option   puts are priced similarly but they move inversely with respect to call option prices due to put call parity so if call option prices are falling then put option prices are rising note however that call prices falling does not cause put prices to rise the inverse relationship exists because of changes in the underlying factors and how pricing works so the option action signifies that the market believes the stock is headed lower in the given time frame that does not mean it will go lower and option traders assume risk whenever they take a particular position bottom line got ta do your own homework best of luck

this is an older question but things have changed its a common misconception on what the contribution cap is a few things in 2014 the irs did not adjust the maximum contribution from the previous year which include 401(k accounts 403(b accounts most 457 plans and thrift savings plans will be $ 18,000 up $ 500 from $ 17,500 savers and investors aged 50 or older can take advantage of a catch up contribution in 2015 taxpayers who meet this age based criterion can contribute an additional $ 6,000 above the regular maximum of $ 18,000 thus you can contribute a maximum of $ 24,000 into these tax advantaged accounts   the total contribution limit including employer contributions has increased to $ 53,000 you can actually contribute up to   53k including matching so the exact amount you contribute from your actual income may end up being more or less than 24k if you get a poor employer match you can actually contribute more but it would go in as after tax dollars and not claim the tax deduction note after tax does not equal roth   however if your a high salaried individual you can use this as a potential loop hole for funding a roth ira chances are if your making enough money to contribute 53k total contributions then your not going to qualify for a roth however once you retire or possibly before depending on the plan withdraw terms you can roll the after tax money into a roth ira this is a gray area on the tax policy the irs may come back and change their mind about this if considering this option talk to a tax adviser

i would also consider the following factors how stable is your income   are you in an industry that could vanish in the near future   how long would it take you to replace this income   if you are at risk then you need to consider that your lenders do not care how fast you 've paid down your debt   all the care about is that you make next month 's payment   you need to have liquid reserves available to weather any storm current wisdom is 3 6 months expenses   it may be prudent to put this money in gics or t bills   there may be an early withdrawal penalty but at least you wo n't lose your house obviously this is n't as important when you can actually retire all debt what 's your debt level   if it 's more than 3x income then reducing that number might be the most prudent on another note what is your expected retirement income   iras defer the tax to a later year but if you expect a great pension it is feasible that you might be in a higher tax bracket on retirement when you withdraw the funds than you are now a situation that makes indexed retirement planning counterproductive rich people do n't buy iras

short answer yes for federal income tax purposes you are taxed on your total income adding up positives and negatives if business a made say $ 100,000 while business b lost $ 20,000 then your total income is $ 80,000 and that 's what you 'll be taxed on as @littleadv says of course any business losses you claim must qualify as business losses under irs rules and yes there are special rules about losses that the irs considers passive if you have wage income in addition to business income business losses do n't offset wage income for social security and medicare tax purposes you ca n't get a refund of the social security tax deducted from your paycheck i do n't know if this is relevant to you but if you have businesses in different states each is taxed by that state for example i have two tiny side businesses one in michigan and one in ohio last year the michigan business made money while the ohio business lost money so my federal income was michigan minus ohio my ohio income was negative so i owed no ohio income tax but i could n't subtract my ohio losses from my michigan income for michigan income tax purposes thus having say $ 10,000 income in michigan and $ 10,000 in ohio would result in lower taxes than $ 30,000 income in michigan and a $ 10,000 loss in ohio even though the total income in both cases is the same and this would be true even if the tax rates in both states were identical

you are thinking about this very well   with option one you need to think about the 5 d 's in the contract   what happens when one partner becomes disinterested divorced break up does drugs something illegal dies or does not agree with decisions one complication if you buy jointly and decide to break up move on will the other partner be able to refinance   if not the leaving person will probably not be able to finance a new home as the banks are rarely willing to assume multiple mortgage risks for one person   high income large down payment not with standing i prefer the one person rents option to option one   the trouble with that is that it sounds like you are in better position to be the owner and she has a higher emotional need to own     if she is really interested in building equity i would recommend a 15 year or shorter mortgage   building equity in a 30 year is not realistic

automatic can be extremely risky and the closer to the money the options are the riskier their are it is unlikely that the entire account has negative equity since a responsible broker would forcibly close all positions and pursue the holder for the balance of the debt to reduce solvency risk   since the broker has automatically exercised a near the money option it 's solvency policy is already risky regardless of whether there is negative equity or simply a liability the least risky course of action is to sell enough of the underlying to satisfy the loan by closing all other positions if necessary as soon as possible if there is a negative equity after trying to satisfy the loan the account will need to be funded for the balance of the loan to pay for purchases of the underlying to fully satisfy the loan since the underlying can move in such a way to cause this loan to increase the account should also be funded as soon as possible if necessary accounts after exercise for deep in the money exercised options a call turns into a long underlying on margin while a put turns into a short underlying the next decision should be based upon risk and position selection   first if the position is no longer attractive it should be closed   since it 's deep in the money simply closing out the exposure to the underlying should extinguish the liability as cash is not marginable so the cash received from the closing out of the position will repay any margin debt if the position in the underlying is still attractive then the liability should be managed according to one 's liability policy and of course to margin limits in a margin account closing the underlying positions on the same day as the exercise will only be considered a day trade   if the positions are closed on any business day after the there will be no penalty or restriction cash option accounts while this is possible many brokers force an upgrade to a margin account and the sharebuilder options account agreement seems ambiguous but their options trading page implies the upgrade in a cash account equities are not marginable so any margin will trigger a margin call   if the margin debt did not trigger a margin call then it is unlikely that it is a cash account as margin for any security in a cash account except for certain options trades is 100 equities are convertible to cash presumably at the bid so during a call exercise the or 's broker pays cash for the underlying at the exercise price and any deficit is financed with debt thus underlying can be sold to satisfy that debt or be sold for cash as one normally would to a forced exercise as a call holder one could short the underlying but this will be more expensive and since probably no broker allows shorting against the box because of its intended use to circumvent capital gains taxes by fraud   the least expensive way to trade out of options positions is to close them themselves rather than take delivery

i pay taxes on revenue   you do have the ability to deduct expenses though it 's not as comprehensive as what companies can do these figures apply to everybody so those that earn more get taxed more on thee additional income in each bracket meaning the first $ 100,000 of taxable income is taxed the same for everybody at one rate the next $ 100,000 at a different rate etc so you do get to deduct personal expenses and get taxed on profit but since the vast majority of people do n't keep detailed records of what they spend it 's much simpler just to use blanket deduction amounts for everyone companies have much more detailed systems in place to track and categorize expenses so it 's easier to just tax on net profit plus the corporate tax rate is much higher than the average individual tax rate would you trade more deductions for a higher tax rate

since most developed countries view a low but positive inflation rate as ideal it is very likely that we will end up with positive inflation   however modern societies such as japan have experienced extraordinarily long periods of deflation   in their case however it is mostly due to a political unwillingness to impose the costs on savers as savers are politically in control as to your point about things being so much cheaper in our grandparents days this is actually completely untrue for the vast majority of goods when measured in real terms e.g. relative to the median workers wages   today a decent bicycle can be bought with the average worker 's earnings over a few days whereas our grandparents would have had to work over a month   a modern radio can be bought for perhaps an hours worth of work $ 10 on amazon.com but our grandparents may have had to spend months working to buy their first radio   there is no reason for this trend not to continue point is inflation is not such a bad thing so long as wage growth keeps up or exceeds it

gt do you know why it 's so popular i thought other trucks are pretty good too    well for starters because ford the company is considered a more solid brand firm the two chief competitors chevy amp chrysler dodge are considered by some many actually to have themselves in the financial crash of 2008 2009     i know many previously loyal gm fans who swore after it became government motors that they would never buy another gm and the vast majority of them switched over to ford   and chrysler having gone through various owners is likewise looked at somewhat by many   you have to keep in mind that business owners are generally not just thinking of a singular vehicle purchase but of a series of such purchases often over years and decades as well as the supply of parts the availability amp consistency of service amp support whether internal in company shops or at dealers and so on anything amp everything that brings those things into the question mark territory tends to reduce confidence and thus shift the focus onto other brands that seem to be more stable   gt;you're right that they get burned out quickly although i 'd think there 'd be a longevity version of trucks by now    that would be part of the reputation of the f series and especially the f150 it is widely considered to be one of the best longest lasting least problematic vehicles made   toyota trucks very long living   yes and yet no   the history reputation has been a bit more spotty than with ford   the same is true of dodge and the other brands   certainly there will be people who think believe state otherwise i myself own a dodge that i am generally very happy with and i know others who have chevy and other brands and are likewise quite happy with them but over the years ford has built up a solid reputation with it 's truck line

why do banks charge a significantly lesser rate for a 15 yr fixed mortgage than a 30yr though they know it will not earn them the same amount of money   a simplistic model of where banks get the money to lend to borrowers is that they borrow money from investors that want to earn a return on the money that they provide   the actual mechanics of that process are much more complicated but the gist is that if those investors want to tie their money up for a longer period they expect to get a higher return thus 30-year mortgages require a higher interest rate than 15-year mortgages   in addition the usual consensus in the market is that interest rates will rise in the future so interest rates for longer term loans are higher   while it 's true that the bank gets more money overall from a higher rate mortgage the fact that that additional money does n't come until several years into the loan and that money loses value over time due to inflation makes a lower rate 15 year mortgage roughly equivalent to a higher rate 30-year mortgage

the first thing you need to do is to set yourself a budget total all your money coming in from jobs allowances etc and all your money going out including rent utilities loan repayments food other essential and the luxuries   if your money coming in is more than your money going out then you are onto a positive start if on the other hand your money going out is more than the money coming in then you are at the beginning of big trouble you will have to do at least one of 2 things either increase your income or reduce your expenses or both you will have to go through all your expenses money going out and cut back on the luxuries try to get cheaper alternatives for some of your essential and get a second job or increase your hours at your current job the aim is to always have more money coming in than the money you spend the second thing to do is to pay off any outstanding debts by paying more than the minimum amounts and then have some savings goals you said you wanted to save for a car that is one saving goal another saving goal could be to set up a 6 month emergency fund enough money in a separate account to be able to survive at least 6 months in case something happened such as you lost your job or you suddenly got sick next you could look at getting a higher education so you can go out and get higher paying jobs when you do get a higher paying job the secret is not to spend all your extra money coming in on luxuries you should treat yourself but do not go overboard increase the amounts you save and learn how to invest so you can get your savings to work harder for you building a sound financial future for yourself takes a lot of hard work and discipline but once you do get started and change the way you do things you will find that it does n't take long for things to start getting easier the one thing you do have going for you is time you are starting early and have time on your side

yes your business needs to be in the business of making money in order for you to deduct the expenses associated with it i suppose in theory this could mean that if you take in $ 10,000 and spend $ 30,000 every year you not only do n't get a net deduction of $ 20,000 your loss but you have to pay tax on $ 10,000 your revenue however this is super just only deduct $ of your expenses small profit for all the gory details including how they consider whether you have an expectation of profits see this expectation of profit rule appears to apply to things like i sell home items or home decorating advice and therefore need to take several multi week trips to exotic vacation destinations every year and deduct them as business expenses if you 're doing or in your home and selling on etsy you do n't particularly have any expenses it 's hard to imagine a scenario where you consistently sell for less than the cost of materials and then end up dinged on paying tax on revenue

but what about the following scenario which is my paraphrasing of a nanex article i 'm hoping you can help clarify this for me   1 i observe a 1,000 lot advertised for sell on a lit exchange   2 i try to lift the 1,000 by placing a limit order   3 my order goes through some kind of order routing process first 3 orders get executed on a dark pool let 's say i got a 50 lot filled so available offer reduces to 950   4 my order hits a lit exchange i get a partial fill for 100 offer shrinks to 850 but the offered size shrinks instead to 500 or 0   5 now in order to execute my trade i will have to take a higher price than the original advertised liquidity   my question maybe you can answer this is why did my original order size of 1,000 appear in smaller blocks is this because the order routing algorithm breaks up the size   or is it that market makers only post offers in small block sizes e.g. 100 so even if the order book looked like   100 10   100 10   100 10   100 10   100 10   100 10   all the way to 1,000 total as soon as the first 100 shares were lifted the mm can immediately cancel the remainder of the advertised liquidity in practical terms making it impossible to execute large orders at an advertised price

contrary to what you might have heard moving money between mutual funds whether or not in the same family of funds is a taxable event assuming of course that the funds are not in tax deferred retirement accounts about the only thing that is not taxable is moving funds between share classes in the same mutual fund e.g. a conversion from what vanguard refers to as investor shares to admiral shares in the same fund in some cases the admiral shares may have a considerably different price for example vanguard health care fund investor shares and admiral shares are priced at $ and $ respectively and so changing from one class to the other changes the number of shares owned considerably while the net value of the investment remains unchanged

the fact that your ex is on the mortgage limits their ability to get more loans while you have been making the payments on time if you had any problems making those payments it would have also impacted their credit score it is understandable that they would like to be released from the mortgage the options that they have are limited you would have to refinance the mortgage lenders do n't just drop borrowers from a mortgage unless they have determined that the remaining people on the mortgage can make the payments besides the mortgage ownership documents were probably filed with the local government the refinancing process will require a signature by your ex unless the earlier agreement documents removed your ex as an owner and those were filed with the authorities regarding an exchange of funds it can be negotiated an attempt was done with the earlier agreement if the documents that were signed are proof of the agreement ca n't be determined by the internet how this is settled is outside the scope of this site it depends on what documents have been signed in the past the jurisdiction involved and the state of the relationship at the time of the purchase and at the time of the refinancing

considering that it 's common for the monthly mortgage payment to be 25 of one 's income it 's an obvious advantage for that monthly burden to be eliminated   the issue as i see it is that this is the last thing one should do in the list of priorities the idea of no mortgage is great but you might pay early and have just a few years of payments left on the mortgage and if you are unemployed those payments are still due it 's why i 'd suggest loading up retirement accounts and other savings before paying the mortgage sooner your point that rates are low and your expected return is higher is well presented i feel no compulsion to prepay my 3.5 mortgage   as the op is in canada land of no mortgage interest deduction i ignore that till now the deduction simply reduces the effective rate based on the country tax code permitting it it 's not the reason to have a loan but it 's ignorant to ignore the math

i 've asked myself that question many times but this problem seems like by far the most likely reason i did n't get an offer the behavioral interview went smoother than any interview i 've ever done before and i really clicked with the interviewer the other case in this round was pretty easy i wrote out all my calculations my thought process at all times and the numbers i got in the first case worked out perfectly with the interviewer basically confirming i had gotten it right    in this case my interviewer 's cues were telling me i was doing it wrong throughout the entire second section and like i said he basically seemed to give up on letting me try to work it out with a good chunk of time still left in the allotted time i 'm also sure i was a serious candidate for the job as the company had spent a fairly large amount of money flying me out to their headquarters putting me up in a hotel and paying for my meals competition was pretty fierce as far as their backgrounds vs mine but this case really seemed to have been the real cause of my undoing

a perfectly implemented fiat currency printed and by a perfectly perfectly competent and perfectly benevolent central bank let 's call it god money is the ideal   guess i had to come out of the woodwork here sounds like you just described bitcoin   plus it is nice because it is much cheaper and easier to digitally transfer than heavy metal    since bitcoin has a very finite supply and probably upsets keynesian economics   i could see an alt coin that would have an automatic calculation built in to create more money based on inflation

this is basically the same as any other loan out there that defers payments   the bank does n't care because your balance with them keeps going up along with their future profits when you pay that balance back   the only point where this becomes a problem for them is when you get to a point where your monthly income no longer supports the minimum payment required btw this is basically a study of what the us treasury is doing with the national debt and the annual budget deficit but i will go over to before commenting on the wisdom of this

as i understand it us federal gift tax does n't kick in at all until one person gives more than about $ 14,000 in a single year so a couple can give someone $ 28,000 if you want to give more than that in a lump sum while avoiding gift tax one workaround is to structure it as an intra family loan basically you write and formally register a loan for the amount then gift them with up to the limit for them to pay off that loan the irs requires that you charge interest on this loan but the rates are pretty minimal and of course you can incorporate that in the gift the downside is that the interest income you 're required to take is taxable but that 's a small sum on the other hand if the loan is a mortgage against real property and properly filed as such the interest paid may be deductable for the person you 're giving the money to doing this properly requires a tax accountant or lawyer who has a clue about the right legalese to make it work however there are starting to be some services which specialize in this doing it for a fixed fee i used one of those recently which is why i 'm somewhat familiar with this process they made it about as much of a fill out the forms process as they could but it still took a few weeks for me to figure out which options were best for my needs

it seems to me that having a market factor in a risk advantage for a bank that 's backed by its own government is not a subsidy there 's no actual transfer of wealth e.g. from the dept of the treasury to the banks it 's a just benefit of market pricing which is based on the collective opinion of those who make up the bond market    and if the author of the article is stretching the definition of subsidy presumably they 're doing it because they 're trying to make a story here and not because they 're reporting an actual financial transaction

the point is that the bid and ask prices dictate what you can buy and sell at at market at least and the difference between the two or spread contributes implicitly to your gains or losses for example say your $ 1 stock actually had a bid of $ 0.90 and an ask of $ 1.10 i.e. say that $ 1 was the last price you would have to buy the stock at the ask price of $ 1.10 but now you can only sell that stock at the bid price of $ 0.90 thus you would need to make at least that $ 0.20 spread before you can make a profit

here 's an excerpt from visa 's card acceptance guidelines for visa merchants pdf   the merchant name is the single most important factor in cardholder    recognition of transactions therefore it is critical that the    merchant name while reflecting the merchant ’s doing business as    dba name also be clearly identifiable to the cardholder this can    minimize copy requests resulting from merchant    merchant applications typically list the merchant name as the merchant    dba this may differ from the legal name which can represent the    corporate owner or parent company and may differ from the owner ’s    name which for sole proprietorships may reflect the business owner i think that the key statement above is therefore it is critical that the merchant name be clearly identifiable to the cardholder since this merchant was not clearly identifiable to the cardholder they are in breach of a critical point in these guidelines this is from visa but i would assume that all other major credit cards would have similar guidelines for their merchants however keep in mind that these are guidelines and not necessarily rules

the value of an option has 2 components the extrinsic or time value element and the intrinsic value from the difference in the strike price and the underlying asset price with either an american or european option the intrinsic value of a call option can be locked in any time by selling the same amount of the underlying asset whether that be a stock a future etc   further the time value of any option can be by delta hedging the option i.e. buying or selling an amount of the underlying asset weighted by the measure of certainty delta of the option being in the money at expiry instead the extra value of the american option comes from the financial benefit of being able to realise the value of the underlying asset early for a dividend paying stock this will predominantly be the dividend but for non dividend paying stocks or futures the buyer of an in the money option can realise their intrinsic gains on the option early and earn interest on the profits today but what they sacrifice is the of the option   however when an option becomes very in the money and the delta approaches 1 or -1 the discounting of the intrinsic value i.e. the extra amount a future cash flow is worth each day as we draw closer to payment becomes larger than the theta or time value decay of the option then it becomes optimal to early exercise abandon the optionality and realise the monetary gains upfront for a non dividend paying stock the value of the american call option is actually the same as the european the spot price of the stock will be lower than the forward price at expiry discounted by the risk free rate or your cost of funding this will exactly offset the monetary gain by exercising early and banking the proceeds however for an option on a future the value today of the underlying asset the future is the same as at expiry and its possible to fully realise the interest earned on the money received today hence the american call option is worth more for both examples the american put option is worth more slightly more so for the stock as the stock 's spot price is lower than the forward price the owner of the put option a higher intrinsic profit from selling the stock at the higher strike price today than waiting till expiry as well as realising the interest earned liquidity may influence the perceived value of being able to exercise early but its not a tangible factor that is added to the commonly used maths of the option valuation and is n't really a consideration for most of the assets that have tradeable option markets it 's also important to remember at any point in the life of the option you do n't know the future price path you 're only modelling the distribution of probable outcomes what subsequently happens after you early exercise an american option no longer has any bearing on its value this is now zero whether the stock subsequently crashes in price is what is relevant is that when you early exercise a call you give up all potential upside protected by the limit to your downside from the strike price

johnfx and provide excellent answers researching prices others have paid being up front that you 'll go buy a junker car to hold you over if they wo n't meet your price and playing a few dealerships off of each other are all great tactics in addition i 've got a few points about timing your purchase if you 're not desperate for a car these can really help give you the upper hand in negotiations wait until the end of the month dealerships and individual salespeople usually have quotas that they 're trying to clear and the month is usually the standard cutoff the last time i bought a car the salesman made the mistake of mentioning i do n't usually work but i 'll be in this thursday thursday was the 31st i inferred from this information that he had n't made his quota for the month yet so i came back on the 31st to negotiate and managed to hammer out a pretty good deal wait until about an hour before the dealership closes to show up and shop this gives you enough time to not be obvious about the tactic but you 'll definitely be holding them past their normal quitting time if you do much negotiating the salesman will be   a little more inclined to make a deal so he can get home and have dinner bonus points if you can wait until a month that ends on a friday

we all buy stuff from time to time that only satisfies us for a short time i was able to locate a few expenses that fall under that category i see a lot answers that focus on not getting these things i 'm going to tell you how to at least attempt to have your cake and eat it too if you can get these things without paying for them or by paying pennies on the dollar for them you 'll no longer want to buy them at full price begin by making a list of the items you ca n't stop thinking about   go to your local library and look for relevant items that are on your list if they are not yet available request that the library purchase them and reserve them for when the items come in   yes libraries are usually tax supported but to give back if you ca n't afford to contribute to the library immediately you can still promote their fund raising or book media drive efforts if you do n't mind buying things that may be second hand thrift stores and garage or yard sales can have anything the ones near you may have one or two items on your list of things you were looking for for pennies on the dollar   other items might be things you can share with friends borrow or swap things until you get bored of them if you do n't have a network of friends with shared interests there may be a local or relevant group you can join   the key here is to try to contribute more than you take and you probably have things you do n't need that you can start with trading and do n't keep careful score the upshot is you 'll not only save money but make friends while doing it you can sometimes have your cake and eat it too these recommendations can get you the short term happiness you were looking for without spending the money and when the happiness is gone you wo n't feel like you need to hang on to the item indefinitely you can pass it on for others to enjoy

if these are children that may be employed in a few years it may well be worth walking them through some basics of the deductions around employment some basic taxes uses of banks and give them enough of a basis in how the economy of the world works   for example if you get a job and get paid $ 10/hour that may sound good but how much do various things eat at that so your take home pay may be much lower   while this does presume that the kids will get jobs somewhere along the way and have to deal with this it is worth making this part of the education system on some level rather than shocking them otherwise rather than focusing on calculations i 'd be more tempted to consider various scenarios like how do you use a bank what makes insurance worth health car and any others may be worth teaching on some level and how does the government and taxes fit into things while i may be swinging more for the practical it is worth considering if these kids will be away in college or university in a few years how will they handle being away from the parents that may supply the money to meet all the financial needs

i 'd hazard that jim is mostly worried that people are getting ripped off by high employer 401(k fund fees a lot of employers offer funds with fees over 1 a year this sounds low ish if you do n't realize that the real inflation adjusted return for the fund will probably average out to about 4 so it 's really something like a quarter of your earnings gone with an ira you do n't have to do that you can get an ira provider which offers good cheap index funds and the like cough vanguard cough fund fees will probably be closer to however the maximum ira contribution in 2013 will be $ 5,500 the maximum for a 401(k contribution will be $ 17,500 that extra capacity is enough to recommend a 401(k over an ira for many people these people may be best served by putting money into the 401(k and then rolling it over into a rollover ira when they change jobs also certain people have retirement plans which offer them good cheap index funds these people probably do n't need to worry quite as much finally having two accounts is more complicated please contact someone who knows more about taxes than i am to figure out what limitations apply for contributing to both iras and 401(k)s in the same year

is it common in the us not to pay medical bills or do i misunderstood what had been said i would feel comfortable saying that most people who face medical bills do n't pay them   they are unable   if they were able they would have gotten medical insurance   in america something like 55 of individuals do not have even $ 500 of savings so when a big medical bill rolls in especially on top of lost work hours they do n't have a lot of options   hospitals charge reasonable prices to insurance companies and medicare these fees are negotiated in advance and reflect the hospital 's actual costs   this is called usual reasonable and customary   hospitals charge a wildly inflated criminally outrageous cash price to the uninsured for instance back when medicare paid about $ 175 for an ambulance ride a friend was billed $ 1100 for the exact same thing    the hospital aims to scare the living out of the patient caring nothing about what that does to their health perfect world the patient pays them the $ 1100 instead of paying their rent   if the patient puts up a fight they hope to haggle them down to something like $ 400 remember it really costs $ 175 this tactic is a huge profit center for hospitals even the charity hospitals and they feel justified because so many uninsured do n't pay at all the hospital considers them deadbeats well patients do n't pay because cash prices are so they just give up anyway your friends are correct do n't even think of paying those cash billing amounts research and find out what medicare pays offer 60 of that and haggle it to 100   and sleep well knowing you paid what is fair not all services are as overpriced as my example but most are at least 50 too high   the hospital does send you all the bills as a formality even while they submit them to your insurance company and then the insurance company usually pays them so it is correct to not pay that bill a lot of medical offices will check with your insurance company even before you leave the office and ask you to immediately pay anything the insurance wo n't cover   for instance they often have co pays where you pay $ 20 and they pay the rest to be clear if your insurance company negotiates a rate with the hospital say $ 185 for the ambulance ride that is your price which you are entitled to as a member of that insurance system a lot of people get their livelihood from the inefficiency in medical insurance and billing   their political power is why it 's so hard for america to install a simpler system or even replace obamacare in an ideal political environment   it is also a big part of why america spends 18 of gdp on healthcare instead of 7 11 like our european peers who do not have to account for every or multiple insurers   sorting out who pays would be expensive even if everyone did pay

unless you have a lot of money to get rid of you should spend at least a year trading with a dummy account it takes a long time to work out what is gong on and your training will get very expensive if you start using real money do n't start trading with real money until you have a strategy never trade on a whim only trade if your strategy says it is time to trade are able to stick to that strategy it is amazing how easy it is to stray from your strategy just because you feel it is right or you have to try to make up some losses you will lose money doing this you are making significant profits for at least 6 months using 1 and 2 with your dummy account even after all this you will probably still lose money make sure you only trade with money you can afford to lose ie never trade with this months rent money

i 've read multiple times that the way to rebuild the credit score is to get a credit card and then have some minor charges on it every month and have them paid in full every month old negative events age and this disciplined activity rebuild the score to some not to horrible levels now it 's true that it 's hard to get reasonably good credit cards when your credit score is poor yet it 's not necessary to have a good credit card for this case such things as large credit limit are not needed all that 's needed is a long grace period so that there 's no interest between the moment a charge is done and a moment the bill is paid in full at the end of the month yes the card may have rather high interest and rather low credit limit but it does n't really matter i 've read once on msn money that people are offered credit even while they 're in the middle of bankruptcy so it 's not impossible to get a credit card in the described situation goes without saying that a lot of discipline will be needed to have all this implemented

the real reason credit cards are so popular in the us is that americans are lazy and broke and the credit card companies know how to market to that   have you ever heard of the $ 30k millionaires these were individuals that purchased as if they were some of the wealthy elite but had no real money to back it up american society has pushed the idea of living on credit for quite some time now an idea that is even by watching the us government operate solely on credit raise the debt ceiling much live in america for more than six months and you will be bombarded with pre approved deals with low introductory rates that are designed to sucker the average consumer into opening multiple accounts that they do n't need then they try and get you to carry a balance by allowing low minimum payments that could take in the neighborhood of 20 years to pay off depending on carried balance this in turn pads the credit companies pockets with all of the interest you now pay on the account the few truly wealthy americans do not purchase on credit

these are all factually correct claims s corporation is a pass through entity so whatever gain you have on the corporate level is passed to the shareholders if your s corp has capital gains you 'll get your pro rata share of the capital gains interest the same dividends you get it on your k-1 earned income taxed as such to you i.e. whether you earn income as a s corp or as a sole proprietor matters not that 's the answer to your bottom line question the big issue however is this you can not have more than 25 passive income in your s corp you pass that limit three consecutive years one off is ok your s corp automatically converts to c corp and you 're taxed at the corporate level at the corporate rates you then lose the capital gains rates personal brackets etc this means that an s corp can not be an investment company most of its income has to be earned not passive another problem with s corp is that people who work as self proprietors incorporated as s corp try to abuse it and claim that the income they earned by the virtue of their own personal performance should n't be taxed as self employed income irs upon such a position and if considerable amounts are at stake will take you all the way up to the tax court to prove you wrong this has happened before you should talk to a licensed tax adviser ea cpa attorney licensed in your state to educate you about what s corp is and how it is taxed and whether or not it is appropriate for you
