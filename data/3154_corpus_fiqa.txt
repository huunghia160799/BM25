that looks like a bloomberg terminal and like said it would appear to be the symbol for the s&p 500 e mini index future although it does n't look right all on its own as it should have a indicating the month or quarter of expiry however since it appears on a bloomberg terminal in the image i checked a source for bloomberg symbol lists and found one of two possibilities for it is most likely the s&p 500 e mini future cme e mini futures   e mini s&p 500     index the only alternative was 3 month    i think the former is far more likely as the latter has the commodity tag instead of index as the tag in the image also it is n't the which pertains to sustainability indices and something with the eurozone also bloomberg indices here we go excerpt straight is from a presentation presentation on charting from a business school pdf see 13 and appears to be a straight excerpt from september 2007 bloomberg documentation i did n't know any other way to it besides taking a screen shot then uploading to or of course see 13 in the referenced pdf i 've attached   see

is the bloomberg symbol for the cme e mini s&p 500 front month continuous contract   etc will likewise yield the 2nd and 3rd months   which exact futures contract this symbol refers to will change about once a month
# 366526
that looks very much like an s&p 500 e mini index future   however is a strange symbol   futures have the month of expiry encoded in their symbol as well   for example the september 2011 future in this series would be i 'm not very familiar with bloomberg so perhaps this is the front contract i.e. the one that 's closest to expiry in the is case the september 2011 one only problem is that prices do n't exactly match what cme has high of and low of for when this page gets out of date     but they are so close i suspect it must be some sort of s&p 500 index future

many folks use bonds to diversify their portfolio since bonds rise and fall in value at different times and for different reasons than stocks bonds pay interest on a regular basis usually monthly or quarterly and so some people invest in bonds in order to match the interest payments to some regular expense they might have the interest payment does not change fixed income   for individual bonds there is a maturity date at which you can expect to receive the face value of the bond the issuer 's creditworthiness is important here you can make a little money on a bond by buying it when its value is lower than its face value and either selling later for a higher value or waiting for it to mature   often the minimum investment for a single bond is high so if you do n't have a large enough amount you can still get the performance of bonds through a bond fund these do not mature so you do n't have a guarantee of a return of your investment however they have access to more bonds than retail investors so the funds can keep your money more fully invested if you do n't need the income you can reinvest the dividends and have a little extra capital growth this way

i was wondering if i could make part of the payment here in usd legally although not directly illegal from an india tax and point of view this would be a bit complicated   a nri seller can not repatriate the proceeds from sale of house unless he had purchased this from nre account and repatriation is only possible for original purchase amount for the gains seller has to apply for repatriation of funds a nri seller has to pay taxes on gains and this transaction should not look like facilitating a tax fraud in case nri seller does not pay his taxes as a buyer if you make the purchase from your nre account i.e. move us funds into india into nre account it will ease you ability to repatriate funds in future depending on the property value and pan card availability of seller you have to deduct 1 to tax from the value and deposit this with income tax india ps it is recommended that you consult a professional ca to help you with

generally the paperwork realtors use is pre written and pre approved by the relevant state and real estate organizations the offers contracts etc etc a pretty straightforward and standard you can ask a realtor for a small fee to arrange the documents for you smaller than the usual 5 sellers fee they charge i would say 0.5 or a couple of hundreds of dollars flat fee would be enough for the work you can try and get these forms yourself sometimes you can buy them in the neighborhood staples or from various law firms and legal plans that sell standard docs you can get a lawyer to go over it with you for almost nothing i used the legalzoom plan for documentation review and it cost me $ 30 business plan individual is cheaper to go over several purchase contracts $ 30 is a monthly subscription but you do n't have to pay it for more than one month but these are standard so you do it once and you know how to read them all if you have a legal plan from work this may cover document review and preparation preparing a contract that is not a standard template can otherwise cost you hundreds of dollars title company will not do any paperwork for you except for the deed itself they can arrange the deed and the recording escrow and title insurance but they will not write a contract for the parties to use you have to come with the contract already in place and with escrow instructions already agreed upon some jurisdictions require using a lawyer in a real estate transaction if you 're in a jurisdiction usually on a county level that requires the transaction to go through a lawyer then the costs will be higher

buying shares back is an indication that the company has nothing better to do with their money   true   however buying the shares back is essentially moving money around the firms or individuals they buy from will invest their money differently   mergers and acquisitions are productive though   the idea is that you combine things to work more efficiently   for example a small startup might have a great product but not a lot of infrastructure or cash   so the big guys with both buy em up   or big companies might have redundant expenditures in infrastructure or employees and by merging they can produce more efficiently   the term you keep using real economy is a strange one   the above parties are part of the real economy   really   what may i ask is your education in economics   what books have you read on the subject classes taken jobs worked podcasts listened to etcetera that are giving you these ideas

one important thing that has n't been mentioned here is that the vast majority of companies have eventually eliminated their company provided pension plans and replaced it with a 401 k with some degree of matching   there is a cost advantage to doing this as companies no longer have to maintain or work to maintain a 100 vested pension plan   this takes a great burden off them   they also do n't have to manage the pension annuity that the retirement benefit entails

bonds are priced very high because their price is compared to their yields with the current interest rates which are very low the bond yields will be low however bond issuers still need the money so there still will be high par value and investors will not sell bonds at a loss unless there 's a better investment = bonds with better yields once the rates start going up you 'll see bonds with current rates dropping in value significantly once alternatives appear people holding them will start dumping them to move the money somewhere more profitable similarly the stocks since there 's no other investment alternatives yields on the bonds are low interests are low people invest more in the stocks once the rates go up the investors will start rebalancing portfolios and cashing out

hi accounting major here   a lot of people mentioned both tax advantages and cheap money money you can borrow at a low interest rate   another reason businesses do this is to reward investors generally people with stock in a company want to see some of its operations financed with debt instead of all of it financed from investors money or profit this way the company can grow more and still pay better dividends to its investors however you do n't want too much debt either it 's a balance and a way to see how much debt vs equity a company has is called a leverage ratio leverage = debt hope this helps

pay off the highest interest loan rate first you must be doing something funky with how long your terms are if you give a bit more info about your loan 's such as the term and how much extra you have right now to spend it could be explained in detail why that would be the better choice using your numbers you have to make sure when you are analyzing your different loan options that you make sure you are comparing apples to apples ie make sure that you are either comparing the present value future value or amortization payments   edit using some of your numbers lets say you have 5000 dollars in your pocket you have 3 options excel makes these calculations easier do nothing in 80 months your student loan will be payed in full and you will have owing on your mortgage and 5000 in your no bank interest   for mortgage pay off student loan and allocate student loans amortization to mortgage in 80 months you will have $ owing on mortgage and student loan will be paid in full for mortgage pay 5000 on mortgage in 80 months student loan will be paid in full and you will have $ owing on mortgage for mortgage

the papers you would need to buy are called futures and they give you the right to buy or sell a certain amount of oil at a certain location some large harbor typically for a certain price on a certain day you can typically sell these futures anytime if you find someone that buys them and depending on the direction you bought you will make or lose money according to oil rice changes if you have the future to get oil for 50 $ and the market price is 60 this paper is obviously worth 10 $ note that you will have to sell the future at some day before it runs out or you get real oil in some harbor somewhere for it which might not be very useful to you as most traders do n't want really any oil that might happen automatically or by default but you need to make sure of that note also that worst case you could lose a lot more money than you put in if you buy a future to deliver oil for 50 $ and the oil price runs you will have to procure the oil for new price meaning pay the current price for it there is no theoretical limit so depending on what you trade you could lose ten times or a thousand times what you invested i worded that without technical lingo so it is clear for beginners this is the concept not the full technical explanation

first of all debt is a technology that allows borrower to bring forward their spending it 's a financial time machine from borrowers point of view debt is good when it increases overall economic utility   a young person wants to bring up a family but can not afford the house had they waited for 30 years they would have reached the level of income and savings to buy the house for cash by the time it might be too late to raise a family sure they 'd enjoy the house for the last 20 years of their life but they would loose 30 years of utility they could have enjoyed the house for 50 years so for a reasonable fee they can bring the spending forward   another young person might want to enjoy a life of luxury using the magical debt time machine and bringing forward their future earnings they might spend 10 years worth of future earnings on entertainment within a year and have a blast due to the law of diminishing marginal utility all that utility is pretty much wasted but they 'll still will need to make sacrifices in the future the trick is to roughly match the period of debt repayment to the economic life of the purchase buying a house means paying over 30 years for an asset that has an economic life of 80 given that the interest fee is reasonable and the house wo n't loose it 's value overnight that 's a good debt buying a used car with a remaining life of 5 years and financing its with a seven years loan is not a good idea buying a luxurious holiday that lasts a fortnight with 2 years of repayments i.e. financing non essential short term need with medium term debt is insane the other question is could the required utility be achieved through a substitute at a lower cost without having to bring the spending forward or paying the associated fee

your colleague made a simple and incorrect assumption that as our society 's technology improves we will use that technology to replace labor with capital keeping output constant   clearly this is a contrived example but it illustrates the point effectively   suppose we have a factory that produces some level of output and employs 1000 workers   say a technological breakthrough is developed that allows that factory to produce the same level of output using only 500 workers   your colleague is assuming those 500 people will lose their jobs   but who is to say the factory wo n't just double its output   in fact since the industrial revolution that is precisely what we 've seen   since the beginning of the industrial revolution workers have shunned more productive capital in fear they will be replaced   historically that has not been the case   society instead has used the more productive capital to produce more output

i believe that is the purpose of write offs aka loopholes to save people money on their taxes   the tax code is an incentive system right now there are huge incentives for corporations to organize themselves in odd ways to avoid taxes if we restructure the tax code the behavior will change no sense in blaming companies for playing by the rules

since i personally agree with the investment thesis of peter schiff i would take that sum and put it with him in a managed account and leave it there i 'm not sure how to find a firm that you like the investment strategy of   i think that it 's too complicated to do as a side thing   someone needs to be spending a lot of time researching various instruments and figuring out what is undervalued or what is exposed to changing market trends or whatever i basically just want to give my money to someone and say i agree with your investment philosophy let me pay you to manage my money too no one knows who is right of course   i think schiff is right so that 's where i would put the amount of money you 're talking about   if you disagree with his investment philosophy this does n't really make any sense to do for that amount of money though i think firms would be willing to sit down with you and sell you their services   you could ask them how they would diversify this money given the goals that you have for it and pick one that you agree with the most

then at the end if you decide to cash in your house you can roll the    proceeds into a fancier house to avoid paying taxes on your profit the problem is that the book was written in 1989 that comment is no longer true that part of the tax law changed in the 1990 's also in 1989 the maximum amount that person could put in an ira was $ 2,000 and had n't been raised for almost a decade and would n't be raised for another decade roth accounts did n't exist nor did hsa 's or 529 's most people did n't have a 401k. you are asking to compare what options we have today compared to what was available in the late 1980 's   for me except for the years 2001 2005 and 2010 2015 the period from 1988 until now has had flat real estate values still the current values have n't returned to the peak in 2005 the score is 11 great years 17 flat or negative i know many people who during the 1990 's had a zero return on their real estate

if i were you i would rent   wait to buy a home   here is why when you say that renting is equal in cost to a 30-year mortgage you are failing to consider several aspects   see this recent answer for a list of things that need to be considered when comparing buying and renting you have no down payment   between the two of you you have $ 14,000 but this money is needed for both your emergency fund and your fiancée 's schooling in your words we ca n’t afford a home   a home is a big financial commitment   if you buy a home before you are financially ready it will be continuous trouble    if you need a cosigner you are n't ready to buy a home   i would absolutely advise whoever you are thinking about cosigning for you not to do so   it puts them legally on the hook for a house that you ca n't yet afford you are n't married yet   you should never buy something as big as a home with someone you are n't married to there are just too many things that can go wrong   see comments for more explanation   wait until you are married before you buy your income is low right now   and that is okay for now you 've been able to avoid the credit card debt that so many people fall into however you do have student loans to pay and taking on a huge new debt right now would be potentially disastrous for you   your family income will eventually increase when your fiancée gets her degree and gets a job and at that time you will be in a much better situation to consider buying a house you need to move asap buying a house when you are in a hurry is a generally a bad idea when you look for a home you need to take some time looking so you are n't rushed into a bad deal that you will regret even if you decide you want to buy you should first find a place to rent then you can take your time finding the right house   to answer your question about escrow when you own a house two of the required expenses that you will have besides the mortgage payment are property taxes and homeowner 's insurance   these are large payments that are only due once a year   the bank holding the mortgage wants to make sure that they get paid   so to help you budget for these expenses and to ensure that these expenses are paid the bank will add these to your monthly mortgage payment and set them aside in a savings account called an escrow account   then when these bills come due once a year they are paid for out of the escrow account

let 's say that you bought a share of apple for $ 10 when if ever their stock sold for $ 10 it was a very small company with a very small net worth that is the excess of assets over liabilities your $ 10 share was perhaps a share of a tiny company over the years apple has developed both software and hardware that have real value to the world no one knew they needed a smartphone and particularly an iphone until apple showed it to us the same is true of ipads ipods apple watches etc because of the sales of products and services apple is now a huge company with a huge net worth obviously your share of the company is now worth a lot more perhaps it is worth $ 399 maybe you think apples good days are behind it after all it is harder to grow a huge company 15 a year than it is a small company so maybe you will go into the marketplace and offer to sell your share of apple if someone offers you $ 399 would you take it   the value of stocks in the market is not a ponzi scheme although it is a bit speculative you might have a different conclusion and different research about the future value of apple than i do your research might lead you to believe the stock is worth $ 399 mine might suggest it 's worth $ 375 then i would n't buy the value of stocks in the market is based on the present and estimated future value of living breathing companies that are growing shrinking and steady the value of each company changes all the time so then does the price of the stock real value is created in the stock market when real value is created in the underlying company

let 's do a real example of leverage on the spy imagine you have $ 20 k today and plan on having $ 100 k by jan 2018   you could get 100 shares of spy and ride it out   maybe buying another 100 shares every few months until 2018 ending up with less than 500 shares to your name and zero cash in the bank or you could lever with dec 2017 leap calls they 'll expire in 2.5 years so you 'd have to re up sooner than your plan    with 20 k starting cash in my example we 'll go with 5 contracts to start with   if we choose the $ 230 strike they 'd cost $ 1250 each putting roughly $ at risk    the plan in is if the stock market goes up you 've got leverage   you are the proud owner of contracts worth 500 shares of spy and have only spent 1/3rd of your present day dollars   if the market goes down in the next two years sure you lost the entire $ but likely saved $ powder dry and can try your luck with the 2021 leaps    probably get down votes for this but i 'll even argue that proper use of leverage can very much reduce your risk    one truth is you 'll never get a margin call from holding long options

i believe that an understanding of the taxation system can help to understand our place in it and how that impacts each of our personal finances i will try to remain unbiased here but this is a somewhat subjective question so please bear with me if you disagree on any point some of these tax savings are well advertised and can be used by many people such as tax credits for mass transit passes which exists in some countries but some of these tax savings are things you never heard of before until it winds up on the news why do some people seem to get tax savings that you and i can not get and why do those people always seem to have so much more money than us a simplistic answer can show this in three parts 1 the source of one 's income 2 transaction costs and 3 tax loopholes tax savings occur proportionately to one 's income and if the savings apply to investment income they occur proportionately to one 's wealth if someone living paycheck to paycheck with a minimal amount in a bank account saves tax on investment income they might reduce their taxable interest from $ 50 to $ 0 that 's because they simply do n't have any other investment income to reduce all of their income comes in the form of employment which is typically very hard to save taxes on most governments have a very firm grasp on the taxation of employment income because it is a huge proportion of income in the country and therefore has the largest amount of tax associated and because it is very straightforward work for someone = employment income a more cynical person than i might point out that investment income is earned by the very wealthy who can afford to lobby for politicians to pass favourable investment income laws even very straightforward tax saving opportunities may cost money to enable the simplest example would be if a tax saving opportunity is so complicated that an average person ca n't understand it themselves then an accountant lawyer or banker will need to be the one to explain it and that can cost you money if your tax is n't so much to begin with then the transaction costs to achieve the tax savings could be higher than the tax savings themselves for example most countries have tax savings deferrals if you start a corporation these rules typically exist to promote investment in the local economy but someone who earns $ 10k in a side business might not be able to afford the $ 3k in incorporation costs just to save $ 2k in taxes the more income and wealth you have the more these transaction costs become worthwhile i 'm going to generally define tax loopholes for the purposes of this answer as something where a somewhat arbitrary situation allows for taxes that a layman would consider unfair or unexpected this often occurs with good intentions but poor legislation the government tries to provide a benefit to a deserving group or to promote an activity but ends up allowing another group to take advantage   for example in canada there existed until a few years ago tax saving rules about passing on wealth to children at lower tax rates only when a close family member is near death setting up a testamentary trust between a grandparent and a could in some circumstances allow that trust to be created with additional tax brackets meaning more income would be taxed at a less than top tax rate before being distributed to the grandchildren   the rules were put in place with the idea that oh gee a family member has died and the ol' family is so hard they ca n't distribute the wealth to the next generation for a few months on account of all the crying we should make it so that the estate is taxed like a person and if they earn only a little income they have a low tax rate and they only get taxed at the full rate if they have a lot of income seems reasonable enough but if a family is ready to pass on wealth at the same time as someone is the bucket with their foot a morbid discussion with your lawyer and accountant could set your children up for life with forever reduced taxes on massive inheritances   in the case of the panama paradise leaks tax savings are due to all 3 of the above those who have massive wealth and therefore earn the majority of their income from investments instead of employment can afford the transaction costs associated with taking advantage of specific tax loopholes the simplest example of which is just that income earned in a foreign country might have a lower tax rate than income earned domestically this is often a result of cracks in the foreign tax treaties between countries which exist generally to promote business between countries and prevent double taxing individuals who need activity in both countries for whatever reason take for example the apple loophole apple has operations around the world some activity occurs in low tax jurisdictions apple reports a high percentage of the value of r&d as being associated with those jurisdictions those branches in low tax jurisdictions charge the high tax branches such as the us with fees for use of their valuable research so much of apple 's income is reported in those foreign jurisdictions it wo n't be taxed in the us until apple the cash back to the us until then the cash sits in the foreign jurisdiction accruing less tax this and similar rules can be used by individuals wealthy enough to hold corporations in foreign jurisdictions with low tax rates how each particular rule loophole works will depend on the nature of a specific case tax law is complex and the rules between countries are even more so these foreign tax loopholes are closing every year it is getting harder and harder to hide money offshore and it is getting less and less likely that you will be able to find a country with the right loopholes for your own offshore wealth these types of news leaks will only help to expedite those changes

the matching funds are free money so it is a very good idea to take that money off the table   look at it as free 100 return you deposit $ 1000 your employer matches that $ 1000 you now have $ 2000 in your 401(k   obviously i 'm keeping things simple   vesting schedules mean that the employer match is n't yours to keep immediately but rather after some time usually in chunks beyond the employer match you need to consider what is available for investment in a 401(k   typically your options are more limited then in an ira   the cost of the 401(k should be considered as it is n't trivial for most   the specifics will of course vary but in large ira accounts are cheaper so it 's about the opportunity costs   up to the employer match it does n't matter as much that your investment choices are more limited in a 401(k because you 're getting 100 return just on the matching funds   once that is exhausted you have more opportunity for returns due to having more options available to you by going with an account that provides more choices the overall principle here is that you have to look at the whole picture   this is similar to the notion that you should pay down your high interest debt before investing because from the perspective of investing the interest you 're paying represent a loss or negative return on investment since money is going out of your accounts   specific to your question you have to consider the various types of investment vehicles available to you   it is not just about 401(k and ira accounts   you may also consider a straight brokerage account a savings account cds etc   the costs and returns that you can typically expect are your guides through the available choices

before starting with investing you should make sure you are saving enough   living in a welfare country france does not exempt you from potentially needing to save large amounts of money you state that you do not need much of an emergency day fund but this is not true   being dismissed from your job is not the only way to become unemployed and not all roads lead to unemployment pay   being fired for cause or leaving your job voluntarily are two work related causes that will leave you without an income source   unexpected major expenses are another reason you might need to dip into your emergency fund if your emergency fund is in order the next thing to investigate is your pension and saving for retirement   in a country with a strong pension system you need to check how comfortable you are with its sustainability greece anyone and also whether it will adequately meet your needs   if not there are no 401ks or iras in france but there is a relatively new personal supplementary pension plan that you might investigate contributing to if you 're comfortable with your emergency fund and your retirement savings then preparing for buying a house is likely your next savings goal   a quick search shows that to get a mortgage to buy a house in france banks will commonly require a downpayment of 20 plus various closing costs   see for example here   this is 40,000 + euro for a 200k euro house which will take you several years at the rate of 500 euro month   france has special plans plan with tax exempt interest for saving up for a house that you might want to investigate in your other question you also ask about buying a cheap car   as you get older and possibly start a family having a car will likely become more of a necessity   this is another goal you can save for rather than having to take a loan out when you buy one

question 2 some financial institutions can provide a way to invest small amounts with low or no cost fees over a period of time like monthly weekly etc   for instance a few brokerages have a way to buy specific etfs for no cost outside of the total expense ratio question 3 when someone says that investing is like buying a lottery ticket they are comparing an event that almost always has at least a 99.9 of no return large winnings to an event that has much better odds   even if i randomly pick a stock in the s&p 500 and solely invest in it over the course of a given year i do not face a 99.9 chance of losing everything so comparing the stock market to a lottery unless a specific lottery has much better odds keep in mind that some of these jackpots have a of no return is not the same   unfortunately nothing truly safe exists risk may but it 's always present instead the probability of something being safe and or generating a return may be true for a given period of time while in another given period of time may become untrue one may argue that holding cash is safer than buying an index fund or stock etf mutual fund etc and financially that may be true over a given period of time for instance the usd beat the spy for the year of 2008   benjamin franklin per a biography i 'm reading argued that the stock market was superior to gold from the context it sounds like the cash of his day because of what the stock market represents essentially you 're betting on the economic output of workers   it 's like saying in an example using oil that i believe that even though oil becomes a rare resource in the long run human workers will find an alternative to oil and will lead to better living standards for all of us do like the roman and empires collapse   yes and would holding the market in those days fail   yes   but cash and gold might be useless too because we would still need someone to exchange goods with and we would need to have the correct resources to do so if everyone in a city owns gold gold has little value   the only safe bet in those days would be farming skill land crops and or livestock because even without trading one could still provide some basic necessities

it can be done but i believe it would be impractical for most people i.e. it would likely be cheaper to fly to europe from other side of the world to handle it in person if you can   it also depends on where you live you should take a look if there are any branches or subsidiaries of foreign banks in your country the large multinational banks most likely can open you an account in their sister bank in another country for say a couple hundred euro in fees

i worked at a best buy for a summer   i worked in merch basically i was a stock boy and we sold something greater than 80 of the product if i remember correctly   people mostly do n't want need a person to help them   that said even though i was n't really supposed to talk to customers i still really enjoyed helping them   i even sent a few home to the internet to order basic computer hardware because our store prices were stupid expensive more than a similar product online   i was n't ranked on how many stupid extended warranties i sold though because i was merch and not sales   that shit was stupid   most of the products they sell at best buy are disposable   even the more expensive items will probably last longer than is worth trying to get them fixed   but that shit gets pushed on employees and if they want to get raises they push it on customers   margins are shit on lots of the stuff they sell though   except car audio   car audio has a massive mark up

the difference between dividend and growth in mutual funds has to do with the types of stocks the mutual fund invests in typically a company in the early stages are considered growth investments in this phase the company needs to keep most of its profits to reinvest in the business typically once a company gets a significant size the company 's growth prospects are not as good so the company pays some of its profits in the form of a dividend to the shareholders   as far as which is the best buy is totally a personal choice there will be times when one is better then the other most likely you will want to diversify and invest in both types

gt;they especially the atlantic does investigative journalism vice on the other hand does investigative journalism on the level of buzzfeed    the atlantic is a magazine publisher they publish curated content they do not produce that content   buzzfeed was started as a viral lab to track viral content then it developed into a internet media production house that 's why they try to produce viral content but have a general reputation for creating clickbait the most legitimate part of its reporting is that it actually pays reporters to go to things like the press its revenue is about m a year   vice is a broadcast company worth over $ its revenues exceed $ 1b a year particularly due to its lucrative deal with hbo the fact that hbo charges premium prices for access to this content should be enough to distinguish it from outlets like buzzfeed which is completely free and open to access vice is a producer of content and not just a publisher broadcaster of information you 've falsely equated them in quality to buzzfeed perhaps by correlating that they are both recent upstarts   gt;i mean this linked piece is shallow to say the least    correct i 'm very skeptical of anyone reporting on a report that they themselves co wrote while touting co founding an advocacy organization as somehow being a qualifier credential i would normally consider this to be paid content although it is unclear if the writer paid for vice to publish it the quality of the image editing was also very poor of course i doubt this content would ever make it into the more premium vice communication channels specifically i doubt this content would be covered in any capacity on hbo that 's why i said at some point that the quality of its reporting is inconsistent and sometimes quite dubious   gt;why you think vice does quality work is beyond me the only possible reason is you are their main demographic    it 's not because it appeals to me as someone well versed in media politics i ensure that my media diet is diverse and broadly sourced the reason that i think some of their work is good is because i actually read it and think some of it is actually credible and worthy of my time it 's very clear that you do not find vice news credible so you want to act like your perceptions are equal in value and accuracy with my perceptions of it the problem with your logic is that i actually am exposed to its content while you self select not to expose yourself to it i like some of it because i find that some of it has a reasonable basis underlying the claim and i ca n't get the news anywhere else so you think our perceptions are equally accurate although mutually exclusive i.e. we disagree with each other or you think your perceptions are more accurate than mine most likely due to a confirmation bias but the reality is that my perceptions are broadly based considerations based on a much larger sampling of their content while your perceptions amount to an opinion derived from a first impression glance

assuming the numbers in your comments are accurate you have $ extra after paying your expenses   i assume this includes loan payments you said you have $ 3k in savings and a $ monthly nut so only one month of living expenses in savings in my opinion your first goal should be to put 100 of your extra money towards savings each month until you have six months of living expenses saved   that 's $ 6 or $   since you have $ 3 k already that means you need $ more which is exactly six months $ next i would pay off your $ 4 k for the bedroom furniture   i do n't know the terms you got but usually if you are not completely paid off when it comes time to pay interest the rate is very high and you have to pay interest not just going forward but from the inception of the loan ymmv check your loan terms you may want to look into consolidating your high interest loans into a single loan at a lower rate   barring that i would put 100 of my extra monthly income toward your 10 loan until its paid off and then your loan until that 's paid off   i would not consider investing in any non tax advantaged vehicle until those two loans at minimum were paid off   is a very good guaranteed return on your money after that i would continue the strategy of aggressively paying the maximum per month toward your highest interest loans until they are all paid off with the possible exception of the very low rate sallie mae loans   however i 'm probably more conservative than your average investor and i have a major aversion to paying interest

the short answer it depends the long answer off the top of my head there are quite a number of factors that an analyst may look at when analyzing a stock to come up with a recommendation   some example factors to look at include the list goes on   quite literally any and all factors are fair game for a recommendation   so the question is n't really what analysts do with financial data it is what do analysts do with financial data that meets your investment needs as an example if you have two analysts one who is focused on growth stocks and one who is focused on dividend growth they may have completely different views on a company   if both analysts were to analyze apple aapl 5 years ago the dividend analyst would likely say sell or at the most hold because back then apple did not have a dividend   however an analyst focused on growth would likely have said buy because apple appeared to be on a clear upward trend in terms of growth   likewise if you have analysts who are focused on shorting stocks and ones who are focused on deep value investing the sell analyst may be selling sell because they are confident the stock will go down in price so you can make money on the short position   conversely the deep value investor may be saying buy because they believe that based on the companies strong balance sheet and recent shake ups in management the stock will eventually turn around   two completely different views for the same company the analyst focused on shorting is looking to make money by capitalizing on falling share price while the analyst focused on deep value is looking for companies in a whom s he believe will turn around the thesis being that if you dollar cost average as the price drops when it corrects you 'll reap the rewards that all said to answer the question about what analysts look for so really you should be looking for analysts who align with your investment style and use those recommendations as a starting point for your own purchases   personally i am a dividend investor so i have passed many buy recommendations from analysts and my former broker because those were based on growth stories   that does not mean that the analysts my former broker or myself are wrong   but we were all incorrect given the context of how i invest and what they recommend

the other answers are talking about seller financing   there is another type of arrangement that might be described as writing your own mortgage where the buyer arranges his or her own financing   instead of using a bank a buyer might find his own investor to hold the mortgage for him an example would be if i were to buy a house that needs fixing up   i might be able to buy a house for $ 40,000 but after i fix it up i believe it will sell for $ 100,000   instead of going through a traditional mortgage bank i find an investor with cash that agrees the house is a good deal and we arrange for the investor to provide funds for the purchase of the house on a short term basis perhaps interest only during which i fix up the house and sell it   just like a regular mortgage the loan is backed by the house itself i am not recommending this type of arrangement by any means but this article does a good job of describing how this would work   it is written by a real estate guru with lots of training courses and coaching materials that she would like to sell you

edited in response to joetaxpayer 's comment and op tim 's additional question to add to and clarify a little what littleadv has said and to answer   op tim 's next question as far as the irs is concerned you have at most one individual retirement account of each type traditional roth though the money in each ira can be invested with as many different custodians brokerages banks etc and different investments as you like thus the maximum $ 5000 $ 6000 for older folks that you can contribute each year can be split up and invested any which way you like and when in later years you take a required minimum distribution rmd from a traditional ira you can get the money by selling just one of the investments or from several investments all that the irs cares is that the total amount that is distributed to you is at least as large as the rmd an important corollary is that   the balance in your ira is the    sum total of the value of all the investments that various custodians are holding    for you in ira accounts there is no loss in an ira until every penny has been withdrawn from every investment in your ira and   distributed to you thus making your ira balance zero   as long as you have a positive balance there is no loss everything has to come out after the last distribution from your roth ira the one that your entire roth ira no matter where it is invested and reduces your roth ira balance see definition   above to zero total up all the amounts that you have received as   distributions from your roth ira if this is less   than the total amount of money you contributed to your roth ira   this includes rollovers from a traditional ira or roth 401k   etc but not the earnings within the roth ira that you re invested inside the roth ira you have a loss that can be deducted on schedule a as a miscellaneous deduction subject to the 2 agi limit this 2 is not a cap in the sense that no more than 2 of your agi can be deducted in this category   but rather a threshold you can only deduct whatever part of your total miscellaneous deductions exceeds   2 of your agi not many people have miscellaneous deductions whose total exceeds 2 of their agi and so they end up not being able to deduct anything in this category if you ever made nondeductible contributions to your   traditional ira because you were ineligible to make a   deductible contribution income too high pension plan   coverage at work etc then the sum of all these contributions is your basis in your   traditional ira note that your deductible contributions if any are not part of the basis   the above rules apply to   your basis in your traditional ira as well   after the last distribution from your traditional ira the one that   all your traditional ira accounts and reduces your traditional ira balance to zero total up all the distributions that you received do n't forget to include the nontaxable part of each distribution that represents a return of the basis if the sum total is less than your basis you have a loss that can be deducted on schedule a as a miscellaneous   deduction subject to the 2 agi threshold you can only deposit cash into an ira and take a distribution in cash from an ira now as joetaxpayer points out if your ira owns stock you can take a distribution by having the   shares transferred from your ira account in your brokerage to your personal account in the brokerage   however the amount of the distribution as reported by the brokerage to the irs is the value of the shares transferred as of the time of the transfer more generally   the fair market value of the property that is transferred out of the ira and this is the amount you report on your income   tax return any capital gain or loss on those shares remains inside the ira because your basis in your personal account in the   shares that came out of the ira is the amount of the distribution   if you sell these shares at a later date you will have a taxable gain or loss depending on whether you sold the shares for more or less than your basis in effect the share transfer transaction is as if you sold the shares in the ira took the proceeds as a cash distribution and immediately bought the same shares in your personal account but you saved the transaction fees for the sale and the purchase and avoided paying the   difference between the buying and selling price of the shares as well as any changes in these in the microseconds that would have elapsed between the execution of the sell shares in ira account distribute cash to tim and buy shares in personal account transactions   of course your broker will likely charge a fee for transferring ownership of the shares from your ira to you   but the important point is that any capital gain or loss within the ira can not be used to offset a gain or loss in your taxable accounts   what happens inside the ira stays inside the ira

the short answer is that the people who know are n't saying lisa blog author at ft has made a effort at figuring it out but working from what is publicly known and making some reasonable assumptions she ca n't even find $ 1 billion of losses much less 9    all we know for sure is that jpm sold massive amounts of protection on a particular cds index roughly that means that they sold insurance on a group of 125 companies and they would lose money if one of those companies went bankrupt or looked like it might go bankrupt and make money if those companies look less likely to go bankrupt    however they were certainly combining that position with other offsetting positions since their banking business loses money when companies go bankrupt it would make sense if they protected themselves with an even more massive position that made money when companies went bankrupt    a common strategy is to bet that the price of 1 thing will go up and the price of a very similar thing will go down so you are protected and can make money if both prices go up or if both go down however if the 2 things are not as similar as you thought you can lose money from both bets that 's what seems to have happened to jpm   dimon has basically said that jpm screwed up their calculations and positions that they thought were offsetting were not     what also seems likely is that other companies figured out that jp morgan had massive amounts of certain things that they needed to sell so jpm was forced to sell at bad prices you never want to play poker against someone who can see your hole cards   so my speculative theory is that the main point of the trading was to protect jpm if other companies went bankrupt but they did it with a complicated strategy that included selling protection they got the calculations wrong and then they were forced to sell at bad prices to other companies who knew they had to sell

1 for fha loans pmi is required for where there is not at least 20 equity   bank financed non fha loans may have other standards if you are getting an fha loan if possible put down 20   so that you do not have to pay pmi   that said your pmi costs should be reduced by the size of your down payment since the pmi covers the difference between your equity value based on the appraisal at time of purchase and 20 equity value of the home so if you buy a home for 100 appraisal price 20 equity would be 85k   so if you put 10 down you would be paying pmi until you accrue an addition in equity   and you will be paying pmi on that for about 12 on 30 year mortgage or until you home appraised at higher value than purchase price where you would have 20 equity   there are ways to get out of pmi early but few banks are willing to help you through the hoops unless you pay more closing costs 2 different banks offer better rates or other benefits for paying points   we paid $ 300 for a 1.5 reduction in our interest rate less than 1 but it was called a point we were offered a few other points .25 for 2500 and an one time on demand interest rate adjustment for but declined but they may make more sense on a home than our more modest one   you can talk to a banker about this now get helps with getting offers accepted sometimes and find out more details about the mortgage they will offer you   this meeting should be would say will but some bank would charge just to prove me wrong and help answer your questions more than anyone here can    3 the costs will come out of your down payment   so if you put down down your costs will come out of that   so you will probably end up with being applied towards your purchase price with the rest going for costs   you can tell the banker you want to put 10 towards the price and the banker will give you a down payment probably around 50k to cover costs etc   my figures are hopefully intentionally high better to find out that it will cost less than my than get your hopes up just to find out the costs are higher than expected

the ppf and nsc can broadly be compared as below ppf is public provident scheme with initial period of 15 years and can be extended by 5 yrs blocks there is a minimum investment of rs 500 every year and a maximum of rs per year for 2014 15 financial year the gains from ppf are also exempt from any and all capital gains tax nsc is like fixed deposits for a period of 6 years they can be purchased from post office in multiples of rs 100 rs 500 rs 1,000 rs 5,000 rs 10,000 there is no maximum limit of purchase however tax rebate is only to the extent of rs on 2014 15 financial year   interest rate both currently offer 8.75 interest rate incase of ppf the interest rate is declared every year and is applicable to the entire invested corpus in case of nsc the interest is fixed for the tenure of the investment changes in interest are applicable for next investments the interest is compounded    account operation    withdrawals in ppf the first withdrawal is possible in the 7 years for 50 balance of the 4th year and like wise for subsequent years in nsc there is no premature withdrawal however one can get loan from banks by of the certificates    tax benefits both ppf and nsc enjoy tax benefits under 80c. however the ppf follows what is called an regime under which the investment is exempt from tax the interest accrued is exempt from tax and the withdrawal is also exempt from tax the nsc however only the investment is exempt from tax the interest earned has to be shown as income and would be treated as invested on withdrawal the interest would be taxed accordingly the best benefit of ppf account can not be attached by court of law in case one comes under financial liability ie the money in the ppf account can only be used by you hence it would make more sense to invest in ppf

you are doing great congratulations check out the dave ramsey baby steps   he has advice for exactly your situation the book financial peace covers the topic in detail   you have an emergency fund which is step 3   step 4 is investing 15 for retirement in 401k and similar   step 5 is funding college if you have children in step 6 he advises putting any extra money towards the principle on your home   owning your own home outright is a better goal than investing the money at a higher interest versus your mortgage interest rate after your are completely debt free then you can invest and give generously which is step 7 answering your question push your emergency fund to 6 months bump your retirement saving to 15 and put any extra money to your mortgage

the idea of an index is that it is representative of the market or a specific market segment as a whole so it will move as the market does thus past performance is not really relevant unless you want to bank on relative differences between different countries economies but that 's not the point by far the most important aspect when choosing index funds is the ongoing cost usually expressed as total expense ratio ter which tells you how much of your investment will be eaten up by trading fees and to pay the funds operating costs and profits this is where index funds beat traditional actively managed funds it should be below 0.5 the next question is how buying and selling the funds works and what costs it incurs do you have to open a dedicated account or can you use a brokerage account at your bank is there an account management fee do you have to buy the funds at a markup can you get a discount on it are there flat trading fees is there a minimum investment what lot sizes are possible can you set up a monthly payment plan can you automatically reinvest dividends coupons   then of course you have to decide which index i.e. which market you want to buy into my answer in the other question apparently did n't make it clear but i was talking only about stock indices you should generally stick to broad established indices like the msci world s&p 500 euro stoxx or in australia the all among those it makes some sense to just choose your home country 's main index because that eliminates currency risk and is also often cheaper alternatively you might want to use the opportunity to diversify internationally so that if your country 's economy tanks you wo n't lose your job and see your investment take a dive finally you should of course choose a well established reputable issuer but this is n't really a business for startups neither shady nor consumer friendly anyway

in the us this is considered a sale and the proceeds will be taxed as if you 've sold the stocks in any other way the decision about the treatment capital ordinary etc is dependent on what kind of stock that is how you acquired it how long have you held it etc if it is a regular stock that you bought as an investment and held it for more than a year then it will likely to be a capital gain treatment however this is only relevant for the us taxation since you 're a uk person you should also check how it is handled in the uk which may or may not be different

both are correct depending on what you are really trying to evaluate if you only want to understand how that particular investment you were taking money in and out of did by itself than you would ignore the cash   you might use this if you were thinking of replacing that particular investment with another but keeping the in out strategy if you want to understand how the whole investment strategy worked both the in out motion and the choice of investment than you would definitely want to include the cash component as that is necessary for the strategy and would be your final return if you implemented that strategy as a side note neither irr or cagr are not great ways to judge investment strategies as they have some odd timing issues and they do n't take into account risk

the company was paying only $ 1 a share in dividends compared to $ 10 a share in earnings that is a so called payout ratio of 10 which is low a more normal payout ratio would be 40 something like $ 4 a share if a $ 13 stock had a $ 4 dividend the dividend yield would be about 30 which would be too high meaning that the price would go up to drive down the resulting yield even $ 1 a share on a $ 13 stock is a high dividend of about 7 allowing for appreciation to say the $ range graham was a great believer in the theory that management should pay out most of its earnings in dividends he believed that by holding dividends so far below earnings the company was either being stingy or signalling that the $ 10 a share of earnings was unsustainable either of these would be bad for the stock for instance if $ 1 a share in dividends actually represented a 40 payout ratio it would signal management 's belief that they could normally earn only $ 2.50 a year instead of $ 10

how would they make money from it    they sell you the software for $ 100 us example could as easily be 100 euros or 10,000 japanese yen   you use it to make recommendations on your blog   your blog becomes rich from advertising   they sold $ 100 worth of software   if they spent $ 1 million in labor developing it they 're way behind    another problem is that the software would stop working and need adjusted periodically   this is easy to do on a server but annoying on a pc   and who pays for the adjustments    put both those things together and it 's a lot easier to do on a server   another advantage is that a server can get a better data feed as well   pay a premium for the detailed information rather than relying on public sources   and people are used to renting server access where they expect to buy software once    another issue is that they are unlikely to beat the market this way   yes have done so   but that 's the latest ai constantly adjusted   this is going to be a previous generation ai   it 's more likely to match the market   and we already have a way to match the market   an index fund    if someone had a brilliant ai the best use would probably be to sell it to a fund manager   the fund manager could then use the ai to find opportunities for its existing investors   note that a $ 10 billion fund with a 10 return that gives a .1 commission would be paying $ 1 million   and that has no marketing or packaging overhead   think $ 10 billion is a lot   fidelity has $ 2 trillion

well if you have your money invested and then there 's a financial crisis and there 's a personal crisis at the same time e.g. you lose your job then you 're in big trouble you might not have enough money to cover your bills while you find a new job you could lose your house ruin your credit or something like that   think 2008 even if there 's not a financial crisis if the money is in a tax sheltered retirement account then withdrawing it will incur ugly now after you 've got an emergency fund established things are different if you could probably ride out six to twelve months with your general purpose savings then with the money you are investing for the long term retirement there 's no reason you should n't invest 100 of the money in stocks the difference is that you 're not going to come back for that money in 6 months you 're going to come back for it in 40 years as for retirement savings over the long term though i do n't think it 's a good idea to think of your money in those terms if you ever lose 100 of your money on the stock market while you 've invested in diversified instruments like s&p500 index funds you 're probably screwed one way or another because that represents the core industrial base of the us economy and you 'll have better things to worry about like looking for a used shotgun myself i prefer to give the suggestion do n't invest any money in stocks if you 're going to need to take it out in the next 5 years or so because you generally should n't be worried about a 100 loss of all the money in stocks your retirement accounts nearly so much as you should be worried about large medium term setbacks like the dot com bubble crash and the 2008 financial crisis i save the do n't invest money unless you can afford to lose it all advice for highly speculative instruments like gold futures or social media ipos remember also that while you might lose a lot of your money on the stock market your savings accounts and bonds will earn you pathetic amounts by comparison which you will slowly lose to inflation if you 've had your money invested for decades then even during a crash you may still be coming out ahead relative to bonds

dividend rate is dividend per share over a specified time period usually a year so in the first example if the company paid a $ 1/share dividend over the year before the stock dividend the shareholder would receive $ 100 while if it paid the $ 1/share the year after the stock dividend the shareholder would receive $ 105 the company could have achieved the same thing by paying total dividends of $ which is what the last phrase of the last quoted paragraph is saying here 's an investopedia page on dividend rate also what you 're calling payout ratio is really dividend yield payout ratio is how much of the company 's net earnings are paid out in dividends that 's all in the us i could see the terms being used differently outside the us

a living wage is a great idea but asking business to pay for it is bad it 's not that companies ca n't afford it it 's that for every company that can afford it there are about a dozen small ones that ca n't eg small businesses   the solution is to have a universal wage subsidy funded by the government and sourced through increased taxes especially in the financial sector this would allow companies to pay wages while the government tops it up to ensure that low paid workers get more money

there are probably specific laws that control landlord tenant rent disputes but your friend 's argument assumes that there are n't let 's assume that there are n't so there are two possibilities either the contract directly addresses this issue or it does n't if the contract directly and specifically addresses this issue then that controls your friend is not claiming that it is specifically addressed so the general principle is this when something occurs within a contract that was n't explicitly discussed by the parties courts will try to figure out what the parties likely would have agreed to had they discussed the specific issue without changing the agreed terms of the contract this should produce the result that is fair to both parties your friend is arguing then that had he and the landlord discussed the issue the landlord would have agreed that in the event he is no longer able to accept credit cards easily your friend could live there rent free that does n't seem right to me does it seem right to you much more likely they would have agreed that he might have some leeway to work out a new payment scheme and maybe some late rent should be forgiven if he made an attempt to pay on time but could n't make arrangements but i do n't see more than that being reasonable

i 'm not sure that you 're considering all the options    so you may not subtract $ x from b but you do compare npv(b to $ y.    also remember that we 're not trying to figure out the return on b.   we 're trying to figure out what to do next   in terms of planning the sunk cost is irrelevant   but in terms of calculating return a was a turkey   and to calculate the return we would include $ x in our costs for b.   and for the second option we 'd subtract $ x from $ y may be negative    sunk costs are irrelevant to planning but they are very relevant to retrospective analysis   please do n't confuse the two   when looking back part of the cost for b will be that $ x.   but in the middle after paying $ x and before starting b the $ x is gone   you only have the building and have to make your decision based on the options you have at that moment    you will sometimes hear $ y called the opportunity cost of b.   you could sell out for $ y or you could do b.   you should only do b if it is worth more than $ y.    the sunk cost fallacy would be comparing b to $ x.   assuming $ y is less than $ x this would make you not do b when it is your best path forward from that moment   i.e. $ y < npv(b < $ x means that you should do the project   you will lose money apparently that 's a foregone conclusion but you will lose less money than if you just sold out    you should also do b if $ y < $ x < npv(b or $ x < $ y < npv(b   in general you should do b any time $ y < npv(b   the only time you should not do b is if npv(b < $ y.   if they are exactly equal then it does n't matter financially whether you do b or not

when you say that the problem is high supply but no demand you are actually correct here 's why   the phrase borrow spend less save more is n't an absolute law it 's more of a cautionary tale obviously spending is an integral part of an economy it accounts for at least 50 of every transaction but the is getting at something other than people to not spend the point of the saying is that interest rates should reflect savings rates    what it comes down to is the how the law of supply and demand applies to the relationship between savings and interest rates consider this thought experiment in a world where everybody saves 50 of their income what would happen to interest rates banks would have a glut of savings relative to the population assuming demand remains constant interest rates would go down the price of borrowing goes down as the supply of money to be borrowed increases thus a corollary of the law of supply and demand is that as savings increase interest rates tend to go down    so as savings increase the economic environment encourages capital improvements businesses can borrow at lower rates and increase long term productive capacity this is what the federal reserve has attempted to do by lowering the fed funds rate to near zero and by operation twist increase economic activity through low borrowing costs    so what 's the problem when interest rates are artificially low there are no savings to support the production later in time a company that borrows at a 1 rate created by the feds can build a factory to make widgets but it will have a hard time selling that widget to a population with a negative net worth however if the 1 rate is natural then the company should be fine the savings of the population should support the production from his widget factory    for about 30 years we have experienced a credit boom in this country that was not created by excess savings this trend could n't continue forever look around you at the end of the day an economy is simply a group of people getting together to buy and sell stuff and services right now there is a lot of debt and little cash who will be doing the buying

quote driven markets are the to the modern securities market before electronic trading and hfts specifically trading was thin and onerous   today the average investor can open up a web page type in a security and buy at the spread permitted by regulators with anyone else who wants to take the other side before the lines between market maker and speculator became blurred to a market maker was one who was contractually obligated to an exchange to provide a bid and ask for a given security on said exchange even though at heart a market maker is still simply a trader despite the obligation   a market maker would simultaneously buy a large amount of securities privately and short the same amount to have no directional bias exposure to the direction of the security and commence to making the market   the market maker would estimate its cost basis for the security based upon those initial trades and provide a bid and ask appropriate for the given level of volume   if volumes were high the spread would be low and vice versa market makers who survived crashes and spikes would forgo the potential profit in always providing a steady price and spread ie increased volume otherwise known as revenue to maintain no directional bias   in other words if there were suddenly many buyers and no sellers hitting the market maker 's ask the mm would raise the ask rapidly in proportion to the increased exposure while leaving the bid somewhere below the cost basis   eventually a seller would arise and hit the mm 's bid bringing the market maker 's inventory back into balance and narrowing the spread that particular mm could provide since a responsible mm 's ask could rise very high very quickly if a lack of its volume relative to its inventory made inventory too costly   this was temporarily extremely costly to the trader if there were few market makers on the security the trader was trading or already exposed to market makers prefer to profit from the spread bidding below some predetermined price based upon the cost basis of the market maker 's inventory while asking above that same predetermined cost basis   traders profit from taking exposure to a security 's direction or lack thereof in the case of some options traders because of electronic trading liquidity rebates offered by exchanges not only to contractually obligated official market makers but also to any trader who posts a limit order that another trader hits and algorithms that become better by the day market making hfts have supplanted the traditional market maker and there are many hfts where there previously were few official market makers   this speed and diversification of risk across many many market making hfts have kept spreads to the minimum on large equities and have reduced the same for the smallest equities on major exchanges orders and quotes are essentially identical   both are double sided auction markets with bids and asks   the difference lies in that non market makers specialists etc orders are not shown to the rest of the market providing an informational advantage to mms and an informational disadvantage to the trader   before electronic trading this construct was of no consequence since trader orders were infrequent   with the prevalence of hfts the informational disadvantage has become more costly so order driven markets now prevail with much lower spreads and accelerated volumes even though market share for the major exchanges has dropped rapidly and number of trades even though the size of individual trades have fallen the worst aspect of the quote driven market was that traders could not directly trade with each other so all trades had to go between a market maker specialist etc   while this may seem to have increased cost to a trader who could only trade with another trader by being arbitraged by a mm et al paying more than what another trader was willing to sell these costs were dwarfed by the potential absence of those market makers   without a bid or ask at any given time there could be no trade so the costs were infinite in essence a quote driven market protects market makers from the competition of traders   while necessary in the days where paper receipts were from brokerage to brokerage and the trader did not dedicate itself to round the clock trading it has no place in a computerized market   it is more costly to the trader to use such a market explaining quote driven markets rapid exit

the big difference for me is that my contribution thorough a cafeteria plan also skips social security and medicare taxes that is a 6.2 ss + 1.45 medicare tax on those contributions if done outside a cafeteria plan some companies make a contribution to a the hsa if you handle your contributions outside of their channels they may see you as a non participant and not make any matching contributions you might have to put a minimum amount into the company setup hsa   the non company hsa may also charge fees that the company one does n't regarding the taxes if you contribute $ 3,000 to the hsa via post tax your paychecks would have had an extra $ paid into social security medicare there is no mechanism to get this refunded

here 's an alternative there are hundreds maybe thousands of contract engineering firms job shops in the united states probably hundreds in california alone   they are in the business of doing what your employer wants you to do they know how to do it they have been doing it for decades working with the biggest most established companies in the country   they have forgotten more about providing engineering services to clients and paying the engineers than you can learn in a lifetime call a few of them   set up meetings   budget a few hours for it   you want to talk with the most experienced recruiter in the office the old guy who has been there and done that   explain your situation and tell them that rather than go through all of the headaches yourself you want to investigate the possibility of them handling all the headaches for their usual markup of course   you can probably word this better than i can but you get the idea the shop may or may not be willing to talk about their markup   my personal opinion is that this is perfectly ok   what they make off of you after your rate is paid is their business also talk about what you do and your recommended rate   it would not surprise me to learn that you are currently grossly underpaid and mention that if the client declines you 're going to be available immediately and you 'd certainly be open to working with them   you will see this again   in fact if they have any current leads that you fit you would certainly be interested in hearing about them   they may already have a from another client for which you fit for which the client is willing to pay much more than your current employer if it were me personally i 'd start with and maybe tad technical   these are three of the oldest and best i 'd also hit up ce weekly get a subscription and find some other shops with offices in your area once you have a shop lined up then ask your employer if rather than you setting up a personal corporation they 'd be willing to work with an established contract engineering firm   who does this kind of thing for a living who does this every day who has been doing this for decades   doing this is simpler for everyone and by going through an established firm they avoid having to teach you how to do business with them   they also avoid the risk of having you reclassified by irs as an employee which exposes them to all kinds of legal and financial liability if they say no walk away from them   immediately   they 've just thrown up a huge red flag   this is where the other discussions with the shop come into play

the argument you are making here is similar to the problem i have with the stronger forms of the efficient market hypothesis   that is if the market already has incorporated all of the information about the correct prices then there 's no reason to question any prices and then the prices never change   however the mechanism through which the market incorporates this information is via the actors buying an selling based on what they see as the market being incorrect the most basic concept of this problem i think starts with the idea that every investor is passive and they simply buy the market as one basket   so every paycheck the index fund buys some more stock in the market in a completely static way   this means the demand for each stock is the same   no one is paying attention to the actual companies performance so a poor performer 's stock price never moves   the same for the high performer   the only thing moving prices is demand but that 's always up at a more or less constant rate this is a topic that has a lot of discussion lately in financial circles   here are two articles about this topic but i 'm not convinced the author is completely serious hence the worst case scenario title these are interesting reads but again take this with a grain of salt   you should follow the links in the articles because they give a more nuanced understanding of each potential issue   one thing that 's important is that the reality is nothing like what i outline above one of the links in these articles that is interesting is the one that talks about how we now have more indexes than stocks on the us markets   the writer points to this as a problem in the first article but think for a moment why that is   there are many different types of strategies that active managers follow in how they determine what goes in a fund based on different stock metrics   if a stocks p e ratio drops below a critical level for example a number of indexes are going to sell it   some might buy it   it 's up to the investors you and me to pick which of these strategies we believe in another thing to consider is that active managers are losing their clients to the passive funds   they have a vested interest in attacking passive management

you may be in a situation where buying is preferred especially because you can enter the market in a strong position with a 20 down payment   if you have the financial ability to assume the risk of owning you may be better off   i would consider two things   renting is purchasing a service you are buying the flexibility to move with minimum hassle and the landlord is assuming the risk of owning the asset property they will make money on you like any service provider buying is purchasing an asset you are buying the underlying asset and assume all the risks associated with it this is large unforeseen maintenance fees taxes depreciation etc some of these risks were passed to you as a renter but some were not   just like purchasing $ 400k in stock if you have to sell when the market is down you lose big you win if you can hold unlike a stock real estate will eat your cash in taxes and repairs unless it is rented if you are willing to be a long distance landlord this may work out understand that property management fees will eat into your rent income and being long distance will give more potential for a bad tenant to ruin your property value these and other factors e.g. vacancy rate will increase your risk of loss and should be considered some of this will be your preference since you will spend much more time dealing with buying selling property management as opposed to a more clean rental situation is this hassle worth the savings for many yes others no finally i hope this calculator can help clarify some of the financial aspects for you   good luck

it very much depends on whether you want to drive around in an expensive car or whether you want an expensive car parked on your driveway and whether you want to buy a new car or a used one and whether you know a reliable garage that does n't rip you off or not   for example if my wife who drives maybe 5,000 miles a year wanted a 5 series bmw we could buy a five year old one with 120,000 miles for about £ 120 per month purchase price if it lasts 6 years 11 year old and 150,000 miles should be no problem for that kind of car so that 's quite affordable for me driving 25,000 miles a year the numbers are quite different   fact is if you drive around in my wider neighbourhood you will sometimes see very expensive cars parked in front of very rundown houses some people find it more important to drive around in an expensive car than to live in a nice place that 's priorities many people can afford expensive cars if they their priorities and i 'm not saying it 's a good thing   ps if you want to be seen in an expensive car for example you take your wife out you can always rent a car for a day or two

never is n't that the whole idea of the limit order you want a bargain not the price the seller wants and when the market opens it is volatile at the most just an observation may n't be correct let it stabilize a bit the other thing is you might miss the opportunity but as an investor you should stick to your guns and say i would n't buy any higher than this or sell any lower than this as you are going long buying at the right price is essential you are n't going to run away tomorrow so be smart   probably this is what warren buffet said it is important to buy a good stock at the right price rather than buying a good stock at the wrong price there is no fixed answer to your question it can be anything you can check what analysts someone with reputation of predicting always say would be the increase decrease in the price of a stock in the projected future they do quite a lot of data crunching to reach a price do n't take their values as but from a number of sources and take an average or some sorts of it you can then take an educated guess of how much you would be willing to pay depending the gain or loss predicted else if you do n't believe the all do n't have a stellar reputation you can do all the data crunching yourself if you have the time and right tools

thanks for the writeup it was a really informative read i 've been aware for a while now that reagan and were in a large way the start of most of the current problems in the economic and political landscape but you filled in a few gaps that were really useful for me   so i guess ultimately a lot of conservatives see it as a kind of necessary evil in order to bring about the success story that the current economy needs right now unfortunately their strategy is totally wrong that kind of makes sense with my observation that rather than supporting the cronyism and corruption they turn a blind eye to it because they think it 's necessary   my view is not so much that labour and finance capital returns need to be balanced although that is probably a great thing to aim for but that creation of wealth capital needs to be intrinsically linked with the creation of real value the modern banking crisis was a great example of the ability to generate wealth while in fact destroying real value

form is to report to the irs withholding of capital gains tax that may be due from the seller foreign nationals do n't always file tax returns so they often did n't pay capital gains tax on properties that they sold congress decided to make the buyers responsible for this tax so that they would have a better chance of collecting it there is a penalty against the buyer if that tax is not withheld your attorney should have filed this form on your behalf as part of the closing papers i think your first step is to look at your copy of the closing papers and see if money was withheld from the sale there definitely should be disclosure of these requirements before the sale you should also follow up with your attorney to see whether he has already filed the forms and on your behalf if you had purchased for less than $ 300,000 and were purchasing for your primary residence you would not have to file that form but since the property was under $ 1,000,000 the withholding rate is only 10 rather than 15

i 'm being taxed at a 40 rate then i can give $ 500,000 to charity write it off and save $ 200,000 on my taxes that 's a net loss of $ 300,000 i may have paid less taxes but it cost me 300 grand your logic is correct however here 's another way to think about it suppose you are being taxed at a 40 rate you wish to purchase $ 500,000 worth of diamonds   how much do you have to make in income to do so   you need to make $ in income pay 40 of that $ in taxes and then spend the $ 500,000 on the diamonds   but to spend that $ 500,000 on a charitable donation you only need to make an income of $ 500,000 taxed at a rate of 0 because donations to charity count against your taxable income or yet another way to think about it is that if you make $ in income you can spend it on $ 500,000 worth of diamonds or $ worth of charitable contributions effectively you get to purchase $ worth of charitable contributions for free over the equivalent purchase that is not a charitable donation

does a good answer of addressing the gains and when you are taxed on them and at what kind of rate money held in a brokerage account will usually be in a money market fund so you would own taxes on the interest it earned    there is one important consideration that must be understood for capitol losses   this is called the wash sale rule   this rule comes into affect if you sell a stock at a loss and buy shares of the same stock within 30 days before or after the sale   a common tactic used to minimize taxes paid is to capture losses when they occur since these can be used to offset gains and lower your taxes   this is normally done by selling a stock in which you have a loss and then either buying another similar stock or waiting and buying back the stock you sold    however if you are intending to buy back the same stock you must not trigger the wash sale rule or you are forbidden to take the loss examples   lets presume you own 1000 shares of a stock and it 's trading 25 below where you bought it and you want to capture the loss to use on your taxes this can be a very important consideration if trading index etf 's   if you have a loss in something like a s&p500 etf you would likely incur a wash sale if you sold it and bought a different s&p500 etf from another company since they are effectively the same thing   otoh if you sold an s&p500 etf and bought something like a stock market etf it should be different enough to not trigger the wash sale rule   if you are trying to minimize the taxes you pay on stocks there are basically two rules to follow   1 when a gain is involved hold things at least a year before selling if at all possible   2 capture losses when they occur and use to offset gains but be sure not to trigger the wash sale rule when doing so

i made this mistake and tried calling paypal the first time i have ever been unhappy with their service   the girl gave me some number but did n't make it clear whether it was an order reference number or a reference phone number for the company i ordered from   i called within 10 minutes of placing my order and they were unable to cancel or change the payment method   i did find however that even though you ca n't pay paypal with your credit card some banks will let you   i went into my account and paid my account the amount needed using my credit card from the same bank that i had intended to use in the first place hopefully it went through quickly enough to not get a service fee from paypal

first gather the information you have on her banking history   she may have accounted for that money and moved it to a new account or otherwise spent it   i do n't expect you 'll have much banking documentation from the 1950s but if you do then start there and trace the money to the extent you can you may try to contact the banks in question or their   it may be difficult to trace them through mergers or closings   again it 's very possible that she spent or transferred those funds and there is nothing to find anyway there is also a risk that if the money went unclaimed for too long then the bank was obligated to any remaining balance to the state of ohio   you can try contacting ohio department of commerce about unclaimed funds and attempt to locate anything that may have rightly belonged to her   you will need to gather documentation to do so   you may be able to receive the funds from the state if it has received them

is it true that you can not amend a tax return to include both a    futures loss carry back and a schedule c at the same time no it is not true you can include all the changes necessary in a single amended return attaching statement explaining each of the changes however you 're talking about two different kinds of changes futures loss is a sec and not a correction of an error adding schedule c would be a correction of an error i 'm guessing your cpa wants to separate the two kinds to avoid the situation where the irs refuses to accept your correction of an error and by the way also does n't accept the sec on the same return or the cpa just wants to charge you twice for amendments

i have also tried mvelopes in the past and my experiences match yours i currently use the desktop version of ynab you need a budget ynab 4 and i like it much better   where we failed after a while with mvelopes we are succeeding with ynab and have been now for the last 3.5 years i do n't want this to sound like a commercial for ynab i will give important caveats about ynab later but here is why i believe we have done better now with ynab than before with mvelopes   i hope that these reasons will be useful to you when you are evaluating your next options as you said we also found mvelopes interface to be slow and   ynab 4 is a desktop app with capabilities that we found to be much quicker and easier to work with than mvelopes flash based interface   that was 4 years ago hopefully mvelopes has their interface since then    we also struggled with mvelopes connection with our banks   with ynab 4 there is no connection to the bank everything has to be entered manually   i initially thought this might be worse but for us it has been better   i can either enter transactions as they happen on the mobile app or i can hold on to receipts and enter them every day or two in the evening categorizing as i go   we always have an up to date picture of our finances and we do n't have to mess with trying to match up downloaded transactions that have been screwed up or are missing we are n't really using ynab much differently than we were using mvelopes but we have learned a few tricks that i think have contributed to our success   one of the things we do differently is that i do n't obsess about the cash accounts too much   cash accounts for us are the hardest to keep track of because most of our cash transactions do n't have a receipt we are paying a friend or family member for something or leaving a tip or something like that which we forget about when it comes time to enter into the software   as a result the cash account balances get off   i periodically enter a correcting transaction to get the balances right and have a budget category specifically for this that we have to put money in for these unknown transactions   fortunately for us our cash spending is a small percent of our total spending we usually pay with a credit card so this bit of spending is n't that big of a concern with ynab the current month 's budget is right in front of you as soon as you open up the app which makes it easy to adjust your budget during the month if necessary   with mvelopes at least how their app worked 4 years ago the budget was somewhat hidden after you funded your budget categories and it was a bit of a pain to move money around between categories   the ability to adjust your budget in the middle of the month is crucial if you do n't do that you 'll get frustrated the first time you find that you do n't have enough money in a category for something you need   ynab makes it very easy to move money around inside your budget that having been said you need to be aware that the current version of ynab is not a desktop application but a web based app   ynab 4 the old desktop version which we have been using is officially unsupported as of the end of 2016   however i see that it is still available for sale if you are interested in it the ynab4 help site is still up and the mobile app you would need to work with it on your phone called ynab classic is still in the app store    as i said the current ynab is now a web app complete with automatic downloading of transactions from your bank   i have no experience with it other than playing around with it a little and so i ca n't tell you how quick the interface is or how well the auto downloading of transactions works as an alternative another web based solution is everydollar from dave ramsey 's company   i have never tried it   the advantage of this one is that it is free if you choose not to link it to your banks the automatic downloading of transactions is a paid feature i wrote an answer a couple of years ago in which i describe two different approaches that budgeting software packages tend to take   i 'm not familiar with buxfer so i do n't know which approach it takes but perhaps that answer will help you evaluate all of your software options on the behavior side of things besides the relaxing of the cash accounting i mentioned above we also involve my wife a little less in the budgeting process than we used to   this is by her choice   i am the one who enters all the transactions into the software she hands me all her receipts i reconcile the accounts at the end of the month and i set the budget for the next month   we have been doing this long enough now that she knows what the budget is and we only need to discuss it if we want to do something different with the budget than we have been doing in the past   she has the ynab app on her phone and can see where we are at with all of our budget categories

secondly should we pay off his student loans before investing the subsidized loans wo n't be gaining any interest until he graduates so i was wondering if we should just pay off the unsubsidized loans and keep the subsidized ones for the next two years from a purely financial standpoint if the interest you gain on your savings is higher than the interest of the debt then no otherwise yes if we were to keep 5,000 in savings and pay of the 3,000 of unsubsidized loans as i described above that would leave us with about 15,000 dollars that is just lying around in my savings account how should i invest this would you recommend high risk or low risk investments i 'm not from the us so take my answer with caution but to me $ 15,000 seems a minimum safety net then again it depends very much on any external help you can get in case of an emergency

i really does depend on the bank here is a fairly typical page on interest calculations the key phrase is interest is calculated on each day 's final balance and paid monthly   so at the end of each day the amount of interest is calculated for that day based on how much is in the account at the end of the month the amount of interest for each day is and added to the account balance that calculation is extremely similar to duffbeer703 's compound monthly using the average balance for the month provided the account does n't have tiered interest rates and the balance does n't go negative the software that banks use is easily sophisticated enough to handle that kind of calculation your bank should be able to give you a statement of exactly how the interest is calculated

i 'd encourage you to use rules of thumb and back of the envelope here are some ideas that could be useful the problem with any kind of detailed calculations is the number of unknowns there are some really complex calculators out there for example see caution horrible user interface but seemed to work that will include all kinds of factors and run monte carlo and the whole thing but in my opinion it 's just as good or better to say save at least 15 of income until you have 25x what you spend or some other such rule of thumb here 's my little blog post on savings and investing fwiw http://blog.ometer.com/2010/11/10/take-risks-in-life-for-savings-choose-a-balanced-fund/ another note there 's sort of an ideology of how to live embedded in any retirement recommendation and you might want to take the time to reflect on that and consciously choose a book on this topic is your money or your life by robin which is a sort of radical you should save everything possible to achieve financial independence as early as possible argument i did n't go for their plan but i think it 's thought provoking a newer book that may be more appealing is called the number   and it 's about your question exactly it 's more designed to get you thinking while your money or your life has a particular answer in mind both have some math and some rules of thumb though they are n't focused on that a kind of general takeaway from these books might be first think about your expenses what are you trying to accomplish in life how would you like to spend your time and then ask how much money you absolutely need to accomplish that and focus on accomplishing your goals spending your time as much as you can on what you 'd like to spend it on i 'm this with a generic recommendation to save enough to spend 80 of your income in retirement which this idea that you should spend as much as possible every year before and after you retire lots of people do like that idea but it 's not a law of the universe or something it 's just one popular approach

the charts on are log based if you look closely you can see that the between evenly prices is tighter at the top of the chart and wider at the bottom    it 's easiest to see on a stock with a wide price range using candlestick where you can clearly see the grid   i 'm also not seeing the you indicate when i look at google finance with the settings to use log on the price axis   i see what i 'd expect which is basically a given vertical differential on the price axis representing the same percentage change in price no matter where it is located for example if i look at goog from the earliest date they have aug 20 2004 to a nice high point dec 7 2007 i see a cart where the gap from the the bottom of the chart seems to be right around 100 to the 200 point a 100 increase is the same as from 200 to 400 a 100 increase is the same as 400 to 800 a 100 increase    that 's exactly what i expect from a log chart on a financial site each relative move up or down of the same distance represents the same relative change in value so i 'm having difficulty understanding what your complaint is note i 'm using chrome which is the browser i 'd expect to work best with any google website   results with other browsers could of course vary   if you want to do some other wacky math with the axis then i suggest that something like excel is your friend    goto the charts at   get the chart displaying the period you care about click the chart to display the data there will be an option to download the data   cram it into excel and go wild as you want with charting it out   e.g. note that step 2 links to client side javascript so you will need javascript enabled if you are running something like disable it for this site   also since the data opens in a new window you may also need to enabled for the site and yes i sometimes get an annoying news alert advert   and have to close it when the chart first appears oh well it pays the rent and nasdaq is not charging you so for access so such is the price for a free site

because my accountant said i 'm in the 28 bracket and need more write offs when i hear someone say this i tell them to get a new accountant advisor tax guy   the benefit if any is the fact that if and only if a hat tip to you are already itemizing your deductions   it means that for me my 3.5 mortgage is really costing me   the only effect of this is the when i line up my debts the mortgage might fall to a lower priority for payback this is where there 's a balance between the choice of a robust emergency fund earning close to 0 today or using those funds to pay the mortgage at an accelerated rate   if the sentiment expressed by the question implies that one should carry a mortgage needed or not it really comes down the a question of risk over the long term i do n't suggest that people take a mortgage today to invest in the market a zero return as we just saw in the will show you that the 10 market return is an average over the very long term fwiw the period returned and 2 years short of the 10 few have the discipline to patiently wait out the dips and see the returns i quoted   that said the fact that the interest is deductible is a small factor given the low rates we are currently enjoying   each of the points above can be expanded into its own answer a great question with not so simple answers

individuals most definitely can have nol this is covered in the irs publication what is the difference between nol and capital loss nol is net operating loss i.e. a situation where your allowable expenses and deductions exceed your gross income basically it means that you have negative income for that year for tax purposes capital loss occurs when the total amount of your capital gains reported on schedule d is negative what are their relations then not all expenses and deductions that you usually put on your tax return are allowed for nol calculation for example capital loss is not allowed i.e. if you earned $ 2000 and you lost in stocks $ 3000 you do not get a $ 1 k nol capital losses are excluded from nol calculation and in this scenario you still have non negative income for nol purposes even though it is offset in full by capital loss deduction and your taxable income line is negative the $ 1 k that was not allowed gets carried forward to the next year using the capital loss carryover worksheet in the instructions to schedule d. you calculate your nol using form schedule a. you can use the form to apply the nol to prior 2 years or you can elect to apply it only to future years up to 20 years in what cases capital loss can be nol never

the business may not have paid any direct tax towards profit however it would have paid tons of indirect tax like sales tax service tax on the goods services rendered the raw material that he has purchased from vendors leading to demand would have been taxed the salary he has paid hence employees paying personal tax   so essentially even from a loss making venture the govt has received enough tax money

why is the stock trading at only $ 5 per share the share price is the perceived value of the company by people buying and selling the stock not the actual value of the company and all its assets generally if the company is not doing well there is a perceived risk that it will burn out the money fast there is a difference between its signed conditional sale and will get money and has got money so in short it 's trading at $ 5 a share because the market does n't feel like it 's worth $ 12 per share quite a few believe there could be issues faced i.e. it may not make the $ 12 or there will be additional obligations i.e. employees may demand more layoff compensation etc or the distribution may take few years due to regulatory and legal hurdles the only problem is the stock exchange states if the company has no core business the stock will be suspended soon hopefully they can release the $ 12 per share first what will happen if i hold shares in the company the stock gets suspended and its sitting on $ 12 per share can it still distribute it out every country and stock markets have laid out procedures for de listing a company and closing a company the company can give $ 10 as say dividends and remaining later or as part of the closure process the company will distribute the balance among shareholders this would be a long drawn process

i had experience working for a company that manufactures stuff and giving products to the employees the condition was to stay employed for a year after the gift for the company to cover its cost i think they imputed the tax otherwise they 'd add the cost to the last paycheck which they did when i left but they were straight forward about it and i signed a paper acknowledging it however in your case you did n't get a product that you could return when leaving if you did n't want to pay but rather a service the winning trip was definitely supposed to be reported as income to you last year is it okay for them to treat me differently than the others for tax purposes of course not but it may be that some strings were attached to the winning of the incentive trip for example you 're required to stay employed for x time for the company to cover the expense see my example above maybe it was buried somewhere in small letters can they do this a year after the trip was won and redeemed as i said in this case this sounds shady since it is a service which you can not return you should have been taxed on it when receiving it would the irs want to know about this fuzzy business trip practice how would i report it   here 's how you can let them know besides now understanding the new level of slime from my former    employer is there anything else i should be worried about could they    do something like this every year just to be annoying no once they issued the last paycheck you 're done with them they can not issue you more paychecks after you 're no longer an employee in most us states you are supposed to receive the last paycheck on your last day of work or in very close proximity matter of weeks at most

when they make the most money off of charging interest on late payments this is incorrect do you have any data to back this in the past decade there was a tendency by financial institutions to make money from late payments and there were certain rewards incentives for people who paid late however the bubble cracked soon enough and there were huge losses in the card industry today most of the revenue for card companies is from margins on customers who pay on time and growth avenues are promoting to pay every transaction by card why do they actively seek people who pay their bills on time as evidence by requiring good credit scores to get approved for a card instead of they opposite as indicated above remember if one customer defaults it wipes out margins made by tons of customers in spite of giving credit to people with good credit score the average credit card debit an us individual holds is still quite high

indeed there is conservation of money   if the insurance companies have those big buildings and television commercials and ceos then that money comes from only one place the insurance premiums of customers   to say insurance is a good deal is either the benefit and cost of insurance for most indeed of all the answers here james 's is best   if you ca n't afford to lose something it is vital to insure it   ideally insurance would be a non profit operation to best cover this   such that people would as a whole lose nothing   theoretically it could even be slightly for profit by making wise investment decisions and benefiting from the future value of money by beating inflation   but they do n't see this writeup for slightly dated information on health and this wikipedia article for more direction but even if you are taking an average loss by using a profit making insurance company by taking insurance you avoid the situation where you 're crippled by a catastrophe   you are paying a fee to hedge your losses   like james said insure what you can not afford to lose   but realize you 're going into a situation where the overall net is an average loss of between 10 50 of your money on average   basically you 're playing the lottery except your net losses mostly go to fund the company and the ceos rather than nominally support education but you sounded like you understood those ideas well so    can you self insure as others noted yes there is the option of self insurance in most places   even even often when insurance is considered as required   for example in the us basically car insurance coverage is required   but generally you are legally able to self insure to cover this requirement    the cost of self insuring there is one cost to self insure time   it takes time to research the laws time to to satisfy those requirements and then time to find setup all the care providers doctors mechanics lawyers etc when is it worth it   first again you must satisfy the prerequisite you are able to financially handle the loss of the topic under consideration at a commenter 's request here is an attempt to better spell out this requirement though it does n't appear pertinent to the question asked it is indeed very important not to mistakenly assume you satisfy this requirement can you comfortably cover the level of insurance you would otherwise be taking out   $ is a common reasonable insurance level so that would be $ 200,000   basically have enough money to cover the loss of your car your possible injury expenses and most importantly the damage and medical of anyone else you hit   you would need to have that value available optimally in your accounts   alternatively you could weigh it against your assets such that if you had low accounts but a paid off $ 200,000 house you could conceivably sell your property and still be able to survive financially afterwards   however it is indeed dangerous to make this assumption as there may be additional costs and troubles in selling assets and you may fail to recognize how precious the property is to you   having at least double or triple in property you 'd be willing to part with might be a more comfortable number   again the main idea is can you afford to lose the insured value tomorrow   though you hope it would n't happen if someone came and took $ 200,000 + of yours tomorrow would you be able to adjust to it relatively easily   if the answer is yes you 've satisfied this requirement   in many states it 's easier to understand whether you can meet this requirement it instead becomes can you take out the liability bond required if you 've met that requirement then it comes down to the time you 'd lose versus the savings you 'd gain   to get a fair idea you 'll need the premium you would pay to purchase the insurance since you are likely losing 10 50 of your premiums it should be fair to make a rough estimate of value lost by using 25 for most purposes especially given that this still ignores the future value opportunity cost of your money which could often be 5 10 if invested well the value of your time   you must properly identify either    a rough estimate of how much time it will take you to research the legal requirements and meet them and then to research handle the subsequent needs that come up which the insurance would take care of in an average year   so try to balance those typical years where you would n't have a lot of work to do with a year where you 'd need to call repair mechanics or find health practitioners   perhaps aim high research calling usually takes more time than we think    is this calculation positive your estimated net annual benefit or cost from self insuring is 0.25 insurance premium per year estimated value of your hours of to self insure per year   this is a rough estimate   but if the result is quite positive and you can afford to cover the hit the insurance would otherwise cover you 're likely better off self insuring if the result is quite negative or you ca n't cover the possible costs insurance would cover you 're probably better off buying insurance finally indeed there are still a few other factors on each side to consider most often those additional pluses and minuses probably are smaller than the primary cost benefits out earlier   but if you 're rich enough to have the money you 're in a situation where you can likely sacrifice a little income to have your peace of mind   so there 's certainly a lot to consider in it   but if you 're a self starter i believe you 're right that you 'll find it 's more worthwhile to self insure if you indeed have the resources

a lot of loans are taken out on a fixed rate basis so the rate is part of the contract and is therefore covered by contract law if the loan is taken out on a variable basis then in principle the rate can rise within the terms of the contract   if a particular lender tries to raise its rates out of line with the market then its customers will seek alternative cheaper loans and pay off their expensive loan if they can if rates rise sharply in general due to unusual economic circumstances then those with variable rate loans can find themselves in severe trouble   for example the base rate in the uk and therefore variable mortgage rates closely tied to it spiked sharply in the late 80s which caused severe stress to a lot of borrowers and undoubtedly pushed some into financial difficulties

one way is to think of a reit as a fully managed portfolio of real estate investments risks and returns are averaged across the real estate portfolio and managed by experts possibly industry leading experts   reits have a well documented track record you can research most individuals do not many individuals have learned a hard lesson or two while attempting to generate passive income with real estate conversely some people derive a great deal of satisfaction from owning real estate and have a true passion to do so   plus if you are expecting interest rates to raise and/or rate of inflation to increase in the next 30 years you may benefit from the financing aspects of the investment as well   there are some opportunities that seem to do better than the average reit a majority of the time but may not be desirable to you or fit into your budget for various reasons i 'm not sure what your level of experience knowledge or financial situation but for everyone considering there are many additional things to know about investment property compared to a primary residence   a good place to start with reits is the prospectus of one that interests you   research their holdings create a model or otherwise make a connection with the reit before clicking buy

grad school applications typically have deadlines around december or january so you 're thinking about this at the right time    first obviously you should get an idea of where you want to go and what kind of program there 's plenty of ranking lists online that can help give you an idea grad school applications take a non trivial amount of effort so most people apply to only 5 10   next you 'll want to contact potential references the grad school websites should inform you what type of reference they want but in my experience these were mostly academic and usually 2 3 per application finance programs may want more professional references as well try to choose the right references for the application e.g. i applied to financial engineering programs and would usually have one economics professor and then either a math professor or a statistics professor depending on the focus of the program   now check to see if your programs require a gre gmat score they probably will and start studying asap there 's tons of study materials available both in book form and online and if you can put the time in you can probably get a decent score with just a few weeks 4 6 of studying as far as i know just about every program that accepts a gmat score will also accept a gre score but not necessarily the other way around so you may be better off studying for the gre verify this   and with all those components complete you 'll basically be done some applications will ask for various forms of cover letter or have other essay questions so set aside some time to write these as well    also if you 're looking at finance master 's programs i notice that they tend to come in a few varieties some set you up for phds and are naturally more academic focused where as terminal master 's that resemble an mba will focus on trying to get you a job reflect a bit on what you want to accomplish with your degree and figure out the program that 's best for that if you get in to a top school then it wo n't matter much regardless but otherwise it is very likely that schools which produce good phd candidates and research are not necessarily the same schools which place people on wall street   hope that helps

there 's really no right or wrong answer here because you 'll be fine either way if you 've investing amounts in the low 5 figures you 're likely just getting started and if your asset allocation is not optimal it 's not that big a deal because you have a long time horizon to adjust it and the expense ratio differences here wo n't add up to that much a third option is vanguard etfs which have the expense ratio of admiral shares but have lower minimums i.e. the cost of a single share typically on the order of $ 100 however they are a bit more advanced than mutual funds in that they trade on the market and require you to place orders rather than just specifying the amount you want to buy a downside here is you might end up with a small amount of cash that you ca n't invest since you can initially only buy whole numbers of etfs shares so what i 'd recommend is buying roughly the correct number of etfs shares you want except for your largest allocation then use the rest of your cash on admiral shares of that if possible for example let 's say you have $ 15k to invest and you want to be 2/3 u.s. stock 1/6 international stock and 1/6 u.s. bond i would buy as many shares of international stock etf and u.s. bond etf as you can get for $ 2500 each then whatever is left over put into vtsax u.s. stock admiral shares mutual fund

last month i spend about 3 4 days totally diving into the kindle e books drm etc   my goal was to basically replace my entire book collection online with books that i could edit etc     the result   kindle and the drm suck   the pirate experience an order of magnitude better than the kindle and drm experience   1   not all books are even available on the kindle or other drm platforms   pirated books   not a problem i can pretty much get any book i want in a matter of minutes   sometimes i have to spend a while to find them maybe 10 15 minutes   2   the quality of the drm books are horrible   for kindle they use fixed width graphics   however many of the pdf books that i 've been using use pdfs and vector graphics which means they look nice on my 30 monitor   4   i can use skim to edit and manipulate the books i can attach i can copy text out i can add bookmarks i can highlight pages   in kindle i can do this but it 's very basic and frankly the highlighting sucks and is hard to use     5   the kindle books are handicapped by the publishers and they wo n't let you actually copy text from them some of the publishers do let you do this but i want a consistent experience i do n't want to be reading a book and want to copy a paragraph to a friend only to find out that this is disabled   6   some of the magazine editions suck they are the same price as the news stand one but do n't actually include the full magazine   and no where on the site does it say this some of these do end up getting downvoted in the amazon reviews but i 've accidentally purchased a few of these and felt screwed   7   many most of the books you use do n't actually have an   they 're just flat out stripped removed   this is because the kindle pages and the book pages do n't line up however in pdf versions they are there and they 're working   i think the pdfs are the leaked master copy which they use to print the book   8   some of my kindle books are far inferior to the print edition that i actually own due to misc errors   for example one of them is missing a whole 2 chapters at the end which were author notes after the book was written but the kindle version says it 's the same edition as the one i own   9   what about bugs   if they make a mistake do they give you a new copy of the book   for example in 8 that 's clearly a bug they should have included those two chapters   do i get a new copy of the book when they fix it   will they ever fix it   do my notes highlights work with the new version do i get to keep the older version   in short i do not mind paying   in fact i allocated the money to upgrade my entire book collection to electronic   but i 'll be damned if i do that now the experience is so bad that i do n't want to give them the satisfaction of taking my money for this crap   further e books could be a revolution in the way we perceive books   why are we limiting ourselves to just text   why not interactive graphs spreadsheets charts i should be able to manipulate the examples change numbers zoom in etc     high resolution images for example that look awesome on my 30 display   video included embedded directly into the book   audio and audio commentary by the author   the entertainment industry went this way with dvds to encourage people to buy this format over the version   we need to do this with too     one could do this with html5 but it needs to be done right   some sort of simple zip with html inside which can be viewed by normal browsers    i 'll also say this i 'm not too concerned about the drm   just in terms of innovation this would be a major step forward     books and print media is dying but we could revolutionize it and embrace the digital publishing medium and really kick ass   edit   holy shit that was long the adderall must have just kicked in

a link to this article grabbed my interest as i was browsing the site for something totally unrelated to finance   your question is not silly i 'm not a financial expert but i 've been in your situation several times with carmax auto finance caf in particular a lot of people probably thought you do n't understand how financing works but your car loan set up is exactly how caf financing works which i 've used several times just some background info to anyone else reading this unlike most other simple interest car financing with caf they calculate per diem based on your principal balance and recalculate it every time you make a payment regardless of when your actual due date was   but here 's what makes caf financing particularly fair when you do make a payment your per diem since your last payment accrued x dollars and that 's your interest portion that is subtracted first from your payment and obviously per diem goes down faster the more you pay in a payment and then everything else including any extra payments you make goes to principal you do not have to specify that the extra payment(s are principal only if your payment amount per month is $ 500 and you give them 11 payments of $ 500 the first $ 500 will have a small portion go to interest accrued since the last payment depending on the per diem that was recalculated and then everything else goes to principal and still pushes your next due date i prefer to break up extra payments as precisely the amount due per month so that my intention is clear pay the extra as a payment for the next month and the one after that etc and keep pushing my next due date that last point of pushing your next due date is the key   not all car financing companies do that a lot of them will let you pay to principal yes but you 're still due next month with caf you can have your cake and eat it too i worked for them in college i know their financing system in and out and i 've always financed with them for that very reason   so back to the question should you keep the loan alive albeit for a small amount my unprofessional answer is yes car loans are very powerful in your credit report because they are installment accounts same as mortgages and other accounts that you pay down to 0 and the loan is closed credit cards are revolving accounts and do n't offer as much bang for your money unless you are savvy in manipulating your card balances take it up one month take it down to 0 the next month etc i play those games a lot but i always find mortgage and auto loans make the best impact   i do exactly what you do myself i pay off the car down to about $ 500 i actually make several small payments each equal to the agreed upon monthly payment because their system automatically treats that as a payment for the next month due and the one after that etc on top of paying it all to principal as i mentioned   do not leave a dollar as another reader mentioned they have a good will threshold i ca n't remember how much probably $ 50 for which they will consider the account paid off and close it out so if your concern is throwing away free money but you still want the account alive your sweet spot where you can be sure the loan is not closed is probably around $ 100   but something else important to consider if you decide to go with that strategy of keeping the account alive which i recommend in my case caf will adjust down your next payment due if it 's less than the principal left so let 's say your regular payment is $ 400 and you only leave a $ 100 your next payment due is $ 100 and it will go up a few cents each month because of the small per diem and that is exactly what caf will report to the credit bureaus as your monthly obligation which sucks because now your awesome car payment history looks like you 've only been paying $ 100 every month so leave something close to one month 's payment yes the interest accrued will be higher but i 'm not a penny when the reward is worth it if you left $ 400 for 1.5 years at 10 apr that equates to about $ 50 interest for that entire time well worth it in my books sorry for rambling a lot i suck myself into these debates all the time

upstream is into businesses that supply the original business downstream is into businesses that make use of the original product   so in that description what they are saying is that the original business received products from plantations and sent products to manufacturing this is also called vertical integration   meaning that they are diversifying along their supply chain so that they control more of it   this is in contrast with horizontal integration where they move into new products that either compete with the existing products or which are entirely separate    in general the upside of vertical integration is that a company is less reliant on suppliers and intermediate consumers and has more control over its supply chain   the downside is that they have less opportunity to partner with other companies in the same supply chain as they compete with them   some companies are better at managing to do both   for example amazon.com has integrated fulfillment and sales   but partners can still do their own fulfillment and/or sales choosing how much to send out to amazon    if you are investing in individual stocks integrated companies can be problematic in that they cut across diversification areas   so they can be harder to balance with other stocks   you can either buy plantations transport and manufacturing together or not buy at all   if your investment strategy says to increase plantations and reduce manufacturing this can be difficult to implement with an integrated company   of course everyone else has the same problem which can lead to integrated companies being undervalued   so they may be an opportunity as a value stock

rob i 'm sorry your first visit here has been unpleasant   what you are asking for is beyond the capability of most software if you look at you find the standard deduction for married filing joint is $ in 2012 and $ in 2013 i offer this anecdote to share a deduction story the first year i did my mil 's taxes i had to explain that she did n't    have enough deductions to itemize every year since she hands me a    file full of paper medical deductions that do n't exceed    7.5 of her income in turn i give her two folders back one with the 5 or so documents i needed and the rest labeled trash fewer than 30 of filers itemize and a good portion of those that do have no question that 's the right thing to do e.g. my property tax is more than the $ 12 k so anything else i have that 's a deduction adds right to the number   it 's really just those people who are at the edge that are likely frustrated i wrote an article regarding standard deduction vs itemizing in which i describe a method of pulling in one 's deductible expenses into odd years reducing the number in even years to allow a bi annual if this is your situation you 'll find the concept interesting   you also ask about filing status think on this for a minute after pulling in our turbotax imports the data right from adp i do the same for our stock info the stock info and all schedule a deductions are n't assigned a name so any effort to split them in search of savings by using married filing separate would first require splitting these up turbotax has a what if worksheet for this function but when the marriage penalty was lifted years ago the change in status had no value items that phaseout over certain income levels are often lost to the separate filer anyway when i got married i found my real estate losses each year could not be taken they accumulated until i either sold or until our income dropped when the mrs retired   so while is respect your desire for these magic within the software i think it 's fair to say they would provide little value to most people   if this thread stays open i 'd be curious if anyone can cite an example where filing separately actually benefits the couple

gladwell was writing about which university an stem major should choose if the kid actually wants to finish university with a stem degree   according to gladwell stem students whose sat math scores were in the bottom third regardless of the university were much less likely to graduate with a stem degree   they 're not dropping out of school though they 're just getting different degrees   so if your goal is to get a stem degree and be a successful student harvard may not be the best place for you particularly if your score falls into that bottom third     that inc. author completely missed the point that gladwell makes in his book   either that or he 's intentionally misrepresenting it

you are making an assumption that may not be true to me some apartment debt i paid had already been sold to a collections agency before i actually paid it typically debts are sold to a debt buyer whereas a collection agency works on commission to collect debts on behalf of the creditor if your debt was actually sold you should have been notified in writing of this fact and who the new creditor was i suspect your debt was not sold because if it was the apartment complex would not have been legally allowed to cash your check when you finally paid them therefore it is most likely that the collection agency was working on commission and the apartment complex never informed them that you had settled your debt as for what to do about it here are 3 options ordered by likelihood of success good luck and if you do n't mind please update us later on what you did and what the result was your experience will be helpful for others having this issue in the future

while it is a true loss as you 've determined is not a cash cost per se a cash cost would be a decrease in cash holdings   inflation does not take your cash balance it devalues it so it is an accrued loss central banks are extremely lazy in determining inflation so the highest resolution available at a public level is monthly   in the united states there is a small project that tries to calculate daily inflation rates and seems to do a decent job but unless if you are a customer of a particular financial institution you will suffer a lag   the small project refuses to make the data public in real time or even allow outside analysis in the uk the office for national statistics is responsible for consumer inflation statistics   the methodology is not readily available but considering the name it is most likely an inferior index instead of the optimal fisher index as it is in the us to calculate the accrued cost due to inflation simply multiply the amount of money held by the price index value at the beginning of the time held and divide by the price index value at the end of the time held for example to determine the amount of value lost since march 2014 multiply the money held by the price index value for march 2014 and divide by june 2014

not to my knowledge often the specific location is diversified out of the fund because each major building company or real estate company attempts to diversify   risk by spreading it over multiple geographical locations also buyers of these smaller portfolios will again diversify by creating a larger fund to sell to the general public that being said you can sometimes drill down to the specific assets held by a real estate fund that takes a lot of work you can also look for the issuer of the bond that the construction or real estate company issued to find out if it is region specific hope that helps

how can i avoid this so we are taxed as if we are making the $ 60k yr that we want to receive   you ca n't in the us the income is taxed when received not when used if you receive 1 m this year taking out 60 k does n't mean the other k were n't received they were and are taxable create a pension fund in the corporation feed it all profits and pay    out $ 60k yr of pension i doubt that the corporation could deduct a    million a year in pension funding you can not do that you can only deposit to a pension plan up to 100 of your salary and no more than $ 50 k total maybe a little more this year its adjusted to inflation buy a million dollars in business equipment of some sort each year    to get a deduction then sell it over time to fund a $ 60k yr salary i    doubt such a vehicle exists if there 's no real business purpose it will be disallowed and you 'll be penalized your only purpose is tax avoidance meaning you 're trying to shift income using your business to avoid paying taxes that 's illegal do crazy section 79 life insurance schemes to tax defer the income    the law caps this so i can only deduct < $ 100k of the $ 1 million    annually and there are other problems with this yes would n't go there   added from what i understand this is a term life insurance plan sponsored by the employer for the employee this is not a deferral of income but rather a deduction instead of paying your term life insurance with your own after tax money your employer pays with their pre tax it has a limit of $ 50 k per employee and is only available for employees there are non discrimination limitations that may affect your ability to use it but i do n't see how it is at all helpful for you it gives you a deduction but its money spent not money in your pocket end added do some tax avoidance like facebook does with its double irish trick    storing the income in some foreign subsidiary and drawing $ 60k yr in    salary to be taxed at $ 60k yr rates this is probably cost prohibitive    for a $ 1mm yr company you 're not facebook what works with a billion will not work with a million keep in mind that you 're a one man business things that huge corporations like google or facebook can get away with are a no no for a sole proprietor even if incorporated bottom line you 'll probably have to pay the taxes get a good tax professional to help you identify as much deductions as possible and if you can plan income ahead plan it better

this is always a judgement call based on your own tolerance for risk   yes you have a fairly long time horizon and that does mean you can accept more risk more volatility than someone closer to starting to draw upon those savings but you 're old enough and have enough existing savings that you want to start thinking about reducing the risk a notch so most folks in your position would not put 100 in stocks though exactly how much should be moved to bonds is debatable one traditional rule of thumb for a moderately conservative position is to subtract your age from 100 and keep that percentage of your investments in stock for stock bond age will find lots of debate about whether and how to modify this rule i have gone more aggressive myself and have n't demonstrably hurt myself but past results are no guarantee of future performance a paid financial planning advisor can interview you about your risk tolerance run some computer models and recommend a strategy with some estimate of expected performance and volatility if you are looking for a semi rational approach that may be worth considering at least as a starting point

having a separate checking account for the business makes sense it simplifies documenting your income expenses you can explain every dollar entering and exiting the account without having to remember that some of them were for non business items my credit union allowed me to have a 2nd checking account and allowed me to put whatever i wanted as the name on the check i think this looked a little better than having my name on the check i do n't see the need for a separate checking account for investing the money can be kept in a separate savings account that has no fees and can even earn a little interest unless you are doing a lot of investment transactions a month this has worked for me i fund iras and 529 plans this way we get paychecks 4 5 times a month but send money to each of the funds once a month you will need a business account if the number of transactions becomes large if you deposit dozens of checks every time you go to the bank the bank will want to move you to a business account

the values of 12 26 and 9 are the typical industry standard setting used with the macd however other values can be substituted depending on your trading style and goals the ema is considered the long moving average when in this case it is compared to the shorter ema if you used a ema and a ema then the ema would be considered the long ma it is based on what you are comparing it with apart from providing signals for a reversal in trend macd can also be used as an early indication to a possible end to a trend what you look out for is divergence between the price and the macd see chart below of an example   here i have used 3d and 1 for the signal as i did not want the signal to show up i am simply using the macd as a momentum indicator which work by providing higher highs in the macd with higher highs in price this shows that the momentum in the trend is good so the trend should continue however the last high in price is not met with a higher high in the macd the green lines demonstrate bearish divergence between price and the macd which is an indication that the momentum of the trend is slowing down this could provide that the trend may be about to end and to take caution i.e. not a good time to be buying this stock or if you already own it you may want to tighten up your stop loss

you could try to refine your options strategy   for instance you could buy the usd 750 call you mentioned and at the same time sell short call options with a higher strike price which is above the share price level you expect that apple will trade at in one year for instance usd 1,100   by doing this you would receive the premium of the call with the higher option which in turn would help you finance buying your usd 750 the net effect of this trading strategy would be that you would give up the extra profit you would earn if apple would rose above usd 1,100 the strike price of the call option sold short your total risk would be even less than with your actual strategy in my view

like joetaxpayer said i do n't know of any difference between the backdoor and a regular roth ira contribution besides the issue with existing pre tax ira money so if it is your practice to contribute at the beginning of the year good for you most people wait until the last minute then doing a backdoor seems like the safe choice some people have speculated that hypothetically the irs could use the step transaction doctrine to treat it as a single direct contribution to a roth ira which then would be disallowed and cause you a penalty until you take it out but i have never heard of this happening to anyone as for the paperwork you just need to fill out one extra form at tax time form 8606 you need to complete two parts of it one for the non deductible contribution and one for the conversion it is pretty straightforward although i 've found that it is a pain to do it in tax software another option would be for you to contribute to a roth ira now but when you discover that you 're over the limit at the end of the year re characterize it as a traditional contribution and then convert it back to roth but this way is not good because then there is a long time between the traditional contribution and the roth conversion and earnings during this time will be taxed at conversion

education is where there 's no need for humans videos and recorded lectures ai teaching at your own level and pace are much better than a class of 30   yes this is one of automation yet i only see it as a complement to the education system if there 's one thing automation can not provide it would be the same interactive environment provided by the classroom which allows students to learn from each other and request a different explanation in real time for    videos and recorded lectures tend to be one way communication is stifling and overwhelming which kills the learning environment this is one of many reasons why online courses are n't taken seriously at least in this part of the world the presence of the facilitator imparts certain values in the student the role of the facilitator is just as crucial as the knowledge they    i have never heard of ai teaching maybe it will disrupt education in the future but for now we are stuck with our vanilla education system

the only party that can pay back a government bond is the government that issued it itself in the case of argentina us vulture funds have won cases against it but it has yet to pay   the best one can do to collect is to sue in a jurisdiction that permits and hope to seize the defaulted government 's assets held in such jurisdiction one could encourage another state to go to war to collect but this is highly unlikely since a state that does n't repay is probably a poor state with nothing much to loot besides most modern governments do not loot the conquered anymore   such a specific eventuality has n't happened in at least a lifetime anyways   it is highly unlikely that any nation would be foolish enough to challenge the united states considering its present military dominance it is rare for nations with medium to large economies to their government obligations for long with argentina as the notable exception   even russia became current when they their government debt during the oil collapse of 1998 countries with very small economies such as zimbabwe are the only remaining nations that try to use their central banks to fund debt repayments if they even repay at all but they quickly see that the destruction caused by hyperinflation neither helps with government debt nor excessive government expenditure nevertheless it could be dangerous to assume that no nation would default on its debt for any period of time and the effects upon countries with defaulted government debt show that it has far reaching negative consequences if the us were to use its central bank to repay its government obligations the law governing the federal reserve would have to be changed since it is currently mandated to maintain long run growth of the monetary and credit aggregates commensurate with the economy 's long run potential to increase production so as to promote effectively the goals of maximum employment stable prices and moderate long term interest rates the united states treasury has no power over the federal reserve thus can not force the federal reserve to betray its mandate by purchasing government debt it should be noted that while japan has a government debt twice its gdp it also has a persistent slight deflation which has produced incredibly low interest rates allowing it to finance government debt more easily a situation the us does not enjoy for now the united states seems to be able to pay expenditures and finance at low interest rates   at what ratio of government debt to gdp that would cause interest rates to climb thus put pressure on the us 's ability to repay does not seem to be well known

a bank needs to make sure they wo n't lose money by cashing a check when you have an account with a bank and you cash a check if the check ends up not getting paid the bank will take the money back out of your account this could happen for a number of reasons the check could bounce not enough money in the check writer 's account it could be a fraudulent fake check or the payment could have been stopped on that check   treasury checks are more problematic for banks than private checks the government has given themselves more power to refuse to pay a check than the average person has as a result banks are already overly cautious about cashing treasury checks the fact that you have a big check increases the risk for the bank   you 'll have to ask around at different banks to see what they will do for you and what type of fee if any they will charge some banks might cash it for a fee others might require that you open a savings account and wait a certain number of days after depositing the check before withdrawing your money

i would n't like to say either way what you should do not being an financial advisor or lawyer but i did find an interesting article on walk away from your mortgage   that you might also find helpful to frame your decision it has some interesting information on defaults it says this mortgage holders do sign a promissory note which is a promise to pay but the contract explicitly details the penalty for nonpayment surrender of the property the borrower is n’t escaping the consequences he is suffering them in some states lenders also have recourse to the assets like their car and savings accounts a study by the federal reserve bank of richmond found that defaults are lower in such states apparently because lenders threaten the borrowers with judgments against their assets but actual lawsuits are rare and given that nearly a quarter of mortgages are underwater and that 10 percent of mortgages are delinquent white of the university of arizona is surprised that more people have n’t walked he thinks the desire to avoid shame is a factor as are overblown fears of harm to credit ratings probably homeowners also labor under a delusion that their homes will quickly return to value white has argued that the government should stop default scare stories and indeed should encourage borrowers to default when it ’s in their economic interest this would correct a prevailing imbalance homeowners operate under a powerful moral constraint while lenders are trying to maximize profits more important it might get the system if lenders feared an avalanche of strategic defaults they would have an incentive to renegotiate loan terms in theory this could produce a wave of loan modifications the very goal the treasury has been pursuing to end the crisis

it 's in your interest to pay down these loans just like any debt at an accelerated rate so long as you prioritize it appropriately and do n't jeopardize your financial situation what are your plans for the $ 50k is it a downpayment on a house are you already saving for retirement at what rate are you saving each year these are all important questions there is nothing wrong with using some of the $ 50k to make a dent in your loans but overpaying a debt at 6 should not be your first priority save for retirement pay off credit cards make sure you have an emergency fund of between 6 12 months living expenses depending on your comfort level as well as how stable you think your job is and how much you could downsize if need be then tackle extra loan payments unfortunately 6 is about what you would expect to get in the market these days so you ca n't necessarily make more money investing your remaining cash on hand as compared to putting it towards your loans and you could always make less personally i would divide the $ 50k as follows insert your own numbers circumstances of the that remains

my observations is that this seems like hardly enough to kill    inflation is he right or are there better ways to invest the tax deferral part of the equation is n't what dominates regarding whether your 401k beats 30 years of inflation it is the return on investment   if your 401k account tanks due to a prolonged market crash just as you retire then you might have been better off stashing the money in the bank   remember 401k money at now + 30 years is not a guaranteed return though many speak as though it were   there is also the question as to whether fees will eat up some of your return and whether the funds your 401k invests in are good ones i 'm uneasy with the autopilot nature of the typical 401k non strategy it 's too much the standard thing to do in the u.s. it 's too and strikes me as ponzi like   it has been a winning strategy for some already sure and maybe it will work for the next 30 100 years or more   i just do n't know   there are also changes in policy or other unknowns that 30 years will bring so it takes faith i do n't have to lock away a large chunk of my savings in something i ca n't touch without hassle and penalty until then for that reason i have contributed very little to my 403b previously contribute nothing now though employer does automatically   i have no match and have built up a sizable cash savings some of which may be used to start a business or buy a house with a small or no mortgage thereby guaranteeing at least not paying mortgage interest   i am open to changing my mind about all this but am glad i 've been able to at least save a chunk to give me some options that i can exercise in the next 5 10 years if i want instead of having to wait 25 or more

from lots of sensible advisers will tell you to buy index funds but    importantly the advice is not simply buy index funds    there are at least two other critical details 1 asset allocation    across multiple well chosen indexes maintained through regular    rebalancing and 2 dollar cost averaging or    much more complex but probably slightly better value averaging the    advice is not to take your single lump sum and buy and hold a    cap weighted index forever the advice is an investment    discipline which involves action over time and an initial    choice among indexes an index fund based    strategy is not completely passive it involves some active risk    control through rebalancing and averaging if you 'd held a balanced portfolio over the last ten years and rebalanced and even better if you 'd dollar cost averaged you 'd have done fine your reaction to the last 10 years incidentally is why i do n't believe an almost all stocks allocation makes sense for most people even if they 're pretty young more detail in this answer how would bonds fare if interest rates rose i think some index fund advocacy and books do people a disservice by focusing too much on the extra cost of active management and why index funds are a good deal   that point is true but for most investors asset allocation rebalancing and of their setup are more important to outcome than the expense ratio

if you know you will have a big bill like braces and you fully expect to hit the deductible then it can make sense the deductible can trip some people up because if they put too much into the limited purpose fsa and do n't hit the deductible for the regular insurance policy they ca n't get to all the money in the fsa because you have the ability to spend the potential money in the fsa before all the money has been contributed it can allow you to make that payment for the braces in january i did this the first year we had the hsa i knew i needed to pay a dental bill early in the year but the hsa would only have a few hundred dollars at that time so i used the limited purpose fsa to be able to make that payment this could also work if you spent a lot of money in the previous year because you have the ability to adjust how much money goes into the hsa each each pay period this idea does keep the option open to fully fund the hsa if your finances improve regarding the deductible   the law limits what you can use the limited purpose fsa for dental and vision only there is an exception if you hit the deductible for the high deductible insurance policy then you can use the funds in the limited purpose fsa for any medical reason   when i did this a few years ago i needed to send extensive paperwork to the company holding the funds before they would release the funds for dental once i sent them proof that i had met the deductible then any medical expense after that date could use the fsa with minimal paperwork if you fully fund the fsa beyond the cost of the braces and then have a light year medical expense wise you might not be able to spend all money in the fsa by the deadline regarding state taxes   i saw no difference in my states virginia treatment of the funds the state taxable income number was exactly the same as the federal taxable income number it did not treat the money in the fsa differently than the money in the hsa

yes you should incorporate if you plan on seriously investing in real estate this not only limits liability in terms of paying back the debt but also in case your tenants sue you   pass through entities typically an llc but it depends on the state if they have good or bad llc laws pennsylvania is a state where you would not want to incorporate as an llc other options include s corps and   loans are taken out by corporations against the property typically mortgage loans are non recourse if you set up a company for each property this further insulates you against the bank capturing other properties within the pool however recourse can still end up getting you on the hook personally for the loans these typically include voluntary bankruptcy you would very rarely have to file for bankruptcy anyway for your real estate investments at worst it will end in foreclosure but banks typically would prefer deed in lieu just because it is faster and easier for them too you just turn over the keys and walk away it will have very little impact on your personal finances or record everyone in real estate walks away from properties and leaves them with the bank it 's a fact of doing business and your lender should have been comfortable owning your property at the basis they lent money to you if they were n't they were just stupid   yes every real estate investment requires equity in the property typically it 's a 20 equity check but if the lender the property to a lower value than what you purchased it for you may have to line up more expensive financing

for whatever it 's worth   judging from the comments in the other answers i think everyone is addressing your question how can you possibly lose money   there are a lot of ways to possibly lose money in the stock market   here are my thoughts   this is a chart of the s&p 500 from about 1996 to about 2012   at the top from the first arrow the entire s&p500 index fell about 45   from the top of the second arrow the entire s&p500 index fell about 52   it is really easy to look at our sustained bull market and feel   and while i 'll concede that not every company in the index fell over these two periods bear in mind that the s&p500 index is a collection of the 500 largest companies in the united states and the entire index lost half it 's value twice   as the companies contained in the index shrink in value they were replaced by companies that are the new biggest 500 in the country then those fell too and so on and so forth until the entire index lost half value is a funny thing because it is n't necessarily tied to the performance of the business look at the current rosy valuations of all these non earnings tech companies   it could be that a company is still performing very well but there are just no buyers for the stock    so how can you lose money in the stock market   very easily   in a practical sense it 's when you need the money and can no longer weather the storm   people who went out for retirement around 2000 could n't sit around and wait until 2007 for their account values to be replenished   this is why you roll off your stock exposure as you age   as you get older you do n't have time and if you stop having income you can find yourself selling your assets at the least opportune time

what are my options for raising the funds assuming you have decent credit you can either mortgage your home or apply for a land loan in order to purchase the land since both your home and the land have value either one can act as collateral in case you default on your loan land loans tend to have a higher interest rate and down payment however this is because banks see land loans as a riskier investment since it 's easier for you to walk away from an empty plot of land than your own home

is it common in the us not to pay medical bills or do i misunderstood what had been said there has definitely been a misunderstanding as it is not that common for people to not pay medical bills yes there are those that can not afford to pay them and that does contribute to increasing prices but overall people do pay i think there is an aspect to this that has not been covered by the other two answers what is common at least in my experience is that medical providers i.e. doctors hospitals etc are much more likely to work with you on establishing a payment plan than utilities credit card companies banks etc are this is different than holding off payment in the hopes of negotiating a reduction in payment i am speaking of paying the total amount but over multiple payments and without a penalty for paying over multiple payments and usually they will ask you what you can afford if you can pay $ 50 per month likely that will work and even what i do that and call to pay the monthly amount they will ask if i will pay that or some other including lesser amount also if i skip a month usually from forgetting not intentionally there is again no additional fee this does n't cover all providers but so far has been consistent across all of the ones i have used i suspect this is what your colleagues were referring to

first to actually answer the question how long at these rates   these is nothing magic or nefarious about what the bank is doing they add accrued interest and take your payment off the new total   i 'd make higher payments to the 8.75 debt until it 's gone $ 100/mo extra and be done the first debt if you bump it to $ 50 will be paid in 147 months at $ 92 months everything you pay above the minimum goes right to the principal balance and gets you closer to paying it off   the debt snowball is not the ideal way to pay off your debt say i have one 24 credit card the bank was nice enough to give me a $ 20,000 line of credit on i also have 20 cards each with $ 1000 in credit all at 6 the snowball dictates that the smallest debt be paid first so while i pay the minimum on the 24 card the 6 cards get paid off one by one but i 'm supposed to feel good about the process as i reduce the number of cards every few months   the correct way to line up debt is to pay off the tax adjusted highest rate first as an extra $ 100 to the 24 card saves you $ vs 50 cents mo for the 6 cards i wrote an article discussing the debt snowball which links to a calculator where you can see the difference in methods i note that if the difference from lowest to highest rate is small the snowball method will only cost you a small amount more if by coincidence the balances are close the difference will also be small   the above aside it 's the rest of your situation that will tell you the right path for you for example a matched 401(k deposit should take priority over most debt repayment the $ 11,000 might be better for a house downpayment as that $ is student loan and wo n't count as the housing debt rather other debt and part of the higher ratio when qualifying for the mortgage if you already have taken this into account by all means pay off the 8.75 debt asap then start paying off the 3 faster keep in mind this is likely the lowest rate debt one can have and once paid off you ca n't withdraw it again so it 's important to consider the big picture first   are you depositing to a retirement account is it a 401(k and are you getting any matching from the company

what will happen if the stock price just continues to decline   nothing what would happen if folks just stop trading it nothing what if the company goes private then they will have to buy you out based on some agreed upon price as voted by the board and potentially approved by the shareholders depending on the corporation charter the board may not be required to seek the shareholders approval but if the price the board agreed upon is unreasonable you can sue and prevent the transaction how do they decide the fair value of the outstanding stocks through a process called valuation there are accounting firms which specialize in this area of public accounting

gt however for non tech industries if current ceo 's want to learn more about tech i think that 's great but most of them still wo n't get it they 'll just say the normal buzzwords and enough to get by    yup and as the article says this will not bode well for the company that employs them the fundamental problem is that non tech companies are facing the same kind of disruption that is situation normal for the tech business it probably wo n't last forever like that but for now there is a big wave of through a lot of industries   gt then a cto cio will step up   you ever been at a company with a technically brilliant cio and a ceo that did n't a thing about technology does great if the business fundamentals remain the same otherwise not so much probably one of the better outcomes with that was at ibm he saved the company but turned one of the biggest mountains of intellectual property in to a consulting services company that essentially was out of the tech game   gt also one risk here is you get a ceo who wants to learn tech or gets a wild hair and then they think they know everything and then the begins i actually worked at a company that went this direction because a ceo learned about a new product that would replace our backend processing software and wanted everyone to start converting to it then the cio had to come in and take   if you have a ceo who thinks they know everything when they do n't you are definitely doomed they have to expect their senior staff to be more talented specialists if they are n't that already a very bad sign of their leadership skills

i would recommend using growth value income bond based asset allocation because your goal is to find asset classes that have different performance trends when 1 is up the other is down and vice versa     if you chose domestic us stocks and diversified between med cap and large cap stocks they would not exactly mirror each other but they would roughly rise and fall at the same time preventing you from taking full advantage of diversification increasing risk and lowering returns

yeah i mean it 's natural economics that jobs go to low wage countries so i guess i ca n't be mad at that but in addition there 's also a shift in debt from what was usually mortgages to student loan debt it 's not good because you 're no longer paying yourself as you did with a mortgage so money just gets burned you ca n't shed that debt ever    people frame it like a bubble but it 's more like a long term hamper on consumer spending imo if the fed wants to help the economy this would be the most effective bailout for lifting long term growth i do n't have any student debt and i still think this is probably one of the better answers

brokerages offer you the convenience of buying and selling financial products they are usually not exchanges themselves but they can be typically there is an exchange and the broker sends orders to that exchange the main benefit that brokers offer is a simpler commission structure not all brokers have their own liquidity but brokers can have their own allotment of shares of a stock for example that they will sell you when you make an order so that you get what you want faster regarding accounts at the exchanges to track actual ownership and transfer of assets it is not safe to assume that s how that works there are a lot of shortcomings in how the actual exchange works since the settlement time is 1 3 business days depending on the product so upwards of 5 to 6 actual days in a fast market the asset can change hands many many times making the accounting completely incorrect for extended time periods better to not worry about that part but if you 'd like to read more about how that is regulated look up failure to deliver regulations on short selling to get a better understanding of market it is a very antiquated system

if you think you can manage the risk and the spread is ultimately worth it to you there 's nothing stopping you i know in the u.s. in ca specifically you need to have $ 85,000 annual income or net worth over some threshold to be able to loan more than $ 2,500 via peer to peer loan investing   i 've had an account at prosper since around 2010 it does pretty well   it 's made my taxes a bit more complicated each year but it 's been profitable for me   i would n't lever up on it though my prosper experience my experience with prosper has generally been positive   my real motivation for starting the account was generating a dataset that i could analyze here 's some of that analysis i started the account by trickling $ 100 in to buy four $ 25 loans   any payments received from these loans were used to buy more $ 25 loans   i 've kept my risk to an average of about a- aa a b c d e hr are the grades though the interest rates have reduced over time   at this point i have a few hundred loans outstanding in various stages of completion   in calendar 2015 i had a monthly average of 0.75 of my loans charged off and about 3 of loans at some stage of delinquency    i receive about 5.5 of my principle value in receipts on average each month including loan pay offs and charge offs   interest and other non principle payments comprise just shy of 20 of my monthly receipts   prosper 's 1 maintenance fee translates to about 8 of my monthly non principle receipts   it 's all a pretty fine line it would n't take many defaults to turn my annual return negative though in 5 years it has n't happened yet   considering only monthly charge offs against monthly non principle receipts i had two net negative months in 2015   i made about a net 4.5 annual return on my average monthly outstanding principle for calendar 2015   when i log in to my prosper account it claims my return   is closer to 7.5 i 'm not sure how that number is calculated the key is diversifying your risk just like a bank would   i do n't know how the other services function at a nuts and bolts level   with prosper i choose which loans to fund which means i determine my risk level   i assume the other services function similarly    regarding collection of charged off loans   i do n't know how much real effort is by prosper   i 've had a few notes sold for about 10 of the outstanding balance and i do n't know who they were sold to   comically i have loan that 's made more payments in collections than when it was in good standing   there is definitely more to this than handing over $ 15,000 and receiving 6 on it

obviously there are good answers about the alternatives to the stock market in the referenced question   hft has been debated heavily over the past couple of years and the flash crash of may 6 2010 has spurred regulators to rein in heavy automated trading hft takes advantage of churn and split second reactions to changing market trends news and rumors it is not wise for individual investors to fight the big boys in these games and you will likely lose money in day trading as a result hft 's 's may be right when they claim that it makes the market more liquid for you to get the listed price for a security but the article points out that their actions more closely resemble the currently illegal practice of front running than a negotiated trade where both parties feel that they 've received a fair value there are many factors including supply and demand which affect stock prices more than volume does while market makers are generating the majority of volume with their hft practices volume is merely the number of shares bought and sold in a day volume shows how many shares people are interested in trading not the actual underlying value of the security and its long term prospects extra volume does n't affect most long term investments so your long term investments are n't in any extra danger due to hft that said the stock market is a risky place   whether panicked people or poorly written programs are trading out of control most people are better off investing rather than merely trading long term investors do n't need to get the absolute lowest price or the highest sell they move into and out of positions based on overall value and long term prospects they 're diversified so bad apples like enron etc wo n't destroy their portfolio investors long term view allows them to ignore the effects of churn while working like the to win the race while the eventually gets swallowed by a bad bet there are a lot of worrying and stressful uncertainties in the global economy if it 's a question of wisdom focus on sound investments and work politically as a citizen and shareholder to fix problems you see in the system
