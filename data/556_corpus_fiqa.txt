does he need to file a tax return in this situation will the irs be concerned that he did not file even if he received a 1099 no however if you do n't file the irs may come back asking why or make up a return for you assuming that the whole amount on the 1099-misc is your net earnings so in the end i suspect you 'll end up filing even though you do n't have to just to prove that you do n't have to bottom line if you have 1099 income or any other income reported to the irs that brings you over the filing threshold file a return

here 's the detailed section of irs pub 590 it looks like you intended to have a trustee to trustee conversion but the receiving trustee dropped their ball   the bad news is a rollover contribution needed to be done in 60 days of the distribution   there is good news you can request an extension from the irs with one of the reasons if there was an error by one of the financial institutions involved other waivers    if you do not qualify for an automatic waiver you can apply to the irs for a waiver of the 60-day rollover requirement to apply for a waiver you must submit a request for a letter ruling under the appropriate irs revenue procedure this revenue procedure is generally published in the first internal revenue bulletin of the year you must also pay a user fee with the application the information is in revenue procedure 2016 8 in internal revenue bulletin 2016 1 available at     in determining whether to grant a waiver the irs will consider all relevant facts and circumstances including whether errors were made by the financial institution other than       those described under automatic waiver earlier whether you were unable to complete the rollover due to death disability incarceration restrictions imposed by a       foreign country or postal error whether you used the amount distributed for example in the case of payment by check whether you cashed the check and how much time has passed since the date of distribution you can also see if you can get etrade to recharacterize the equity position to your desired target ira   the positive here is that the allowed decision window for calendar year 2016 rollovers is october 15 2017 the negatives are this is irrevocable and restricts certain distributions from the target for a year unlikely to impact your situation but you know trust but verify anonymous internet advice and it requires etrade to recognize the original transaction was a rollover to a roth ira which they currently do n't   but if their system lets them put it through you could end up with the amount in a traditional ira with no other taxable events to report which appears to be your goal    recharacterization faq

if you are already invested in a particular stock i like joetaxpayer 's answer think about it as if you are re buying the stocks you own every day you decide to keep them and do n't set emotional anchor points about what you paid for them or what they might be worth tomorrow these lead to two major logical fallacies that investor 's commonly fall prey to loss aversion and sunk cost both of which can be bad for your portfolio in the long run to avert these natural tendencies i suggest having a game plan before you purchase a stock based on on your investment goals for that stock for example a combination of one or more of the following i 'm investing for the long term and i expect this stock to appreciate and will hold it until specific event time at which point i will sell it all sell it gradually over a fixed time period right around the time i need the money i 'm going to bail on this stock if it falls more than x from my purchase price i 'm going to cash out all half some of this investment if it gains more than x from my purchase price to lock in my returns the important thing is to arrive at a strategy before you are invested and are likely to be more emotional than rational   otherwise it can be very hard to sell a hot stock that has suddenly jumped in price 25 because it has momentum gambler 's fallacy conversely it can be hard to sell a stock when it drops by 25 because i know it will bounce back eventually sunk cost loss aversion fallacy   also remember that there is opportunity cost from sticking with a losing investment because your brain is saying i really have n't lost money until i give up and sell it when logically you should be thinking if i move my money to a more promising investment i could get a better return than i am likely to on what i 'm holding

4 beef up my emergency fund make sure my 401(k or ira was fully funded put the rest into investments see many past answers a house you are living in is not an investment it is a purchase just as rental is a purchase buying a house to rent out is starting a business if you want to spend the ongoing time and effort and cash running a business and if you can buy at the right time in the right place for the price this can be a reasonable investment if you are n't willing to suffer the pains of being a landlord it 's less attractive you can hire someone to manage it for you but that cuts the income significantly starting a business remember that many perhaps most small businesses fail if you really want to run a business it can be a good investment again assuming you can buy at the right time price place and are willing and able to invest the time and effort and money to support the business   nothing produces quick return with low risk

you 're missing the cost of carry aspect the cost of carry or carrying charge is the cost of storing a physical commodity such as grain or metals over a period of time the carrying charge includes insurance storage and interest on the invested funds as well as other incidental costs in interest rate futures markets it refers to the differential between the yield on a cash instrument and the cost of the funds necessary to buy the instrument so in a nutshell you 'd have to store the gold safely invest your money now i.e. you 're missing out on interests the money could have earned until the futures delivery date   well and on top of that you need to get the gold shipped to london or wherever the agreed delivery place is edit forgot to mention that of course there are arbitrageurs that make sure the futures and spot market prices do n't diverge so the idea is n't that bad as i might have made it sound but being in the arbitrage business myself i should that profits are small and is highly automated so before you spot a $ 1 profit somewhere between any two contracts you can be quite sure it 's been taken by an already

one significant reason it makes sense for filing to be the default is home ownership rates   i think far more so than investment income americans own homes as there is a significant mortgage interest deduction between that and investments a large number of americans would have to file about a third of americans get the mortgage interest tax deduction and a large chunk of the richest do n't qualify but would have to file for investments anyway we also have a very complicated tax code with nearly everyone getting some kind of deduction   earned income tax credit for the working poor folks making say $ 30k for a family of 4 with a full time job get several thousand dollars in refundable credits for example the student loan interest deduction the above mortgage deduction almost everyone gets something finally your employer may not know about your family situation   as we have tax credits and deductions for families based on number of children for example it 's possible your employer does n't know about those if you do n't get health insurance on their behalf they may well not know   start reporting things like that separately and you end up with about as much work as filing is now

you can do on both market and limit orders normal market orders will partial fill if you want more shares than are being offered or if someone pulled their order before you get there and now there are fewer shares than you placed a trade for with a limit order not at the you are shooting in the dark for a quick match most of the time it does not fill   this is a commonly used order type for arbitrage   some exchanges will not attempt to cross it for a match if its price is not at or better than the market price when the limit order is at the it is essentially a market order    fyi sometimes you have a minimum quantity to fill option so you can let the order sit on the book until it fills or you cancel

i would strongly encourage you to either find specifically where in your written contract the handling of early over payments are defined and post it for us to help you or that you go and visit a licensed real estate attorney even at a ridiculously high price of 850 pounds per hour for a top uk law firm and i suspect you can find a competent lawyer for 10 20 of that amount it would cost you less than a year of prepayment penalty to get professional advice on what to do with your mortgage a certified public accountant cpa might be able to advise you as well if that 's any easier for you to find i have the suspicion that the company representatives are not being entirely forthcoming with you thus the need for outside advice generally speaking loans are given an interest rate per period such as yearly apr and you pay a percentage the interest of the total amount of money you owe the principle so if you owe 100,000 at 5 apr you accrue 5,000 in interest that year if you pay only the interest each year you 'll pay 50,000 in interest over 10 years but if you pay everything off in year 8 at a minimum you 'd have paid 10,000 less in interest assuming no prepayment penalties which you have some of those so paying off early does not change your apr or your principle amount paid but it should drastically reduce the interest you pay amortization schedules do n't change that they just keep the payments even over the scheduled full life of the loan even with prepayment penalties these are billed at less than 6 months of interest at the rate you would have payed if you kept the loan so if you are supposedly on the hook for more than that again i highly suspect something fishy is going on in which case you 'd probably want legal representation to help you put a stop to it in short something is definitely and most certainly wrong if paying off a loan years in advance even after taking into account pre payment penalties costs you the same or more than paying the loan off over the full term on schedule this is highly abnormal and frankly even in the us i 'd consider it if it were the case so please do look deeper into this something is n't right

i 've read this claim many times in the news banks are making less profit from the lending business when interest rates are historically low the issue with most loans is they can be satisfied at any time   when you have falling interest rates it means most of the banks loans are refinanced from nice high rates to current market low interest rates which can significantly reduce the expected return on past loans   the bank gets the money back when it wants it the least because it can only re lend the money at the current market lower interest rates   when interest rates are increasing refinance and early repayment activity reduces significantly it 's important to look at the loan from the point of view of the bank a bank must first issue out the entire principal amount   on a 60 month loan the lender has not received payments sufficient to satisfy the principal until around or month depending on the interest rate   if the bank receives payment of the outstanding amount on month 30 the expected return on that loan is reduced significantly consider a $ 10,000 60 month loan at 5 apr   the bank is expected to receive $ in total for interest income of $   if the loan is repaid on month 30 the total interest is about $ 972   that 's a 26 reduction of expected interest income and the money received can only be re lent for yet a lower interest rate add to this the tricky accounting of holding a loan which is really a discounted bond which is an asset on the books and profitability of lending while interest rates are falling gets really funky and this does n't even examine default risk cost

my advice to you act like responsible adults and owe up to your financial commitments   when you bought your house and took out a loan from the bank you made an agreement to pay it back if you breach this agreement you deserve to have your credit score trashed   what do you think will happen to the $ 100k+ if you decide to stiff the bank the bank will make up for its loss by increasing the mortgage rates for others that are taking out loans so responsible borrowers get to subsidize those that their responsibilities if you were in a true hardship situation i would be inclined to take a different stance but as you 've indicated you are perfectly able to make the payments you just do n't feel like it real estate fluctuates in value just like any other asset if a stock i bought drops in value does the government come and bail me out of course not what i find most problematic about your plan is that not only do you wish to breach your agreement but you are also looking for ways to conceal your breach please think about this best of luck with your decision

in the case of a vehicle with a lien there is a specific place on the title to have a lien holder listed and the holder of the lien will also hold the title until the lien is cleared usually this means you have to pay off the loan when you purchase the vehicle if that loan is held by a bank meet the seller at the bank and pay the loan directly with them and have them send the title directly to you when the loan is paid this usually involves writing up a bill of sale to give to the bank when paying the loan the only thing you 're trying to avoid here is paying cash to the seller who then keeps the cash without paying the lien holder who then keeps the title and the motorcycle do n't pay the seller if they do n't have the title ready to sign over to you

this is not intended as legal advice and only covers general knowledge i have on the subject of wills as a result of handling my own finances    each state of the usa has its own laws on wills and trusts   you can find these online   for example in kentucky i found state laws here   and title is about wills and trusts   i would recommend reading this and then talking to a lawyer if it is not crystal clear    generally if a lawyer does not draft your will then either 1 you have no will or 2 you use a form or computer program to make a will that must then be properly witnessed before it is valid   if you do n't have it witnessed properly then you have no will   in some states you can have a will which means a will in your own   that 's when you have that 3 am heart attack and you get out a pad of paper and write i rescind all former wills hereby everything to my and as to the rest of you go rot in hell one issue with these is that they have to get to court somehow and someone has to verify the and there are often state laws about excluding a current spouse so you can guess for yourself whether that one might disappear in the fireplace when another family member finds it next to the body or if a court would give it validity and there can be logic or grammar problems with do it yourself wills made in your own without experience or good references on how to write things out   lawyers who have done a bunch of these know what is clear and makes sense   1 in tennessee where i live an 's property someone who died with no will is divided according to the law   the law looks to find a spouse or relatives to divide the property before considering giving it to the state   that might be fine for some people   it happened once in my family and was resolved in court with minimal red tape   but it really depends on the person   someone in the middle of an divorce for instance probably needs a will help to sort out who gets what    2 a form will is valid in tennessee if it is witnessed properly   that means two witnesses who sign in yours and each others presence   in theory they can be called to testify that the signature is valid   in practice i do n't know if this happens as i am not a lawyer i have found it difficult to find witnesses who will sign a form will and it is to have to ask friends or coworkers for this sort of favor as most people learn never to sign anything without reading it   but a lawyer often has secretaries that do it   there is a procedure and a treaty for international wills which i know about from living overseas to streamline things you can get the witnesses to each sign an affidavit after they signed the will   the affidavit is sworn written testimony of what happened that they saw the person sign their will and sign in each others presence when where no duress etc   if done correctly this can be sufficient to prove the will without calling on witnesses   there is another option 3 you arrange your affairs so that most of your funds are disbursed by banks or brokers holding your accounts   option 3 is really cheap most stock brokers and banks will create a transfer on death notice on your account for free   the problem with this is that you also need to write out a letter that explains to your heirs how to get this money and you need to make sure that they will get the letter if you are dead   also you ca n't deal with physical goods or appoint a guardian for children this way   the advantage of a lawyer is that you know the document is correct and according to local law and custom and also the lawyer might provide additional services like storing the will in his safe   you can get personalized help that you can not get with a form or computer program

insurance is not health care   insurance is a financial instrument designed to protect the insured from short term shocks caused by some calamity by spreading out the cost over time     not covering someone with a pre existing condition is similar to an car insurance company refusing to pay for repairing a damaged car where the damage was caused prior to obtaining insurance   not to be rude but failure to understand that utterly simple basic financial concept is exactly the sort of willful ignorance i 'm talking about   what you are interested in is justice   someone was harmed by a which is tragic for the individual and in some sense unfair    it is n't however the fault of the insurance company that the person did n't purchase a policy beforehand   it would in fact be unfair to existing policy holders if the insurance company pays such claims as it would raise their rates to cover those who will now rationally choose not to get insurance until after they have a claim

i think you 're missing my point i 'm not saying automation is n't useful or beneficial to society i feel it 's disingenuous to argue there would be no net job loss companies wo n't invest capital unless there is the prospect of a return therefore they wo n't build robots unless they are saving on labor if they have to replace an equal number of unskilled laborers with skilled laborers at a higher cost in addition to the capital expenditure to purchase the robots it does n't make sense to purchase the robots   companies adopt automation because it saves them money in the long run mostly by replacing human workers and resulting in a net job loss

the appropriate amount of cash bonds to hold will be largely a matter of opinion but here are the general reasons why having at least some is a good idea cash is very liquid and bonds are often mostly liquid this means you can access them very quickly without taking on losses to get the most liquidity out of your bonds you can do what is called laddering this means that you take out different bond amounts with different maturity dates and periodically renew them on a schedule so that you always have some bonds maturing which you can access without paying an interest penalty you can look this term up online for more details cash and bonds are low risk if you have absolutely no low risk assets then in the event of say a market crash you may have no savings to fall back on by owning some bonds and some equities you are able to earn a modest return without being too risky however note that some bonds are just as risky as equities any bond which pays an abnormally high interest rate does so because the entity backing the repayment government company whomever is thought to not be guaranteed to be able to do so the 25 figure given by your author is his opinion on the appropriate mix of cash bonds to equities but there are many views on the matter consider that any rule of thumb in personal finance should be for general consideration only

get a lawyer to put this in contract form with everything spelled out explicitly what is fair is what the two of you agree upon my own suggestion divide the property into things which are yours his and shared then have each of you be responsible for all your costs plus half the shared costs but get all the benefits of your half that would mean that if he rents out his half all the rental income is his if you decide to live in your half all the savings of not paying rent are yours   each of you pays your half of mortgage insurance and other shared costs repairs to shared infrastructure should be done by someone both of you trust if you agree the work is needed and he does it rather than your hiring someone you owe him the appropriate percentage of the costs the two of you will need to agree on whether you owe him for that percentage of his time as well make sure you agree on some mechanism for one person offering to buy the other out or to sell their half to the other party or potentially to someone else entirely personally i would try to do that at opportunity to avoid some of the ways this can go wrong see past comments about the hazards of guaranteeing a loan this works or does n't work similarly does that address your question

in the us the title company usually collects all money being paid by parties to the sale including the buyer seller and mortgage companies and then pays out money where its due to the respective parties the seller and possibly mortgage companies housing inspectors etc   if you have equity meaning that you sold your house for a price greater than what you owed on your mortgage you 'll typically get them money from the title company but they are really passing through money that they got from the buyer less whatever fees are going to the title company itself and other third parties involved one misconception however is that if you paid off part of your mortgage over time that you automatically have equity   that 's really only true if you find a buyer willing to pay a price greater than what 's left on your mortgage   when housing prices decline it 's possible that you as the seller may need to bring a check to closing and do not get any money back they buyer is presumably bringing a bigger check but you would need to make up the difference between what the buyer pays and what you still owe on your mortgage

the key thing to consider in a question like this is what return am i getting on my investment versus what interest am i paying on the loan if the investment returns more than what you 're paying on the loan than it makes sense to keep the investment and pay off the loan with other income if the investment returns less than it makes sense to cash it out to pay off the loan one complicating factor is taxes in the case of an ira you 're not paying taxes on the profits you do pay a tax penalty for an early withdrawal those are both factors that tend to make keeping the money in the ira more desirable and of course if the choice is between keeping your investment and defaulting on the loan you probably want to close out the investment i do n't know what return you 're getting on your ira but it 's probably more than 6.8 i 'd have to check but i think my retirement funds got over 20 last year if you 're not getting 6.8 you might want to investigate switching to another investment fund i 'm sure there 's a lot i do n't know about your situation but i 'd think that keeping the ira would be a better plan if you ca n't add to it for some time well you get these debts paid off well that 's how it is

according to this article with an all stock merger the number of shares covered by a call option is changed to adjust for the value of the buyout the options on the bought out company will change to options on the buyer stock at the same strike price but for a different number of shares normally one option is for 100 shares of the underlying stock for example company a buys company b exchanging 1/2 share of a for each share of b. options purchased on company b stock would change to options on company a with 50 shares of stock delivered if the option is exercised   this outcome strongly suggests that in general holders of options should cash out once the takeover is announced before the transactions takes place   since the acquiring company will typically offer a significant premium this will offer an opportunity for instant profits for call option holders while at the same time being a big negative for put option holders   however it is possible in some cases where the nominal price of the two companies favours the company ie the share prices of is lower than that of big the holder of a call option may wish to hold onto their options and possibly conversely for put option holders

even for those of us who are n't at risk of over drafting direct debit is a less than stellar option direct debit is a great way to begin ignoring how large your bills are by explicitly paying them through my bank 's online billpay i notice immediately when a bill is larger than it ought to be this is often caused by a billing error in which case i 've found it far easier to resolve disputes when the money is still in my hands it 's significantly harder to convince an internet provider cell phone service or utility to reverse an incorrect charge after it 's been paid than it is before the other times it 's because i 've been using the service more than normal for example sending text messages more frequently or using more electricity explicitly paying these bills makes me realize upfront that there 's been a change in my behavior and i can either reduce my expenses or accept the higher cost for higher service my own experience leads me to believe that paying your bills automatically every month is a great way to ignore these events and leak money like a online bill pay makes doing this as trivial as i could hope for and the risk of missing a payment is essentially nil

why would n't you expect a long term profit   say you buy 100 shares of company x selling today   you hold it for 20 years after which it 's worth $ 10/share in inflation adjusted dollars   so you 've made a profit only making two trades buy sell   what the algorithmic traders have done with short term trades during those 20 years is irrelevant to you now expand the idea   you want some diversification so instead of one stock you buy a bit of all the stocks on whatever index interests you and you just hold them for the same 20 years   how has what the short term traders done in the intervening time affected you

if they really want cash you notify your bank in advance of the amount and have it put in your account then you both sign the paperwork at the bank and after everything is signed you have the bank hand them the money it after that is entirely their problem personally i would consider this a stupid request and tell them to have their lawyer discuss it with my lawyer in the hope they can be talked out of it   as far as where to get the money same as for any purchase find a bank willing to write a mortgage for you on this new house what you choose to do about the other two houses is an independent question you can sell one or both but that may take money so you probably wo n't finish doing so before needing to pay for the new house of course when they do sell you can use the money toward paying down paying off the new mortgage

for an investment to appreciate in value one of two things needs to happen 1 demand for that particular item needs to increase 2 the supply of that item needs to decrease houses are good because everyone needs a place to live but there is a finite amount of land   no matter how much you invest in real estate ai n't   the trick there is to find an area that people are going to want to live in when you 're ready to sell   specific of wines and spirits are another good example because it 's literally impossible to create more of that vintage cars and most consumer goods usually do n't appreciate because they do n't last long enough   most cars are resold within three to five years after the initial purchase   this is also why jewelry is a good investment properly cared for it can last centuries without wearing out so look for something durable that has a limited supply

the point is that the bid and ask prices dictate what you can buy and sell at at market at least and the difference between the two or spread contributes implicitly to your gains or losses for example say your $ 1 stock actually had a bid of $ 0.90 and an ask of $ 1.10 i.e. say that $ 1 was the last price you would have to buy the stock at the ask price of $ 1.10 but now you can only sell that stock at the bid price of $ 0.90 thus you would need to make at least that $ 0.20 spread before you can make a profit

if it 's just an ordinary credit card i 'd think he could merely dispute the charges since he 's saying they created which i presume means applied for and received a card it should not affect his accounts directly   and especially since application details may be bogus he should be able to prove it was not him even if they got his credit card number he should be able to dispute those charges that are not his especially if they went to a different address or were charged someplace like another city where he was not present at that time otoh if they created a debit card that was linked to his bank account somehow well then that could be a lot more difficult to recover from but even then if it 's not his signature that was used to apply for the card or on any charges that had to be signed for etc he should be able to dispute it and get the bank to put the money back in his account since it will be a case of forgery etc the big problem with id theft is people tend to ruin your credit rating and you end up having to fend off bill collectors etc the primary thing it costs you speaking from experience of having checks stolen and forged using a fake drivers license is the time and hassle of getting everything straightened out and put right   in my case it took a few hours at the credit union and all the money was back in a new account the old one having been closed when i left   dealing with all the poor merchants that were taken and with bill collectors on the other hand took months   but i never once in the process needed quick money from anyone so the need for quick money seems a bit doubtful   i 'd want a lot more details of exactly why he needs money from you refer your friend to this federal trade commission site and make sure he takes the steps listed and especially pays attention to the parts about keeping notes of every single person he talks with including name date time and pertinent details of the conversation   if he has some idea how this happened as in a robbery then report it to the proper authorities and insist on getting a case number talking with bill collectors is the worst just trying to get ahold of them when they send you letters and talk to a person not a recorded number with instructions on how to pay them is sometimes nearly impossible google was my friend   and a lot of times they did n't want to back off till i gave them the case number with the police that somehow magically made it real to them and not just my telling them a story

there is no guarantee improvements will raise the appraised value   you also do n't want your property tax appraisal to go up if you can avoid it since you are talking on the order of $ 10k i 'll assume you 're only a few thousand dollars more from getting to 20 that said any schemes you might come up with like refinancing or second line of credit will probably cost more in fees than they are worth unless you can get a much nicer interest rate figure out how long you plan to stay there evaluate your options do nothing principal reduction refinance for 30 15 or even an arm and figure out your bottom line by comparing everything in a spreadsheet one more thing if you do pay a substantial amount of extra principal you can ask the lender to rebalance which will correct the minimum monthly payment to your remaining term this will likely incur a fee but could be helpful in an emergency

my primary concerns there seems to still be a fair bit of distressed property etc on the market at current which might well keep prices down for the next year or so that it takes to finish that stuff out of the market   the gist i get from most experts pundits is that there will be good deals around for while to come still i 'd advise you wait   go ahead and do the math to figure out what total you would be paying would be and charge yourself that much a for rent in your current place pocketing the difference in a savings account   you 'll be able to get a feeling for what it 's like to live with that kind of house payment and if you can do it sans any room mate something you ca n't always count on   if you can manage it then you have a much more realistic idea of what you can afford and you 'll have saved up a bunch of money to help with a down payment in the process   if for example your mortgage plus taxes and insurance ends up running around say $ a month plus another $ 150 for the hoa well then that 's charging yourself $ 1600 a month for your rent which means $ 1000 per month going into the bank in two years that 's nearly the same as what you have now in the $ 401 k and you 'd have a really good idea if you can afford that much per month in housing costs if you are bound and determined to do this now then here 's a few other things to consider you might to shop around a bit to see how typical those hoa fees are    yeah you do n't have the expense and hassle of needing to mow the lawn paint the place etc   but still   150 a month translates to around another 1.5 mortgage payments a year you might be able to get around pmi by splitting the mortgage into two pieces and doing a purchase money second of around 15 20 and 75 70 of the value for the main mortgage   that way the on your primary loan is under 80 which could be worthwhile even if the interest rate on that second loan is a little higher at least it 's deductible paying pmi is just money lost to you although trying to do any kind of creative financing these days is a lot trickier

first of all i recommend reading this short e book that is aimed at young investors the book is written for american investors but they same rules apply with different terms e.g. the equivalent tax free savings are called isas in the uk if you do n't anticipate needing the money any time soon then your best bet is likely a stocks and share isa in an aggressive portfolio of assets you are probably better off with an even more aggressive asset allocation than the one in the book e.g. 0 15 bond funds 85 100 equity funds in the long term this will generate the most income for an up to date table of brokers i recommend if you are planning to use the money as a deposit on a mortgage then your best bet might be a help to buy isa you 'll have to shop around for the best deals if you would rather have something more liquid that you can draw into to cover expenses while at school you can either go for a more conservative isa 100 bond funds or even a cash isa or try to find a savings account with a comparable interest rate

there is no relationship between the government appraisal and the mortgage appraisal   the loan appraisal is done by a lender to determine if the property value is in agreement with the loan amount the government appraisal is done to determine how much to charge you in taxes they use the values of residences and commercial property to get their operating budget each year they also set the rate to generate the amount of income money they need if they cut all appraisals in half they would just double the rate in some jurisdictions the government appraises every year in other places every three years some only when the property is sold in some jurisdictions the maximum increase or decrease in government appraisal is set by law but then they reset after the house is sold that being said use this time to review the appraisal from the government they may have facts wrong they may think you have a pool or more bedrooms or a garage when you do n't some jurisdictions use an automated process others do a more detailed individual process if there was a mistake ten years ago with the description it will never get caught unless you complain   check with the website for how to appeal some have windows of opportunity for an appeal

i found this article to clarify some of the issues one point raised is that the concession can be thought of as getting tax exemption for the closing costs which normally are not allow i 'm not sure i follow this logic since you can only deduct the interest not the principal i asked a lender and he verified you can only spend the concession money on closing costs i think if your closing costs are less than 1 of the loan its probably not worth it to go for a concession over the price reduction with interest rates so low its also not cost effective to buy down points on the loan this should limit most of your closing costs

i do n't know australian law but i will give my us perspective here   the custom in the us is for officers and directors to be by the corporation and that llcs have an even broader power to even to remove the duty of loyalty   moreover directors will typically be able to purchase insurance to protect them from loss in the event of liability for us corporations not llcs the duty of care prudence requires that directors behave responsibly in weighing major decisions and consult experts and specialists before coming to rash decisions   it usually becomes a court case in the context of a large public company in the midst of an acquisition event   the only people with standing in the us are shareholders   if all the other shareholders are directors then it may be hard for them to blame you additionally if you are concerned about the of your actions there may be sources to rely on   first discussion with your fellow directors can be a helpful guide though will not usually you from any accusation of wrongdoing and disclosure tends to cure almost any accusation of breaching the duty of loyalty   second boards often secure the advice of legal counsel and sometimes bring on lawyers as members or will outright hire counsel for the board   third there may be services that will provide you with generic advice e.g. uk companies house and us based which might set you at ease a little bit i do n't know the details of australian law as i say   but my sense of common law countries is that like the us they are primarily concerned about negligence or neglecting to understand the business and make informed decisions fraudulently engaging in self interested transactions that either hurt the company or should have been offered to the company and not bothering to seek out information   as long as you are active informed engaged and not engaging in secret deals outside the company especially deals where either side is competing with the company then that would be more than sufficient under the us standard if you are concerned about liability then inquire into by the company in the us the company can usually pay all legal costs of directors insurance and legal counsel   i imagine your business partners are no more savvy than you are   my impression is you are to relatively rare and exotic expression of corporate law at least in the us but i 'll close by repeating that i do n't know australian corporate law

that transaction probably cost the merchant $ 0.50 + 3 or close to $ 5   they should have refunded your credit card so they could have recouped some of the fees i imagine that 's why big box retailers like home depot always prefer to put it back on your card than give you store credit consider yourself lucky you made out with $ 0.15 this time   had they refunded your card the 1 of $ 150 credit would have gone against next month 's reward once upon a time folks were buying money from the us mint by the tens of thousands $ range and receiving credit card rewards then depositing the money to pay it off they figured that out and put a stop to it

interesting as i am in the exact same situations as yourself   i in fact just incorporated   you will be able save more in taxes in the end   the reason i put save in quotes is that you do n't necessarily save on taxes but you can defer taxes   the driving factor behind this is that you specify your own fiscal calendar year   incorporating allows you to defer income for up to 6 months   meaning that if you make your fiscal year starting in august or september for example you can claim that income on the following year august + 6 months = february   it allows you to keep the current year taxes down   also any income left over at year end is taxed at 15 the corporation rate rather than the 30 40 personal rate you get with a sole proprietorship   in a nutshell with sole proprietorship all income is taxable after write offs in a corporation you can take some of that income and keep it in the corporation gives your company a value and is only taxed at 15 big saving there i primarily work with us businesses   i am however a dual citizen us and canadian which allowed me as a sole proprietor to easily work with us companies   however as a sole proprietor or a corporation you simply need to get an ein from the irs and any us company will report earnings to that number with no deductions   at year end it is your responsibility to file the necessary tax forms and pay the necessary taxes to both countries   therefore you can solicit new us business if you choose but this is not restricted to corporations   the real benefit in incorporating is what i mentioned above my suggestion to you is to speak with you ca who can outline all benefits   revenue canada 's website had some good information on this topic as well please let me know if you need anything else explained

the biggest issue i can see is that in order to have your parents protected properly they 'll have to register an interest in the property ie the 25 i ca n't see the mortgage lender being too happy to have a second lienholder on the house for a total of 100 of the purchase price usually their conditions state that they 'll need to be informed of other debts secured on the house and might actually have a say in that another way of accomplishing this is putting your parents on the house 's deeds but that might also complicate matters with the lender and cause additional problems when it comes to selling the property not to mention that if anything bad happens to your parents their stake in your property would be counted as one of their assets and you might find yourself in the situation where you have to come up with 25 of the property value right now or you might find that you have to sell the property to the first bidder simply because you do need the money as quickly as possible personally i would n't do it especially without legal advice the legal structure can be a nightmare and you 'll just end up painted into a corner

i have been in a very similar place like that before as an intern and got the hell out quickly   let me try to paint a picture   on the 12th floor of a random nyc building there will be a large office floor with long desks in several rows   around the outside against the windows will be maybe some empty conference rooms random senior people you wo n't be allowed to talk to and a poor miserable compliance guy stuck in a somewhere   each desk will have a phone and a call sheet   there wo nt be many computers anywhere maybe one bloomberg machine in the back   every single person in there is on the phone   in fact that will be your job   starting at sharp you will be at your desk   at 8 you will start dialing the call sheet put on your desk   if it is a bunch of residences you will get angry house wives because their husbands are at work do nt pitch the bitch next call you will get someone that passed away 2 years ago mark your sheet dead and cross out as you are dialing the next number   if you manage to get someone that answers their own phone at work and listens to a pitch you will now get the opportunity to give a pitch on why a mid market dividend paying stock is fantastic and should be bought now   now as in you have to open a brokerage account on the first call for no less than a $ 5k trade   you will pitch them on why they do nt need to ask their wife why you will bring them great ideas   ask them what is their net worth have they ever hired a broker over the phone qualify them or get hung up on   anything short of them threatening to call the sec and you before hanging up means you will be sure to call them again a prospect actually picking up the phone is about a 1 in 20 dial event   people just slamming the phones on you call them back for fun because you got disconnected     if you ever manage to get a client you will be charging them enormous percentages and fees to do simple trades but do nt worry you probably wo nt get a client in the first 2 months and even if you manage to get clients it will be maybe one or two a month   think about the sheer volume of calls you have to make 300 400 calls a day is probably a normal pace    you will meet the most insane people   people will go down for lunch or coffee and never return to the office   most of the people there you wonder how they ever passed a series 7   there are people that fail the 7 3 times and quit   there will be a guy that opens 10 accounts a month and actually will be talking with two phones up to his ears at once           this is the definition of a high pressure sales job

hmmm i guess if my choice is representation with a vote or representation without a vote that vote might be worth some money on the other hand i 'd prefer option c operate independent of the union and negotiate directly with the employer and pay no dues   it seems like it should be up to each individual employee to decide whether to be represented by the union   out of curiosity once a union has been established is it possible for another union to come in collect signatures and force a vote to switch representation is it possible for a vote to dissolve the union to happen   why is hiring a worker who wishes to be employed without union representation considered union breaking the members of the union have a right to vest their bargaining power in the union but why should someone not already in the union be forced to join in order to accept employment

in most cases an rent with option to buy is structured as follows the renter buyer will place a deposit premium not the same as a security deposit that purchases the option the right to buy the home at a future date at a specific price the renter buyer will often pay extra rent in addition to market rent   many times this additional rent is contracted to be applied to the purchase price of the home the risks to the renter buyer are as follows also something to note many people will recommend that you use the additional rents to be applied specifically towards the downpayment   be wary of this   there are no institutional lenders available today that will allow the additional rent money to be applied towards your downpayment   that means you must come up with the downpayment in cash before closing   the additional rent payments can   be used towards the price    hope that helps   good luck

you need a lawyer and a tax accountant for a sale like this they will be able to tell you if the proceeds are taxed as income most likely or capital gains and will help you structure the deal how you spend the proceeds will not make a difference although if it 's a large amount and you plan to donate some to charity you may be able to save on your total tax liability by creating a donor advised fund keep in mind the broker is mostly interested in his commission and not about making the best deal for you get an attorney with experience in business sales

the big difference for me under the high deductible plan has been that instead of paying the co pay now i am now responsible for the negotiated rate until i reach the deductible limit the hsa is only a way to funnel medical payments through a tax free account the insurance company and the doctor do n't care about the hsa if we go out of network then i am responsible for the full rate but they only count the negotiated rate as a credit against the out of pocket deductible this big difference makes it very important to pick a doctor in network for your example i would have paid $ 50 under the ppo but $ 200 under the high plan if i go out of network i would have to pay whatever the doctor want me to pay but the insurance company would only credit me $ 200 against my deductible i can pull the extra $ 350 from the hsa it is hard to get good pricing information from some doctors but the price difference for me has been so large that in network is the only way to go for prescriptions the high deductible plan has been worse because we pay the full price with no discounts for the medicine until we reach the plan deductible that makes the cost of the prescriptions as much as 10x 's more expensive in fact the annual cost of our prescriptions all but guarantees that we hit the deductible each year

@joetaxpayer gave a great response to your first question here are some thoughts on the other two 2 transaction fees for mutual funds are tied to the class of shares you 're buying and will be the same no matter where you buy them a shares have a front end load the fee charged and the lowest expenses and can be liquidated without any fees b shares have no up front load but come with a 4 7 year period where they will charge you a fee to liquidate technically called contingent deferred sales charge and slightly higher management fees after which they often will convert to a shares c shares have the highest management fees and usually a to 18-month period where they will charge a small percentage fee if you liquidate there are lots of other share classes available but they are tied to special accounts such as managed accounts and 401-k plans not all companies offer all share classes c shares are intended for shorter timeframes eg 2 5 years a and b shares work best for longer times use a b share if you 're sure you wo n't need to take the money out until after the fee period ends most fund companies will allow you to exchange funds within the same fund family without charging the edit no load funds do n't charge a fee in or out usually they are a great option if they are available to you most self service brokerages offer them few full service brokerages offer them the advantage of a brokerage versus personal accounts at each fund is the brokerage gives you a single view of things and a single statement and buying and selling is easy and convenient 3 high turnover rates in bond funds depending on how actively the portfolio is managed the fund company may deliver returns as a mix of both interest and capital gains and the management expenses may be high with a lot of churn in the underlying portfolio bond values fall as interest rates rise so at least in the usa be prepared to see the share values of the fund fall in the next few years the biggest risk of a bond fund is that there is no maturity date so there is no point in time that you have an assurance that your original investment will be returned to you

very generally speaking if you have a loan in which something is used as collateral the leader will likely require you to insure that collateral    in your case that would be a car   yes certainly a lender will require you to insure the vehicle that they finance toyota or otherwise   of course if you purchase a vehicle for cash which is advisable anyway then the insurance option is somewhat yours some states may require that a certain amount of coverage is carried on a registered vehicle   however you may be able to drop the collision rental car and other options from your policy saving you some money so you buy a new car for cash $ 25 k or so and store the thing   what happens if the car suffers damage during storage   are you willing to save a few dollars to have the loss of an asset   you will have to insure the thing in some way and i bet if you buy the proper policy the amount save will be very minimal sure you could drop the road side assistance rental car and some other options during your storage time but that probably will not amount to a lot of money

ultimately no one really knows what causes the markets to rise and fall beyond supply and demand if more people want to buy then sell prices go up and if more people want to sell prices go down the news channels will often try to attribute a specific reason to the price move but that is largely just guess work to fill up the news pages so people have something to read you may find it interesting to read up on the elliot wave principle the crash of 2008 was a perfect elliot wave fit elliot wave theory states that social which ultimately drive the stock market generally occur in a relatively predictable pattern the crash in september was a wave 3 down this is where the majority of people give up hope however there are still a few people who are still holding on the markets tend to about during wave 4 finally the last few people give up hope and sell out this causes the final crash of wave 5 only when the last person has given up hope can the markets start to go up again

in my experience financial advisors do not normally assist with budgeting and personal everyday finance there certainly are people who do that but you would normally only consult them when you have financial difficulties especially debt the more common find of financial advisor is mostly focussed on advising you about savings and investments a lot work for banks and investment companies they will usually advise you for free the downside being that they will only recommend their company 's products this may or may not be a bad thing depending on the company others will charge you a commission on purchases and their advice will be more neutral this question will also be interesting are all financial advisors compensated in the same way

my basic rule of thumb is that if the the bill come from a government office of taxation and that if you fail to pay the amount they can put a tax lien on the property it is a tax for you the complication is in assessments for local benefits     you can not deduct amounts you pay for local benefits that tend to increase the value of your property    local benefits include the construction of streets sidewalks or    water and sewer systems you must add these amounts to the basis of    your property   you can however deduct assessments or taxes for    local benefits if they are for maintenance repair or interest    charges related to those benefits an example is a charge to repair an    existing sidewalk and any interest included in that charge   if only a    part of the assessment is for maintenance repair or interest    charges you must be able to show the amount of that part to claim the    deduction if you can not show what part of the assessment is for    maintenance repair or interest charges you can not deduct any of it an assessment for a local benefit may be listed as an item in your    real estate tax bill if so use the rules in this section to find how    much of it if any you can deduct i have never seen a tax bill that said this amount is for new streets and the rest i for things the irs says you can deduct the issue is that if the center city tax bill is a separate line or a separate bill then does it count i would go back to the first line of the quote from pub you can not deduct amounts you pay for local benefits that tend to    increase the value of your property then i would look at the quote from the ccd web site the center city district ccd is a business improvement district our    mission is to keep philadelphia 's downtown called center city clean    safe beautiful and fun we provide security cleaning and promotional    services that supplement but do not replace basic services provided    by the city of philadelphia and the fundamental responsibilities of    property owners ccd also makes physical improvements to the downtown installing and maintaining lighting > signs banners trees and landscape elements   and later on the same page ccd directly bills and collects mandatory payments from properties in    the district ccd also receives voluntary contributions from the    owners of tax exempt properties that benefit from our services the issues is that it is a business improvement district bid and you are n't a business i did find this document from the city of philadelphia explain how to establish a bid if the nature of the bid is such that organizers wish to include    residential properties within the district and make these properties    subject to the assessment it may make sense to assess these    properties at a lower level than a commercial property both because    bid services and benefits are business focused and because    owner occupants often can not treat assessments as tax deductible    business expenses like commercial owners do care must be taken to    ensure that the difference in commercial and residential assessment    rates is equitable and complies with the requirements of the from the same document funds for bid programs and services are generated from a special    assessment paid by the benefited property owners directly to the    organization that manages the bid ’s activities note many leases    have a clause that allows property owners to pass the bid assessment    on to their tenants because they are authorized by the city of    philadelphia the assessment levied by the bid becomes a legal    obligation of the property owner and failure to pay can result in the    filing of a lien i have seen discussion that some bids can accept tax deductible donations this means if a person they can deduct the donation i would then feel comfortable deducting the tax because if you ca n't deduct it that would mean the only people who ca n't deduct it are home owners   so deduct it keep in mind i am not a tax professional

why does the yield go up if the country is economically unstable the yield will rise when instability increases because the risk of default increases   if the case of greece the instability of government finances resulted in a 50 haircut for bond holders in 2011   in other words bond holders suffered a 50 write down in the nominal value of their bonds   this means that holding these bonds until maturity will mean they will only receive half of the original nominal value of the bond and that is assuming no further write downs occur why does selling a bond drive up the yield significant selling of bonds means that sellers are worried about future prospects   sellers will outnumber buyers so sellers will have to reduce their offer price in order to attract new buyers so if you think greece is not going to default as it 's highly likely a country would completely default would n't it make sense to hold onto the bonds if you think that it is highly unlikely that greece will default and the prices and yields are attractive then greek bonds may look like an attractive investment however keep in mind the fate of bond holders in 2011   they were attracted to greek bonds by the price and yield but they suffered a 50 haircut

although this is off topic since it is about economics i 'm going to write a short answer in case it is decided that it is on topic i will remove this if it gets migrated the key to why printing extra money causes inflation and a change in exchange rate has nothing at all to do with whether or not it is announced or done in secret the quantity of money in circulation by whichever measure is what informs the value of the currency not whether you tell people that it has changed or not announcing it should increase the volatility somewhat around the time of the announcement but the long term effects will be the same no matter what whether or not they announce it printing more money will mean that there is more in circulation which will reduce the value of each unit of the currency by the dilution amount which in turn will increase inflation and decrease the exchange rate

no it can really not look at detroit which has lost a million residents over the past few decades there is plenty of real estate which will not go for anything like it was sold other markets are very risky like florida where speculators drive too much of the price for it to be stable you have to be sure to buy on the downturn a lot of price drops in real estate are masked because sellers just do n't sell so you do n't really know how low the price is if you absolutely had to sell in general in most of america anyway you can expect real estate to keep up with inflation but not do much better than that it is the rental income or the leverage if you buy with a mortgage that makes most of the returns in urban markets that are getting an influx of people and industry however real estate can indeed outpace inflation but the number of markets that do this are rare also if you look at it strictly as an investment as opposed to the question of is it worth it to own my own home there are a lot of additional costs that you have to recoup from property taxes to bills rental headaches etc it 's an investment like any other and should be approached with the same due diligence

the purpose of long term care insurance is to pay for your long term care while protecting your assets this is highly recommended to people who have high risk factors or family history people who will most likely receive care should purchase this as early as possible in order to avoid the soaring cost of coverage and care another reason why people should buy this is is because of the much longer life expectancy today statistics would show that about 70 of people who are 65 years old will need long term care this is obviously high and alarming for me this is enough to encourage people to prepare for their future and buy insurance for long term care

the following advice assumes that you have a significant amount already in the account in cash equivalents if you are only talking a few hundred bucks or so then just jump in at the next dip like today 's if you have a larger amount to move into equities the safest approach is to gradually move it into investments over some period of time at regular intervals regardless of what is going on in the market this mitigates the risk of investing it all into an fund that is peaking at the exact moment you buy   so for example you might invest 20 of the total amount each month for 5 months to gradually get into the market the larger the amount you are investing the more you probably want to spread it out but do n't spread it out much further than a year or you are losing opportunity cost by leaving your money in cash type investments with likely a very poor rate of return this strategy is called dollar cost averaging if you want to research it more

you 're right but netting $ 150,000 a year is n't really even that tough for a savvy individual with the skill set of talented developer   creating an app is far from the only option to make that money anyways in fact you 're probably correct in your condescending tone mentioning it     why would an intelligent skilled worker themselves to a desk in seattle when they could easily do just as well financially and live where and work when they please   there are definitely some people who would value the steady and certain paycheck   but becoming a talented developer requires a level of ambition and self motivation in and of itself that caters to entrepreneurship well    the issue is that msft does n't want to pay what good programmers are actually worth according to the market   so they run pr campaigns and lobby the government to bring in workers that will happily work for under true market rate   granted these visa workers pay taxes and get great jobs   that does n't really hide the fact that these workers help lower the wages that they should be paying according to basic supply and demand

i 'm a democrat so get off your horse if there are no jobs in your city yes you should move   i did and as did all 3 of my siblings pretty much every single person i went to college with moved from their hometown as well to pursue a better paycheck moving for work has always been an integral part of the american psyche it 's literally how your state was founded and what separated us from europeans in the 19th and early 20th centuries    what do you want to have happen   you want the federal government to force companies to move to your home state   you want to pay a bunch of corporate welfare to entice a company to move for you   if anything you should be pissed that your state government has created such a toxic environment that no one wants to open a business there besides those looking to exploit your natural resources your economy sucks because of your local politics almost everywhere else is doing well as far as employment goes there should be wage increases happening right now that are n't but if we do n't go into recession they will go up soon they are going to have to but only in those places with diverse economies built on future tech energy models    do n't get mad at me get mad at yourself and those around you you all have voted for republicans who have you over for decades yet it 's always someone else 's fault i understand you 're a democrat personally so you of all people should understand this

price is current price per share but you can buy fractional shares minimal investment is how later the first purchase of shares must be to make it worth their efforts to set up the account for you how you manage it is up to you you can buy or sell shares at any time pretty much though it may take a few days for the transaction to settle and take effect you can do this via checks or you can give the broker or the investment house if you are dealing directly with them as i do permission to take money from or put money to your bank account when you tell them you want to buy or sell shares you may be able to set up direct deposit talk to your employer about that or you may be able to have your bank make a periodic transfer purchase for you

i do n't know what rates are available to you now but yes if you can refinance your car at a better rate with no hidden fees you might save some money in interest however there are a couple of your original loan was a 6 year loan and you have 5 years remaining   if you refinance your car with a new 6 year loan you will be paying on your car for 7 years total and you will end up paying more interest even though your interest rate might have gone down   make sure that your new loan in addition to having a lower rate than the old loan does not have a longer term than what you have remaining on the original loan make sure there are n't any hidden fees or closing costs with the new loan   if there are you might be paying your interest savings back to the bank in fees if your goal is to save money in interest consider paying off your loan early   scrape together extra money every month and send it in making sure that it is applied to the principal of your loan   this will shorten your loan and save you money on interest and can be much more significant than refinancing   after your loan is paid off continue saving the amount you were spending on your car payment so you can pay cash for your next car and save even more

generally yes   rather than ask why are these guys so cheap you should be asking why the big names are so expensive marketing spend plays a big role there getting babies to shill for your company during the super bowl requires a heck of a lot of commissions due to the difficulties involved in setting up a brokerage it 's unlikely that you 'll see a scam a brokerage might go bankrupt for random reasons but that 's what investor insurance is for is mostly the likelihood that you 'll be able to get access to your funds on deposit with the broker investment funds are insured by sipc for up to $ 500,000 with a lower limit on cash the specific limits vary by broker with some offering greater protection paid for on their own dime check with the broker it 's usually on their web pages under security funds in cash might be swept into an interest earning investment vehicle for which insurance is different and that depends on the broker too a few forex brokers went bankrupt last year although that 's a new market with fewer regulatory protections for traders i heard that one bankruptcy in the space resulted in a 7 loss for traders with accounts there and that there was a ponzi ish scam company as well luckily the more stringent regulation of stock brokerages makes that space much safer for investors if you want to assess the reliability of an online broker i suggest the following it 's tempting to look at when the brokerage was founded fly by night scams by definition wo n't be around very long and usually that means under a few months any company with a significant online interface will have to have been around long enough to develop that client interface their backend databases and the interface with the markets and their clearing house the two brokerages you mentioned have been around for 7 + years so that lends strength to the supposition of a strong business model that said there could well be a new company that offers services or prices that fit your investment need and in that case definitely look into their registrations and third party reviews finally note that the smaller independent brokerages will probably have margin rules if you 're playing a complex novel and/or high risk strategy that ca n't handle the volatility of a market crash even a short excursion such as the 2010 flash crash stiff margin rules might have consequences that a novice investor would rather pretend did n't exist

short answer do n't do it unless you know something that the bank does n't it 's safe to assume that banks are a lot better at assessing risk than you are if they think he ca n't afford it odds are he ca n't afford it regardless of what he might say to the contrary in this case the best answer may be sorry for your luck you could recommend that he comes up with a larger down payment to reduce his monthly payment or that he find a way to get some extra income rather than getting you to cosign please also see this article by dave ramsey on why you should never cosign loans

as others have addressed the legality in their answers i want to address the idea of the dealership being a middleman a dealership serves more of a purpose than just a car to a consumer actually they consume a great deal of risk let 's remember that a dealership is really an extension of the oem albeit independently owned and operated the dealership must still answer to the brand they represent if people have a bad experience with a dealership a customer might go to another of the same brand but more often than not they will go to the competition out of spite therefore it 's in the dealership 's best interest to represent the brand as best as possible but unfortunately that does n't always happen   while the internet has made a certain part of a salesman 's role null and void and since this is a finance read money q a site let 's take a moment to consider the risk assume and therefore the value added by a dealership test drive a car is a huge purchase and while it 's okay to buy a pair of shoes online without trying them on a car is a bit different of course we want to make sure it fits before we shell out several thousand dollars yes you meaning consumers can look at car pictures and specs online but if you want to see how that vehicle handles on your town 's roads if it fits in your garage and/or driveway then you need to take it for a test drive it 's not feasible for to have millions of people showing up to car plants for a test drive right scalability aside some business that is handled in automotive plants are confidential and not for the general public to know about a dealership provides an opportunity for those who live locally to see and experience the car without flying or driving wherever the car was assembled they provide this at a risk banking on the fact that a good experience with the vehicle will lead to a sale service a car is a machine and no machine is perfect neither will it last forever without proper service a dealership provides a place for people to bring their vehicles when they need to be serviced let 's set aside the fact that the service prices are higher than we 'd like because the fact remains most of it is skilled and labor that the majority of people do n't want to do themselves trade ins it is not in an best interest to accept a vehicle just to sell you another vehicle especially if that vehicle is from another brand dealership 's assume this risk and often offer incentives to do so hoping it will lead to a sale that trade in was an asset to you but is a liability to them because they now have to liquidate that trade in just so that you can purchase a car sure you could sell your car yourself and now you would assume that risk what if your car is not in perfect shape or has a lot of miles for it 's age would it do well in the used car market what if it takes too long to sell and you miss that memorial day car sale at the dealer this might be okay for some but generally speaking most people would rather avoid the risk and trade it in at the dealer toward the purchase of a new car rather than the headache of selling it themselves i 'm sure there are more but those are the one 's that immediately sprung to mind just like starbucks there are terrible dealerships out there and there are great ones and very few of us venture to farms and just for fresh coffee beans

you ca n't get your credit score for free just the report with the information the score is based on    if you got credit reports through annualcreditreport.com the score tab would typically contain an advertisement for purchasing your score   if you have an ad blocker enabled that might be blocked explaining the blank page   try turning off any browser extensions that alter how pages are shown    the accounts page tab section should show something like 0 open accounts or similar to indicate that it is loading data    your lack of credit history probably does mean you do n't have a credit score so it 's probably not worth paying anything to find that out   the focus should be on the accuracy of the underlying report since you can do something about that    should i be worried i 'd say no on that    you 'll have an easier time getting credit and better terms in the future if you start now with some account even if it 's a secured credit card you do n't use much because the age of the oldest and average accounts are factors in credit scoring models

some stocks do fall to zero i do n't have statistics handy but i 'd guess that a majority of all the companies ever started are now bankrupt and worth zero even if a company does not go bankrupt there is no guarantee that it 's value will increase forever even in a general overall sense you might buy a stock when it is at or near its peak and then it loses value and never it even if a stock will go back up you ca n't know for certain that it will suppose you bought a stock for $ 10 and it 's now at $ 5 if you sell you lose half your money but if you hold on it might go back up and you make a profit or it might continue going down and you lose even more perhaps your entire investment a rational person might decide to sell now and cut his losses of course i 'm sure many investors have had the experience of selling a stock at a loss and then seeing the price skyrocket but there have also been plenty of investors who decided to hold on only to lose more money just a couple of weeks ago a stock i bought for $ 1.50 was selling for $ 14 i could have sold for like 900 profit instead i decided to hold on and see if it went yet higher it 's now at $ 2.50 fortunately i only invested something like $ 800 if it goes to zero it will be annoying but not ruin me on a bigger scale if you invest in a variety of stocks and hold on to them for a long period of time the chance that you will lose money is small the stock market as a whole has consistently gone up in the long term but the chance is not zero and a key phrase is in the long term if you need the money today the fact that the market will probably go back up within a few months or a year or so may not help

traditional banks do n't put their money onto the stock markets in fact the economic crisis was in part caused by the fact that banks were placing money into higher risk portfolios and doing just that in the uk there has been a debate for the last few years specifically around retail and investment bank operations entirely   what i was discussing was in the retail consumer sector where the money comes in as mortgages amp secured loans and slightly riskier unsecured credit credit cards etc in that model you do not need to be a genius if i lend you $ 20k to buy a car and you do n't repay me my money plus 8 i get the car and therefore am unlikely to be seriously out of pocket the only thing i have to do is make sure i lend to people likely to repay more often than i do to those who will not and that well that 's something we 've got a few hundred years of experience with   if i walk onto the nyse and start throwing around my cash at put option on exotic fx markets that are in turn responding to conditions almost impossible to truly understand well i 'm sure we 'd agree that it 's hard to beat the market that 's why the investment banks who specialise in that market do n't invest their own money they make money from investing other people 's cash clever guys   so we need to understand here there are two very different kinds of banks with two very different business models and it was the mixing of them that led to the disaster we 've seen them makes sense to me   communists who think banks are making money out of thin air do n't seem to understand that and so it 's not surprising that they seem confused about what a bank is actually there for those who do get these two models must see that a retail bank is there to provide finance based on savings held and investment banks are there to help people invest in riskier markets that does not mean they are magic or evil   now they might argue that fractional reserve banking is a problem i would imagine many of them would prefer the credit union model instead but that 's a different debate that 's the mechanics and detail not the institutional need for existence

you should definately have a stop loss in place to manage your risk for a time frame of 5 to 10 years i would be looking at a trailing stop loss of 20 to 25 off the recent high   another type of stop you could use is a volatility stop here the more volatile the stock the larger the stop whilst the less volatile the stock the smaller the stop you could use 3 or 4 x weekly average true range to achieve this the reason you should always use a stop loss is because of what can happen and what did happen in 2008 some stock markets have yet to fully recover from their peaks at the end of 2007 almost 9 years later what would you do if you were planning to hold your positions for 5 years and then withdrawal your funds at the end of june 2021 for a particular purpose and suddenly in february 2021 the market starts to fall by the time june comes the market has fallen by over 50 and you do n't have enough funds available for the purpose you planned for instead if you were using a trailing stop loss you would manage to keep at least 75 of the peak of your portfolio you could even spend 10 minutes each week to monitor your portfolio for warning signs that a downtrend may be around the corner and adjust your trailing stop to maybe 10 in these situations protecting 90 of the peak of your portfolio if the downtrend does not you can adjust your trailing back to a higher percentage if you do get stopped out and shortly after the market recovers then you can always buy back in or look for other stocks and etfs to replace them sure you might lose a bit of profits if this happens but it should always be part of your investment plan and risk management how you will handle these situation if you are not using stop losses risk management and money management you are essentially gambling if you say i am going to buy these stocks and etfs hold them for 10 years and then sell them then you are just hoping to make gains which is essentially gambling

there are two answers to this excluding central banks which are really just a banks to private banks   please note   this is an oversimplification and not accounting for the fact that banks operate in both categories now     banks are either depository institutions or financial service transaction providers     depository institutions are your typical retail bank regions boa retail wells fargo retail etc   they accept deposits from account holders and lend out via reserve lending to mortgages and business loans for their revenue generation     financial service transaction providers are better known as   you have your goldman sachs deutsche bank jp morgan morgan stanley etc   these have traditionally been banks that do not accept deposit accounts but revenue generation comes from financial services such as asset management and research or from financial transaction such as market making offering both buy sell quotes in capital markets   this is generally the role that banks have played historically from the medieval ages on they started out as being entities that provided access to connecting buyers and sellers of markets

should you care from vanguard the long term impact of investment costs on portfolio balances    assuming a starting balance of $ 100,000 and a yearly return of 6 which is reinvested check out this chart reflecting the impact of relatively small expense ratios on your 30 year return   all else being equal you should very much care about expense ratios you end up with a significantly smaller amount if your pre expense return is the same a 0.75 difference in er compounds to 20 over 30 years if so how should i take them into consideration when comparing funds i 'm in the u.s. if that matters if they track the same index cheaper is better the cases where higher expense ratios might be better are if you believe that index will outperform the market by enough to recoup the cost of the er   there is significant research that most funds do not do this

in general scholarship income that you receive that is not used for tuition or books must be included in your gross income and reported as such on your tax return   scholarship income you receive that is used for those kinds of expenses may be from your gross income   see this irs information and this related question i believe that as represented on the 1098-t this generally means that if box 5 scholarships and grants is greater than box 1 or 2 only one of which will be used on your 1098-t you received taxable scholarship income   if box 5 is less than or equal to box 1/2 you did not receive taxable scholarship income   this page draws the same conclusion however you should realize that the 1098-t is not what makes you have to pay or not pay taxes   you incur the taxes by receiving scholarship money and you may reduce your tax liability by paying tuition   the 1098-t is simply a record of payments that have already been made for instance if you received $ 10,000 in scholarship money that is actually received checks for that amount or had that amount deposited into your bank account then your income went up by $ 10,000   if you yourself paid tuition it is likely that you can exclude the amount of the tuition from your taxable income reducing the tax you owe see the irs page linked above   however if you received $ 10,000 in actual money and in addition your tuition was paid by the scholarship with money you never actually had in your own bank account then the entire $ 10,000 would be taxable   you do not give enough information in your question to be sure which of these situations is closer to your own   however you should be able to decide by looking at your bank account look at how much money you received and how much you spent on tuition   if you received more scholarship money than the tuition you paid out of pocket you owe taxes on the remainder   i emphasize that this is just a general rule of thumb and should not be taken as tax advice you should review the irs information and/or consult a tax professional to determine what part of your scholarship income is taxable in addition as this now rather old article from the new york society of cpas notes many colleges and universities prepare incorrectly and report tuition and related expenses   this means you should be careful to reconcile the 1098-t with your own financial records of what money you actually received and paid   when i was in grad school there was a good deal of hand wringing and hair pulling each year among the students as we tried to determine what relationship if any the 1098-t bore to the financial facts

if you know that your tax situation is not easily handled by the standard withholding table then you can use that line to ask for additional funds be withheld you could also ask for less money to be withheld    why would somebody do this they had a small side business that made them extra income and wanted to withhold extra money from their full time job to cover the extra income they might have been awarded a big bonus and it caused too much in taxes to be withheld so they wanted to not have as much taxes from their regular pay check given the fact that you are young in your first real job and almost the entire tax year ahead of you it is likely that the standard tax tables will be close enough so leave the line blank or put zero

i would suggest having your money auto deposited into a savings account then use cash weekly to pay for everything you purchase forget the atm card because you can burn through your whole paycheck and then run out set a certain budget say $ 200 per week just making up a number and that 's all you get withdraw $ 200 from the bank atm and then walk away no buying online because it is n't restricted no buying on a card all expenses beyond utilities comes out of that cash when you want to spend more you need to wait until your next cash paycheck if you want to spend more on whatever you end up splurging on you will need to cut back in other areas cheaper food etc as others have mentioned freeze that atm card and do n't use it at all

there is no limit on how much money you can bring into the usa in cash or through electronic transfer you only need to be able to proof or convincingly show that you earned it legally and paid all potential us taxes that you had to pay if you chose to bring it in cash you need to tell customs when arriving and again be prepared to proof the legal sources wire transfer cash in the suitcase whatever you like there is no tax for bringing the money and the tax for making that money supposedly is already paid once the money is in the us and earns more money you will owe taxes on the gain not on the capital itself just on the amounts it increases by i hope you understand that if you live in the us and you have money anywhere in the world you might need to report it to the irs and if your money makes interest anywhere in the world including of course in india you might be are required to pay us taxes on the gains that is independent of your question but if you do n't do it you are cheating the irs and they will ask this when you bring the money back

all investors of equal standing get the same proportion of the net assets on bankruptcy but not all shareholders are of equal standing in general once all liabilities are covered bond holders are paid first as that type of investment is company debt then preferred stock holders are paid out and then common shareholders this is the reason why preferred stock is usually cheaper it is less risky as it has a higher claim to assets and therefore commands a lower risk premium the exact payout schedule is very corporation dependent so needs research on a per firm basis

for practical purposes i would strongly suggest that you do create a separate account for each business you may have that is used only for business purposes and use it for all of your business income and expenses this will allow you to get an accurate picture of whether you are making money or not what your full expenses really are how much of your personal money you have put into the business and is an easy way to keep business taxes separate you will also be able to get a fairly quick read on what your profits are without doing much accounting by looking at the account balance less future taxes and expenses and less any personal money you 've put into the account check out this thread from paypal about setting up a child account that is linked to your personal account and can be set up to payments into your main account should you like you will still be able to see transactions for each child account note do be careful to make sure you are reserving the proper amount out of any profits your startup may have for taxes you do n't want to mix this with personal money and then later find out that you owe taxes and have to to come up with the money if you have already spent it this is one of the main reasons to segregate your startup 's revenues and profits in the business account for those using brick and mortar banking services rather than a service like paypal you likely do not need a business checking account if you are a startup most likely you can simply open a second personal account with your bank in your name and name it john doe dba company name dba = doing business as this way you can pay expenses and accept payments in the name of your startup check with your banker for additional details localized information

i think the issue here is you 're starting with a criteria that does n't actually exist in reality   a very small amount of research will uncover a plethora of options for savings accounts that pay far more interest than your basic checking account and do n't require you to spend on the balance to earn the interest    the point of saving is to have a pot of money that you can dip in to when you need it or when you 're ready to spend it for it 's intended purpose   that pot of money is not supposed to experience a lot of transactions   it should n't be commingled with funds that come and go on a daily basis   it does n't make sense to have checks or a debit card attached to your savings account because you should n't need access to that money that way not to mention that those two things open the door to fraud on the money that 's supposed to be there for you when you need it could you put your savings funds in to a checking account sure   if we lived in a world where savings accounts that do n't force you to jump through hoops to avoid fees did n't pay 10x more interest than interest bearing checking accounts that have similar ease of administration more people may choose to house savings funds in checking accounts but that 's not the world we live in    thanks to the back and forth in the comments below i 'm now more certain of my position that if you want a high yielding checking account you 'll have pay fees or initiate a certain number of debit card transactions or both   no one wants fees and you should n't be spending on your savings in order to earn interest on the balance it is very easy to juice your savings account to the best rates available

separation of powers under the united states constitution   separation of powers is a political doctrine originating in the writings of charles de baron de in the spirit of the laws in which he argued for a constitutional government with three separate branches each of which would have defined abilities to check the powers of the others this philosophy heavily influenced the writing of the united states constitution according to which the legislative executive and judicial branches of the united states government are kept distinct in order to prevent abuse of power this united states form of separation of powers is associated with a system of checks and balances   during the age of enlightenment philosophers such as advocated the principle in their writings whereas others such as thomas strongly opposed it     ^ ^pm](https://www.reddit.com message compose?to = kittens_from_space ^| ^exclude ^me](https://reddit.com message compose?to = wikitextbot&amp;message = excludeme&amp;subject = excludeme ^| ^exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com r economy about banned ^| ^faq ^/ ^information](https://np.reddit.com r wikitextbot wiki index ^| ^source](https://github.com kittenswolf wikitextbot    ^ ^downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.24

as i understand it the usual rule is that the country you are resident in taxes you on your worldwide income but gives you credit for foreign tax paid the country you are not normally resident in taxes you only on income from that one country note that residence for tax purposes can have different rules from residence for immigration purposes at least in the uk being resident in the country for more than half the tax year normally makes you tax resident and there are some other cases too i expect other countries are similar but the details of the rules and the start end of the tax years may vary i do n't know the exact rules for finland and belgium but i expect your belgian taxes will be based on your belgian income only and your finnish taxes will be based on your worldwide income but with a credit for your belgian taxes engaging accountants from both countries to confirm the exact rules and what exactly you should put on the forms is almost certainly a good idea

there 's not a single answer here as the premium you pay for car insurance depends on multiple factors including but not limited to all these factors contribute to the likelihood of getting into an accident and the expected damage from an accident   so just having an accident and making a claim will likely raise your premium all else being equal but whether or not it will be cheaper in the long run depends obviously on how much your premium goes up which can not determined without all of the facts   your agent could tell you how much it would go up but even making such an inquiry would likely be noted on your insurance record and may cause your premium to go up although probably not by as much however the point of insurance is to reduce the out of pocket expenses from future accidents so the question to ask is how likely am i to have another accident and if i do can i pay cash for it or will i need to offset some cost with an insurance claim   do you risk making a claim and having your rates go up by more than $ 700 over the next 3 4 years the rough time it takes for a surcharge to expire   or do you just pay for the repair out of pocket and keep your premiums lower

let 's assume that the bonds have a par value of $ 1,000   if conversion happens then one bond would be converted into 500 shares   the price in the market is unimportant   regardless of the share price in the market the income per share would be increased by the absence of $ 70 in interest expense   it would be decreased by the lost tax deduction   it would be further diluted by the increase in 500 shares   likewise the debt would be extinguished and the equity section increased   whether it increased or decreased on a per share basis would depend upon the average amount paid in per share in the currently existing structure adjusted for changes in retained earnings since the initial offering and for any treasury shares there would be a loss in value generally if it is trading far from $ 2.00 because it would be valued based on the market price   had the bond not converted it would trade in the market as a pure bond if the stock price is far below the strike price and as an ordinary pure bond plus a premium if near enough to the strike price in a manner that depends upon the time remaining under the conversion privilege    i can not think of a general case where someone would want to convert below strike and indeed barring a very strange tax inheritance or legal situation such as a weird divorce i can not think of a case where it would make sense   it often does not make sense to convert far from maturity either as the option premium only vanishes well above $ 2   the primary case for conversion would be where the after tax dividend is greater than the after tax interest payment

in most cases a debit card can be charged like a credit card so there is typically no strict need for a credit card however a debit card provides weaker guarantees to the merchant that an arbitrary amount of money will be available this is for several reasons as such there are a few situations where a credit card is required for example amazon requires a credit card for prime membership and car rental companies usually require a credit card the following does not apply to the op and is provided for reference debit cards do n't build credit so if you 've never had a credit card or loan before you 'll likely have no credit history at all if you 've never had a credit card this will make it very difficult to get any sized loan also some employers typically if the job you 're applying for involves financial or other highly sensitive information check credit when hiring and not having credit puts you at a disadvantage

i do n't see a tag for united states so i 'm having to assume this is us taxes   it does n't matter what app you use irs trades are all calculated the same first you have to report each trade on a 8949 and from that the totals go into a schedule d.   short term trades are stocks that you 've kept exactly one year or less long term trades are for 1 year + 1 day or more   trades where you sold a stock for a loss then bought that stock back again under 30 days do n't get to count as a loss   this only affects realized capital gains and losses you do n't count fees first take all of your short term gains then offset them by all of your short term losses   do the same for long term gains and losses   short and long term gains are taxed at different rates   you can deduct losses from short term to your long term and vice versa   then you can deduct the total losses up to $ 3000 household $ 1500 married filing separately per year on your regular income taxes or other dividend taxes   if you have over $ 3000 in losses then you need to carry that over to subsequent years edited per dave 's comments thanks dave

i too am a full monthly statement balance payer and i received a balance transfer offer from my credit card company this one was quite different from many others that i have read about on this forum i could do a balance transfer for any amount up to $ x from another credit card or use the checks to pay   some other non credit card bills and i would not have to pay any interest for 12 months on the amount thus borrowed   but there would be a 2 service charge on the amount i was borrowing this amount would be billed on the next monthly statement and it would have to be paid in full by the due date of that month 's payment that is within the grace period allowed for payment of monthly statements else interest would start being charged on the unpaid part of the service charge at the usual rate of per month if i had not paid the previous month 's balance in full i would be charged interest at per month on the service charge starting from day one no free ride till the due date of the next month 's statement of course the balance carried over from last month would also be charged interest at if i had paid last month 's bill in full but there were any other charges purchases during the current month then   unless the entire amount due this month 's purchases plus service charge and that interest free for twelve months loan   balance was paid off within the grace period my purchases would be deemed unpaid and would start being charged interest in short the only way to avoid paying interest on the amount borrowed was to start with a card showing a $ 0 balance due on the previous month 's statement not make any charges on that card for a whole year and pay off that 2 service charge within the grace period it might also have required that one of that interest free loan be repaid each month but   i had stopped reading the offer at this point and filed it in the round circular file in short while @joetaxpayer 's tale of how as a pay in full user i 've used the zero rate to throw $ 20 k at the 5.25 mortgage is undoubtedly how things worked once it is not at all clear that they still work that way at least they do n't work that way for me   heck once upon a time for a period of about 3 months you could earn 1.5 interest per month from the credit card company by overpaying your credit card bill considerably their computers then just added on 1.5 interest by multiplying your credit balance by and so you got 1.5 per month interest from the credit card company the credit card agreements and the software got changed in a hurry and all credit card agreements state in the fine print that if you overpay your bill you do n't earn any interest on the overpayment

while i agree with the overarching narrative regarding the car industry self driving cars and how people will use transportation in the future i deeply disagree with his timeframe and reject that his clearly large city centric thinking will effect all parts of the country and all parts of the world    there is no way this happens as quickly as he says it will for the following reasons    on his claim that electric cars will be all anyone will buy 1 we lack the road or electrical grid infrastructure to support tens of millions of electric vehicles throughout the us this will take far more than just 5 10 years especially in the more rural parts of the country   2 we lack the production capacity to create the batteries for 17 million of yearly sales of automobiles for the few years between 2021 2025 when everyone is presumably just buying only electric self driving cars   3 the used market for combustion engine cars will tank so strongly that it will actually create demand for people to buy combustion cars as the costs will now outweigh the savings of buying a new car with lower running costs thus pushing his timeline out into the future by several years   4 cars even electric cars are much more complicated durable expensive and prone to damage and accidents than most software and disposable consumer electronics he cites in his examples of course nokia went from 50 of the market to 5 over one product cycle people completely replaced their phones every 2 3 years back then wireless carriers built a system where even if your phone worked you had little to no reason not to lock in another contract and get the next best phone of course people would dump their nokia bricks for an iphone it was the next best thing cars have a much longer life cycle and inefficient older models will be around for decades in some cases because they will be a sunk cost for those who bought them    on his claim that no one will own a car anymore and everyone will ride share   1 how does one decide to take a road trip somewhere what about people who travel for a living or as an integral part of doing their job   2 i personally think a ride sharing transportation network represents a limiting of freedom though i can see why people might make the opposite point people identify with owning their own cars keeping their own belongings in them having them for use whenever they so need or desire people who do n't live in dense urban i.e a huge group of americans and especially a huge group of americans who are older have money and are set in their ways are n't going to see this as nearly as attractive as someone who lives in new york or san might and those people hardly buy cars anyway   3 people are fucking stubborn it 's going to take a lot for people to decide to change up such an integral part of their daily lives this will not happen over a 3 4 year cycle   4 where is the infrastructure to park charge and perform maintenance on all these autonomous vehicles we will need more cars available during rush hour than at 3 pm or 3 am for that matter where do the cars go then   5 this simply wo n't work quickly in countries outside the very top of the first world they wo n't have the infrastructure or capital to invest to bring it up to speed fast enough to derail oil demand as quickly as he claims   5 this theory implies a central government that is in complete control to implement rules in support of autonomous cars i believe most of this will be done at the state and municipality level at first with some cities hopping on board and others banning the practice   6 this theory also implies that the technology will be flawless the first completely computer aided pedestrian disaster or multi car pile up will undoubtedly cause massive backlash regardless of the statistics showing general reduction in accidents and might clog this entire concept up in bureaucracy for decades as the government forces stricter and stricter safety and quality requirements on the software    i 'm not saying his view is n't the long run eventually for mobility in the us and the world in general but applying personal electronic technology cycle rules to large scale durable goods that work in real space instead of cyber space represents a whole different set of challenges and could easily take 25 50 years to really pull off over that time oil markets will right size themselves and the automotive manufacturers will consolidate and cater their product to meet demand service the fleet    tl dr this will take much longer to accomplish than he infrastructure takes time to build cars are a different technology than consumer electronics people are stubborn

have you bought computers since   could you afford a computer back when you were building them     i remember my upper middle class friends owning computers back then and i believe they paid around 1200 for them   inflation adjusted we should be paying just shy of 2k for a pc today and yet you can buy a basic desktop for 500     you may have personally felt the sting from outsourcing many people have   many people also felt the sting when their companies could no longer compete with the computer companies   this is n't the 50 's when you could work the same job 30 years   today many people have to go through several career changes in their lifetime

this may make australian exports cheaper which can be a good thing however it is at the expense of making imports more expensive look to japan which is devaluing their currency and is a large importer of energy   i wo nt say its bad or unnecessary to hold money in other currencies however keep in mind that all aud denominated assets will or at least should rise as the currency falls if just aud usd falls this may not apply but if aud is weakened all around it should hold true again look to japan where the nikkei is closely correlated with the strength of the yen   another possibility is to buy gold which should rise in aud terms but other forces are at work with gold price so some would not agree with this

gt;my father and my grandfather and my great grandfather could all sustain their families on a single middle class income   well depends on what you define as middle class income   some of it is a rising expected standard of living   what size house did they have   how many automobiles did they have   if you go back to your great grandfather 's time he probably had far fewer sets of clothing   they probably did n't have the television telephone and air conditioning services that i expect most middle class people expect   my dad ate fruits and vegetables only in season you did n't get to have in the middle of winter or shipped in from chile   i expect to be able to travel via air to visit relatives go back to the 1960s or even into the 1970s and it was considered something that only the well to do would expect to be doing   my father did n't have video game consoles available to him   some of these are driven purely by technology of course and someone can manage to pay no larger a chunk of change than they did before   we eat more meat if i remember a lecture on this correctly   my parents had a lot more and inexpensive foods than i do   but some of it is also adjusting norms   reading about the sort of house that a farmer lived in a few hundred years back would make me think of horrible poverty by modern standards   most women seem not to have wanted to remain when women started going out and doing men 's historical work   so if they go out into the workforce then keeping up with the doing what 's considered middle class requires doubling income and downwards pressure on some fixed costs like say utility costs or gas costs is lessened that makes things tough on the few families who want to have a single income standard   sure maybe a small percentage of people out there want less expensive beef but its the bulk of people who get catered to   automation has greatly decreased demand for some types of jobs performing a repetitive pre defined task on an assembly line has fallen dramatically in value as the need for more people to do this sort of work has fallen off   wages for a particular job are a function of how many people are available to do them relative to how many are needed   every atm is one less bank teller every e commerce website fewer retail workers   that increases the productive capacity of society but whereas before there might be tremendous demand for someone to perform a repeated task on an assembly line which it was easy to train people to do many of the types of labor that are currently under supplied are things that take longer to train people to do and require more specialization   debt   any debt that someone has that does n't have a positive return on investment an engineering degree would probably have a positive roi a large television probably a negative winds up making them poorer in the long run   any debt at all barring investors making bad pricing decisions and hitting default or unexpectedly low returns means transfer of wealth from people without money to people with money   the more non defaulted upon debt the more people with more wealth make more wealth from lending   people have vastly more personal debt than they once did    compare the amount of debt that someone has today with the amount of debt that they typically had in your great grandfather 's time in the 1930s   there 's a constant drain of wealth towards the lenders   this is one of elizabeth warren 's favorite points people take out a lot more debt particularly on housing than they ever did in the past and so a lot of their income is eaten year by year on debt service   there are lots of factors that make it easier to take out more debt   the biggest source of personal debt is by far pdfs and this is where the largest increases have taken place policies to try to encourage people to go into debt to take out larger and larger mortgages have been steadily ramped up over this time with the government subsidizing and taking on risk for insurance liability on mortgages to keep encouraging ever larger amounts of debt   lenders have computers and much more information and sophisticated systems for evaluating risk of default which permits lending out more wealth   so there are technological changes driving this   the government has more public debt which means more such payments even if they do n't show up on your personal checkbook and are only seen by an increasing disparity between what you pay in taxes and the services you get back    here 's a chart of inflation adjusted debt per business of the day americans income and the us in the united states   that means that there 's a constant increasing in the siphoning off of taxes as well to pay for the government having purchased a good or service without having actually paid for it at the time it was ordered   that decreasing green line means not that personal debt is falling well most of the time but that the government is taking out debt on your behalf even faster than private debt has been going up   the rest of the world catching up and breaking a temporary limited monopoly on certain   china and india were not industrialized and the former stuck under and not trading much with the rest of the world so there were fewer people available to do this sort of work   europe rebuilt from world war ii so it did n't have to purchase from the overseas us manufacturing industry   what could change   well standard of living is a cultural thing that seems hard to manipulate   i 'm sure that it 's possible to change that but i have a hard time suggesting how   automation would be an across the board good thing if workers could be efficiently shifted into fields which currently have more demand it 's only an issue for workers if they stay in a field that has falling demand   i 'm sure that our mechanisms for re educating workers are not terribly good   today our education system still involves having a person stand up in front of a lot of other people and talk at them then have those other people go and repeat some rote tasks to try and hammer something into their brain it 's the same mechanism that the wealthy used hundreds of years ago to tutor their children but ramped up on a larger scale   if it were cheaper and easier to learn a new trade it 'd be easier to enter lucrative fields   college costs in particular are ridiculous   when you take college classes you 're basically getting a reading list a very few limited slots to ask questions and a set of predefined tasks plus some grading   that can be done far less than it is provided today   i personally have high hopes for online courses as a start here though i 'm sure that there will be blocks   ditto for things like wikipedia using means that i can skip over things i already know and focus on what i do n't understand and electronic automatic distribution means that it can be done far less than having some guy with a phd stand up in front of a room and read some lecture notes   instead of answering questions generation after generation those people should be polishing databases of answers to questions so that every subsequent human being can quickly and easily refer to their answer and so that we can direct people to the best explanation easily   it 's possible to adopt some measures that would reduce debt service by reducing public debt but the public debt has been growing for a long time and it seems very clear that people are much more willing to take out debt than to cut into their favorite concern low taxes or lots of services in the immediate future   as for reducing debt service via reducing private debt most of the policy and technological factors that drive private debt seem unlikely to change to me   maybe if we see some sort of cultural change an aversion to taking out debt with a negative roi but all of the information i 'm giving here has been public for a long time and people have n't changed so i doubt that we 'll see any kind of a reversal or social movement against taking out lots of debt   you 'd have to have the equivalent of a great wiki with respect to debt and given that attempts to excite interest in the matter have generally not gone anywhere thus far i suspect that this is human nature and doubt that things will change   you can always change your personal debt decisions but society as a whole   as for the temporary monopoly well i think that it 's pretty much inevitable that the rest of the world catches up to a great degree   asia will catch up even africa will eventually get there   i think that that would be a pretty difficult thing to stop and i think that most of the world would object to someone attempting to stop it

a key principle of economics is sunk costs are irrelevant you bought the stock at 147 and it has now fallen to 144 that 's too bad this has nothing to do with whether it is wise or foolish to buy shares at 144 the only relevant thing to consider is do i expect the stock to go up or down from 144 you have lost $ 3 per share on the original buy buying more shares will not reduce your loss in any way suppose you bought 100 shares at 147 the price then drops to 144 you have lost $ 3 per share or $ 300 total you buy another 50 more shares at 144 the price stays at 144 so your average purchase price is now 147 x 100 + 144 x 50 150 = 146 so i guess you could say that your average loss per share is now only $ 2 but it 's $ 2 x 150 shares instead of $ 3 x 100 shares you still lost $ 300 you did n't reduce your loss by a penny maybe it made you feel better that you reduced your average loss per share but this is just an arithmetic game if you believe that the stock will continue to drop than buying more shares just means you will lose even more money your average loss per share may go down but you 're just multiplying that average by more and more shares of course if you believe that the stock is now at an low price and it will likely go back up then sure buy if you buy at 144 and it goes back up to 147 then you 'll be making $ 3 per share on the new shares you purchased but i repeat whether or not you buy more shares should have nothing to do with your previous buy buy more shares if you think the price will go up from the present price do n't buy more shares if you do n't think it will go up the decision should be exactly the same as if you had never previously bought shares i 'm assuming here that you are a typical small investor that you not buying enough shares to have any significant effect on the market nor that you are in a position to buy enough shares to take control of the company

there are cases where it makes sense to insure something even if you can bear its loss   insurance is a tool to control risk   one reason you might want to control risk is indeed if you can not afford to bear it 's loss   however there are other reasons you might wish to insure something when you look at your life in totality let 's say you have $ 100 to work with and you have an item a that costs $ 30 perhaps you really need a in your life but its clear here that you can afford to replace it so maybe you do n't insure it   then you get item b which also costs $ 30 and item c which costs $ 30   we can see that you can cover all three of these total value $ 90 so one might argue that you do n't need to insure it now let 's add item d onto the plate also at a cost of $ 30   now you 're in an interesting position with 4 items you depend on a b c and d which have a sum total replacement cost of $ 120   now if all of these break or are stolen you no longer have the funds to replace them   of course what are the odds that all of them break at the same time   you may be able to do the math to determine the probability of going broke and use that to determine whether you want to insure the item or not now consider that you will have to make a similar mathematical analysis for every additional purchase you make   you will also have items which you can bear to lose but you really do n't want to   these can add a large amount of effort to every decision you make   it may be worth getting insurance in such a case   one could think of the purchase in two parts   there is the part that accounts for the statistical expectation of loss and the other is the insurance company 's profits   the profits could be thought of as paying the insurance company for a service which makes it easier for you to think through complicated decisions by removing risk

gt;if you have more people in an insurance pool premium costs go down which is the whole point of the individual mandate   the costs depend very very very much on who the people in the pool are actuarial data shows that older people almost invariably and by definition have significantly higher costs ergo this is why their premiums have been higher or if a particular pool has an inordinate number of older people in it why everyone in that pool 's premiums are higher because they are essentially an average and the younger members are in essence subsidizing the older ones conversely if a firm has almost entirely young single people premium costs are significantly significantly lower   one of the things the legislation does though is place an artificial limitation of the premium price differential ergo younger people will across the board be seeing a huge increase in premium costs because the law is essentially mandating a major increased operating loss on the older pool members the cost will be shifted to the younger people   end result is that premiums for younger people will increase several times over which will make buying a policy which in the past was relatively cheap for young amp healthy people a significantly more difficult burden and that will naturally make paying the fine far more financially pragmatic   this is especially true since the other provision of the law is that known pre existing conditions can not be used to exclude or change the premium cost so should the individual be diagnosed with something they can after the fact still purchase coverage   basically it is like being able to buy a lottery ticket after the number have been drawn   it is an inherently unstable and unsustainable system

two different takes on an answer the net loss concept you mentioned and a core business concept if a store is actually a net loss and anybody is willing to buy it it may well make sense to sell it   depending on your capital value invested and how much it would take you to make it profitable it may be a sound business decision to sell the asset   the buyer of the asset is of course expecting for some reason to make it not a net loss for them perhaps they have other stores in the vicinity and can then share staff or stock somehow the core business is a concept   investors seem to go in cycles like can like well diversified companies that are resilient to a market downturn in one sector but then they also like so called pure play companies where you are clear on what you are owning   to try an example which is likely not the case here lets say that in 5 of its stores had migrated away from a gas station model to a one stop gas and repairs model therefore they had to have service parts and trained staff at those locations   these things are expensive and could be seen as not their area of expertise selling gas so as an investor if i want to own gas stations i do n't want to own a full service garage so perhaps i invest in somebody else once they sell off their non core assets they free up capital to do what they know best it is at least one possible explanation

in most cases of purchases the general advice is to save the money and    then make the purchase paying cash for a car is recommended over    paying credit for example for a house getting a mortgage is    recommended says who these rules of thumb hide the actual equations behind them they should be understood as not as the word of god the basics the basic idea is if you pay for something upfront you pay some fixed cost call it x where as with a loan you need to pay interest payments on x say i as well as at least fixed payments p at timeframe t resulting in some long term payment ix your assumption to some this obviously means upfront payments are better than interest payments as by the time the loan is paid off you will have paid more than x. this is a good rule of thumb like 's equations at low x high i and moderate t because all of that serves to make the end result ix > x. counter examples are there circumstances where the opposite is true here 's a simple but contrived one you do n't pay the full timeframe suppose you die declare bankruptcy move to another country or any other event that reduces t in such a way that xi is less than x. this actually is a big concern for older debtors or those who contract terminal illnesses as you ca n't squeeze those payments out of the dead this is basically manipulating the whole concept let 's try a less contrived example suppose you can get a return higher than i. i can currently get a loan at around 3 due to good credit but index funds in the long run tend to pay taking a loan and investing it may pay off and would be better than waiting to have the money even in some less than ideal markets this is basically manipulating t to deal with ix even less contrived and very real world suppose you know your cash flow will increase soon a promotion an inheritance a good market return it may be better to take the loan now enjoy whatever product you get until that cash flows in then pay it all off at once the enjoyment of the product will make the slight additional interest worth it this is n't so much manipulating any part of the equation it 's just you have different goals than the loan home loan analysis for long term mortgages x is high usually higher than a few years pay it would be a large burden to save that money for most people i is also typically fairly low p is directly related to i and the bank ca n't afford to raise payments too much or people will rent instead meaning p needs to be affordable this does not apply in very expensive areas which is why cities are often mostly renters t is also extremely long usually mortgages are for 15 or 30 years though 10 year options are available even with these shorter terms it 's basically the longest term loan a human will ever take this long term means there is plenty of time for the market to have a fluctuation and raise the investments current price above the remainder of the loan and interest accrued allowing you to sell at a profit as well consider the opportunity cost while saving money for a home you still need a place to live this additional cost is comparable to mortgage payments meaning x has a hidden constant the cost of renting often x + r > ix making taking a loan a better choice than saving up conclusion the general advice is a good heuristic for most common human payments we have relatively long life spans compared to most common payments and the opportunity cost of not having most goods is relatively low   however certain things have a high opportunity cost if you ca n't talk to hr you ca n't apply for jobs phone if you ca n't get to work you ca n't eat car and if you have no where to live it 's hard to keep a job house for things with high opportunity costs the interest payments are more than worth it

therefore i get the outcome i want    the human brain must think it ca n't stop   if you do n't believe me try     the mental process of putting stuff in those is called rationalization   this is a bored mind who wants something   if that mind is not particularly well disciplined those things will get pretty unrealistic    that is what has happened to your friend   landlords do not like drama   they do like money   generally a landlord will be happy to take your money any reasonable way that they can achieve   it sounds like either your landlord lost the ability to do credit cards or he got sick of paying the 3 overhead or some other overhead costs that may be higher because he does not have the right credit card merchant service   for instance paypal here charges flat but a traditional can cost up to $ 2000 a year in up fees and charges    as soon as the landlord calls the rent a debt he has to take cash   but in most places rental is at will and the landlord can evict for any reason or no reason at all except race color national origin family running a daycare center and a few other protected reasons   and there 's not a whole lot you can do about it   even for a lease he can trump up a reason   your friend would be wise to have a meeting of the minds with the landlord about how he 'd like to pay   business is done by mutual consent not non consensual legal tricks   i agree i would n't do ach either    one problem with ach or credit is the landlord can charge anything he pleases and that 's when they start in surcharges for things   once he 's pulled the money out you 're really at a disadvantage to argue since he already has the money and it 's really difficult to do a chargeback on part of a payment so you end up having to chargeback the entire rent check and now he can evict you

let 's look at some of your options in a savings account your $ 40,000 might be earning maybe 0.5 if you are lucky   in a year you 'll have earned $ 200   on the plus side you 'll have your $ 40,000 easily accessible to you to pay for moving closing costs on your new house etc if you apply it to your mortgage you are effectively saving the interest on the amount for the life of the loan   let 's say that the interest rate on your mortgage is 4   if you were staying in the house long term this interest would be compounded but since you are only going to be there for 1 year this move will save you $ 1600 in interest this year which means that when you sell the house and pay off this mortgage you 'll have $ 1600 extra in your pocket you said that you do n't like to dabble in stocks   i would n't recommend investing in individual stocks anyway   a stock mutual fund however is a great option for investing but only as a long term investment   you should be able to beat your 4 mortgage but only over the long term   if you want to have the $ 40,000 available to you in a year do n't invest in a mutual fund now i would lean toward option 2 applying the money to the mortgage   however there are some other considerations do you have any other debts maybe a car loan student loan or a credit card balance   if so i would forget everything else and put everything toward one or more of these loans first do you have an emergency fund in place or is this $ 40,000 all of the cash that you have available to you   one rule of thumb is that you have 3 to 6 months of expenses set aside in a safe easily accessible account ready to go if something comes up    are you saving for retirement   if you do n't already have retirement savings in place and are adding to it regularly some of this cash would be a great start to a roth ira or something like that invested in a stock mutual fund if you are already debt free except for this mortgage you might want to do some of each keep $ 10,000 in a savings account for an emergency fund if you do n't already have an emergency fund put $ 5,000 in a roth ira if you are n't already contributing a satisfactory amount to a retirement account and apply the rest toward your mortgage

if you keep going over budget with your credit card then stop using the credit card if you plan to pay off the card every month then your balance should always be under whatever your budget is   for example if you budget to spend $ 500 then even though your card has a limit of $ 5,000 you will never carry a balance of over $ 500   most banks have an option to email and or text message you when you pass a certain balance threshold in this instance you would set two notices one when your balance exceeds $ 400 warning you that you 're close need to start paying closer attention and one when you exceed $ 500 additionally maybe you are n't ready to pay for everything with your credit card   i prefer to use mine just for groceries and then pay it off at the end of the month   whatever rewards you get for putting all of your purchases on the card are more than paid for when you cross your budget limit costing you more in interest and fees   perhaps starting with just one type of purchase groceries or gas are good choices as most consumers are fairly consistent in their purchases of both would allow you to ease into using the card until you get used to managing your budget with it personal finances are all about behavior not knowledge   do n't worry too much about slipping up right now and making a mistake just keep practicing good behavior with your credit card and soon managing your budget with it will be as natural for you as when you only used cash

there is no issue and no question if you get married   the question is only relevant in the event that you go separate ways   should that happen you imply that you would want to refund whatever amount your girlfriend has paid toward the mortgage the solution then would seem to be to exempt her from any payments as you will either give that money back to her if you break up or make her a co owner of the condo if you get married   if you actually need her contributions to the monthly nut you could give her a written agreement whereby you would refund her money plus interest at her discretion

it definitely depends on the exchange you are trading on i 'm not familiar with scottrade but a standard practice is to fulfill limit orders in the order they are placed    most of the time you would n't see stocks trade significantly under your bid price but since penny stocks are very volatile it 's more likely their price could drop quickly past your bid and then return above it while only fulfilling a portion of the orders placed example 1 penny stock priced at $ 0.12 2 others place limit orders to buy at $ 0.10 3 you place limit order to buy at $ 0.10 4 stock price drops to $ 0.07 and some orders are filled anything $ 0.07 or higher based on a first come first served basis 5 due to the increase in purchases of the penny stock the price rises above $ 0.10 before your order is filled edit adding additional clarification from comment section a second example if the price drops from $ 0.12 to $ 0.07 then orders for all prices from $ 0.07 and above will start to be filled from the oldest order first that might mean that the oldest order was a limit buy order for 100 shares at $ 0.09 and since that is above the current ask price it will be filled first the next order might be for 800 shares at $ 0.07 it 's possible for a subset of these to be filled let 's say 400 before the share 's price increases from the increased demand then if the price goes above $ 0.10 your bid will not be filled during that time

this is not hypothetical this is an accurate story i am a long term investor i have a bunch of money that i 'd like to invest and i plan on spreading it out over five or six mutual funds and etfs roughly according to the canadian couch potato model portfolio that is passive mutual funds and etfs rather than specific stocks i am concerned that if i invest the full amount and the stock market crashes 30 next month i will have paid more than i had to as i am investing for the long term i expect to more than regain my investment but i still would n't be thrilled with paying 30 more than i had to instead i am investing my money in three stages i invested the first third earlier this month i 'll invest the next third in a few months and the final third a few months after that if the stock market climbs as i expect is more likely the case i will have lost out on some potential upside however if the stock market crashes next month i will end up paying a lower average cost as two of my three purchases will occur after the crash on average as a long term investor i expect the stock market to go up in the short term i expect much more fluctuation statistically speaking i 'd do better to invest all the money at once as most of the time the trend is upward however i am willing to trade some potential upside for a somewhat reduced risk of downside over the course of the next few months if we were talking a price difference of 1 as mentioned in the question i would n't care i expect to see average annual returns far above this but stock market crashes can cause the loss of 20 to 30 or more and those are numbers i care about i 'd much rather buy in at 30 less than the current price after all

the new york times offer a remarkably detailed buy vs rent calculator   you enter from all of this it advises the break even rent when monetarily it 's equal   i 'd suggest you keep a few things in mind when using such a tool logic common sense and a nobel prize winner named robert shiller all indicate that housing will follow inflation over the long term short term even 20 years the graphs will hint at something else but the real long term the cost of housing ca n't exceed inflation   the other major point i 'd add is that i see you wrote we rent a nice house most often people are looking to buy what they feel they ca n't easily rent whether it 's the yard room number or sizes etc this also leads to the purchase of too big a house you can find that you can afford the extra bedroom family room in addition to living room etc and then buy a house 50 bigger than what you need or planned on in my opinion getting the smallest house you can imagine living in no bigger than what you live in now and plan to get on a faster than 30 year repayment even with transaction costs in 10 years you 'll have saved enough to make the bump up to a larger house if you wish

there are some excellent responses to this question at the time of this post i have had the greatest success writing options the 2 main reasons are as follows with little time to expiration as stated in the question the implied volatility of the option is dictating the premium looking for the highest premiums is a mistake because you are taking a conservative strategy and re creating it into a high risk strategy my sweet spot is a 2 4 monthly return for my initial profit and then mastering management techniques to protect that return and even enhancing it

i am a bit confused here as to how a 4 k loan will negatively effect your credit score if payments are made on time   fico scores are based upon how well you borrow   if you borrow pay back on time your score will not go down   perhaps a bit in the short run when you first secure the loan but that should come back quickly   in the long run it will help improve your score which seems like it would be more important to you having the provider finance your loan will probably not show up on your credit unless you fail to pay and they send to collections if the score is so important to you which i think is somewhat unwise then use a credit card   with a 750 you should be able to get a pretty good rate but assume it is 18   in less then 9 months you will have it paid off paying about $ in interest   you could consider that a part of the cost of doing business for maintaining a high credit score   again not what i would advise but it might meet your needs one alternative is go with lending club   with that kind of score you are looking at 7 or so   at $ 500 a month you are still looking at just over 8 months and paying about $ 100 in interest   much less money for improving your credit score edit based upon the comment my understanding is that using a significant portion of your available credit balance is bad for your credit even if you pay your bills on time define bad   as i said it might go down slightly in the short term   in three months you will have almost 33 of the loan paid off which is significantly lower then the original balance   if you go the credit card route you may be approved for quite a bit more then the 4000 which may not move the needle at all   are you planning on buying a home in the next 90 days   if not why does a small short term dip matter   will your life really be effected if your score goes down to 720 for three months keep in mind this is exactly the kind of behavior that the banks want you to engage in   if you worship your fico score which gives no indication of wealth then you should do exactly what i am suggesting

your only real alternative is something like t bills via your broker or treasurydirect or short term bond funds like the vanguard short term investment grade fund   the problem with this strategy is that these options are different animals than a money market you 're either going to subject yourself to principal risk or lose the flexibility of withdrawing the money a better strategy imo is to look at your overall portfolio and what you actually want if you have $ 100k in a money market and you are not going to need $ 100k in cash for the future you are paying via the low yield for flexibility that you do n't need if get your money into an appropriately diversified portfolio you 'll end up with a more optimal return if the money involved is relatively small doing nothing is a real option as well $ 5,000 at 0.5 yields $ 25 and a 5 return yields only $ 250 if you need that money soon to pay tuition use for living expenses etc it 's not worth the trouble

got job at top 10 bank out of college   first year as analyst i also got involved in college recruiting   there were many discussions on what schools to recruit from   seemed to be a combo of best reputations highest rankings and schools some senior executives went too   our bank had dedicated recruitment at about 10 to 15 schools   if you got into the analyst program outside of that it was through some connection   if memory serves me these were the colleges we recruited from   harvard yale mit dartmouth brown cornell princeton columbia duke nyu stanford ucla cal   think nyu the easiest school that gets dedicated recruiters due to it 's size and location   my bank had more west coast and southern focus than other banks   i believe northwestern and u of chicago get recruited from banks with large chicago offices

an actual degree may not be necessary in 18 years as non traditional education becomes more openly available sources such as mit 's etc are dramatically lowering the bar to getting a decent education   while these types of resources wo n't take the place of a degree if only the ultra wealthy can afford college in the future at least in the states we 'll see even more jobs being taken by people from other countries where education is free or at least significantly less expensive due to the lack of education and experience our own over priced universities will cause

in this case it is probably best to have a separate line for each degree since they were not earned at the same time   you can probably find some examples by searching around i am usa based so you might also want to check if there are regional differences in layouts   my input is based on usa styles

my answer has nothing to do with tax brackets or mathematics i 'm taking advantage of the leeway your question allowed but rather it has to do with career goals and promotion   large companies often have large policies procedures to go with them   one policy that sometimes exists which would make it a bad idea to accept a raise is employee can not be given more than one    salary increase in a 12-month period this means that if you accept a standard of living or merit increase of say 2 or 3 in april and then you apply for a job that would otherwise warrant a pay grade increase you may be forced to wait until the following year to get bumped to the proper pay grade of course this totally depends on the company but it would be advisable to check your company 's h.r. policy on that if you 're considering a move even a lateral one in the future

basically the first thing you should do before you invest your money is to learn about investing and learn about what you want to invest in another thing to think about is that usually low risk can also mean low returns as you are quite young and have some savings put aside you should generally aim for higher risk higher return investments and then when you start to reach retirement age aim for less risky lower return investments in saying that just because an investment is considered high risk does not mean you have to be exposed to the full risk of that investment you do this by managing your risk to an acceptable level which will allow you to sleep at night to do this you need to learn about what you are investing in as an example about managing your risk in an investment say you want to invest $ 50,000 in shares if you put the full $ 50,000 into one share and that share price drops dramatically you will lose a large portion of your money straight away if instead you spent a maximum of $ 10,000 on 5 different shares even if one of them falls dramatically you still have another 4 which may be doing a lot better thus your losses to take it one step further you might say if anyone of the shares you bought falls by 20 then you will sell those shares and limit your losses to $ 2000 per share if the worst case scenario occurred and all 5 of your shares fell during a stock market crash you would limit your total losses to $ 10,000 instead of $ 50,000 most successful investors put just as much if not more emphasis on managing the risk on their investments and limiting their losses as they do in selecting the investments as i am not in the us i can not really comment whether it is the right time to buy property over there especially as the market conditions would be different in different states and in different areas of each state however a good indication of when to buy properties is when prices have dropped and are starting to as you are renting at the moment one option you might want to look at is buying a place to live in so you do n't need to rent any more you can compare your current rent payment with the mortgage payment if you were to buy a house to live in if your mortgage payments are lower than your rent payments then this could be a good option but whatever you do make sure you learn about it first make sure you spend the time looking at for sale properties for a few months in the area you want to buy before you do buy this will give you an indication of how much properties in that area are really worth and if prices are stable still falling or starting to go up good luck and remember research research and more research even if you are to take someone elses advice and recommendations you should learn enough yourself to be able to tell if their advice and recommendations make sense and are right for your current situation

except restricting how the economy can be controlled is a slippery slope into financial control of the nation by outside interests   the real issue is that every extreme becomes a problem and trying to block every extreme is futile   controls should impede but not completely stop extremes   the method should return the force against it as support or growth for the nation   financial growth of any outside interest connected to the government or in this country should bring more and more wealth into the nation while slowing the growth of the financial extremes but never stopping it   special interest groups need to return to the country a share of what they gain through their work with the government and our people   religious groups should return money and support of the lower class   women ’s advocacy groups need to return value for their gains   the nra needs to return value for its gains   the poorer populace should return work for the country in return for education health care housing food and wages   harder and smarter work better progress through education should be rewarded with better benefits and eventual financial freedom there is no true freedom in a world of limited resources and competition so the idea of true freedom is ridiculous   we should however endeavor to give as much freedom as possible   there should be an uncomfortable minimum below which a person may only fall if they refuse to work and get educated

the most relevant aspect of islamic banking that distinguishes it from non islamic banking is the prohibition of charging interest there is no prohibition on the utilization of technology    since banks that comply with sharia make direct investments sharing of profit loss and leasing many banks that are sharia compliant are very modern sophisticated and behave very much like private equity or even in some cases hedge funds there is a prohibition in sharia to avoid excessive risk so many modern islamic financial institutions deploy and trade financial derivatives to provide the means to risk management this is done on a very technological level with expertise   london has become a hub of islamic banking and there have been efforts by the financial sector to push to make london the center of islamic banking these institutions are as advanced as any non islamic banks    here is a source to check out   here is an article discussing the streamlining of banking through technology

spring hill in 2009 spring hill united church of christ followed the lead of the denomination ’s 24th general of 2003 and adopted a statement of the church body would welcome and affirm all people including people of every sexual identity one way the church has decided to live up to that statement is by offering an educational and support group for those with hiv aids as well as people affected by it beginning this month the group will meet from 7 to p.m. on the last tuesday of each month at the church for the past two years our church has declared itself open to all people regardless of age race gender ethnicity sexual identity health or disabilities economic status or family structure said the as part of that of all people in our we are excited to be able to reach out to those who may lack the support and that comes from being hiv positive or having aids the ministry called red project will be led by church member and student ray gomez i chose the name red project because red is a stand out shout out kind of color gomez said red is also the color of the aids used to represent the illness he said red denotes danger and is an angry color representing the worst in human behavior and ignorance along with hatred shown to the people with the illness in the early years gomez said and the stigma surrounding hiv even today gomez is hiv positive and has more than 25 years of experience teaching and advocating on hiv aids he holds degrees in education and education and is working on a second master ’s degree in counseling he is an minister through the church international and is a student in ministry with the united church of christ gomez who is gay said he the church in spring hill because it is open and a lot of churches do not want to service or go out of their way to reach the hiv population he said it ’s unfortunate because a lot of people with hiv live in this community there ’s so much stigma still attached to hiv so for that reason many people do n’t want anything to do with church gomez said that several years ago he personally felt rejection by many churches subsequently he turned to alcohol crack cocaine and living i discovered quite quickly that the world ’s solutions make great promises but can never deliver he said it was all just an illusion of the intimacy i was seeking and i was left more broken more hopeless and experienced deeper despair over the past 11 years gomez said he returned to the faith of his youth and began to those who were hurting and broken now as an advocate and peer in the field he is a certified prevention specialist hiv test counselor and peer i have recovered from crack addiction and alcohol abuse he said i have discovered the metropolitan community church and the united church of christ two denominations that allow me to be fully myself and fully christian and which give me the opportunity to minister to a hurting and broken community reconciliation for hurting people is his goal my purpose and pastor ’s purpose is to reconcile gay men and people that have been hurt by other christians and that do n’t attend church anymore and welcome them back into a family of faith topics at the monthly classes will include i just tested positive now what talking with my health care provider the stuff you need to discuss medication adherence what ’s important and why and crystal meth and hiv a non judgmental educational experience according to a press release the purpose of red project is to offer emotional physical and spiritual support and guidance to those newly diagnosed with hiv and to those who have been positive for some time i believe a good support group needs four things gomez said physical support emotional support education and spiritual support there is no cost to attend but donations will be sought to help with and educational materials said those attending need not participate in the church there are no strings attached he said all we want to do is to help those who have a need and to affirm those who may feel alienated and by society at large my biggest hope is that people find inner healing and form bonds of friendship from participating in red project according to public information officer for the county health department the county does not offer a support group for those with hiv aids the health department reaches out with hiv aids education presentations literature testing and prevention said the health department clinics offer testing education comprehensive care and referrals hiv and aids is a concern across florida she said and we are fortunate to have resources available in county that support people who are living with hiv and aids

i 'm going to ignore your numbers to avoid spending the time to understand them   i 'm just going to go over the basic moving parts of trading an upside down car against another financed car because i think you 're conflating price and value   i 'm also going to ignore taxes and fees and depreciation the car has an acquisition cost price then it has a value   you pay the price to obtain this thing then in the future it is worth what someone else will pay you when you finance a car you agree to your $ 10,000 price then you call up mr. bank and agree to pay 10 per year for 5 years on that $ 10,000   mr. banker wires over $ 10,000 and you drive home in your car    say in a year you want a different car   this new car has a price of $ 20,000 and would n't you know it they 'll even buy your current car from you   they 'll give you $ 7,000 to trade in your current car your current car has a value of $ 7,000   you 've made 12 payments of $   of those payments about $ 460 was interest you now owe about $ to mr. banker the new dealership needs to send payment to mr. banker to get the title for your current car   they 'll send the $ 7,000 they agreed to pay for your car   then they 'll loan you the additional $ $ owed on the car minus $ 7,000 trade in value    your loan on the new car will be for $ $ 20,000 for the new car and $ for the amount you still owed on the old car after the dealership paid you $ 7,000 for your old car it does n't matter what your down payment was on the old car it does n't matter what your payment was before it does n't matter what you bought your old car for   all that matters is how much you owe on it today and how much the buyer the dealership is willing to pay you for it how much of this is loss is an extremely vague number to derive primarily because your utility of the car has a value   but it could be argued that the $ added on to your new car loan to pay for the old car is lost

is this right the example is slightly off google would be running a cafeteria that can be subsidized employees pay an amount to buy food not every one spends the same amount or eats the same amount of food if someone does n't use cafeteria he does n't get more money for example suppose john doe makes $ 100,000 a year taxed at a rate of 20 for a take home pay of $ 80,000 he spends $ 10,000 on food his employer corporation decides to give him all of his food and deduct it as a business expense costing them $ 10,000 but now they can pay john doe an amount so his take home pay will be reduced by $ 10,000 $ the company is now spending $ employing john doe for a savings of $ if a scheme is devised specifically to evade taxes then it is invalid in this case bill may buy groceries worth only $ 5000 so keep track of which employee buys how much groceries in added cost of google plus one ca n't really call it a business expense

i absolutely agree with the other answers   no contest you should keep getting the match   but just for completeness i 'll give a contrarian opinion that is generally not very popular but does have some merit    if you can focus on just one main financial goal at a time and throw every extra dollar you have at that one focus i.e. getting out of debt in your case you will make better progress than if you 're trying to do too many things at once   also there something incredibly freeing about being out of debt that has other beneficial impacts on your life so if you can bring a lot of focus to the credit card debt and get it paid off quickly it may be worth deferring the 401(k investing long enough to do that even though it does n't make as much mathematical sense   this is essentially what dave ramsey teaches btw

what is your investment goal   many investors buy for the long haul not short term gain   if you 're looking for long term gain then daily fluctuations should be of no concern to you   if you want to day trade and time the market buy low and sell high with a short holding period then yes less volatile stock can be less profitable but they also carry less risk   in that case though transaction fees have more of an impact and you usually have to trade in larger quantities to reduce the impact of transaction fees

the first problem with your analysis is that you are not comparing equivalent contributions the deductible traditional ira contribution is in terms of pre tax money whereas the roth ira contribution is in terms of post tax money a certain nominal amount of pre tax money is equivalent to a smaller nominal amount of post tax money because taxes are taken out of it for a fair comparison you need to start with the same amount of pre tax money being taken out of your wages if you start with $ 1000 being taken out of your pre tax wages the deductible traditional ira contribution will be $ 1000 but your roth ira contribution will be $ 750 because 25 of it went to paying taxes if you go through the calculation you will see that after you withdraw it and 25 taxes are paid in the traditional case you will be left with the exact same amount of money in your hand at the end in both cases even though you see that you end up with the same amount of money you may still be confused because you paid different nominal amounts in taxes that 's the second problem with your analysis you are comparing the nominal amounts of taxes paid at different times you are missing the time value of money would you rather pay $ 1000 of taxes today or $ of taxes in 10 years of course you would rather the latter even though it is a higher nominal amount a given amount of money now has the same value to you now as a bigger amount of money later if i invest a given amount of money now and it grows in to a bigger amount of money later then that bigger amount of money later has the same value as the original contribution now so the 25 tax on the contribution now is equivalent to the 25 tax on the total value later even though the latter is a much bigger nominal amount another way to think about it is that you could have taken that 25 tax you paid now and instead invest it let it grow and pay that result which will still be 25 of the total later in taxes later you get to keep the remaining 75 of your investment either way you are simply investing on behalf of the government the part of the money you would have paid them and paying them the result of investing that portion of the money later

sort of yes sort of no all teslas actually claim to be completely out of charge while there is actually still a bit of juice in the battery they do this because fully draining the battery damages it and its life span significantly but that 's just a few percent of full battery capacity and not what 's being discussed in this article   the thing being discussed in this article is that tesla used to sell one specific model that had about 15 of it 's normal battery capacity artificially locked away you could pay tesla a bit extra at any time and they would unlock the full potential of the battery via a remote software update that particular model sold pretty poorly unclear if it 's because customers did n't like the artificial restriction or if the range on that model was simply too short but either way tesla stopped selling it not long after introducing it

there is a positive not being mentioned above the depreciation vs your regular earned income disclaimer i am not a tax attorney or an accountant nor do i play one on the internet i am however a landlord with that important caveat out of the way rental properties and improvements to them depreciate in value on a well defined schedule you can claim that depreciation as a phantom loss to lower the amount of your taxable regular income if you make a substantial amount of the latter it can be a huge boon in the first few years you own the property you can claim the depreciation as if the property were new so take the advice of a random stranger on the internet to your accountant attorney and see how much it helps you

most personal loans in the us are for the purpose of purchasing some tangible object usually a house or car and that object is the collateral for the loan indeed the loan proceeds are usually paid directly to the seller without passing through the bank account of the borrower and the seller delivers the title of the car to the lender or a mortgage lien is recorded on the real property except possibly in the case of a refinance of a home mortgage   there is not much cash from such a loan to send to a friend to invest in his business whether in the us or in india   these types of loans are relatively easy to get much harder to get are unsecured personal loans unless your friend has a very friendly banker getting an unsecured loan of say $ 20,000 just for the heck of it is not easy some reasonably well off people do manage to get such loans and use the money to invest in the stock or bond markets in which case the interest paid on such loans can be deducted on   schedule a but only to the extent of the actual investment income any extras can be carried over to the next year so will your friend be investing in your business or making a loan to your business and do you anticipate that your business will generate any investment income or interest for your friend if not and your friend still wants to finance your business while making payments on the loan in the us then your friend must really like you a lot or have faith that a few years down the road you will be able to sell your business to for big bucks and pay him off very handsomely

in general i do n’t think you can blame the news stories you can blame everyone ’s preconceived notion that any sort of lbo or leveraged restructuring is the devil ’s work every american is of course well versed in the subject    from the example you clearly have a journalist who has no idea what they are talking about all you have is a cherry picked summary of what took place as such the finance scholars jump in and explain how it ’s all a giant scam   bain in 1997 as a part of that it was saddled with m in debt that of course is for the finance scholars because they do n't understand the benefits of debt and more generally how lbos work none of which are noted in the article   the article then notes that has recently encountered trouble to the geniuses this is of course because of romney 's work and the m in debt no one notices the fact that bain this in 2004 for double what it paid for it for those that did the unloading was a textbook bain scam bain this to kkr perhaps the and most successful pe firm in history would kkr put $ into this if it were a scam according to the geniuses of course they would how could mitt romney actually improve a business no one looks at the fact that revenues were up considerably margins had expanded tremendously growth prospects were higher and fcf yields were fantastic this is why kkr bought the company and this is what an lbo is supposed to be i have n't done a ton of work on this case it was before my time but i would be very surprised if the growth was n't accompanied by employee expansion as well   you also get the i wish i had a way to just walk away from my debt comment i do n’t even know where to begin explaining how asinine that is equity is subordinated to debt that ’s the definition of equity    the article also notes the one sided mattress idea which is construed as romney 's giant scam to screw the average american while flipping this company and making his millions the article of course did n't note that this one sided mattress idea was a mere fraction of revenue this was designed as an economy mattress with an advertised shorter shelf life plus how can this be a scam would you go into the mattress store and pay the same amount for a mattress with only one side if you would you deserve to get half of a mattress   so the crux of it is this is in actuality an example of what an lbo should be at least for bain ’s part bain took a business that was ripe for an lbo reasonable steady fcf low leverage did the lbo improved the business and came out on top what kkr did with it i have no idea i would imagine it has more to do with deteriorating business conditions than the debt on its balance sheet   i work with restructurings over 100 hours a week i of course do n’t come up with the plans i ’m a lowly analyst building models and associated but i see just how brilliant these ideas are in a lot of cases restructurings prevent the tripping of covenants and associated bankruptcy and allow for strategy to play out and for companies to grow i can of course give a more detailed rant on the article but i figured no one will read this anyway
