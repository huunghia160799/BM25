the bank secrecy act of 1970 requires that banks assist the u.s. gov't in identifying and preventing money laundering this means they 're required to keep records of cash transactions of negotiable instruments and report any such transactions with a daily aggregate limit of a value greater than or equal to $ 10,000 because of this the business which is issuing the money order is also required to record this transaction to report it to the bank who then holds the records in case fincen wants to review the transactions edited added clarification on the $ 10,000 rule

first off let me just say that you are an intelligent individual and regardless of how heated this conversation gets i really appreciate the opportunity to talk with you about this   i definitely do n't disagree with you that germany got it 's debt by a different means and that the mechanisms that kept it in debt are different from the mechanisms that are effecting us today but the discussion we 're having does have everything to do with debt we 've been deficit spending for generations and we 're trillions in the hole and that 's the psychological issue hanging over our heads   i 'm not arguing with the accepted principles of macroeconomics in fact what 's just occurred to me is that we could put together another bretton woods type conference which would hopefully learn from the mistakes of the previous systems so we can design a system that will keep inflation low while we dump money into the economy from what i understand inflation has always been lower while these flawed previous systems were in place and the issue in my mind with dumping money while the debt situation is such a concern is that speculators could the bed and devalue our currency

i have done something similar to this myself   what you are suggesting is a sound theory and it works   the issues are which is why it 's the reason not everyone does it the initial cost is great many people in their 20s or 30s can not afford their own home let alone buy second properties   the time to build up a portfolio is very long term and is best for a pension investment   it 's often not best for diversification you 've heard not putting all your eggs in one basket with property deposits you need to put a lot of eggs in to make it work and this can leave you vulnerable there can be lots of work involved renovating is a huge pain and cost and you 've already mentioned not paying   unlike a bank account or bonds shares etc   you can not get to your savings investments quickly if you need to or find an opportunity   but after considering these and deciding the plunge is worth it i would say go for it be a good landlord with good quality property and you 'll have a great nest egg   if you try just one and see how it goes with population increase in a safe respectable location the value of the investment should continue to rise which it does n't in a bank and you can expect a rental return very hard to find in cash account   hope it goes well

no as a director normally you ca n't as a director of a limited company all those payments should be accounted for as directors remuneration and have been subject to paye and even if you are self employed currently there is no legislation which prevents a director from receiving self employment income from a company in which he is a director however the default position of hmrc 's is that all the payments derived from the are subject to paye in other words it 's possible only invoice from an business or in a consultancy role that 's not directly related to the trade of business but it really depends on the circumstances and the contracts in place sources at forum david at and at   more sources if a person does other work that ’s not related to being a director they may have an employment contract and get employment rights source employment status as director at gov.uk in principle it is possible for an employee or office holder to tender for work with their employer outside their normal duties in circumstances where that individual will not be providing service as an employee or office holder but as a self employed contractor where there is any doubt about whether service is provided constitutes employment or self employment see the employment status manual source section 62 2003 at hmrc

you are not missing something basic   putting money in the bank will cost you in terms of purchasing power   the same thing has been true in the us and other places for a long time now   the real interest rate is negative there is too much aggregate wealth being saved compared to the number of profitable lending opportunities   that means any truly risk free investment will not make as much money as you will lose to inflation    if the real interest rate appears to be positive in your home country it means one of the following is happening capital controls or other barriers are preventing foreigners from investing in your home country keeping the interest rate there artificially high expected inflation is not being measured very accurately in your home country inflation is variable and unpredictable in your home country so investors are demanding high interest rates to compensate for inflation risk   in other words bank accounts are not risk free in your home country if you find any securities that are beating inflation you can bet they are taking on risk   investing in risky securities is fine but just understand that it 's not a substitute for a risk free bank account   part of every interest rate is compensation for the time value of money and the rest is compensation for risk   at present the global time value of money is negative

building tanks and helicopters is the use of the countries economic resources for goods that provide no net benefit to the economy beyond their construction price   if for example the government wanted to stimulate the economy by spending $ 1 trillion on something sure the country 's gdp would by definition increase by $ 1 trillion and there 'd probably be some multiplier effect by those workers now having additional money to spend on other goods   there 's also going to be some negative effects on other sectors of the economy because the prices for labor and raw materials will go up because of the increased demand from the government   if the government is buying $ 100 billion in steel and aluminum you can bet that the spot prices of steel and aluminum is going to jump up squeezing any private industries that need to buy those resources   now the question is what do you spend that $ 1 trillion on to get the biggest bang for your buck   military hardware accomplishes the goal of having something disposable to buy with $ 1 trillion but little additional benefit to the private economy   if you instead spent $ 1 trillion on building infrastructure bridges roads dams pipelines flood control scientific research or education you 've now generated goods that have their own intrinsic value to society beyond their cost whether it be less traffic new scientific discoveries or a more educated workforce

that 's a good point what i should say is that pf does n't lose money on each gym user the way moviepass does my understanding is that moviepass gets a flat subscription fee from each user per month and then whenever a user wants to buy a movie ticket moviepass go out and purchase the movie ticket at full market value the same price that the customer would pay if they just went to the theater and bought one for example if a user pays $ 10 a month for a pass and decide to see two movies in that month they 've already lost money on that customer and two movies in one month is n't really crazy for some of the people who go enough that a monthly pass makes sense   and all this is assuming that ticket prices are lower than the subscription fee where i live the ticket prices are actually a little bit higher if moviepass was here even one movie would make me an unprofitable customer for them looking just at subscriptions of course   the data analytics play is the only viable strategy i can imagine for this i understand that certain business models rely on but i ca n't think of one where each customer that uses the service actually loses the business money

i do n't think anyone can give you a definitive answer without knowing all about your situation but some things to consider if you are on a 1099 you have to pay self employment tax while on a w-2 you do not that is social security tax is 12.4 of your income if you 're a 1099 you pay the full 12.4 if you 're w-2 you pay 6.2 and the employer pays 6.2 so if they offer you the same nominal rate of pay you 're 6.2 better off with the w-2 what sort of insurance could you get privately and what would it cost you i have no idea what the going rates for insurance are in california if you 're all in generally good health you might want to consider a high deductible policy then if no one gets seriously sick you 've saved a bunch of money on premiums if someone does get sick you might still pay less paying the deductible than you would have paid on higher premiums i wo n't go into further details as that 's getting off into another question even if the benefits are poor if there are any benefits at all it can be better than nothing the only advantage i see to going with a 1099 is that if you are legally an independent contractor then all your business expenses are deductible while if you are an employee there are sharp limits on deducting employee business expenses maybe others can think of other advantages if there is some reason to go the 1099 route i understand that setting up an llc is not that hard i 've never done it but i briefly looked into it once and it appeared to basically be a matter of filling out a form and paying a modest fee

yes they 're often a beneficial choice because it means you are earning the interest on the money instead of the government you wo n't necessarily pay taxes on it you have many options once you reach the point of wanting to do something with the money many people accumulate the wealth and then pass it down to subsequent generations without paying tax which is perfectly legal if done right others make donations to charity   those are just a couple examples but the point is that you accumulated the wealth over a long period of time and bought yourself time to decide what to do with it edit no if the investor decides to cash the money out all at once at the end it would not be equivalent assuming you had $ 1,000 to put in an account and could get a 5 return on your money and you were in the 25 tax rate the tax free account ends up with more in the end mostly by virtue of the compounding being tax free

if you have no credit score it is generally far easier and more affordable to establish credit the cheapest way possible which is usually in the form of a small credit card student card if you are a student low credit line unsecured or even secured if you need your local bank credit union will usually be keen to offer you something to start out but you can also apply online to some of the major credit card vendors as always look out for annual fees etc in general trying to get a larger loan to establish credit will cost you a lot as you will not qualify for any legitimate 0 or ultra low apr car loans those are reserved for people with established and generally pretty good credit i expect you 'll find a car loan that will have a lower apr than you could get investing your money otherwise especially if you do not have established excellent credit to simply be a phantom you wo n't find it and even if you could it is more risky than it is worth furthermore if establishing credit is important to you such as for buying a house down the road you can build an excellent credit score without ever having a car loan so you do n't have to buy a car on borrowed money just to hope to get approved for a house some day it 's just not a requirement finally i urge you to make a decision on the best car for you in your situation ignoring the credit score especially if you are more than 3 5 + years away from buying a house everything else about buying a car is more important the actual cost of the car year mileage suitability for your needs gas mileage maintenance and insurance costs etc   then at the very end of your decision making process ensure that buying the car would not put you dangerously low on savings by squeezing your emergency fund decide if you really need a loan or as expensive of a car considering the costs over the expected life of you owning the car or at least the next 2 5 years never get trapped into just thinking about monthly payments which hide the true cost of loans and buying beyond what you can afford to purchase today

to add to 's solid answer i would suggest sitting down and analyzing what your priorities are about paying off the student loan debt versus investing that money immediately regardless the first thing you should do is as michael suggested pay off the credit card debt since it looks like you will be having some new expenses coming up soon rent possibly a new car as part of that you should calculate what your rent and associated bills will cost you on a monthly basis including saving a bit each month and see if you can afford to pay everything without incurring new debt i 'd recommend trying to come up with several scenarios to see how cheaply you can live roommates maybe you can figure out a way to go without a car etc   if for whatever reason you find you ca n't afford everything then i would suggest taking a portion of your inheritance to at least pay off enough of your student loans so that you can afford all of your costs per month and then save or invest the rest you can invest all you like but if you do n't live within your means it wo n't do you any good finally be aware that you may have other factors that come into play that may override financial considerations i found myself in a situation similar to yours and in my case i chose to pay off my debts not because it necessarily made the best financial sense but that because of those other considerations paying off that debt meant i had a significant level of stress removed from my life and a lot more peace of mind

it is not so useful because you are applying it to large capital think about theory of investment value it says that you must find undervalued stocks with whatever ratios and metrics now think about the reality of a company for example if you are waiting ko the coca cola company to be undervalued for buying it it might be a bad idea because ko is already an international well known company and ko sells its product almost everywhere so there are not too many opportunities for growth even if ko ratios and metrics says it 's a good time to buy because it 's undervalued people might not invest on it because ko does n't have the same potential to grow as 10 years ago the best chance to grow is demographics you are better off either buying etfs monthly for many years 10 minimum or find small cap and mid cap companies that have the potential to grow plus their ratios indicate they might be undervalued if you want your investment to work remember this stock price growth is nothing more than you might ask yourself what is your investment profile agressive speculative income dividends capital preservation if you want something not too risky etfs and not waste too much time if you want to get more returns you have to take more risks find small cap and mid companies that are worth i hope i helped you

that is a loaded question but i 'll give it a shot   first things first you need to determine if you are ready to invest in stocks   if you have a lot of high interest debt you would be much better served paying that off before investing in stocks   stocks return around in the long run so you 'd be better off paying off any debt you have that is higher than most people get their start investing in stocks through mutual funds in their 401k or a roth ira   if you want to invest in individual stocks instead of mutual funds then you will need to do a lot of reading and learning you will need a brokerage account or if you have a stock in mind they might have a dividend reinvestment plan drip that you could invest in directly with the company you will have to compare the different brokerage firms to determine which is best for you   since you seem to be internet savvy i suggest you use a discount brokerage that let 's you buy stocks online with cheaper commissions   a good rule of thumb is to keep commissions below 1 of the amount invested once you have your online brokerage account open with money in there the process of actually buying the stock is fairly straightforward   just place an order for the amount of shares you want   that order can be a market order which means the purchase will occur at the current market price   or you can use a limit order where you control at what price your purchase will occur there are lots of good books out there for beginners   personally i learned from the motley fool and last but not least is to have fun with it   learn as much as you can and welcome to the club

$ 15 $ 5 = $ 10 how did you possibly buy a put for less than the intrinsic value of the option at $ so we can infer that you would have had to get this put when the stock price was at least $ but given the 3 months of theta left it was likely above $ 7 the value of the put if the price of the underlying asset the stock abc between $ 5 $ 7 would be somewhere between $ 10 $ 8 at expiration so you do n't really stand to lose much in this scenario and can make a decent gain in this scenario i mean decent if you were trading stocks and were trying to beat the s&p or keep up with warren buffett but a pretty poor gain since you are trading options if the stock moves above $ 7 this is where the put starts to substantially lose value

first step pull a copy of your credit report and score you should monitor that score and do what you can to bring it up your chances are far better if a you first save a sizable downpayment and b go with a local bank that does n't just write the mortgage and sell it better still go to that local bank and inquire about real estate owned by the bank property these are properties they foreclosed on and depending how they are carrying them you might find decent opportunities as a matter of logic a local bank that owns these specific properties as compared to debt pools where big banks have piles of paper owned fractionally are more willing to get a new owner in and paying a new loan   congrats on the new higher income i 'd suggest you first build the emergency fund before the downpayment fund let us know how it goes

i remember in the 19th and early 20th century was the problem of trusts set up by the wealthy to avoid taxes hence the term anti trust that 's not what antitrust means   the trusts in that case were monopolies that used their outsized influence to dominate customers and suppliers   they were n't for tax evasion purposes   trusts were actually older than a permanent income tax   antitrust law was passed around the same time as a permanent income tax becoming legal   prior to that income taxes were temporary taxes imposed to pay for wars    the primary ways to evade taxes was to move expenses out of the personal and into businesses or charities   the business could pay for travel hotels meals and expenses   or a charity could pay for a trip as a promotion activity the infamous safari to africa scheme   charities can pay salaries to employees so someone could fund a charity tax deductible and then use that money to pay people rather than giving gifts   if you declare your house as a historical landmark a charity could maintain it    subscribe to magazines at the office and set them in the waiting room after you read them   use loyalty program rewards from business expenses for personal things   sign up for a benefit for all employees at a steep discount and pay everyone a little less as a result   barter   you do something for someone else e.g. give them a free car and they return the favor   call it marketing or promotion trump is carried away from his tower in a new mercedes benz limousine    another option is to move income and expenses to another tax jurisdiction that has even fewer laws about it   where the united states increasingly cracked down on personal expenses as business expenses many jurisdictions would be happy just to see the money flow through and sit in their banks briefly    tax policy is different now than it was then   many things that would have worked then would n't work now   the irs is more aggressive about insisting that some payments be considered income even if the organization writes the check directly to someone else   it 's unclear what would happen if united states tax rates went back to the level they had in the fifties or even the   would tax evasion become again   or would it stay closer to current levels    the rich actually pay a higher percentage of the overall income taxes now than they did in the and fifties   and the rich in the united states pay a higher percentage of the taxes paid than the rich in other countries with higher marginal rates   some of this may be more rich people in the us than other countries but tax policy is part of that too   high income taxes make it hard to become rich

the only way to hedge a position is to take on a position with a higher multiplier as any counter position such as a 1:1 inverse etf will merely cancel out the etf it is meant to hedge yielding a negative return roughly in the amount of fees slippage for true risk aversion continually selling the shortest term available covered calls is the only free lunch   a suboptimal version the cboe index has outperformed its underlying with lower volatility the second best way is to continually hedge positions with long puts but this can become very tax complicated since the hedged positions need to be rebalanced continually and expensive depending on option liquidity the ideal assuming no taxes and infinite liquidity is to sell covered calls when implied volatility is high and buy puts when implied volatility is low

there is no catch you 've been a good customer and your bank wants to reward you for it one of the ways you build credit is by having more credit available so by increasing your credit limit its lowering your credit utilization rate one of the factors that go into your credit score which is a good thing so your bank trusts you with more credit which again is a good thing you can also request a line of credit increase yourself without waiting for the bank to do so but there 's a 6 month wait between each increase assuming you get one i always ask every 6 months and have gotten approved each time and it 's helped my credit score tremendously

investing is always a matter of balancing risk vs reward with the two being fairly strongly linked   risk free assets generally keep up with inflation if that these days advice is that even in retirement you 're going to want something with better for at least part of your portfolio a whole market strategy is a reasonable idea but not well defined you need to decide how to weight stocks vs bonds for example and short long term and you may want international or reit in the mix again the question is how much again the tradeoff is trying to decide how much volatility and risk you are comfortable with and picking a mix which comes in somewhere around that point and noting which assets tend to move out of with each other stock bond is the classic example to help tune that the recommendation for higher risk return when you have a longer horizon before you need the money comes from being able to tolerate more volatility early on when you have less at risk and more time to let the market recover that lets you take a more aggressive position and on average higher returns over time you generally want to dial that back in the direction of lower risk if not risk free so a late blip does n't cause you to lose too much of what you 've already gained but see above re risk free that 's the theoretical answer the practical answer is that running various strategies against both historical data and statistical simulations of what the market might do in the future suggests some specific distributions among the categories i 've mentioned do seem to work better than others the mix i use which is basically a whole market with weighting factors for the categories mentioned above was the result of starting with a general mix appropriate to my risk tolerance based on historical data then checking it by running about 100 monte carlo simulations of the market for the next 50 years

the basic theoretical reason for a company to return money to shareholders is that the company does n't need the money for its own purposes e.g. investment or working capital so instead of the company just keeping it in the bank it hands it back so that shareholders can do what they think fit e.g. investing it elsewhere in some cases particularly private equity deals you see companies actively borrowing money to payout to shareholders on the grounds that they can do so cheaply enough that it will improve overall shareholder returns the trade off with this kind of leveraging up is that it usually makes the business more risky and every so often you see it go wrong e.g. after an economic downturn it may still be a rational thing to do but i 'd look at that kind of proposal very carefully in this case i think things are quite different the company has sold a valuable asset and has spare cash it 's already going to use some of the money to reduce debt so it does n't seem like the company is becoming more risky overall if the management is recommending it i would support it as you say the share consolidation seems like just a technical measure and you might as well also support that i think they want to make their share price seem stable over time to people who are looking at it casually and wo n't be aware of the payout otherwise it 'd suddenly drop by and might give the impression the company had some bad news the plan is to essentially cancel one share worth for every payout they make on 16 shares since = payout this should leave the share price broadly unchanged

i 've lived in a few shared houses in my time one house had one unemployed guy two students and two of us earning very little we had individual rental agreements with the landlord so if one of us missed a few payments they 'd be liable for eviction without affecting the others to be honest i 've not heard of this arrangement elsewhere every other rental agreement i had we signed a joint contract i 've had to pay housemates bills a couple of times to avoid a judgement against us and it was a pain getting my money back and strained our friendship i 'm still owed a few hundred that i 'll never see again in general if you ca n't trust your housemates to pay their bills you 're probably better off looking for somewhere else to live

first and foremost you must remember that they are people something i do n't think you have trouble with but others might when dealing with increasingly desperate financial struggles it 's not uncommon to allow financial trouble to define you or for others to see you only as poor money is a human creation it 's not real like fire or water and money problems is a misnomer whatever problems they have money is only one symptom often dealing with those deeper human problems such as lack of confidence depression fear or behavioral issues is the key to correcting downstream problems like poor money management not that learning how to manage money is n't important but it does n't sound like that is the primary issue in this case westerners tend to view money trouble as distinct from other problems the answer to money troubles is often understood to be more money or smarter money earn more or spend better it helps to step back and look beyond finances what 's going in their lives how does that make them feel do they feel unimportant or valueless how 's their family life do they have good emotional support or are they running on empty trying to fill the with other things like games for example simply telling them to stop purchasing games for example without finding a better replacement just the feelings of shame and discovering the deeper elements of your friends situation is much more complicated than giving them money or paying for a financial counselor neither of which are bad things but it may make a tremendous difference not just in your friends bank account but in their lives as well my wife and i have experienced all of this first hand so i know the predicament you are in we 've even had people in tough financial situations live in our home with us in all the situations in which we 've been close enough to understand context money was n't the primary issue it 's always been something else more often than not family but not always i 've found the book when helping hurts helpful for gaining some perspective though it 's not a perfect match since it deals more with poverty on a grand scale you may still find it helpful in terms of general principles but ultimately each situation is going to be unique and no one size fits all strategy exists to solve all problems in the end building a deeper relationship is the best path toward finding a long term solution

well it 's directly depositing money in your account but direct deposit is something completely different direct deposits are most commonly made by businesses in the payment of salaries and wages and for the payment of suppliers accounts but the facility can be used for payments for any purpose such as payment of bills taxes and other government charges direct deposits are most commonly made by means of electronic funds transfers effected using online mobile and telephone banking systems but can also be effected by the physical deposit of money into the payee 's bank account thus since the purpose of dd is to eliminate checks i 'd say no depositing cash directly into your account does not count as the requirement for one direct deposit within 90 days

i would say you are typical   the way people are able to build their available credit then subsequently build their average balances is buy building their credit score   according to fico your credit score is made up as follows given that you had no history and only new credit you are pretty much lacking in all areas   what the typical person does is get a card pay on it for 6 months and assuming good history will either get an automatic bump or they can request a credit limit increase credit score has nothing to do with wealth or income   so even if you had 100 k in the bank you would likely still be facing the same issue   the bank that holds the money might make an exception it is very easy to see how a college student can build to 2000 or more   they start out with a $ 200 balance to a department store and in about 6 months they get a real cc with a 500 balance and one to a second department store   given at least a decent payment history that limit could easily increase above 2500 and there could be more then one card open    along the lines of what littleadv says the companies even welcome some late payments   the fees are more lucrative and they can bump the interest rate   all is good as long as the payments are made getting students and children involved with credit cards is a goal of the industry   they can obtain an emotional attachment that goes beyond good business reasoning

ucla is not a bad place to be school wise you will be pretty much limited to applying to the la and possibly sf offices of any bb bank or relevant mms but for those la positions in particular you will get a fair look so your institution is respected   your experience also seems to be decent especially considering you spent time at a community college it all matters how you market it be humble but do n't sell yourself short do n't claim you founded yahoo but also give an honest view of what you did you can be proud of founding a distribution company and learning the business practices that go hand in hand with that both on your resume and in any interviews you may have discuss how your experiences in that role will help you be a better intern and in the future a better analyst mostly intangibles skills you learned etc the same goes for the other position although the wealth management position probably has more applicable skills so do n't sell yourself too short in that department just lend an appropriate level of importance to the positions you 've held do n't overstate your positions but also give yourself credit for what you 've learned and what you 've done   as far as your performance at ucla so far and gpa that might be a concern but i think you can overcome it with enough work on your part during recruiting i assumed your story from high school through community college and to ucla is a fairly challenging one it likely involved some financial hardships and a good deal of adversity most importantly it probably took a lot of and hard work on your part to get to where you are now if you can convey that during interviews without sounding like a you can likely overcome any downside to not having a gpa clearly you were able to get to ucla from a tough starting point which demonstrates the combination of hard work and intelligence that a gpa is meant to convey and which banks look for in applicants additionally interviews occur in january so you will have one semester 's worth of work to show for it by then and when interviews come around you 'll be able to the story of your journey to ucla to your first semester gpa to lend some credibility to your historical successes   now a lot of what i 've said is contingent on you getting to an interview before that stage it is hard to sell the merits of your alternative path to ucla and to the interview on paper you have the cover letter to make brief mention of those things but the cover letter is far too short a medium through which to convey the entire story so getting yourself into the interview is the most important step you have to take at this point once you get your foot in the door and get a few first rounds you 'll be able to let your shine and show them the merits of the path you 've   an important step of getting the interview will be networking everyone on here says just go network which is really vague and does n't help anyone especially because it is the most of all collegiate finance buzzwords you should contact specifically two groups of people alumni working in the banks you are interested in apply for and the bank hr representatives for your school you ought to talk to the ucla career services people as soon as you can and get names of ucla graduates who work at the banks you 're interested in career services also ought to have the names of the relevant hr representatives both the employees at these banks and the hr recruiters will have an important voice in who gets interviews so make sure you talk to both of them you should be and ask about the bank and the experiences those you talk to have had but you can also try to creatively in details about your story i.e. when talking to someone you could bring up concerns about getting looked at because of your background and then ask whoever you 're speaking with what you can do to overcome that it should always be phrased as a question so as to avoid seeming as if you 're trying to sell yourself or brag during any informational calls the purpose of the calls should be to talk about the bank and the job so try as best you can to work in limited mention of yourself unless specifically asked and focus the discussion on the employee recruiter and not yourself   you should also work to learn all the finance information you 'll need for the job being that you have a finance background and limited academic credentials you will be asked extensive financial information questions if not during any informational calls definitely during first round interviews your knowledge of and commitment to a financial job is uncertain due to your academic background so people will ask you basic to slightly more advanced financial analysis questions to see where your competency is at study up in the vault guide with a particular focus on the fields you will be applying for understand dcf lbo m&amp;a accretion dilution and financial statement analysis primarily for ib internships learn specifics for other roles equity research may require more equity specific stuff cap markets will be similar to ib as listed above will be less specific prep and more fast math prepare a stock pitch of some sort as well in case they ask you for one and pick something obscure ish so that it wo n't be too closely scrutinized stock pitch will come up randomly in interviews and specifically if you apply to equity research   in that same vain of thought you should also think a bit about what group you want to apply to at these banks its good you have an interest in finance and in banking but there are a lot of facets to the banking industry which you could pursue traditional investment banking capital markets sales and trading equity research asset management to name a few some are easier to wedge you way into others harder i have them listed in rough order of difficulty from hardest to easiest above you can usually apply to a couple of different groups at each bank so take advantage of that and definitely apply to multiple groups talk to multiple groups network with multiple groups and try to spread yourself around and get as many interviews as possible   tl;dr you 've got a decent product for sale here but you 'll need to polish up you pitch and learn financial skills to back up the story and prove you 're competent and serious to an interviewers while you do that reach out to ucla alumni in the banking industry and the hr recruiters for the banks to get your name in front of people and work toward securing a first round interview networking in this way is going to be the most important part of recruitment for you over the next 3 5 months

if i buy property when the market is in a downtrend the property loses    value but i would lose money on rent anyway so as long i 'm viewing    the property as housing expense i would be ok this is a bit too rough an analysis   it all depends on the numbers you plug in   let 's say you live in the boston area and you buy a house during a downtrend at $   two years later you need to sell it and the best you can get is $   you are down $ 70k and you are also out two years of property taxes maintenance insurance mortgage interest maybe etc   say that 's another $ 10k a year so you are down $ 70k + $ 20k = $ 90k   it 's probably more than that but let 's go with it in those same two years you could have been living in a fairly nice apartment for $   in that scenario you are out $ 2k 24 months = $ 48k and that 's it   it 's a difference of $ 90k $ 48k = $ 42k in two years   that 's sizable if i wanted to sell and upgrade to a larger property the larger    property would also be cheaper in the downtrend yes the general rule is   if you have to spend your money on a purchase it 's best to buy when things are low so you maximize your value    however if the market is in an uptrend selling the property would    gain me more than what i paid but larger houses would also have    increased in price but it may not scale   when you jump to a much larger more expensive house you can think of it as buying 1.5 houses   that extra 0.5 of a house is a new purchase and if you buy when prices are high relative to other economic indicators like salaries and rents you are not doing as well as when you buy when they are low    do both of these scenarios negate the pro cons of buying in either    market i do n't think so   i think in general buying more house either going from an apartment to a house or from a small house to a bigger house when housing is cheaper is favorable   houses are goods like anything else and when supply is high after overproduction of them and demand is low during bad economic times deals can be found relative to other times when the opposite applies or during housing bubbles    the other point is as with any trend you only know the future of the trend after it passes   you do n't know if you are buying at anything close to the bottom of a trend though you can certainly see it is lower than it once was    in terms of practical matters if you are going to buy when it 's up you hope you sell when it 's up too this graph of historical inflation adjusted housing prices is helpful to that point   let me just say that if i bought in the latest boom i sure hope i sold during that boom too

the 2 months extension is automatic you just need to tell them that you 're using it by attaching a statement to the return as pete mentioned in the comments from the irs pub 54 how to get the extension    to use this automatic extension you must attach a statement to your return explaining which of the two situations listed earlier qualified you for the extension   the regular 6 months extension though is granted automatically upon request so if you can not make it by june deadline you should file the form 4868 to request a further extension automatic 6-month extension    if you are not able to file your return by the due date you generally can get an automatic 6-month extension of time to file but not of time to pay to get this automatic extension you must file a paper form 4868 or use irs e file electronic filing for more information about filing electronically see e file options later   keep in mind that the due date is still april 15th 18th this year so the 6-month extension pushes it back to october previous extension    if you can not file your return within the automatic extension period you generally can get an additional 4 months to file your return for a total of 6 months the period and the 6-month period start at the same time you have to request the additional 4 months by the new due date allowed by the extension   you can ask an additional 2 months extension this is no longer automatic to push it further to december see the publication these are extension to file not to pay with the form 4868 you 're also expected to submit a payment that will cover your tax liability at least in the ballpark the interest is pretty low less than 1 right now but there 's also a penalty which may be pretty substantial if you do n't pay enough by the due date see the irs tax topic there are safe harbor rules to avoid the penalty

in the other question the op had posted a screenshot circa 2010 from transunion with suggestions on how to improve the op 's credit score   one of these suggestions was to obtain retail revolving accounts   by this they are referring to credit accounts from a particular retail store   stores have been offering credit accounts for many years and today this usually takes the form of a store credit card   the credit card does not have the visa or mastercard logo on it and is only valid at that particular store   for example target has their own credit card that only works at target stores   the revolving part simply means that it is an open account that you can continue to make new charges and pay off as opposed to a fixed retail financing loan such as you might get at a high end furniture store where you obtain a loan for a single piece of furniture and when it is paid off the account is closed the formula for credit scores are proprietary secrets   however i have n't read anything that indicates that a store credit card helps your credit score more than a standard credit card   i suspect that transunion was offering this tip in an attempt to give the consumer more ideas of how to add credit cards to their account that the consumer might not have thought of   but it is possible that buried deep in the credit score formula there is something in there that gives you a higher score if you have a store credit card as an aside the op in the other question had a credit score of and was trying to make it higher   in my opinion this is pointless   remember that the financial services industry has an incentive to sell you as much debt as possible and so all of their advice will point to you getting more credit accounts and getting more in debt

this answer is better served as a comment but i do n't have enough rep   it is not guaranteed that they do not accrue interest while you are a full time student some student loans can capitalize the interest before pursuing leveraged investing be sure that your student loan is not capitalizing capitalized interest capitalized interest is a second reason your loan may end up costing    more than the amount you originally borrowed interest starts to accrue grow from the day your loan is disbursed    sent to you or your school at certain points in time when your    separation or grace period ends or at the end of forbearance or    deferment your unpaid interest may capitalize that means it is added    to your loan ’s current principal from that point your interest will    now be calculated on this new amount that ’s capitalized interest capitalized interest if you accrue interest while you are in school as with direct    unsubsidized unsubsidized direct and plus loans and    private loans you will have capitalized interest if it is unpaid    unpaid accrued interest is added to the principal amount of your loan    after you leave school and finish any applicable grace period simply put there will be interest to be paid on both the principal of    the loan and on the interest that has already accumulated to minimize the effects of the capitalized interest on the amount you    will pay overall you can pay the interest during college instead of    waiting until after graduation that way you start with the original    principal balance minus any fees when you begin repayment

if i understand correctly the traditional ira if you have 401k with an employer already has the following features actually 1 and 2 are characteristics of roth iras not traditional iras only 3 is a characteristic of a traditional ira whether you have a 401(k with your employer or not makes absolutely no difference in how your iras are taxed for the vast majority of people the rules for iras are different if you have a very high income though you 're allowed to have and contribute to both kinds of accounts in fact i personally have both traditional iras are tax deferred not tax free as people sometimes mistakenly call them they 're very different meaning that you do n't have to pay taxes on the contributions or profits you make inside the account e.g. from dividends interest profits from stock you sell etc rather you pay taxes on any money you withdraw for roth iras the contributions are taxed but you never have to pay taxes on the money inside the account again that means that any money you get over and above the contributions e.g. through interest trading profits dividends etc are genuinely tax free also if you leave any of the money to people they do n't have to pay any taxes either important point there are no tax free retirement accounts in the u.s. the distinction between different kinds of iras basically boils down to pay now or pay later many people make expensive mistakes in their retirement strategy by not understanding that point please note that this applies equally to traditional and roth 401(k)s as well you can have roth 401(k)s and traditional 401(k)s just like you can have roth iras and traditional iras the same terminology and logic applies to both kinds of accounts as far as i know there are n't major differences tax wise between them with two exceptions you 're allowed to contribute more money to a 401(k per year and you 're allowed to have a 401(k even if you have a high income by way of contrast people with very high incomes generally are n't allowed to open iras a primary advantage of a traditional ira is that you can in theory at least afford to contribute more money to it due to the tax break you 're getting also you can defer taxes on any profits you make e.g. through dividends or selling stock at a profit so you can grow your money faster

for your first question the general guidelines i 've seen recommended are as follows as to your second question portfolio management is something you should familiarize yourself with   if you trust it to other people do n't be surprised when they make mistakes   remember they get paid regardless of whether you make money   consider how much any degree of risk will affect you   when starting out your contributions make up most of the growth of your accounts now is the time when you can most afford to take higher risk for higher payouts still limiting your risk as much as possible of course   a 10 loss on a portfolio of $ 50k can be replaced with a good year 's contributions   once your portfolio has grown to a much larger sum it will be time to dial back the risk and focus on preserving your capital    when choosing investments always treat your as a whole including non retirement assets other investment accounts savings even your house   do n't put too many eggs from every account into the same basket or you 'll find that 30 of your is a single investment   also consider that some investments have different tax consequences and you can leverage the properties of each account to offset that

insurance is for events that are both and unexpected and for many people catastrophic events are for example sickness disability death car accidents house fires and for which you may buy health disability life auto home and renter 's insurance   it may be catastrophic for a family relying on a very old earner for that earner to die and you can buy life insurance up to a very old age but the premiums will reflect the likelihood of someone of that age dying within the covered period   the more expected an event is the more anything referred to as insurance is actually forced savings health insurance with no copays on regular checkups expects the insured to use them so the cost of those checkups plus a profit for the insurance company is factored into the premiums ahead of time   a wooden pencil breaking may be unexpected regardless of no one buys insurance on wooden as the loss of a pencil is not catastrophic what is catastrophic can be context dependent health care needs are typically as you do n't know when you 'll get sick for a billionaire needing health care while the situation would not be catastrophic and the billionaire can easily self insure his or her health to the same extent as most caps offered by health insurance companies if you 're on a fixed budget buying a laptop if it unexpectedly failed that would be catastrophic to you so budgeting in the cost of insurance or an extended warranty while buying your laptop would probably make sense especially if you need that $ 2000 laptop spending an extra 17.5 would safeguard against you having to come out of pocket and depleting your savings to replace it even though that brings you to a grand total of $ before taxes however if you 're in that tight of a situation i would strongly recommend you to find a less expensive option that would allow you to self insure if you found a used laptop for much less i can even see apple selling macs for less than $ 1000 you might decide that your budget allows you to self insure and you could profit from being careful with your hardware and resolving to cover any issues with it yourself

to your secondary question appropriately consider all estimated numbers involved with keeping the house compared to your closest estimate of what the home could sell for weigh out the pros and cons yourself as a stranger will not be able to 100 appreciate what you value and dislike   remember to include insurances taxes and the actual mortgage payment depending on how you also plan to rent out the property include whichever utilities you intend to cover if any   there will also be costs for property management and upkeep as things will break overtime and tenants will not hesitate to get you or your management to fix them either way that means you are paying i would also keep in mind while homes typically appreciate in value there is a higher risk with tenants for the value to depreciate to damages and poor upkeep   there are increased legal risks to renting so be sure you have properly vetted whichever management you are going with   in extreme circumstances you also could be required to retain an attorney to defend yourself again litigation because whichever management team you hire will most likely defend themselves and not include you in that umbrella   my family lives in the la area as well and a judge refused to throw out an obvious frivolous suit when my parents attempted to rent out a house   the possible renters after signing the main paperwork never showed to finish a second set of documents for renting   parents immediately declined to rent to these people as they missed something so important without any explanation and they sued claiming racism emotional damages and some other really crazy things despite my parents never having met them first meeting was between property management and renters only personally and professionally i would only suggest renting our the place and not selling if you can turn a profit after all the above mentioned costs if renters are only paying to keep the property in the black you have yourself a non earning asset which will be damaged over time and require repairs which will come out of your pocket   also while the property is you also must remember it is not earning at that time much of this may sound obvious etc i simply wish to provide my family 's experience to help you in making your decisions    best of luck with your endeavor edit   also you will be required to report all earned rental income on your taxes they will fall under the schedule e and possibly k-1 area   i would strongly recommend consulting with an actual accountant about the impacts to you

kid you need to start thinking in thresholds there are several monetary thresholds that separate your class from a more well funded class 1 you can not use margin with less than $ 2000 dollars brokers require that you have at least $ 2000 before they will lend to you 2 in 2010 congress banned under 21 year olds from getting access to credit unless they get cosigned this means that even if you have $ 2000 no broker will give you margin unless you have a good credit history already there was a good reason for this but its based on the assumption that everyone is stupid not the assumption that some people are objective thinkers 3 the brokers that will open an account for you have high commissions the commissions are so high that it will destroy any capital gains you may make with your $ 1000 for the most part 4 the pattern day trader rule you can not employ sophisticated risk management while being subject to the pattern day trader rule it basically limits you from trading 3 times a day its more complicated than that read it yourself if you have less than $ 25,000 in one account 5 non trade or stock related investments buy municipal or treasury bonds they will give you more than a savings account would and are tax free this is n't exactly what i would call liquid though ie if you wanted to access your money to invest in something else on a whim 6 what are you studying if its anything technical then you might get a good idea that you could risk your money on to create value but i would stick to high growth stocks before blowing your $ 1000 on an idea that s not exactly what i would call access to capital 7 arbitrage lets say you know a friend that buys the trendy collectors shoes at discount and sells them for a profit he might do this with one $ 200 pair of tennis shoes and then use the $ 60 profit different to go buy video games for himself if he wanted to scale up he could n't because he never has more than $ 200 to play with in comparison you could do 5 pairs $ 200 x 5 and immediately have a larger operation than him making a larger profit $ 60 x 5 = $ 300 now you have $ 1300 and could do it again with 6 pairs to make an even great er profit not because you are better or worked at it but solely because you have more capital to start with keep an eye out for arbitrage opportunities usually there is a good reason they exist if you notice it the market is too small and illiquid to scale up with or the entire market will be saturated the next day efficient market theory learn about it 8) take everything i just taught you and make a small investor newsletter website with subscribers online sites have low overhead costs

in the case of wells fargo i believe that free trading is linked to your overall banking relationship with the firm so if you have a checking account with a balance of $ x or   a total relationship with the bank relationship is usually defined as loan balances + deposit balances over a certain amount they give you a like free stock trades the theory behind this approach is that banks want to be a one stop shop for you the idea is that they can market the banks products to you over a period of years lowering customer acquisition cost and offer you a level of convenience that allows them to charge a premium for services for example many people will pay a rate or fee premium on a mortgage or car loan so that they can do all of their business in one place in other cases free trading is linked to marketing campaigns by funds charles schwab started this with the no transaction fee mutual fund store many years ago transaction fees are actually paid for by the mutual funds who pay for placement in the program free etf trade programs are similar

start with the list of mortgage companies approved to work in your area there are 80 within 10 miles of my house and more than 100 in my county pick ones you know because they are established businesses in your area region or even nationally    a good place to start might be with your current lender the risk you seem to be worried about is a scam or a trick in the recent past the scams were ones where the home owner did n't understand teaser rates and the risk of interest only and pick your payment loans the simpler the bells and the less likely you are to be on a risky transaction it ca n't hurt to ask an organization like the bbb or neighbors but realize that many people loved their exotic mortgage until the moment it blew up in their face so for 5 years your neighbor would have about their new mortgage until they discovered how underwater they were   regarding how the transaction is accomplished is hard to predict there is great variation in the quality of the loan officers so a great company can have employees unless you can get a recommendation for a specific employee it is hard know if your loan officer is going to give great service    when getting a mortgage for a purchase the biggest risk is getting a mortgage that results in a payment you ca n't afford this is less of a risk with a refinance because you already have a mortgage and monthly payment but keep in mind some of the monthly savings is due to stretching out the payments for another 30 years know what you are trying to do with the refinance because the streamlined ones ca nt be used for cash out

left out of course is the fact that this is argentina 's default because its policymakers are complete and the fact that instead of not paying anybody by complying with the ruling it could probably have struck a deal with to pay them the principal and interest or a bit less if they were decent negotiators by waiting until december when a bond clause expires that states argentina ca n't willingly pay less to some creditors than others the blame is n't all argentina 's but there 's a reason why this sort of stuff does n't happen in literally any other country in latin america on such a regular basis

also almost by definition rebalancing involves making more trades    than you would have otherwise would n't the additional trading fees    you incurred in doing so reduce the benefits of this strategy you forgot to mention taxes rebalancing does or rather can incur costs one way to minimize the costs is to use the parts of the portfolio that have essentially zero cost of moving these generally are the funds in your retirement accounts in the united states they can be in iras or 401ks they can be regular or roth selling winners withing the structure of the plan does n't trigger capital gains taxes and many have funds within them that have zero loads   another way to reduce trading fees is to only rebalance once a year or once every two years or by setting a limit on how far out of balance for example do n't rebalance at to get back to 60/40 even if it has been two years   given that the ratio of investments is often rather arbitrary to begin    with how do i know whether i 'm selling high and buying low or just    sticking with a losing asset ratio the ratio used in an example or in an article may be arbitrary but your desired ratio is n't arbitrary you selected the ratio of your investments based on several criteria your age your time horizon your goals for the money how comfortable you are with risk as these change during your investing career those ratios would also but they are n't arbitrary   these decisions to rebalance are separate from the ones to sell a particular investment you could sell computer company x because of how it is performing and buy stock in technology company y because you think it has a better chance of growing that transaction would not be a re balancing selling part of your stock in domestic company a to buy stock in international company b would be part of a re balancing

h1b visas are not terrible and i am not against all h1b visas however it is a bald faced lie to suggest the number 1 if not only reason companies use them is to cut labor costs these companies are not advertising they could have hired local talent but chose to provide the job to someone from a poorer region   i think whatever city everybody in the world wants to work or go to school like tokyo or london or paris or boston that is going to have the world 's best talent also if those people go back to their they do n't bring with them the ideas from the city they worked or but rather the best ideas from all over the world   that is n't at all what is happening in technology there are plenty of computer science and electrical engineer majors in the usa out of work and some making six figures with a bs degree and 3 years experience but so many are out of work many of those jobs were outsourced but the talent used was so poor the cost to upkeep or update was so expensive that many companies brought back the jobs to the usa those companies still want to hire the same low cost workers but want them working in the usa for reasons i will spare here the usa talent pool is so full and jobs so scarce it drives down wages not actually because what really happens in the company is toxic to work for and demands 16 hour days 7 days a week for the same great salary that may have once been 40 hours a week with fun and entertainment and space and a gym on site etc   stopping h1b visas would force companies to bring back their on site gyms large break rooms increase work life balance etc   stopping h1b visas mean a lot of billion dollar tech companies would have to pay their shareholders and executives less this year than last year which is outrageous in the race to the bottom

first do n't owe much money on a car that 's out of warranty   if you have an engine blow up and repairs will cost the lion 's share of the car 's value the entire car loan immediately comes due because the collateral is now worthless   this puts you in a very miserable situation because you must pay off the car suddenly while also securing other transportation   second watch for possible early payment penalties   they are cheaper than paying interest but run the numbers   their purpose is to repay the lender the amount of money they already paid out to the dealer in sales commission or kickback for referring the loan   the positive effects you want for your credit report only require an open loan owing more money does n't help it hurts   however interest is proportional to principal owed so a $ 10,000 car loan is 10 times the interest cost of a $ 1000 car loan   that means paying most of it off early can fulfill your purpose as the car is nearer payoff you can reduce costs further assuming you handle the hit by increasing the deductible on collision and comprehensive fire and theft auto insurance   it 's not just you paying more co pay it also means the insurance company does n't have to deal with smaller claims at all e.g. with a $ 1000 files a claim on an $ 800 repair   if the amount you owe is small compared to its value and within $ 1000 2000 of paid off the lender may be ok with you dropping collision and comprehensive coverage altogether assuming you are   all of this adds up to paying most of it off but not all may be the way to go you could also talk to your lender about paying say 3/4 of it off and refinancing the rest as a 12-month deal

the reason they have this massive debt is largely not entirely because they have been employing keynes policies and spending more than they had for so many years as it is austerity is not the solution however reckless spending is not the solution either a lot of people arguing for keynesian policies not a bad idea in most recessions do n't grasp that investors have a limited amount of money to invest and are n't going to place it in a country that has as bad of a debt problem as you pointed out   so many people keep arguing these struggling countries need to spend more while that would help expand their economies it is not feasible where do you guys going to think the money is going to come from if investors do n't want to provide then they have to print more money which creates the risk of hyperinflation   spending could help a little maybe if it was a realistic thing to do right now any keynesian solutions are a fairy tale countries like greece need to do what they can with the resources available to them instead of spending like a bunch of millionaire on crystal meth look at the u.s. we have spent trillions and our gdp is still growing at only slightly more than half the rate it has from 2012 if people expect massive government spending to be a fix to these problems then we are a clear case that it is n't i acknowledge we could be a lot worse and possibly still be seeing a contraction without the spending but it clearly is n't fixing our problems and sooner or later we wo n't be able to take on more debt to fix it we need real solutions to generate real growth instead of dicking around like this other western countries need to do the same   edit also what we are doing right now would not be considered keynesian solutions keynes would advocate spending money to fix the problems not just dumping money into the economy that is something i would agree with but since our politicians ca n't grasp that i do n't want them in control of the purse strings anymore

the car company loans you money at 1 or 2 because it is part of the incentive to get you to buy the car   car company transactions are complex involving the manufacturer the dealership and the financing part of the car company not to mention rebates the used car transaction and the leasing department if they do n't offer you a loan then the profit from that part of transaction is lost to an outside company the better loan rates from the manufacturer are only with shorter term loans and without the rebate that is why some suggest that you get the rebate and then go to a credit union for the loan for lowest overall cost and greatest flexibility the advertised rates are also only for the customers with great credit scores and the room in their clash flow to pay off the loan in a year or two if you do n't fit in that category the rates will be higher

because an equity option can be constructed at essentially any price by two willing counterparties on an exchange there are not enough to represent the entire i.e. infinite option chain for even a single stock on a single expiration date   as a result are not generated for each individual possible options contract   instead the isin is used only to refer to the underlying symbol and a separate formula is used to refer to the specific option contract for that symbol so that code you pasted is not an isin but rather the standard us equity option naming scheme that you need to provide in addition to the isin when talking to your broker note that and formulas for referring to option contracts in other countries can behave quite differently   also there are many countries and markets that do n't need because the products in question only exist on a single exchange   in those cases the exchange is pretty much free to make up whatever id scheme it wants p.s. now i 'm curious how option chains are identified for strike prices above $   i looked up the only stock i can think of that trades above that price brk.a but it does n't seem to have an option chain or at least google does n't show it

you might have to pay a premium for the stocks on the dividend tax free exchanges for example hsbc on the nyse yields versus hsbc on the lse which yields only assuming the shares are truly identical the only reason for this aside from market fluctuations is if the taxes are more favorable in the uk versus the us thus increasing demand for hsbc on the lse raising the price and reducing the yield a difference of 0.15 in yield is pretty insignificant relative to a 30 versus 0 dividend tax but a key question is does your country have a foreign tax credit like the us does if so you usually end up getting that 30 back just delayed until you get your tax return and the question of which exchange to buy on becomes not so clear cut if your country does n't have such a tax credit then yes you 'll want to buy on an exchange where you wo n't get hit with the dividend tax note that i got this information from a great article i read several months back site requires free registration to see it all unfortunately they discuss the case of un versus both on the nyse but adrs for unilever in the netherlands and the uk respectively the logic is very similar to your situation

you do n't seem to have any particular question to be answered your understanding of rrsps seems to be very good   have you considered whether you might be better off putting your retirement savings into a tfsa instead both types can protect your growth from taxation provided you reinvest the refund from the rrsp the main way in which the rrsp is better than tfsa is that you can pay the tax on the contribution at a time when your income is lower and thus have a lower marginal tax rate most people retire with a lower income than during their earning years but it 's a matter of tax brackets if you think you 'll be in the same bracket same marginal tax rate when you retire then the tfsa and rrsp work out even in that regard so in your case the question you want to ask yourself is when i retire will i have an income including cpp oas pension payments etc that exceeds $ worth of today 's dollars if so your rrsp holds no advantage over the tfsa in fact the rrsp may even be worse since the withdrawals count as income and reduce the amount of oas and perhaps payments that the government gives you at least under current regulations if you 're unsure i suggest you try this calculator from that runs both scenarios and helps you see which one is more beneficial it even factors in the oas

not going to happen anytime soon these old wo n't go down without a bitter fight that will make us really hate them for a while longer   new media e.g. netflix youtube hulu still requires an internet connection as it stands the avenue to get connected to these services still goes through cable companies e.g. time warner comcast cox or through telecom companies e.g. att and verizon    the first step these antiquated orgs will pull is putting caps on our internet usage this will take the floor right from under online video services which have worked off an all you can eat broadband model   right now caps are at something like 100 250 gb which seems like a lot but imagine you replace your entire cable consumption with online consumption plus add in any other internet activity like games and downloads 250 gb may be a bit closer than you think   moreover isps are moving to lower the caps on internet usage probably around 50 gb which limits us even further on online media consumption   so because they can not compete with these services they aim to stop us entirely from using them bully tactics not good business through and innovation   they think by doing this they will drive consumers back to their traditional services time will tell if the masses will play into their hand or actually shape demand for a non restrictive non cable sourced isp should such a service arise cable companies are pretty much dead in the next 5 10 years   as it stands we still require cable companies to deliver our content the battle between old media and new media will be hard fought and we the consumers stand to get the brunt of this battle for a while longer

govt debt and money printing is nothing to the amount of debt in circulation in the private sector 41 trillion   it was the private sector that created the inflation and bubbles      giving students 1 to pay off all student loans is n't inflationary it would be deflationary   because the banks created the credit out of thin air to lend to the students for college if you pay it back it closes the circuit    govt would have 1 in debt but that 's nothing only a dollars    it can get paid back in tax revenue from economic recovering by the private sector no longer burdened by debt

wow you guys get really cheap finance here a mortage is 5.5 9 and car loans about 15 20 anyway back to the question the rule is reduce the largest interest rate first the most expensive money for 0 loans you should try to never pay it off it 's literally free money so just pay only the absolute minimum on 0 loans   pass it to your estate and try to get your kids to do the same   in fact if you have 11,000 and a $ 20,000 0 loan and you have the option you 're better to put the 11,000 into a safe investment system that returns > 0 and just use the interest to pay off the $ 20k the method of paying off the numerically smallest debt first called snowballing is generally aimed at the general public and for when you ca n't make much progress to week   thus it is best to get the lowest hanging fruit that shows progress than to try and have years worth of hard discipline just to make a tiny progress   it 's called snowballing because after paying off that first debt you keep your lifestyle the same and put the freed up money on as extra payments to the next target   generally this is only worth while if 1 you have poor discipline 2 the interest gap is n't too disparate eg 5 and 25 it is far better to pay off the 25 3 you do n't go out and immediately renew the lower debt   also as mentioned snowballing is aimed at small regular payments   you can do it with a lump sum but honestly for a lump sum you can get better return taking it off the most expensive interest rate first as the discipline issue does n't apply another consideration is put it off the most renewable finance   paying off your car so your car 's paid off   if you have an emergency on that asset means a new loan   but if you put it off the house conditional on interest rates not being to dissimilar it means you can often redraw some or all of the money if you have an emergency   this can often be better than paying down the car and then having to pay application fees to get a new unsecured loan    many modern banks actually use mortgage offsetting which allows them to do this you can keep your lump sum in a standard or even fixed term and the value of it is deducted as if you 'd paid it off your mortgage   so you get the benefit without the commitment   the bank is contracted for the length of the mortgage to a third party financier so they really do n't want you to change your end of the arrangement   and there is the hope you might spend it to giving them a few more dollars   but this can be very helpful especially if you 're financing stuff because it keeps the mortgage costs down but makes you look liquid for your investment borrowing

this is a frequent problem for anyone with a large amount of deductions whether it is student loan interest home mortgage interest charitable contributions or anything else   as an employee getting your tax withheld from your check your options to reduce the amount withheld are limited the hr department has no control over how much they withhold the amount is calculated using a standard formula based on the number of exemptions you tell them   the number of exemptions you claim on your w-4 form does not have to match reality if you currently have 1 exemption claimed ask them what the withholding would be if you claimed 4 exemptions if that 's not enough go higher as long as you are not withholding so little that you have a large tax bill at the end of the year you are fine   of course when you do your taxes you need to have the correct number of exemptions claimed on your 1040 but this number does not need to match your w-4

no and just a caution about that super low risk suppose that you lived during the late 70s and early 80s when savers in the united states could get interest rates over 10 for savings   you put your money into an account in 1980 knowing that in five years you 'll have made a solid amount of interest   except that you might have been smarter to convert your money to aud and save in that currency because it would have moved from in value to 1.43 in value in principal only not interest when i look at the 's bank interest it appears they were also paying double digit interest to savers now i get that this may not be the answer that you want to see because it means that if the interest rates were higher in the us for savers they might be higher elsewhere too and it also means that what may appear to be a super low risk could actually be a high risk

do not buy this car first i want to say i love bmw 's   there 's a reason why they call them ultimate driving machine and why other car manufacturers compare their new models to bmws   i own and i absolutely love it   every time you get into the car it just begs you to push and abuse it   everything from steering response to throttle to engine sound   awesome car   however 1 bmw is not known for their reliability   i 've had to do numerous things to this car and if i did n't do the work myself i like tinkering with cars it would be a pretty big money pit and actually still is   german parts are more expensive then regular cars   labor will run you if you take it for service   right now my car is on jack stands while i 'm fixing an oil leak replacing cooling system components which are known to fail and doing work with the cam timing system which uses bad seals 2 if you buy a used car which is 3 years old just remember all the items and everything that wants to break will break 3 years sooner on you   someone else already pre enjoyed your car 's maintenance free days   at things will start to go   ask me how i know   so you 'll start paying for maintenance way before your 5-year loan expires   compare this to the acura i used to have   acura aka honda had miles when i sold it and i never once got stranded with the acura 3 fuel economy is not that good and btw you have to use the most expensive gas 4 if you are really set on buying a bmw because you enjoy driving and wo n't drive like an old lady my apologies to those old ladies that drive at least the speed limit but you are not the majority then still do not by this one and check out auctions   i bought my 2003 in 2005 for when it cost over 40k new   you could probably find one with less than 20k miles on it my final advice is either a learn to at least do basic maintenance or b stick to always buying new cars which do n't have any issues in first 4 7 years then move on before you have to schedule your life around your cars on the bright side i doubt you 'll have to ever replace the exhaust and you can buy tail lights on e bay for roughly $ 60

now is there any clever way to combine forex transactions so that you receive the us interest on $ 100 k instead of the $ 2 k you deposited as margin   yes absolutely but think about it why would the interest rates be different imagine you 're making two loans one for 10,000 usd and one for 10,000 chf and you 're going to charge a different interest rate on the two loans why would you do that there is really only one reason you would charge more interest for the currency that you think is less likely to hold its value such that the expected value of the money you are repaid is the same in other words currencies pay a higher interest when their value is expected to go down and currencies pay a lower interest when their value is expected to go up so yes you could do this but the profits you make in interest would have to equal the expected loss you would take in the devaluation of the currency people will only offer you these interest rates if they think the loss will exceed the profit unless you know better than them you will take a loss

there are a few different kinds of implied volatility they are all based on the ivs obtained from the option pricing model you use 1 basically given a few different values current stock price time until expiration right of option exercise style strike of the option interest rates dividends etc you can obtain the iv for a given option price if you look at the bid of an option you can calculate the iv for that bid if you look at the ask there 's a different iv for the ask you can then look at the mid price then you have a different iv and so on and so on and that 's for each strike in each expiration cycle so you have a ton of different ivs 2 in many option trading platforms you 'll see another kind of iv the iv for each specific expiration cycle that 's calculated based on some of the ivs i mentioned on topic 1 some kind of aggregation more on this later 3 finally people often talk about the iv of stock xyz that 's again an aggregation calculated from many of the ivs mentioned on topic 1 now your question seems to be which ivs from which options from which months with which weight are part of the expiration cycle iv or for the iv of the stock itself it really depends on the trading platform you are talking about but very frequently people will use a calculation similar to how the cboe calculates the vix basically the vix is just like the iv described on topic 3 above but specifically for spx the s&p 500 index the very detailed procedure and formulas to calculate the vix ie iv of spx is described here if you apply the same or a similar methodology to other stocks you 'll get what you could call the iv of stock xyz

typically a private company is hit by demand supply issues and cost of inputs in effect at times the cost of input may go up it can not raise the prices because this will reduce demand however certain public sectors companies typically in oil the services are offered by public sector companies and the price they charge is governed by regulatory authorities in essence the pg&e the agreement for price to customers would be calculated as cost of inputs to pg&e plus expenses plus profit thus the regulated price itself governs that the company makes atleast profit year on year does this mean that the shares are good buy   just to give an example say the price was $ 100 at face value so essentially by year end logically you would have made assuming the company did not pay dividend now lets say you began trading this share there would be quite a few people who would say i am ready to pay $ 200 and even if i get on 200 it still means i have got ~6 return someone may be ready to pay $ 400 it still gives ~3 so in short the price of the stock would keep changing depending how the market the value that a company would return if the markets are down or the sentiments are down on energy sectors the prices would go down   so investing in pg&e is not a sure shot way of making money for actual returns over the years see the graph at

this will depend on individual bank policy federal reserve regulation d is the regulation that requires banks to disallow more than 6 convenient transactions in a month on savings accounts   if they do allow it they will fail their audits and be fined as a result banks will do one of several things either prevent you from any more transactions for the month charge you a fee convert your account to a checking account or simply close the account altogether   if they do that they will give you the money in it probably by mailing you a check you have a few options before that happens   first of all if this is an account that you regularly spend money out of the appropriate account type is a checking account   you could go to the bank and open a checking account which will not have a transaction limit if you are unable or unwilling to do that you 'll need to stay under this limit   however you should be aware that not all withdrawal types fall under this 6 transaction limit   the regulations talk about convenient transactions which generally include things like automated payments debit card check internet transfers etc   cash withdrawals in person or at an atm generally do not fall under this limit so that is an option for you if you hit your limit for the month

i think it would be worth it for you to look into something called a self directed ira before you make any decisions sometimes the costs can be a little higher but you may find the flexibility worth it basically instead of being limited to a small set of mutual funds from which to choose having the money in a self directed ira would let you branch out into real estate gold or other vehicles that are n't part of the usual 401 k landscape and count me as another vote for not taking the cash mrchrister is right there are plenty of other ways to pay that off without the penalty

if i am the guarantor for someone else 's loan can my personal property be possessed if the other person does n't pay back the loan as you have not indicated jurisdiction country laws vary in general yes your personal property can be possessed however the financial institution has to send notices get a court order and then possess your property and auction it they can also freeze your bank account or any other assets you have there is no restriction as you have given a blanket guarantee note depending on jurisdictions your estate and or legal heirs can also be liable to this if you die during the course of loan can my property be mortgaged as a guarantee to his loan depending on how this is worded in legal contract you can mortgage your property only as a guarantee to his loan in such cases financial institution can only take your property but can not take any other assets such as bank deposits etc

in short your scenario could work in theory but is not realistic generally speaking you can borrow up to some percentage of the value of the property usually 80 90 though it can vary based on many factors   so if your property currently has a value of $ 100k you could theoretically borrow a total of $ 80 90k against it   so how much you can get at any given time depends on the current value as compared to how much you owe   a simple way to ballpark it would be to use this formula =      if your available equity allowed you to borrow what you wanted and you then applied it to additions renovations your base property value would hopefully increase   however as other people mentioned you very rarely get a value increase that is near what you put into the improvements and it is not uncommon for improvements to have no significant impact on the overall value   just because you like something about your improvements does n't mean the market will agree just for the sake of argument though lets say you find the magic combination of improvements that increases the property value in line with their cost   if such a feat were accomplished your $ 40k improvement on a $ 100k property would mean it is now worth $ 140k   let us further stipulate that your $ 40k loan to fund the improvements put you at a 90 loan to value ratio   so prior to starting the improvements you owed $ 90k on a $ 100k property   after completing the work you would owe $ 90k on what is now a $ 140k property putting you at a loan to value ratio of   meaning you theoretically have 26 equity available to borrow against to get back to the 90 level or roughly $ 36k   note that this is 10 less than the increase in the property value   meaning that you are in the realm of diminishing returns and each iteration through this process would net you less working capital the real picture is actually a fair amount worse than outlined in the above ideal scenario as we have yet to account for any of the costs involved in obtaining the financing or the decreases in your credit score which would likely accompany such a pattern   each time you go back to the bank asking for more money they are going to charge you for new appraisals and all of the other fees that come out at closing   also each time you ask them for more money they are going to your credit and see the additional inquires and associated debt stacking up which in turn drops your score which prompts the banks to offer higher interest rates and/or charge higher fees also when a bank loans against a property that is already securing another debt they are generally putting themselves at the back of the line in terms of their claim on the property in case of default   in my experience it is very rare to find a lender that is willing to put themselves third in line much less any farther back   generally if you were to ask for such a loan the bank would insist that the prior commitments be paid off before they would lend to you   meaning the bank that you ask for the $ 36k noted above would likely respond by saying they will loan you $ 70k provided that $ 40k of it goes directly to paying off the previous equity line

suppose you have been paying interest on previous charges in the past your monthly statement is issued on april 12 and since you just received your income tax refund you pay it off in full on april 30   you do n't charge anything to the card at all after april 12   thus on april 30 your credit card balance   shows as zero since you just paid it off   but your april 12 statement billed you for interest only till april 12   so on may 12 your next monthly bill will be for the interest for your nonzero balance from april 13 through april 30 assuming that you still are not making any new charges on your card and pay off the may 12 bill in timely fashion you will finally have a zero bill on june 12 what if you charge new items to your credit card after april 12 well your balance stopped revolving on april 30 and that 's when interest is no longer charged on the new charges but you do owe interest for a charge on april 13 say until april 30 when your balance is no longer revolving and this will be added to your bill on may 12 purchases made after april 30 will not be charged interest unless you fall off the wagon again and do n't pay your may 12 bill in full by the due date of the bill some time in early june

gt   firstly comparing debt to gdp is comparing a stock to a flow you 're committing a that is warned about in econ 101   perhaps you should learn a bit more   he 's talking bonds not stocks and even with stocks you 've got a dividend discount model for establishing fair value sum of discounted dividend flows = fair value of the company etc   with regard to the size of debt you need to consider 3 things   current interest expense as a of both gdp and income revenue refinance cost change in interest expense if total debt is refinanced at current rates and the first derivative of interest expense current yields   this helps one understand the probability of a death spiral such as what was experienced in greece et al where it was impossible to make debt payments at refinance rates   the fact is that with us interest expenses on the debt of   $ year this is 13.5 of all government revenue   if you factor in the interest expenses with even slightly higher yields one sees that you can quickly get a debt crisis   if trump gives as large a tax cut as he has promised it has a much higher prospect of a debt death spiral   do the math

unfortunately that 's a call only you can make and whichever route you choose comes with advantages and disadvantages   if you manage your money directly you may significantly reduce costs assuming that you do n't frequently trade index funds or you use a brokerage like robinhood and take advantage of market returns if the indexes perform well   on the other hand if the market experiences some bad years a professional might and this is a huge might have more self discipline and prevent a panic sell or know how to allocate accordingly both before and after a rise or fall keep in mind investors often get too greedy for their own good like they tend to panic at the wrong time   as an example of why this might is important one family member of mine trusted a professional to do this and they failed they bought in a rising market and sold in a falling market to avoid the above example if you do go with the professional service the best course of action is to look at their track record if they 're new you might be better on your own   since i assume this one or more professionals at the company testing to see what they 've recommended over the years might help you evaluate if they 're offering you a good choice finally depending on how much money you have you could always do what scott did he took a portion of his own money and managed it himself and tested how well he did vs. how well his professional team did if i recall i believe he came out ahead of his professional team   with two decades left that may help guide you the rest of the way even through retirement

there 's a few options you may want to look into first i 'm writing from an us point of view i do not know if these are available in russia   first look into drips dividend reinvestment plans these seem tailor made for your request they are plans set up by companies that pay dividends if you own at least one share costing no more than say $ 100 often less then these companies will take the dividends paid on these shares and automatically buy more shares as the income from the dividends pile up this is a low cost of entry way of getting in on many high quality stocks stocks such as ge and many utility and real estate stocks reits offer this   check out these links secondly you can look at brokerages that specialize in buying smaller amount of stocks on a regular basis to simulate a drip sharebuilder will allow you to invest say $ 50 or $ 100 a month into one or more stocks however at smaller amounts their commission fees can eat in to your returns   folio investing does the same thing as sharebuilder it 's worth looking at them both and comparing their commissions and other features

i once bought both preferred and common shares in a bankrupt company   it is true that those preferred shares had less potential for appreciation than the common shares   the reason is because the preferred shares were trading around $ 50 and had a face value of $ 1000   this means that if the bankruptcy proceedings ended up finding enough assets to make the preferred shares whole then the preferred shareholders would be paid $ 1000 per share and no more than that   so if you bought the preferred shares at $ 50 and received $ 1000 per share for them then you made a 1900 gain but if the bankruptcy proceedings found enough assets to pay not just the preferred shareholders but also the common shareholders then the common shareholders had the potential for a greater gain than the preferred shareholders   the common stock was trading around 20 cents at the time and if enough assets were found to pay $ 10 per share to the common shareholders then that would have been a 4900 gain   the preferred shares were capped by their face value but the common shares had no limit on how high they could go

i 'll answer your second question it depends what your charity is for there are two types i emergency i.e. to respond to environmental or social disasters where it acts a bit like an insurance policy ii development i.e. where the intention is to subsidise something missing in the local economy a lack of insurance is certainly a problem for people who lose their homes and livelihoods to disaster   your donations can go far as for development aid we find little evidence of a robust positive correlation between aid and growth write two ex imf economists who stepped down as imf chief economist at the end of 2006 and who left the imf this year one of the most enduring and important questions in economics is whether foreign aid helps countries grow there is a moral imperative to this question it is a travesty for so many countries to remain poor if a relatively small transfer of resources from rich countries could set them on the path to growth but if there is no clear evidence that aid boosts growth then handing out more money makes little sense they conclude i do somewhat further in declaring that charity is equivalent to trade dumping   by artificially lowering the real cost of a particular good it ensures that there will be no local investment in that good   free clothes to africa has destroyed the local textiles industry   free doctors has resulted in more african doctors in new york than in the whole of africa so decide where your charity is going emergencies or development   then decide what you can afford   but your first investment should always be in yourself   if by making use of that investment you can benefit the economy and keep others around you employed and productive you will achieve far more

the blue line is illustrating the net profit or loss the investor will realise according to how the price of the underlying asset settles at expiry the x axis represents the underlying asset price   the y axis represents the profit or loss in the first case the investor has a naked put write position having sold a put option   the strike price of the put is marked as a on the x axis   the maximum profit possible is equal to the total premium received when the option contract was sold   this is represented by that portion of the blue line that is horizontal and extending from the point above that point marked a on the x axis   this corresponds to the case that the price of the underlying asset settles at or above the strike price on the day of expiry   if the underlying asset settles at a price less than the strike price on the day of expiry then the option with be in the money   therefore the net settlement value will move from a profit to a loss depending on how far in the money the option is upon expiry   this is represented by the diagonal line moving from above the a point on the x axis and moving from a profit to a loss on the y axis   the diagonal line crosses the x axis at the point where the underlying asset price is equal to a minus the original premium rate at which the option was written i.e. net profit = zero   in the second case the investor has sold a put option with a strike price of b and purchase a put option with a strike price a where a is less than b.   here the reasoning is similar to the first example however since a put option has been purchase this will limit the potential losses should the underlying asset move down strongly in value the horizontal line above the x axis marks the maximum profit while the horizontal line below the x axis marks the maximum loss note that the horizontal line above the x axis is closer to the x axis that is the horizontal line below the x axis   this is because the maximum profit is equal to the premium received for selling the put option minus the premium payed for buying the put option at a lower strike price   losses are limited since any loss in excess of the strike price a plus the premium payed for the put purchased at a strike price of a is covered by the profit made on the purchased put option at a strike price of a

it seems like a more commonly recurring issue on reddit that people are referencing logical fallacies without really understanding them   for reference ad hominem attacks are personal attacks they are person specific you can not make an ad hominem attack against a group of people such as the poor   straw man attacks are when an argument is changed to something that it is not and then beaten down it skews the topic at hand to something it is not   when i make an assumption clearly state it and then ask a question based on it with the words if yes it is not a straw man by any definition i was attempting to expand the argument to see how you view the rich vs. poor because the vast majority of arguments in favor of helping the poor come with the caveat that the rich should pay that price a higher minimum wage is an example of that those greedy business owners need to pay it am i right   i would suggest that you do not refer to these logical fallacies until you fully understand them   me as some guy that just does n't understand how the real world works   this is basically the problem with your source your arguments and your personal position you mention that you worked through high school and college you did n't mention managing people but even if you did i would be surprised if you managed long term minimum wage the kind of people who never rise above it the majority of the workers around you probably were doing much what you did using the job as a stepping stone   your source mentions most people are willing to work yet states that 46 are child care workers and 48 are home care workers do you know why the government will pay relatives who get a simple home health care provider license to care for relatives who are on medicare thus their grandma requires care and their daughter or grandchildren provide said care for a fee paid by the government the us government is literally paying people to take care of their family it is relatively the same with child care it 's disgusting   that article is making the argument that they want to work i do n't think taking a part time job caring for your family denotes a will to work i build low income housing i actually deal with the tenants who do this kind of work on a personal level you could not convince me that a 26 year old with two kids from two different fathers who on occasion provides care to their family members has a will to work i see their daily lives how does the government even check to see if the care is being provided is grandma going to lie nope   i can assume that you do n't manage minimum wage employees because it is nearly impossible good labor refuses to work at that price the market is much higher depending on the job it is usually double or triple the cleaning guy at my apartment building makes $ 12 an hour i 've paid minimum wage the only people i pay that are day laborers most of which have serious problems in their lives and even then it usually is more hell i 've seen a guy from the neighborhood pay as low as $ 25 a day to people looking for a fix   you are constantly arguing that i look down on these people it 's not entirely wrong but it 's not about the wage i am very friendly with the staff at the local mcdonalds in one of the of houston the manager is a really nice guy i asked him why certain positions kept turning over he complained that it was hard to find people and he kept having employees no show this is minimum wage and they ca n't even show up do you really believe that people want to work when simple positions that require no skill can not be filled   you make it seem as though i am assuming the worst it 's quite the opposite i am incredibly optimistic and giving but with many people in the us it does n't matter you just do n't see it on the day to day you read a study that is incredibly biased and take it to the grave there are many many people in the us who do not want to work they rely on government subsidies and refuse to improve their own lives it will always happen it 's just a matter of what the government will try to do about it next   i forgot to mention houston has built more homes in the last 5 years every year houston almost built more single family homes than the entire state of california in the year 2014 thus my painter is leaving one of the largest construction markets in the us to go to seattle because he ca n't find people to paint a building

the difference is in the between the varied investments you make hedging is about specifically offsetting a possible loss in an investment by making another related investment that will increase in value for the same reasons that the original investment would lose value gold for instance is often regarded as the ultimate hedge its value is typically inversely correlated to the rest of the market as a whole because its status as a material durable store of value makes it a preferred safe haven to move money into in times of economic downturn when stock prices bond yields and similar investments are losing value that specific behavior makes investing in gold alongside stocks and bonds a hedge the increase in value of gold as stock prices and bond yields fall limits losses in those other areas investment of cash in gold is also specifically a hedge against currency inflation paper money account balances and even debt instruments like bonds and cds can lose real value over time in a hot economy where there 's more money than things to buy with it by keeping a store of value in something other than currency the price of that good will rise as the currencies used to buy it decrease in real value maintaining your level of real wealth other hedges are more localized one might for example trade oil futures as a hedge on a position in transportation stocks when oil prices rise trucking and airline companies suffer in the short term as their margins get squeezed due to fuel costs currency futures are another popular hedge a company in international business will often trade options on the currencies of the companies it does business in to limit the seen in the forex spot market caused by speculation and other transient changes in market demand diversification by contrast is about choosing multiple unrelated investments the idea being to limit losses due to a localized change in the market companies stocks gain and lose value every day and those companies can also go out of business without bringing the entire economy to its knees by spreading your wealth among investments in multiple industries and companies of various sizes and global locations you insulate yourself against the risk that any one of them will fail   if tomorrow kroger grocery stores went bankrupt and all its stores people in the regions it serves might be but the market as a whole will move on you however would have lost everything if you 'd bet your retirement on that one stock nobody does that in the real world instead you put some of your money in kroger some in microsoft some in home depot some in some in pg&e etc etc by investing in stocks that would be more or less unaffected by a downturn in another if kroger went bankrupt tomorrow you would still have say 95 of your investment next egg still alive well and continuing to pay you dividends the flip side is that if tomorrow kroger announced an exclusive deal with the girl scouts to sell their cookies making them the only place in the country you can get them you would miss out on the full possible amount of gains you 'd get from the price spike if you had bet everything on kroger   hindsight 's always 20/20 i could have spent some beer money to buy bitcoins when they were changing hands for pennies and i 'd be a multi millionaire right now you ca n't think that way when investing because it 's survivor bias you see the successes topping the index charts not the failures you could just as easily have invested in any of the hundreds of internet startups that do n't last a year

futures are an agreement to buy or sell something in the future   the futures price is the price at which you agree to make the trade   this price does not indicate what will happen in the future so much as it indicates the cost of buying the item today and holding it until the future date   hence for very liquid products such as stock index futures the futures price is a very simple function of today 's stock index value and current short term interest rates   if the stock exchange is closed but the futures exchange is open then using the futures price and interest rates one can back out an implied fair value for the index which is in essence the market 's estimate of what the stock index value would be right now if the stock market were open   of course as soon as the stock exchange opens the futures price trades to within a narrow band of the actual index value where the size of the band depends on transaction costs bid ask spread commissions etc

support and resistance points indicate price levels where there have been a large amount of trading activity usually from institutions that tend to stabilize the price of a stock support is a temporary floor where people have been buying in large quantities that means there 's a good chance that the stock wo n't go below this level in the near term but if it does watch out resistance is a temporary ceiling where people have been selling when the stock price hits this level people tend to sell and push it back down until there are no more sellers at this level then the price could skyrocket if there is enough buying

i will add one point missing from the answers by cqm and when you take a loan and invest the proceeds the interest that you pay on the loan is deductible on schedule a line 14 of your federal income tax return under the category of investment interest expense   if the   interest expense is larger than all your investment earnings not just those from the loan proceeds then you can deduct at most the amount of the earnings and carry over the excess investment interest paid this year for deduction   against investment earnings in future years also if some of the earnings are long term capital gains and you choose to deduct the corresponding investment interest expense then those capital gains are taxed as ordinary income instead of at the favored ltcg rate you also have the option of choosing to deduct only that amount of interest that offsets dividend and short term capital gain income that is taxed at ordinary rates pay tax at the ltcg rate on the capital gains and carry over rest of the interest for deduction in future years in previous years when the tax laws called for   reduction in the schedule a deductions for high income earners this investment interest expense was exempt from the reduction whether future tax laws will allow this exemption depends on congress so this should be taken into account when dealing with the taxes issue in deciding whether to take a loan to invest in the stock market

living in one unit of a multi family while renting out the others although not without its risks can be a viable if gradual way to build wealth it 's been recently as house hacking but the underlying mechanics have been around for many years many cities in the northeast in particular remain full of neighborhoods of homes built and used for exactly that purpose for decades though now frequently sub divided into condos   it 's true you 'd need to borrow money but there are a number of reasons why it 's certainly at least worth exploring which is what you seem to be asking should you bother doing the homework tl;dr yes and yes you would be relying on tenants to meet your monthly expenses including a mortgage bill that will arrive whether the other units are vacant or not but in most markets rental prices are far less volatile than home prices from the san francisco federal reserve the main result from this is that the behavior of the    price rent ratio for housing mirrors that of the price dividend ratio    for stocks the majority of the movement of the price rent ratio comes    from future returns not rental growth rates emphasis added it 's also important to remember that rental income must do more than just cover your mortgage there 's lots of other expenses associated with a rental property including insurance taxes maintenance vacancy an allowance for the periods when the property will be empty in between tenants reserves for capital improvements and more as with any investment it 's all about whether the numbers work you mentioned not being interested in the upkeep work so that 's another 8 10 off the top to pay for a property manager if you can find a property at an attractive price secure financing on attractive terms and can be reasonably confident that it will rent in the ballpark of 1.5 2 of the purchase price then it might be a fine choice for you assuming you are willing and able to handle the work of being a landlord something worth at least as much of your research time as the investment itself   it sounds like you 're still a ways away from having enough for even an fha down payment which gives you a great opportunity to find and talk with some local folks who already manage rental properties in your area for example you might look for a local chapter of the national real estate investment association to get a sense of what 's really involved

i can answer scenario 3 if you are purchasing a property with buy to let intentions can you use the    rental income exclusively to fund the mortgage repayments yes this is exactly how buy to let mortgage applications are evaluated lenders generally expect you to fund the mortgage payments with rent they look for the anticipated monthly rent income to cover a minimum of 125 of the monthly mortgage payment this is to make sure you can allow for vacant periods maintenance compliance with rules and regulations and still be in profit i.e. generate a positive yield on your investment however buy to let btl mortgage lenders also generally expect you to own your own home to begin with it 's up to them but rare is the lender who will provide a buy to let mortgage to a non owner this is because of point 2 above the lender does n't want you to end up living in the property because then you 'll need to repay the loan capital since you 'll always need somewhere to live this makes the economics of btl they look at your application as a business proposal quite different to a residential mortgage application which is what your question seems to be addressing bottom line you 're right about scenario 3 but it sounds like you 're trying to afford a home first whereas btl is best viewed as an investment for someone who already has their main residence under ownership mortgaged or otherwise as for scenarios 1 and 2 i ca n't offer first hand answers but i think m. and steve have covered it

what i 've found works best when working on my personal budget is to track my income and spending two different ways bank accounts and budget categories here is what i mean when i deposit my paycheck i do two things with it it goes into my checking account so the balance of my checking account goes up by the amount of my paycheck i also deposit the money from my checking account into my various budget category balances   this is separate from my bank account balances   some of my paycheck money goes into my groceries category some goes into clothing some into car fuel entertainment mortgage phone etc   some goes into longer range bills that only happen once or twice a year such as car insurance life insurance property tax etc   some goes into savings goals of ours such as car replacement vacation furniture etc every dollar that we have in a bank account or in cash in our wallets is also accounted for in a budget category   if you add up the balances of our bank accounts and cash and you add up the balances of our budget categories they add up to the same number when we make a purchase this also gets accounted for twice the appropriate bank account or cash wallet balance gets reduced by the purchase amount the appropriate budget category gets reduced by the purchase amount in this way we do n't really need to worry about having separate bank accounts for different purposes   we do n't need to put our savings goal money in a separate bank account from our grocery money if we do n't want to   the budget category accounting keeps track of how much money is allocated to each purpose    now the budget category amounts are not spent yet the money in them is still in our bank account and we can move money around in the categories if we change our mind on how to allocate them   for example if we do n't spend all of our gas money for the month we can either keep that money in the gas category or we can move it to a different category such as the car replacement category or the vacation category   if the phone bill is more than we expect we can move money around from a different category to cover it now back to your question we allocate some money from each paycheck into our furniture category   but the money is not really spent until we actually buy some furniture   when we do the furniture category balance and bank account balance both go down by the amount of the purchase all of this can be kept track of on the computer in a spreadsheet   however it 's not easy to keep track of so many categories and bank balances   an easier solution is custom budgeting software designed for this purpose   i use and recommend ynab

alright i will go through bullet point by bullet point and try to best figure out what you will be doing in layman 's terms please bear in mind that i do not work for a hedge fund but rather a much larger entity so a lot of the work you will be doing is pre populated   = in this role the individual will be the main point of contact for the client on all things related to understanding their trading profit amp loss and how their valuations have been sourced in addition the product controller will work with internal partner areas to ensure all required processes have been performed to verify the valuation accuracy of the client ’s portfolio   from my understanding you will act as the middle man between the client and the analyst as such here is how a real interaction may go client x calls you answer hello 's office how can i assist you client x asks hey i was curious what my capital gains were on my fb purchase ok let me pull up your account just a moment it seems as though your current capital are $ 30,000 lol on your fb purchase   client x hmm well do i have any significant loses that i may be able to sell off to off set the tax on the capital gains why yes you do it seems aapl has taken a mighty tumble would you like to sell a position to assist you in offsetting client x why that would be great thanks for your help the conversation could go on and that is a pretty deep conversation for the level you are going in but i have had conversations like these before the second part of the bullet just means that you will be checking and the grunt work of the analyst and in some places actually performing the grunt work the work will most likely be along the lines of finding returns for different time periods popular desired time periods are inception ytd 1yr etc remember all of these time periods are not good stand alone they must be compared to a relevant benchmark for instance you would not want to compare the barclays intermediate ag to an equity portfolio the most common benchmark for an equity portfolio is going to be the s&amp;p 500 but you have to look at where the portfolio is focused if it is a you may want to look more towards something like the ishares s&amp;p smallcap 600 value index in the end always remember that any number you come up with is always relative to a benchmark a plain return number is useless   skills = knowledge of cash and derivative products across various markets knowledge of pricing and valuation knowledge of profit and loss reporting and related attribution analysis   pretty much they just want to make sure that if a client asks about a forward future contract as well as any swap option that you understand what they are this bullet points i know what i am doing even though nobody knows what is going on in the economy be up on your current events have a personal conjecture about what you feel is going to happen moving forward but do not convey it if you know that the unemployment was the main driver behind today ’s poor market then you will be good for the day because that will suffice for any call in that relates to why is the market down one of my favorite quotes about the current economy is as follows anyone around here who is n't confused about what ’s going on does n't understand as scary as it is that is the honest truth nobody knows what is about to happen and if anyone tells you they do they are lying and you need to run away quickly i am assuming you know how to calculate profit and loss i do n’t really know of a special way to twist the numbers around   duties = managing the daily p&amp;l process for one or more client trading desks o daily review of quality control checks o working with trading on p&amp;l differences inquiries o working with offshore product control team india on qc process o delivering a final daily and month end p&amp;l statement to the client understanding and explaining the key drivers behind the p&amp;l movements preparing managing monthly or more frequently as required price verification process and associated reporting updating and maintaining pricing policy for each financial type that is included in the consultant ’s p&amp;l reporting ad hoc projects to meet and enhance client   all this means is that you will be sending out the due diligence to the client and you will ensure you are using the proper closing price and include any deposits withdrawals during the month into your calculation the main point is knowing the reasons the price moved throughout the day month keep up on current events and make sure that you understand a vast knowledge of economic data   for what your day to day activity may be i can walk you through it let ’s say you get in at 8 am you will get in at 8 read economic data recent news articles until about 10 from there you will update client a f p l worksheet until about noon you will eat a quick lunch until about and continue on the grind of e m until about 4 from 4 5 you will reread what happened at the end of the day and an overall economic activity report for the day you may stay until 8 or 9 if you are in a banking hub nyc but a lot of the older guys will leave at this time this is your time to shine stay as late as you can and pump out as much work as you can   as for your interview they may ask you what will be a good play for the next 6 months to a year you should respond with common themes in the market the most common theme is the dividend growth play a ton of people are not predicting large amount of growth for the next 5 10 years i believe i read something earlier that jpm lowered their growth forecasts by about 30 recently so dividends is the play dividend payers are generally well established companies blue chip that have a strong in their respective industry sector there are a ton of funds out everywhere to follow this trend you could throw out a few funds for brownie points i ’ll give you some and are pretty common i hope this helps and let me know if anything was n’t clear wrote it pretty quickly i am off to have a drink or two or three i ’ll check this in the morning though

this chart concerns an option contract not a stock the method of analysis is to assume that the price of an option contract is normally distributed around some mean which is presumably the current price of the underlying asset as the date of expiration of the contract gets closer the variation around the mean in the possible end price for the contract will decrease undoubtedly the publisher has measured typical deviations from the mean as a function of time until expiration from historical data based on this data the program that computes the probability has the following inputs 1 the mean current asset price 2 the time until expiration 3 the expected standard deviation based on 2 with this information the probability distribution that you see is generated the green this is a normal or gaussian distribution for a normal distribution the probability of a particular event is equal to the area under the curve to the right of the value line in the example above the value chosen is this area can be computed with the formula   this formula is called the probability density for x where x is the value in the example above t is the reciprocal of the variance which can be computed from the standard deviation mu is the mean the main assumption such a calculation makes is that the price of the asset will not change between now and the time of expiration obviously that is not true in most cases because the prices of stocks and bonds constantly fluctuate a secondary assumption is that the distribution of the option price around the mean will a normal or gaussian distribution this is obviously a crude assumption and common sense would suggest it is not the most accurate distribution in fact various studies have shown that the distribution is actually a more accurate model for the distribution of option contract prices

let me start with something you might dismiss as trite correlation does not mean causation   a money manager charging say 1 is n't likely to take on clients below a minimum level   on the other hand there 's a long debate regarding how on average managed funds do n't beat the averages   i think that you should look at it this way people that have money tend to be focused on other things a brain surgeon making $ 500k yr may not have the time nor the inclination to want to manage her own money   i was always a numbers person i at the difference between raising 1.1 to the power getting i.e. getting times your investment after 40 years at 10 vs at 9 that 1 difference feels like nothing but after a lifetime 1/3 of your money has been skimmed off the top the data show that one can do better by simply putting their money into a mix of s&p index and cash and beat the average money manager over time regardless of convoluted 12 asset class allocations   similarly there are people who use a tax guy in quotes because i mean this as an individual whom they go to year after year not a storefront my used to go to one and i was curious what they got for their money each year he sent them a form 3 pages they needed to fill in every cell made its way into the guy 's tax program the last year i went with them to pick up the tax return i asked him if he noticed that they might benefit from small roth conversions each year or by making some of their ira rmd directly to charity he kindly told me that 's not what we do here and us away i planned both questions in advance the roth conversion was a strategy that one could agree made sense or dismiss as convoluted for some clients but the rmd issue was very different they did n't have enough schedule a deductions to itemize therefore the $ 3000 they donated each year was n't impacting their return by donating directly from their iras this money would avoid tax it would have saved them more than the cost of the tax guy who charged a hefty fee in my opinion it seemed to me this particular strategy should be obvious to one whose business is preparing returns

no the intro rate is a gambit by the bank they accept losing money in the short term but expect to gain money in the long term when your intro is over and you hopefully start paying interest there 's not much in it for them if you never get around to paying interest same can be said for people who close the card after their intro period but that 's different the bank is correctly expecting that most people wo n't bother

thanks for replying i think we are talking at cross purposes though in your original example you were talking terms of a promise to pay at a future time in that example the asset might be destroyed but the promise to pay would still be binding under typical laws of obligations and so a court could enforce the to pay unless perhaps the promise was itself eg by being contingent on the asset the apples being harvested ie not being destroyed so my question was really whether such a contingent promise really amounts to creating new money as is suggested by the original example i do n't see a promise of this nature can be akin to creating money it is a new bargain entered into by two or more parties

there are times when investing in an etf is more convenient than a mutual fund when you invest in a mutual fund you often have an account directly with the mutual fund company or you have an account with a mutual fund broker   mutual funds often have either a front end or back end load which essentially gives you a penalty for jumping in and out of funds etfs are traded exactly like stocks so there is inherently no load when buying or selling   if you have a brokerage account and you want to move funds from a stock to a mutual fund an etf might be more convenient with some accounts an etf allows you to invest in a fund that you would not be able to invest in otherwise   for example you might have a 401k account through your employer   you might want to invest in a vanguard mutual fund but vanguard funds are not available with your 401k   if you have access to a brokerage account inside your 401k you can invest in the vanguard fund through the associated etf another reason that you might choose an etf over a mutual fund is if you want to try to short the fund

gt;you could even pull a cash figure from the income projection in the business plan you asked to see you did ask for that right as well as the resumes from the founders and the name of the vc company so that you can check them out   i guess this is my point a fresh grad is unlikely to know how to evaluate this stuff assuming they even know to ask for the things you mention they also will be less likely to be in a position to be making a lot of demands of that nature you act as if it 's straightforward when i do n't think it is op was making the point that as you rightly point out you need to do a lot of due diligence and decide if it 's the right thing whereas in the popular culture there is a lot of glossing over of the failure cases making people less likely to know that they need to be careful

by the phrasing of your question it seems that you are under the mistaken impression that countries are borrowing money from other countries in which case it would make sense to question how everyone can be a borrower with no one on the other side of the equation the short answer is that the debt is owed mostly to individuals and institutions that buy debt instruments for example you know those us savings bonds that parents are buying to save for their children 's education well a bond is just a way to loan money to the government in exchange for the original money plus some interest back later it is as simple as that i think because the debt and the deficit are usually discussed in the context of more complex macroeconomic concerns people often mistakenly assume that national debts are denominated in some shadow banking system that is hidden from the common person behind some red tape covered bureaucracy this is not the case here why did they get themselves into this much debt the same reason the average person does they are spending more than they bring in and are enabled by access to easy credit like many people they are also paying off one credit card using another one

one extremely important aspect that must be taken into consideration is the state of the housing market if prices are rising it will probably be a false economy to delay your house purchase say you pay off a £ 5,000 student loan thus delaying your house purchase another year you could well end up out an extra £ 10,000 on the mortgage due to the rise in house prices of course if the housing market is falling then without a doubt pay off the student debt

this sounds like a real consistency issue then when it comes to saying one thing and doing another with regard to spending money it seems common that a company just has n't figured out why that kind of consistency is important   to me it 's a question of roi if a company insists on huge money blowing events what 's the return what is that event supposed to achieve and is it worth it huge money blowing events can certainly be worth it when they actually generate long term sales significantly boost employee morale in turn generating sales hopefully or similar but as you obviously know if all the employees involved in the event feel like it 's bullshit before during and after it goes down then somebody did n't really look at the roi before approving it

this is more in support of an interesting point most of the wealthy are no smarter than average dumbass and just as susceptible to hysterical if obama had raised taxes on the wealthy congress made that the rates would have gone up to where they were under clinton or during the mid reagan years both times during which the wealthy did very well indeed   also it could be that most jewelry store customers were barely hanging on anyway or just inept wealth funded by home equity loans and ponzi debt many of those were hitting the day of reckoning around 2008 2009 due to the evaporation of bubble housing wealth obama would have made a nice scapegoat for their own financial ineptitude

there are penalties for failure to file and penalties for failure to pay tax   the penalties for both are based on the amount of tax due   so you would owe penalties of zero otherwise meaning no penalties at all the irs on late 1040 penalties here are eight important points about penalties for filing or paying late a failure to file penalty may apply if you did not file by the tax filing deadline a failure to pay penalty may apply if you did not pay all of the taxes you owe by the tax filing deadline the failure to file penalty is generally more than the failure to pay penalty you should file your tax return on time each year even if you ’re not able to pay all the taxes you owe by the due date you can reduce additional interest and penalties by paying as much as you can with your tax return you should   explore other payment options such as getting a loan or making an installment agreement to make payments the irs will work with you the penalty for filing late is normally 5 percent of the unpaid taxes for each month or part of a month that a tax return is late that penalty starts accruing the day after the tax filing due date and will not exceed 25 percent of your unpaid taxes if you do not pay your taxes by the tax deadline you normally will face a failure to pay penalty of ½ of 1 percent of your unpaid taxes that penalty applies for each month or part of a month after the due date and starts accruing the day after the tax filing due date if you timely requested an extension of time to file your individual income tax return and paid at least 90 percent of the taxes you owe with your request you may not face a failure to pay penalty however you must pay any remaining balance by the extended due date if both the 5 percent failure to file penalty and the ½ percent failure to pay penalties apply in any month the maximum penalty that you ’ll pay for both is 5 percent if you file your return more than 60 days after the due date or extended due date the minimum penalty is the smaller of $ or 100 percent of the unpaid tax you will not have to pay a late filing or late payment penalty if you can show reasonable cause for not filing or paying on time if the irs owes you a refund april 15 is n't much of a deadline i suppose the real deadline is april 15 three years later that 's when the irs keeps your refund and it becomes property of the treasury   of course there 's little reason to wait that long   do n't let the treasury get all your interest

a derivative contract can be an option and you can take a short sell position much the same way you would in a stock when buying options you risk only the money you put in however when selling do n't have the securities or cash to cover all potential losses options you are borrowing brokers force you to maintain a required amount of cash called a maintenance requirement when selling naked calls theoretically you are able to lose an infinite amount of money so in order to sell this type of options you have to maintain a certain level of cash in your account if you fail to maintain this level you will enter into what s often referred to as a margin call and yes they will call your phone and tell you your broker has the right to liquidate your positions in order to meet requirements ps from experience my broker has never liquidated any of my holdings but then again i 've never been in a margin call for longer then a few days and never with a severe amount the margin requirement for investors is regulated and brokers follow these regulations

are financial institutions less likely to lend me money because of my age yes   but they are especially unlikely to loan you money because you have little income    or because they know i avoid interest by paying things off aggressively this wo n't affect them   but you might ask yourself how much credit history you have   credit history can include all of loans credit cards rent utilities etc   you mention three loans   but you do n't mention rent or utilities   you may simply not have much credit history even if what you do have is good    but again the biggest thing that they will look at is your income history   if you have a small income then it does n't matter what your payment history is   they do n't want to loan money to people who need money   they want to loan money to people who do n't need to borrow but are instead bringing a future purchase into the present    the ideal recipient is someone who has a high income and spends it all every month   such a person is likely to borrow heavily but be able to keep up the payments    obsessing about your ability to borrow is probably the wrong approach   instead focus on how you can meet your goals without borrowing   eventually your ability to pay will catch up   then they 'll offer you money   of course you might not need it then    note that when i say little income i 'm talking about their perspective   you may be fully on track and making decent money or even very good money for your age   but they 're looking for people who are mature in their careers and regularly bringing home large sums but who spend it faster than they can get it

that stranglehold is because of the small margins in the business when you put cabs on the road there are only a few models to work with the lease model where the company puts as many cabs on the road as possible the commission model where they balance fleet size and demand and the medallion model where you have a lot of individual operators    the lease model sounds nice for the customers because there 's excess cabs compared to demand but drivers are n't going to pay $ 160 300 a shift to not make any money so even still the cab company has limit the number of cabs they put on the road   in any case once you add up all your costs for gas maintenance licensing and insurance you 're left with a very small margin sure a cab company could 3x the number of cabs it normally does at night during the bar rush but the other 16 hours of the day they 're sitting on the lot not doing anything because there is n't as high of demand during the day that costs money and if the cabs are n't working they 're not paying for themselves   thus the market finds a balance between what supply there is depending on time of day and how much it costs to support a fleet of that size the only outside effect on the market equilibrium is how many taxis a city will license i really do n't like the medallion model because of this the medallion owners love it because they 're sitting on upwards of $ 500k asset in some cities

the issue yo have to consider is that under many state laws you must give a merchant three opportunities to correct an issue before you can sue them so check with your state before considering that option here 's a link to the federal trade commission 's warranty information page which may give you some ideas about what your options are keep in ind if you let someone else work on the computer rather than the store you bought it from you might give the guy a valid claim in court to throw out your lawsuit   many times warranties will spell out the conditions under which repair work can or must be done so make sure you follow every step to the letter in order to preserve your claim i would strongly suggest that you start creating a paper trail for your claim   start by writing a very precise and detailed letter to the store owner with copies of all relevant documents your receipts warranty papers etc included   explain the entire history including what steps you 've taken to date to get him to honor the warranty   offer him the option to let you take the computer to another shop for repairs at his expense   then send the letter by certified mail return receipt requested to the store owner so that he ca n't deny receiving your letter   this is all in order to make the best case you can for your claim just in case you do have to sue him do not take the computer to anyone else until or unless he tells you in writing that he is willing to let you do that   you do n't want to risk him arguing that the other shop is responsible for the problems now i hope this helps good luck

it 's very very unlikely that you received a phone call at work with an incorrect birth date from an actual lending company that thinks it loaned you any money   it 's much more likely that you received a phone call at work from a collections agency that would have bought some loan from the aforementioned agency for pennies on the dollar   they would have been hunting around trying to find someone with your name who was born years earlier   it 's even more likely that this is some sort of phishing scam   if you 're worried you can check your credit rating but it is likely that you can safely ignore the situation   if they call back ask for thorough details about the credit card   if they 're a real collections agency and for some reason they wo n't leave you alone iirc the most course of action is to hire a lawyer to send them a cease and letter

is it difficult to ask the credit card issuer for two cards even if the account belongs to one person you can most definitely get two cards for one account people do it all the time you just have to add her on as an authorized user   would it be better for me to apply for the card on my own or would there be an advantage to having her co sign it depends if she co signed then that means she is also responsible for the credit card payments which can help her credit score if its is just you applying then you are the only one responsible if you do n't want her lower credit score to impact what you could be approved for then only you should apply however if you are the sole account holder then you are responsible for the payments which means if in the event you guys break up and she maxes out the card before you cancel it then you are on the hook for what she spend   as for improving her credit score i do know that some banks report to the credit bureaus for the authorized user as well so that could help her out too

asset allocation serves many purposes not just mitigating risk via a diversification of asset classes but also allowing you to take a level of risk that is appropriate for a given investor at a given time by how much is allocated to which asset classes a younger investor with a longer timeframe may wish to take a lot more risk investing heavily in equities and perhaps managed funds that are of the aggressive growth variety seeking better than market returns someone a little older may wish to pull back a bit especially after a bull market has brought them substantial gains and begin to take money off the table perhaps by starting to establish some fixed income positions or pulling back to slightly less risky index   value or balanced funds an investor who is near or in retirement will generally want even less risk going to a much more balanced approach with half or more of their investments in fixed income and the remainder often in income producing blue chip type stocks or income funds   this allows them to protect a good amount of their wealth from potential loss at a time when they have to be able to depend on it for a majority of their income an institution such as yale has very different concerns and may always be in a more aggressive long term mode since retirement is not a factor for them   they are willing to invest mostly in very aggressive ways using diversification to protect them from one of those choices tanking but still overall taking a pretty high level of risk much more so than might be appropriate for an individual who will generally need to seek safety and to preserve gains as they get older   for example look at the pdf that linked and observe the overall risk level that yale is taking and in addition observe the large allocations they make to things like private equity with a risk level compared to their very small amount of fixed income with a 10 risk level   yale has a very long time horizon and invests in a way that is atypical of the needs and concerns of an individual investor   they also have as you pointed out the economy of scale with something like in assets to afford to hire proven experts and their own internal phd level experts to watch over the whole thing all of which very few individual investors have for either class of investor diversification is a means to mitigate risk by not having all your eggs in one basket   via having multiple different investments such as picking multiple individual stocks or aggressive funds with different approaches or just an index fund to get multiple stocks you are protected from being wiped out as might happen if a single choice might fail   for example imagine what would have happened if you had in 2005 put all your money into a single stock with a company that had been showing record profits   such as lehman brothers and left it there until 2008 when the stock tanked or even faster collapses such as enron etc that all looked great up until shortly after they failed utterly    being allocated across multiple asset classes provides some diversification all on it 's own but you can also be diversified within a class yale uses the diversification across several asset classes to have lower risk than being invested in a single asset class such as private equity but their allocation places much more of their funds in high risk classes and much less of their funds in the lowest risk classes such as fixed income

you also want to make sure that the loan is being re amortized sometimes called recasting   without this you are still responsible for the interest payments according to the original amortization table   if you re amortize the loan with a principal that is lower than on the table you will reduce the amount of interest you owe each period which means that if you maintain the same payment you will pay less in total interest   it 's important to realize that most people re amortize to reduce the payment amount but not the term   also not all loans can be re amortized and some banks limit how often it can be done

first as noted in the comments you need to pay attention to your network providers   if you are unable to pay exorbitant prices out of pocket then find an in network medical provider   if you are unhappy with the in network provider list e.g. too distant or not specialists then discuss switching to another plan or insurer with your employer or broker second many providers will have out of pocket or uninsured price lists often seen in outdated formats or   since you have asked for price lists and not been provided one i would pursue it with the practice manager or equivalent or else a doctor and ask if they have one   it 's possible that the clinic has an out of pocket price list but the front line staff is unaware of it and was never trained on it third if you efforts to secure a price list fail and you are especially committed to this specific provider then i would consider engaging in a friendly by direct negotiation with the practice manager or other responsible person   person they will be amenable to creating a list of prices if you are particularly proactive and aggressive you could offer to find out of pocket price lists from other clinics nearby   you could also flat out ask them to charge you a certain fee for office visits if you do this try to get some sort of offer or agreed price list in writing   most medical practices are uncomfortable asking patients for money so that may mean flat refusal to negotiate but it may also mean surprising willingness to work with you   this route is highly unpredictable before you go down it and it 's dependent on all sorts of things like the ownership structure business model and the personalities of the key people there the easiest answer is to switch clinics   this one sounds very unfriendly to hsa patients

cds spreads have little to do with the already issued debt itself cds spreads broadcast riskiness for current and future market participants   since existing debt is constantly bought and sold higher cds spreads mean the existing debt becomes ever more illiquid it means that those who do hold that debt can not price it accurately as a result of said illiquidity and can not sell it without taking a haircut   it also means that new debt can not be issued without the existing debt taking a haircut or being defaulted on because at least part of the new debt would ostensibly be used to pay off the old debt    if shares are used to securitize debt than a fall in those shares puts into question the ability to fully service that debt the collateral is the balance sheet of the debtor    mf global does n't issue their own currency they can not devalue their debt

there absolutely is a specific model that makes this so popular with so many credit card companies and that model is per transaction fees card companies also receive cost sharing incentives from certain merchants there is also a psychological reasoning as an additional incentive when you want to accept credit cards as a source of payment as a business you generally have three kinds of fees to pay monthly yearly subscription fees percentage of transaction fee and per transaction fee   the subscription fees can be waived and sometimes are expressed as a minimum cost so the business pays a certain amount whether you actually have people use credit cards or not many of these fees do n't actually make it to the credit card companies as they just pay the service providers and middle men processing companies the percentage of transaction fee means that the business accepting payment via credit card must pay a percentage usually ranging from 1 3 of the total transactions they accept so if they get paid $ 10,000 a month by customers in the form of credit cards the business pays out $ 100 300 a month to the credit card processor a good portion of which will make it back to the credit card issuing company and is a major source of income for them the per transaction fee means that every time a transaction is run involving a card a set fee is incurred by the business which is commonly anywhere from $ 0.05 to $ 0.30 per transaction if that $ 10,000 a month business mentioned previously had 10 customers paying $ 1,000 each at $ 0.10 a transaction that 's only $ 1 in fees to the credit card processors companies but if instead that business was a grocery store with an average transaction of $ 40 that 's $ 25 in fees   this system means that if you are a credit card company and want to encourage people to make a specific kind of purchase you should encourage purchases that people make many times for relatively small amounts of money in a perfect world you 'd want them to buy $ 1 bottles of water 5 times a day with their credit card if the card company had 50,000 card holders doing this at the end of 1 year the company would have $ spread across transactions the card company might reasonably make $ 0.05 per transaction and 1 of the purchase total the get rewarded for drinking more campaign might earn the card company $ in percentage fees and over $ 4.5 million in transaction fees yet the company would only have to pay 3 in rewards from the percentage fees or $ 2.7 million back to customers if the card company had encouraged using your credit card for large once yearly purchases they would actually pay out more money in rewards than they collect in card use fees yet by encouraging people to make small transactions very often the card company earns a nice net income even if absolutely every customer pays their balance in full on time and pays no annual monthly fees for their card which obviously does not happen in the real world no wonder companies try so hard to encourage you to use your card all the time for card companies to make real money they need you to use your credit card as discussed above the more often you use the card the better for them and there can be a built in preference for small repeated transactions but no matter what the size of transaction they ca n't make the big bucks if you do n't use the card at all selling your personal information is n't as profitable if they do n't have in depth info on you to sell either so how do they get you to make that plastic sing gas and groceries are a habit most people buy one or the other at least once a weak and a very large number of us make such purchases multiple times a week some people even make such purchases multiple times a day so how do people pay for such transactions the goal of the card companies is to have you use their product to pay as much as possible if you pay for something regularly you 'll keep that card in your wallet with you rather than it getting lost in a drawer at home so the card companies want you to use your card as a matter of habit too if you use a card to buy for gas and groceries why would n't you use it for other things too lunch dinner buying online if the card company pays out more and makes less for large less regular purchases then the ideal for them is to have you use the card for small regular purchase and yet still have you use the card for larger infrequent purchases even if you get reduced no rewards what better way to achieve all these goals than to offer special rewards on gas and groceries and because it 's not a one time purchase you are n't so likely to game the system no getting that special 5 cash back card booking your once per decade dream vacation then paying it off and cancelling it soon after which would actually make the card company lose money on the deal in the end credit card companies as a whole have a business model that almost universally prefers customers who use their products regularly and preferably for small amounts a maximum number of times they want to reduce their expenses like rewards paid out while maximizing their revenue they have n't figured out a better way to do all of this so well as to encourage people to use their cards for gas and groceries everything else seems like a losing proposition in comparison the only time this preference differs is when they can avoid paying some or all of the cost of rewards such as when the merchants themselves honor the rewards in exchange for reduced or zero payment from the card companies so if you use an airline card that seems to give you 10 back in airline rewards well that 's probably a great deal for the card company if the airline provides that reward at their own expense to try to boost business the card company keeps the transaction related fees and pays out almost nothing in rewards the perfect offer for them   and this assumes no shenanigans like black out periods not valid with any other offers rewards like on cars where only a fool pays full msrp and sometimes the rewards are tagged in this sort of way like not valid on sale clearance items etc expiring rewards the fact that they know not everyone uses their rewards annual fees that are greater than the rewards you 'll actually be obtaining after accounting for all the other issues etc and credit card industries are known for their shenanigans

when you say promptly paying off the outstanding balance do you mean you pay it off literally as soon as you have incurred the debt it is important to actually let the debt post on a statement before you pay it off if you pay it off before the statement posts then this wo n't help your credit at all once the statement posts you can pay the entire balance off before the due date and you will still pay no interest assuming you are allowing the balance to actually post on your statements you can simply continue to do this and your credit score will improve over time as your account(s get older and you show that you are reliable the only other way to improve your credit score is to open more accounts in the short term this will actually hurt your score as it will decrease your average age of account and add an inquiry however in the mid long term this will improve your score as having more accounts of a variety of types is better for your score having an installment loan such as an auto loan or home loan is good for your score as it is different from a credit card however you should definitely not engage in one of these unless it makes financial sense for other reasons do n't add debt just to build your credit score you could just open more credit cards like i said it will hurt your score in the short term but improve it in the mid long term open cards with a variety of benefits so you can use them for different things to get better rewards

it 's been a short while since i sold on ebay but i had a feedback rating of about 4,500 so i 've done a lot of transactions the trump card is and always will be the buyer 's ability to contact their credit card company and reverse the charges   paypal has no policy to stop this even though they claim to vigorously defend sellers from chargebacks on their website   you will lose this case 100 of the time   i do n't see how that will change if you have your own terminal   the buyer can still reverse the charges   since you know the card number maybe you can contact his credit card company but it 's probably not going to do much i 've found paypal is more seller friendly in terms of paypal claims   for example the customer has a duty to pay postage to return the product and that 's a cost for him   you also have things like online tracking which shows delivery and paypal has an ip log to see where the payments are coming from   that helped me when a buyer claimed that someone else made the payment   because people often break into someone 's house and make paypal payments for them heh you really just need to use paypal   you 'll get more customers and better prices and it will offset the losses from scammers   also about 99 of buyers are honest people   consider the scammers a cost of doing business and keep making money off of the good buyers   if you 're just pissed off that people actually scammed you get over it   do n't cut off your nose to spite your face   it 's just part of doing business on ebay

regarding auto insurance you have to look at the different parts in the united most states do require a level of specific coverage for all drivers that is to make sure that if you are at fault there is money available to pay the victims that payment may be for damage to their car or other property but it also covers medical costs many policies also cover you if the other driver does n't have insurance the policy that covers the loss of the vehicle is required if you have a loan or are leasing the car somebody else owns it while there is a loan so they can and do require you to pay to protect the vehicle   if there i no loan you do n't have to have that portion of a policy other parts such as towing assistance and rental cars replacement may be required by the insurance standards for your state or might be almost impossible to drop because all insurance companies include it to stay competitive with their competition   dropping the non required parts of the coverage is acceptable when you do n't have a loan some people do drop it to save money but that does mean you are self insuring if you can afford to self insure a new car great the interesting thing is that some people have more than enough assets to self the non required part of auto insurance but then they realize that they do need to up their umbrella liability insurance this is to protect them from somebody deciding that their resources make them a tempting target when they are involved in a collision

sometimes when you are trying to qualify for a loan the lender will ask for proof of your account balances and costs your scheme here could be cause for some questions why are you paying $ 20 30k to your credit card each month is there a large debt you have n't disclosed or perhaps if you lost your job would you be able to afford to continue to pay $ 20 30k of course this is n't a real expense and you can stop whenever you want but still as a lender i would want to understand this fully before loaning to someone who really does need to pay $ 20 30k per month who knows this might hiding some troublesome issues like perhaps a side business is failing and you 're trying to keep it afloat

tax advantaged accounts mean you pay less tax you fundamentally pay less tax on iras and 401ks than other accounts that 's their benefit you keep more money at the expense of the government it makes sense for the government to limit it if you do n't understand why you pay less tax you must consider the time value of money the principal now is the same value of money as the principal + earnings later with iras and 401ks you only pay income tax once with roth iras and 401ks you pay tax on the entire amount of money once when you earn it with pre tax traditional iras and 401ks you pay tax on the entire amount of money once when withdraw it however with outside accounts you have to pay tax more than once you pay once when you earn it and pay tax again on the earnings later earnings that grew from money that was already taxed which when considering time value means that the earnings have already been taxed but is taxed again for things like savings in a bank it 's even worse interest which grew from money already taxed is taxed every year which means some money you pay tax on n times if you have it in there n years if you do n't understand the above you can see with an example we start with $ 1000 pre tax wages and for simplicity will assume a flat 25 income tax rate and a growth rate of 10 per year and get the cash assume it 's a qualified withdrawal in 10 years

both are saying essentially the same thing   the forbes articles says as much as 20 up to a maximum of $ 50,000   this means the same as what the irs page when it says the lesser of a percentage of your income or a total of $ 53,000   in other words the $ 53k is a cap you can contribute a percentage of your earnings but you can never contribute more than $ 53k even if you make so much money that 20 of your earnings would be more than that the difference between 20 and 25 in the two sources appears to reflect a difference in contribution limits depending on whether you are making contributions for employees or for yourself as a self employed individual see publication 560   the difference between $ 50k and $ 53k is due to the two pages being written in different years the limits increase each year

i do n't know why stocks in some industries tend to have lower prices per share than others it does n't really matter much whether a company has shares selling for $ 100 each or 10,000,000 shares selling for $ 10 each either way the total value is the same companies generally like to keep the share price relatively low so that if someone wants to buy a small amount they can like if the price was $ 10,000 per share than an investor with less than $ 10,000 to put in that one stock would be priced out of the market if it 's $ 10 then if someone wants $ 10 they can buy one share and if someone wants $ 10,000 they can buy 1000 shares as to why energy stocks are volatile i can think of several reasons one in our current world energy is highly susceptible to politics a lot of the world 's energy comes from the middle east which is a notoriously unstable region any time there 's conflict there energy supplies from the region become uncertain oil producing countries may embargo countries that they do n't like a war will at the very least interfere with transportation and shipping and may result in oil wells being destroyed etc two energy is consumed when you use it and most consumers have very limited ability to stockpile so you 're constantly buying the energy you need as you need it so if demand goes down it is reflected immediately compare this to say clothing most people expect to keep the same clothes for years wearing them repeatedly hopefully washing them now and then so if for some reason you decided today that you only need three red shirts instead of four this might not have any immediate impact on your buying it could be months before you would have bought a new red shirt anyway there is a tendency for the market to react rather slowly to changes in demand for shirts but with energy if you decide you only need to burn 3 gallons of gas per week instead of 4 your consumption goes down immediately within days three really adding to number two energy is highly perishable especially some forms of energy if a solar power station is capable of producing 10 but today there is only demand for 9 you ca n't save the unused for some future time when demand is higher it 's gone you can charge a battery with it but that 's pretty limited you can pile up coal or store natural gas in a tank until you need it but you ca n't save the output of a power plant note numbers two and three also apply to food which is why food production is also very volatile

is it common in the us not to pay medical bills or do i misunderstood what had been said i would feel comfortable saying that most people who face medical bills do n't pay them   they are unable   if they were able they would have gotten medical insurance   in america something like 55 of individuals do not have even $ 500 of savings so when a big medical bill rolls in especially on top of lost work hours they do n't have a lot of options   hospitals charge reasonable prices to insurance companies and medicare these fees are negotiated in advance and reflect the hospital 's actual costs   this is called usual reasonable and customary   hospitals charge a wildly inflated criminally outrageous cash price to the uninsured for instance back when medicare paid about $ 175 for an ambulance ride a friend was billed $ 1100 for the exact same thing    the hospital aims to scare the living out of the patient caring nothing about what that does to their health perfect world the patient pays them the $ 1100 instead of paying their rent   if the patient puts up a fight they hope to haggle them down to something like $ 400 remember it really costs $ 175 this tactic is a huge profit center for hospitals even the charity hospitals and they feel justified because so many uninsured do n't pay at all the hospital considers them deadbeats well patients do n't pay because cash prices are so they just give up anyway your friends are correct do n't even think of paying those cash billing amounts research and find out what medicare pays offer 60 of that and haggle it to 100   and sleep well knowing you paid what is fair not all services are as overpriced as my example but most are at least 50 too high   the hospital does send you all the bills as a formality even while they submit them to your insurance company and then the insurance company usually pays them so it is correct to not pay that bill a lot of medical offices will check with your insurance company even before you leave the office and ask you to immediately pay anything the insurance wo n't cover   for instance they often have co pays where you pay $ 20 and they pay the rest to be clear if your insurance company negotiates a rate with the hospital say $ 185 for the ambulance ride that is your price which you are entitled to as a member of that insurance system a lot of people get their livelihood from the inefficiency in medical insurance and billing   their political power is why it 's so hard for america to install a simpler system or even replace obamacare in an ideal political environment   it is also a big part of why america spends 18 of gdp on healthcare instead of 7 11 like our european peers who do not have to account for every or multiple insurers   sorting out who pays would be expensive even if everyone did pay

assuming that you accept the premise that technical analysis is legitimate and useful it makes sense that it might not work for a small market or at the very least that it would n't be the same for a small market as it is for a large market   the reason for this is that a large stock market like the u.s. stock market is as close to a perfect market as you will find compare this to a small market in a small country market information is harder to get because there are not as many media outlets covering the news there are n't as many participants and possibly it might be more expensive to participate in and there might be more regulatory intervention than with the large market   all of these things can affect the prices the closer you get to a perfect market the closer you get to a point where the prices of the stocks reflect the true value of the companies without external forces affecting prices

cash back from credit cards is handled separately than the rest of the purchase i.e. interest begins accumulating on that day and likely at a higher rate and usually comes out of a lower limit than the credit allotted to that card given all these differences and the obvious revenue generation situation for the lender it makes sense for them to give the store an incentive rather than penalize them further for the use of such a feature   note i am not privy to the inner workings or agreements between large stores and credit lenders so i can not guarantee any of this

while debt increases the likelihood and magnitude of a crash speculation excess supply and other market factors can result in crashes without requiring excessive debt a popular counter example of crashes due to speculation is 16th century dutch tulip mania   the dot com bubble is a more recent example of a speculative crash there were debt related issues for some companies and the run ups in stock prices were increased by leveraged traders but the actual crash was the result of failures of start up companies to produce profits while all tech stocks fell together sound companies with products and profits survive today as for recessions they are simply periods of time with decreased economic activity recessions can be caused by financial crashes decreased demand following a war or supply shocks like the oil crisis in the 1970 's in summary debt is simply a it can increase profits just as easily as can increase losses the real problems with crashes and recessions are often related to unfounded faith in increasing value and unexpected changes in demand

that was n't an inheritance that arrived out of the blue and the bank contacted your girlfriend by email was it a uk tax code is basically an assessment of how much money you can earn in the uk before you have to pay tax on it basically it 's a coding for a tax allowance and as a uk tax payer hmrc the uk version of the irs gives you one for free if your girlfriend is not a uk tax payer she should get the necessary paperwork to show that she is n't although i 'm not sure if that 's got any bearing on inheritance tax there are no lawyers involved in that process normally any appropriately accredited accountant can do that for you in the uk if you 're not in the uk when i had to apply for a change of tax status in the uk it certainly did n't cost me $ to do so via my accountant there in fact the whole thing cost a few pounds to pay for my accountant 's time and that was it in fact that whole thing smells fishy to me as someone who used to live in the uk care to divulge the name and possibly address of the bank here 's inheritance tax information straight from the horse 's mouth that should clear up any questions if your girlfriend is even liable for any inheritance tax in the uk in the first place and then given the sums involved get the recommendation for a good lawyer and a good accountant in the uk or an accountant who can recommend a lawyer to make sure that that end of the transfer goes smoothly

it 's an effective way to achieve market segmentation without having to ask your customers how rich they are and you get the benefit of finding out additional information like their address email etc the principle is similar to coupons on cereal boxes anybody can get the rebate discount if they go to the effort but people who are cash rich time poor are less likely to do so than those that really need the money joel wrote about this and various other pricing mechanisms a while back i like to reference the article every few weeks it 's well worth a read now if you 're retired and living off of social security $ 7 an hour sounds pretty good so you do it but if you 're a stock analyst at merrill lynch getting paid $ a year to say nice things about piece of junk internet companies working for $ 7 an hour is a joke and you 're not going to clip coupons heck in one hour you could issue buy recommendations on ten piece of junk internet companies so coupons are a way for consumer products companies to charge two different prices and effectively segment their market into two mail in rebates are pretty much the same as coupons with some other like the fact that they reveal your address so you can be direct marketed to in the future

it 's worth noting that there have been several studies with differing results for minimum wage in general and now specifically for seattle it 's unwise to take any single one as the study best to look at them all in context   i think the broad consensus is that there 's an elasticity of somewhere between and   so a minimum wage increase of 10 will lead to a decrease in employment of somewhere between 0.5 and 2     it just comes down to how you value the tradeoff between higher wages for the working and fewer hours worked and where you place that elasticity   i think there 'd be pretty broad support if you could double the minimum wage and only see a 5 decline in hours worked

i would add only and you alluded in this direction but to clarify that barter economies rarely ever exist if you ask an economist about the origin of money they usually offer thus barter to credit story because adam smith this line of development it subsequently became true even though there was no evidence for it    anthropology has come a long way since smith lived and we now know that early societies were communal as in from each according to their means etc the term of art is gift economy where there are no or of who owes exactly what but rather a general sense of mutual obligation   accounting credit and debt as we think of them were a result of dealing with people you did not trust money being a debt arose from this mistrust and was typically only used to settle the most serious matters stolen wives murder etc in a way that could prevent deadly conflict by protecting the honor of the money was intended to replace the lost person    money debt and the rest have come in and out of fashion over the ages the efficiency argument is really null if you consider a gift economy and there have been prolonged periods since the first use of metallic money in which money has gone away for most of the middle ages for example europe reverted to credit and gift economies believe in fact that the use of money comes to typically prevail in societies that are rife with mistrust and lost persons that is societies plagued by war and slavery slaves being historically one of the primary products of war the rise of money usually brings the rise of a creditor class a debtor class who approximate slaves even though not losers in war per se and a terrific amount of social strife and that leads often to collapse if not addressed by periodic debt

do n't ever quantify a stock 's preference performance just based on the dividend it is paying out volatility defined by movements in the the stock 's price affected by factors embedded in the stock e.g. the corporation the business it is in the economy the management etc etc apple was n't paying dividends but people were still buying into it same with amazon berkshire google these companies create value by investing their earnings back into their company and this is reflected in their share prices their earnings create more value in this way for the stockholders the holding structures of these companies also help them in their motives supposedly $ 100 invested in either stocks for keeping things easy you invested at the same time in both single annual dividend and prices more or less remain constant company a $ 5/share at 20 annual dividend yield   dividend = $ 20 company b $ 10/share at 20 annual dividend yield   dividend = $ 20 you receive the same dividend in both cases volatility affect you unless you are trading or the stock market tanks or some very bad news comes out of either company or on the economy volatility in the long term averages out except in specific outlier cases e.g. lehman bankruptcy and the financial crash which are rare but do happen in general case the price movements in both stocks would more or less follow the markets not exactly though except when relevant news for either corporations come out

a simple way to ask the question might be to say why ca n't i just use the same trick with my own shares to make money on the way down why is borrowing someone else 's shares necessary to make the concept a viable one why is n't it just the inverse of going long a simple way to think about it is this to make money by trading something you must buy it for less than you sell it for   this applies to stocks like anything else   if you believe the price will go up then you can buy them first and sell them later for a higher price   but if you believe the price will go down the only way to buy low and sell high is to sell first and buy later   if you buy the stock and it goes down any sale you make will lose you money i 'm still not sure i fully understand the point of your example but one thing to note is that in both cases i.e. whether you buy the share back at the end or not you lost money   you say that you made $ 5 on the share price dropping but that is n't true at all you can see in your example that your final account balance is negative in both cases   you paid $ 20 for the shares but only got $ 15 back you lost $ 5 or in the other version of your example paid $ 20 and got back $ 5 plus the depreciated shares if you had bought the shares for $ 20 and sold them for say $ 25 then your account would end up with a positive $ 5 balance that is what a gain would look like   but you ca n't achieve that if you buy the shares for $ 20 and later sell them for less at a guess you seem to be confusing the concept of making a profit with the concept of cutting your losses   it is true that if you buy the shares for $ 20 and sell them for $ 15 you lose only $ 5 whereas if you buy them for $ 20 and sell for $ 10 you lose the larger amount of $ 10   but those are both losses   selling early as the price goes down does n't make you any money it just stops you from losing more money than you would if you sold later
