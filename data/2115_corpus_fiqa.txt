i think the question relates to the discussion here it was always the case that merchants could discount purchases made with cash   what was n't allowed is allowing the merchant to charge extra for credit card transactions presumably to cover the fees the merchants pay   these fees usually carry a flat fee per transaction plus around 2 of the purchase price   what also was n't allowed was them to refuse any credit transactions   people could charge a pack of gum even if the fees put that transaction in the red what 's allowed according to this new development is different levels of discounting for different credit cards somewhat related to this discussion is another development that happened this summer merchants now have the ability to refuse credit card transactions of less than $ 10 here 's my feeling on all of this   i think we 'll see merchants imposing minimum credit transaction amounts before we see them at the 1 2 level on pricing for different types of credit cards   my feeling is that they 'd be wise not to change anything even though they can   refusing transactions or charging more for others is going to come as a unpleasant shock to enough people that they may take their business elsewhere

emv cards use an offline transaction counter to increase security this counter is maintained inside the card and every time a transaction is confirmed by the card for online contact transactions the card will usually receive feedback from its issuer which among other actions will reset that counter to zero for offline transactions the card will increment the counter by one each time it is used for contactless transactions things are a bit different since contactless transactions usually do not maintain a connection between the card and the terminal long enough to transmit issuer feedback to the card the counter can not be reset that way the counter will therefore even be for online transactions the implications of this are dependent on what your issuer is actually doing with the contents of the offline counter some issuers use this as a safety measure for contactless cards and allow only a limited number of contactless transactions since those usually do not require any cardholder verification method below a certain threshold e.g. 25 € in many european countries and the total risk in case of physical card theft can therefore be limited to < number of offline contactless transaction usually you would have to use your card in a contact based transaction to reset the counter and the terminal would display an according notice it is indeed strange that the terminal instead requested your pin if this happens again you could try to use your card once via the contact interface and see if this resets your offline counters and allows you to pay without pin entry for the next few transactions

i support the strategy to buy a less expensive car at the outset and then save for that more expensive car you mentioned that you would be able to save $ 9000 by the time you had to start making payments that sounds like a great budget for car shopping for $ 9k you can get a dependable used car   if you find the right high yield savings account you can get around 2 on your $ 500/month direct deposit that 's a difference of about 5 when you add in the 2.9 interest that you would have been paying on the loan you ca n't find such a low risk investment that would yield 5 these days   also at that rate 2 you would have $ saved up in less than 52 months or over $ in 60 months then you could buy a bmw with cash and i 'm sure they would give you a cash discount alternatively you could be just finishing paying off the loan and might already be looking at the next car you 'll take a loan out for the point is not that you have to completely deprive yourself for the rest of your life but by not taking out a loan you were certainly come out ahead in 5 10 years time   also one common mistake that new grads make is thinking that they are rich right out of college yes you definitely have a nice salary and could afford it by most people 's standards   i have a coworker that graduated and started work a year ago he first bought a brand new subaru why subaru i do not know but that is what he thought he wanted after driving the car for a few months he decided for a few reasons that it was not what he wanted so he sold the car for a loss and bought a slightly used nissan z. he has since decided that he needs a more practical car for day to day driving to minimize the abuse that his z takes so he has bought another car this time a low budget honda had he started with a low budget car he could be driving the same car to work right now but have a good chunk of savings for a new car instead of a loan and a car that he drives only occasionally

keep in mind there are a couple of points to ponder here rates are really low with rates being so low unless there is deflation it is pretty easy to see even moderate inflation of 1 2 being enough to eat the yield completely which would be why the returns are negative inflation is still relatively contained with inflation low there is no reason for the central banks to raise rates which would give new bonds a better rate thus this changes in cpi are still in the range where central banks want to be with their policy which means rates are low which if lower than inflation rates would give a negative real return which would be seen as a way to trigger more spending since putting the money into treasury debt will lose money to inflation in terms of purchasing power a good question to ponder is has this happened before in the history of the world and what could we learn from that point in time the idea for investors would be to find alternative holdings for their cash and bonds if they want to beat inflation though there are some inflation indexed bonds that are n't likely appearing in the chart that could also be something to add to the picture here

this is your best answer so far a detail left out is that derivatives are mostly known for the amount of leverage allowed which is typically about 20 1 or 5 down this is legal because it 's generally assumed that someone is not going to buy or sell the underlying asset that they will offset their long or short position long before the contract 's delivery date your derivative futures instead of forwards because they 're a standardized size traded on an exchange and more liquid will call you when you lose about half of your 5 to tell you to either transfer some money to cover your position or to ask you to exit your position at a loss   are traded through clearinghouses not exchanges and they can be for any underlying asset for any delivery date for any price so long as parties agree on it just think of it as a contract

this is a misconception one of the explanations is that if you buy at the ask price and want    to sell it right away you can only sell at the bid price this is incorrect there are no two separate bid and ask prices the price you buy your bid is the same price someone else sells their sell the same goes when you sell the price you sell at is the price someone else buys there 's no spread with stocks emphasized it on purpose because many people especially those who gamble on stock exchange without knowing what they 're doing do n't understand how the stock market works on the stock exchange the transaction price is the match between the bid price and the ask price thus on any given transaction bid always equals ask there 's no spread there is spread with commodities if you buy it directly especially contracts mutual funds and other kinds of transactions that go through a third party the difference spread is that third party 's fee for assuming part of the risk in the transaction and is indeed added to your cost indirectly in the way you described these transactions do n't go directly between a seller and a buyer for example there 's no buyer when you redeem some of your mutual fund the fund pays you money so the fund assumes certain risk which is why there 's a spread in the prices to invest and to redeem similarly with commodities when you buy a gold bar you buy it from a dealer who needs to keep a stock thus the dealer will not buy from you at the same price there 's a premium on sale and a discount on buy which is a spread to compensate the dealer for the risk of keeping a stock

will 2 millions dollars check to be cash will a bank convert a check to cash   in my experience no   even for small checks    unless you happen to have a very good relationship with your banker read as have an existing large bank balance    the exception is if you go to the bank the check is drawn on    but even then i doubt they 'll cash a $ 2 m dollar check can you deposit a $ 2 m dollar check   most definitely how long will 2 millions dollars check to be cash depends on your bank 's policies relationship with you and the origination of the check   you 'll need to talk to the exact bank in question to find out   some guidelines from my own experiences out of country checks will take quite awhile say 4 weeks even for trivial amounts   i 'm not sure what a $ 2 m size would do    beyond that situation it will likely depend on whether you have more money than the check 's worth in your bank accounts   if so they may be willing to give you cash in a few days   or if you only want some of the money as cash in a few days that might be possible if the bank could n't cash for him will the bank give him some of cash    for example $ 500,000 for now and the rest wait to be cash at later    time like 24 hours or 1 week unless you already have a lot of money in your relationship with the bank i think it is highly unlikely they will let you have any of the money in 24 hours   you might get some of it in a week    the issue will be that such a large check will be viewed as having a high chance of being fraudulent so they will want to be exceptionally conservative

one approach would be to create journal entries that debit asset accounts that are associated with these items and credit an open balance equity account the value of these contributions would have to be worked out with an accountant as it depends on the lesser of the adjusted basis vs. the fair market value as you then depreciate the amounts over time to take the depreciation as a business expense and it adjusts your basis in the company to calculate capital gains losses when you sell if there were multiple partners or your accountant wants it this way you could then debit open balance equity and credit the owner 's contribution to a capital account in your name that represents your basis when you sell from a pure accounting perspective if the open balance equity account would zero out you could just skip it and directly credit the capital accounts but i prefer the open balance equity as it helps know the percentages of initial equity which may influence partner ownership percentages and identify anyone who needs to contribute more to the partnership

there are several reasons why credit cards are popular in the us on the other hand debit cards do not have any of these going for them   a debit card does n't make much money for the bank unless you overdraw or something so banks do n't have incentive to push you to use them as much   as a result they do n't offer rewards other benefits some people say the ability to spend more than you have is a downside of a credit card   but it 's really an upside   the behavior of doing that when it is n't needed is bad but that 's not the card 's fault it 's the users   you can get a credit card with a very small limit if this is an issue for you the question i find interesting is why debit cards are more popular in your home country   i ca n't think of any advantage they offer besides free cash back   but most people in the us do n't use cash much either   i have to think in your home country the banks have a different revenue model or perhaps your country is n't as eager to offer tons of easy credit to everyone as the us is

i 'm a not an accountant   but my feeling has been that the distinction between asset and liability is mainly a sign convention and comes from a wish to avoid negative numbers suppose you take out a loan for $ 1000 and deposit the proceeds in your bank account   under normal accounting conventions your bank account is an asset and the loan is a liability   after the loan bank has a balance of 1000 and loan has a balance of 1000   you can compute your net worth by adding all assets and subtracting all liabilities so in this case your net worth remains 0 if you treat loan as an asset account then after taking out the loan you should give it a balance of   under this convention you have lots of negative numbers to deal with everywhere which i suspect early accountants would have found inconvenient   the asset liability convention means you only need to deal with negative numbers in unusual situations overdrawn bank account overpaid loan etc likewise in theory you could treat expense accounts as negative income but i 'm not sure why you feel the need to reinvent the wheel by simplifying double entry accounting like this   the standard conventions are not that complicated and their major advantage is that they 're standard other people will be able to understand your books if they ever need to   say you want to hire somebody to do your taxes at some point if your books are kept in your own idiosyncratic system their job will be at best error prone and at worst impossible    it 's a bit like a proposal to simplify english spelling a this mit bee in sum but if can reed it it

i 'll play devils advocate even though i agree that they are overvalued   eps is expected to go from in 2016 to $ 1.20 2017 followed by $ 1.90 in 2018 this means they are expected to grow at 110 a year over the next two years an many experts think they will continue to grow at 30 40 a year after that now many people do n't think a stock is expensive until it hits a pe of 2x its growth rate if we use a growth rate of 110 then they won pay more than earnings assuming they are using this years earnings estimates since the year is already more than half over that puts a valuation of $ per share if they use a 4 year estimates that eps will grow at 72 a year the valuation is $   before people me i do n't value stocks in this manner i use dcf but alot of people who are looking for an easy way out will look at it this way

cheaper would refer to the fees of a fund rather than the share price imo are 2 quarters worth more or less than 10 nickels this is another way to express your question though most open end funds bought directly from the fund family or through fund supermarkets would do fractional shares that may be better than going through etfs though there can be some brokers like sharebuilder that used to do fractional shares though not necessarily having the best execution as i recall

run your credit reports for the 3 major agencies to find out which of them have the debt was reported on and initiate the dispute process with each agency that reports the invalid debt this will cause the person who put it on the report to either prove that it is valid or remove it from your report ignoring debt collector calls is not a good option regardless of whether the debt is valid they obviously think the debt is yours so their response is naturally to put it on your credit report in most cases it is a good idea to respond in writing that it is not your debt i doubt you have much recourse against the creditor for one thing they did try to contact you and you dodged them that is not their fault secondly it is unlikely you would prevail unless you could prove that they maliciously put false information on your credit or through gross incompetence did so more likely is that they are you to a debt from someone with a similar name or there is an accounting error somewhere or possibly you owe the debt and no one ever sent you a bill it happens with medical bills all the time

here are the top in my recent experience in highest first order child care by far the biggest potential cost is childcare whether this be a full time nursery child minder live in nanny au pair or just paying a baby sitter when parents need a night off this needs careful thought in london full time nursery school 6 months to 4 years old varies from 500 to 2000 per month and the amount you pay does not guarantee the quality of the care education if you have relatives nearby these costs can likely be reduced but you 'd really need to pay the relatives somehow meals bling holidays a new bathroom etc loss of earnings whether the mother goes on maternity leave or the father gives up his job to be a house husband the family income is going to be affected for a period of time you can plan for this by researching what government or company benefits the mother or father will get and for how long i suggest dividing this amount evenly across the whole period that the stay at home parent will be off rather than trying to calculate 2 months full pay 2 months half pay 2 month 's no pay because if you get into a pattern of high spending in the first two months what will happen for the next 4 months you also need to consider short notice time off work when anybody is poorly i suggest reserving some of your vacation time for unexpectedly have to look after the family time when children start daycare nursery the cross so you get some really nasty strains of and flu in the house which could cause the primary to be unable to do their caring without your help bigger car if you ca n't get a baby seat into your car because it does n't have the proper fittings or does n't have rear seats you 'll likely need to change your car there are plenty of cars that are bigger in terms of people space without being more expensive but it 'll cost to change insurances if you have health insurance e.g. us you 're going to have a proportional increase call your provider for details bear in mind that children have more illnesses and accidents than middle age parents so it could be a shock some parents take out life insurance to provide for their childrens financial future in case of the worst happening this can be around 50 usd per month but it all depends on the lump sum you 're insuring for equipment as a new parent you think you need an incredible amount of equipment such as changing station cot basket carry chair car seat travel cot feeding chair changing mat baby bath etc when you bring a new baby home you really only need a wipe clean changing mat and somewhere safe for baby to sleep you can buy anything else as you need it in fact it gives you more perspective to go shopping once you 've had the baby whatever you buy keep the receipt and do n't open it until you need it much easier to take back the e.g. portable baby bottle warmer if you did n't open it because baby is breast fed when they become bigger 2 months plus you 'll need a cot invest in an adjustable cot bed it 's a bit larger than a regular cot and the floor lowers as they get bigger so you only need one for the first 2.5 to 3 years food if baby will have formula there are baby milk formula calculators on the web in summary one box of quality formula is usd and this lasts around 4 days if fully formula fed once they 're onto food you need to factor in baby food options you can either make your own by side lining some of the adult meal and it then putting it into individual plastic containers this takes effort so not everyone has the energy alternatively you 're going to have to buy baby food in jars packets or boxes for 3 meals a day and there 'll be little snacks in between baby snacks are strangely expensive so recommend fruit budget for 5 usd per day until they 're eating a small portion of the family meal clothes a new baby really only needs vests all in one suits for warmth you can go mad buying cute outfits but they get limited use as a new baby grows really quickly if you 've a lot of family friends and you have a tradition of some kind of good luck party baby shower then you can find that you end up being given lots of things if you do n't know the sex of the baby ask people to get you a gift receipt if possible such that you do n't get blue clothes for a girl it may not bother you but its a pain when people say is a strange name for a boy just because your little girl has blue child your home this really does not have to cost a lot some people go mad putting soft corners on all the hard edges covering the electrical and generally the whole home it 's up to you but if there 's a room full of sharp poisonous things like a kitchen or utility room you might want to put a 15 usd baby gate on that room putting the or sharp things up high or stored away in the attic is a sensible move too

i 'd check the terms of the student loan it 's been a long time since i had a student loan but when i did it had restrictions that it could only be used for educational expenses which they pretty clear spelled out meant tuition books lab fees i think some provision for living expenses if your student loan is subsidized by the government they 're not going to let you use it to start a business or go on vacation nor are they likely to let you invest it even if it is legal and within the terms of the contract borrowing money to invest is very risky what if you invest in the stock market and then the stock market goes down you may find you do n't have the money to make the payments on the loan people do this sort of thing all the time that 's what buying on margin is all about and some of them lose a bundle and get in real trouble

lets look at possible use cases if you ever converted your cryptocurrency to cash on a foreign exchange then yes you had to report that means if you ever and the us dollar or other fiat amount was $ 10,000 or greater when you went out of crypto then you need to report because the regulations stipulate you need to report over $ 10,000 at any point in the year if you did not convert your cryptocurrency to cash and only had them on an exchange 's servers perhaps traded for other cryptocurrency pairs then no this did not fall under the regulations example in 2013 i wanted to cash out of a cryptocurrency that did n't have a usd market in the united states but i did n't want to go to cash on a foreign exchange specifically for this reason amongst others so i sold my litecoin on btc e slovakia for bitcoin and then i sold the bitcoin on coinbase usa   even though btc e had a litecoin usd market and then i could day trade the swings easily to make more capital gains but i wanted cash in my bank account and did n't want the reporting overhead read the regulations yourself financial instruments that are reportable cash fiat securities futures and options also whether it is just in the blockchain or on a server irs and fincen said bitcoin is not reportable on fbar when they update their guidance it 'll be in the news the director of fincen is very active in cryptocurrency developments and guidance bitcoin has been around for six years it is n't that esoteric and the government is n't that confused on what it is irs and fincen 's hands are tied by congress in how to more realistically categorize cryptocurrency although at this point in time there are several very liquid exchanges within the united states such as the one nyse ice hosts coinbase

i 'm not familiar with the law and taxes in india but can provide guidance based on general accounting and tax principles you are right that receiving money as a loan is not income and is n't liable to income tax therefore i suggest you actually this loan through a written contract with your friend the contract should include all the usual elements of a loan amount interest even if preferential or zero principal term consequences of default and currency of loan you can then simply state the purpose of transfer as personal loan agreement if you have such a document and are questioned by tax authorities you can easily show that the inward remittance is from a loan and should therefore be treated like any commercial loan for tax purposes as long as you disclose the debt in your tax return if required in india and your friend discloses any interest received as income i think you 'll be above board and wo n't be liable for any income tax to make sure you might be better off having a quick consultation with an accountant or tax specialist in india to advise you and draft the loan agreement

yes it 's a gross over simplification we can certainly agree on that   you do n't need a degree to make a good living defined as 50k+ work for you this is a popular lie that was fed to young people which aided in creating this student loan crisis in the first place truck drivers construction workers skilled laborers in general etc make good money right put of hs of course it can be difficult to land one of these jobs but working as say a dock worker for $ 10 12 for a few years and working your way up to a higher paying job is a fantastic route to in this case that would likely be a truck driver this requires some school and a license but every semi major company will pay for that if you 've been working for them for a few years and they can trust you the issue that is far too prevalent is that kids either are n't getting a reasonable education or they are n't graduating from topics for another day probably    school costs have gone up because the govt was a loan to everyone with a pulse    i 'm with you on education public education is an abject failure we have failed to educate our youth and minimum wage laws price those poorly educated unskilled right out of the job market i 'll leave the rest of the third paragraph alone as i think we differ in fundamental values that neither of us are likely to change and a discussion of those values would be

i 'll compare it to a situation that is different but will involve the same cash flow   imagine the buyer agrees that you buy only 70 of the house right now and the remaining 30 in 7 years time   it would be obviously fair to pay 70 of today 's value today pay 30 of a reasonable rent for 7 years because 30 of the house is n't owned by you then pay 30 of the value that the house has in 7 years time 30 of the value in 7 years is the same as 30 of the value today plus 30 of whatever the house gained in value   instead you pay 70 of today 's value you pay no rent for the 30 that you do n't own then in 7 years time you pay 30 of today 's value plus 50 of whatever the house gained in value so you are basically exchanging 30 of seven years rent plus interest for 20 of the gain in value over 7 years which might be zero or might be very little or a lot in which case you are still better off    obviously you need to set up a bullet proof contract a lawyer will also tell you what to put into the contract in case the house burns down and ca n't be rebuilt or you add an extension to the home which increases the value   and keep in mind that this is a good deal if the house does n't increase in value but if the house increases in value a lot you benefit anyway a situation where the worse the deal turns out to be after 7 years the better the result for you in addition the relative carries the risk of non payment which the bank obviously is not willing to do

they do n't actually need to they accept deposits for historical reasons and because they make money doing so but there 's nothing key to their business that requires them to do so here 's a decent summary but i 'll explain in great detail below by making loans banks create money this is what we mean when we say the monetary supply is at least if you believe sir king who used to run england 's central bank the only real checks on this are regulatory capitalization requirements and reserve requirements which impose a sort of tax on a bank 's circulating loans i 'll get into that later let 's start with why should you believe that story that loans create deposits it seems like a bizarre assertion but it actually matches how banks behave in practice if you go borrow money from a bank the loan officer will do many things she 'll want to look at your credit history she 'll want to look at your income and assets she 'll want to look at what kind of collateral or guarantees you 're providing that the loan will be repaid what she will not do is call down to the vaults and make sure that there 's enough bills stacked up for them to lend out loans are judged based on a profitability function determined by the interest rate and the loan risk if those add up to profitable the bank makes the loan so the limiting factor on the loans a bank makes are the available creditworthy borrowers not the bank 's stock of cash further the story makes sense because loans are how banks make money if a bank that was short of money suddenly stopped making loans it 'd be screwed no new loans = no way to make money to pay back depositors and also keep the lights on = no more bank and the story is believable because of the way banks make so little effort to solicit commercial deposit business oh sure they used to give you a free toaster if you opened an account but now it 's really quite challenging to find a no fee checking account that does n't impose a super high deposit limit and the interest paid on savings deposits is approaching zero if banks actually needed your deposits they 'd be making a lot more of effort to get them i mean they wo n't turn up their noses your deposited allowance is a couple basis points cheaper to the bank than borrowing from the fed but banks seem to value small potatoes depositors more as a source of fees and sales opportunities for services and consumer credit than as a source of cash it 's a bit different if you get north of seven figures but smaller depositors are n't really worth the hassle just for their cash this is where someone will mention the regulatory requirements of fractional reserve banking banks are obliged by regulators to keep enough cash on hand to pay out a certain percentage of deposits note nothing about loans was said in that statement this requirement does not serve as a check on the bank making bad loans because the bank is ultimately liable to all its depositors for the full value of their deposits it 's more making sure they have enough liquidity to prevent bank runs the self fulfilling prophecy in which an bank could be forced into bankruptcy as you noted in your question banks can always borrow from the fed at the fed discount rate or from other banks at the interbank overnight rate which is a little lower to meet this requirement they do have to pledge collateral but loans themselves are collateral so this does n't present much of a problem in terms of paying off depositors if the bank should collapse and minimizing the amount of fdic insurance payout from the government it 's really capital requirements that are actually important i.e. the bank has to have investors who do n't have a right to be paid back and whose investment is on the hook if the bank goes belly up but that 's just a safeguard for the depositors it does n't really have anything to do with loans other than that bad loans are the main reason a bank might go under banks like any other private business have assets things of value and liabilities obligations to other people but banking assets and liabilities are counterintuitive the bank 's assets are loans because they are theoretically recoverable the principal and also generate a revenue stream the interest payments the money the bank holds in deposits is actually a liability because it has to pay that money out to depositors on demand and the deposited money will never by itself bring the bank any revenue at all in fact it 's a drain because the bank needs to pay interest to its depositors well they used to anyway so what happens when a bank makes a loan from a balance sheet perspective strangely enough the answer is nothing at all if i grant you a loan the minute we shake hands and you sign the paperwork a teller types on a keyboard and money appears in your account your account with my bank my bank has simultaneously created an asset the loan you now have to repay me and an equal sized liability the funds i loaned you which are now deposited in your account i 'll make money on the deal because the interest you owe me is a much higher rate than the interest i pay on your deposits or the rate i 'd have to pay if i need to borrow cash to cover your withdrawal i might just have the cash on hand anyway from interest and origination fees and whatnot from previous loans from an accounting perspective nothing has happened to my balance sheet but suddenly you owe me closing costs and a stream of extraneous interest payments nice work if you can get it okay so i 've demonstrated that i do n't need to take deposits to make loans but we live in a world where banks do here 's a few reasons you can probably think of more but at the end of the day a bank should be designed so that if every single non borrowing depositor withdrew their deposits the bank would n't collapse or cease to exist

what is the best way that i can invest money so that i can always get    returns if you want something that does n't require any work on your end consider having a fee only financial planner make a plan so that your investments can be automated to generate a cash flow for you or get an annuity as the other classic choices here as most other choices will require some time commitment in one form or other note that for stock investments there could be rare instances like what happened for a week in september in 2001 where the markets were closed for 5 days straight that can be the hiccup in having stocks bonds can carry a risk of default where there have been municipalities that defaulted on debt as well as federal governments like russia in the 1990s real estate may be subject to natural disasters or other market forces that may prevent there always being a monthly payment coming as if you own a rental property then what happens if there are n't tenants because there was an evacuation of the area there may be some insurance products to cover some of these cases though what if there are exceptionally high claims all at once that may have an insurance company go under would it be to set up an fd in a bank to buy land to buy a rental    house to buy a field or maybe to purchase gold   what investment of your own time do you plan on making here both in terms of understanding what your long term strategy is and then the maintenance of the plan if you put the money in the bank are you expecting that the interest rate will always be high enough to give you sufficient cash to live as well as having no financial crisis with the bank or currency you are using are there any better investments you may want to reconsider what assumptions you want to make and what risks you want to accept as there is n't likely to be a single solution here that would be perfect

you can register a limited company and leave it dormant that 's no problem you just need to make sure that later on you notify hmrc within 3 months of any trading activity as pointed out you can register a company in a few hours now so i would n't worry about that your confusion about private limited companies is understandable it 's often not made clear but uk formation services standard packages are always private limited by shares companies limited by guarantee is something else and normally used by charities or non profits only see explanations here registering for vat is optional until you reach the £ turnover threshold but it can make your services more attractive to large companies especially in your field of business you should really seek professional advice on whether or not this is the best option for you

a 5 funds for $ 15 k is not too many or too few a bit high as i 'd wonder if you 've thought of how you 'll rebalance the funds over time so you are n't investing too much in a particular market segment i 'd also question if you know what kinds of fees you may have with those funds as some of vanguard 's index funds had fees if the balance is under $ 10 k that may change how much you 'll be paying from vanguard 's site we charge a $ 20 annual account service fee for each vanguard fund with    a balance of less than $ 10,000 in an account this fee does n’t apply    if you sign up for account access on and choose    electronic delivery of statements confirmations and vanguard fund    reports and this fee also does n’t apply to members of    flagship ® select ® and services ® so if you do n't do the delivery this would be an extra $ that i wonder if you factored that into things here b have i diversified my portfolio too much or not enough perhaps i    am missing something that would be recommended for the portfolio of    this kind with this goal both in my opinion too much in the sense that you are looking at morningstar 's style box to pick a fund for this box and that which i 'd consider consolidating on one hand yet at the same time i notice that you are sticking purely to us stocks and ignoring international funds i do think taxes may be something you have n't considered too much as stocks will most of those funds and trigger capital gains that you do n't mention at all c if not my choice of my portfolio where would you invest $ 15 k    under similar circumstances and similar goals what is the goal here you state that this is your first cash investment but do n't state if this is for retirement a vacation in 10 years a house in 7 years or a bunch of other possibilities which is something to consider if i consider this as retirement investments i 'd like pick 1 or 2 funds known for being tax efficient that would be where i 'd start so if a fund goes down 30 that 's ok do you have a rebalancing strategy of any kind do you realize what taxes you may have even if the fund does n't necessarily have gains itself in not stating a goal i wonder how well do you have a strategy worked out for how you 'll sell off these funds down the road at some point as something to ponder

there is a clear difference between investing and gambling   when you invest you are purchasing an asset that has value it is purchased in the hopes that the asset will either increase in value or generate income this definition holds true whether you are investing in shares of stock in real estate or in a comic book collection you can also purchase debt if you loan money you own debt that will hopefully be repaid and generate income   gambling is playing a game for chance when you gamble you have not purchased an asset you have only paid to participate in a game some games have a degree of skill blackjack poker others are pure chance slot machine in most gambling games the odds are against the player and in favor of the one running the game   lottery tickets without a doubt are gambling   there is a good article on investopedia that discusses the difference between investing and gambling in more detail   one thing that this article discusses is the house edge or the advantage that the people running a gambling game have over the players   with most casino games the house has an advantage of between 1 and 15 over the players   with a typical lottery the house edge is 50 to address some of the points made by the op 's recent edit and in the comments i do not think the definitions of investment and gambling need to be dependent on expected value   there can be bad investments where the odds of a good result are low   similarly there could be gambling games where the odds are in the player 's favor either due to the skill of the player or through some of the game it 's still gambling investing is purchasing an asset gambling is a game of chance i do not consider a lottery ticket an asset   when you buy a lottery ticket you are just paying a fee to participate in a game   it is the same as putting a coin in a slot machine   the fact that you are given a piece of paper and made to wait a few days for the result do not change this assets have inherent value   they might be valuable because of their ability to generate income stocks bonds debt their utility precious metals commodities real estate or their desirability as a thing of beauty collectibles for example   a lottery ticket however is only an element of a game   it has no value other than in the game

fyi prices do n't always go up   inflation is a monetary phenomenon   i 'm simplifying greatly here if more money is printed or the money supply increases through fractional reserve banking and it is chasing the same amount of goods then prices will go up   conversely if money is held constant and the economy becomes more productive producing more goods then a constant amount of money is chasing an increasing amount of goods and prices go down after the civil war the greenback went back to being on a gold standard in   after could be redeemed for gold   gold restricts money growth since it is difficult to obtain here are the price and wage indexes from from here   notice from to that wholesale and consumer prices fall but wages start to increase   imagine your salary staying the same or even increasing but the prices of items falling still do n't think inflation is a monetary phenomenon   here is a cpi chart from 1800 to 2007   notice how the curve starts to go drastically up around 1970   what happen then   the us dollar went off the gold exchange standard and the us dollar became a purely fiat currency backed by nothing but government decree which allows the federal reserve to print money ad

while the issuer of the security such as a stock or bond not the short is responsible for the credit risk the issuer and the short of a derivative is one in all cases it is more than likely that a trader is owed securities by an agent such as a broker or exchange or clearinghouse legally only the options clearing corporation clears openly traded options   with stocks and bonds brokerages can clear with each other if approved while a trader is expected to fund margin the legal responsibility is shared by all in the agent chain   clearinghouses are liable to exchanges   exchanges are liable to members   traders are liable to brokerages   both ways and so on clearinghouses are usually ultimately liable for counterparty risk to the long counterparty and the short counterparty is ultimately liable to the clearinghouse clearinghouses are not responsible for the credit risk of stocks and bonds because the issuers are not short those securities on the exchange thus no margin is required   credit risk for stocks and bonds is mitigated away from the clearing process

since the bondholders have voted to reject the emergency manager 's plan which would have paid them pennies on the dollar the city is now attempting to discharge its short term and long term debt if they get what they want in court it is likely these bonds will become worthless even if they are only able to restructure the debt its likely that bondholders will need to accept large concessions however this may not be immediately reflected in bond prices as it 's very possible that the market for these bonds will be very limited in terms of who they could sell them to if you were to buy them now that would be a bet on some outcome other than bankruptcy and the discharge of the city 's long term obligations president obama has already stated that he monitoring the situation and it seems unlikely to me that after all of the support given to the auto industry in the last several years that the federal government will do nothing if only to avert job losses however i think it 's likely that state aid will be limited at best as michigan 's economy has been struggling for a number of years there are n't many large precedents to look at for guidance one of the largest public entities to declare bankruptcy orange county was a very different situation because this was due to malfeasance on the part of its investment manager whereas detroit 's situation is a much larger structural problem with its declining economy and tax base i think the key question will be whether the federal government will consider a detroit bankruptcy to be a large enough failure to take significant action

you ca n't change the w2 the employer issues it and sends it to the irs you can not affect it in any way the employer reported correctly you did contribute $ in 2015 you then withdrew the excess in 2016 and did it timely so it is not taxable in 2016 however the excess contribution should be added back to your wages on your tax return the way to do it is to add it to the taxable wages amount reported on w2 box 1 and attach a statement explaining that the amount added is the excess contribution you then put the corrected amount in the right place on your tax return line 7 on the form 1040 adding the difference to misc income line 21 is ok too it 's the same effect you will then need to check with your payroll that they 're aware that the excess was deposited back on the account of the next year and adjust their reports accordingly otherwise you 'll end up with excess contribution again

do all most unit trusts have policy it is really that some value of the fund is given to the investor so the fund value goes down by that much per unit it depends on the type of mutual funds for example there are growth type mutual funds that do not give any dividend and the total value of the fund is reflected in its price do the companies whose stocks we owned directly apply policy on their dividends as well why not as far a stock price is concerned it usually decrease by the same amount of the dividend payout at ex date so in effect the market in a way does the equalization the company directly does not do it

i definitely get where you 're coming from   the envelope system sounds good but does n't appeal to most people under 50 for many of these reasons physical cash in my hand is just a hassle it has no appeal or reduced spending affect on me there are various options for prepaid debit cards such as or you could use gift cards for things like gas and groceries though that likely wo n't get you duplicate cards or automatic payments   as far as automatic payments just set that up through your bank so it 's still not a perfect solution   i wish there was a better more straightforward way but this is the best as far as i know update ramsey solutions has since launched everydollar   this is dave 's preferred solution for an online digital envelope system

a financial planner can help with investments insurance estate planning budgeting retirement planning saving for college tax planning prep and other money topics one way to get a sense is to look at this certified financial planner topic list another idea is to look at this book my favorite i 've read which covers roughly a similar topic list in a concise form it could not hurt at all to read that before deciding to visit a planner so you have baseline knowledge by the way look for the cfp certification which is a generalist certification a cfp might also have a deeper cert in certain topics or connect you with someone who does for example you really want a generalist cfp who may have an additional credential as well the idea is to look at what you 're trying to accomplish and all finance related areas especially because there may be tradeoffs the cfp would then refer you to or work with lawyers accountants etc importantly some advisors are fiduciaries must act in your interests and some are not in particular many stockbrokers are neither qualified planners no cfp or equivalent nor are they fiduciaries stay away there are several models for paying a financial planner including there 's an organization called napfa for fiduciary non commission based planners membership there is a good thing to look for since it 's a third party that defines what fee only means and requires the no commissions fiduciary standard finally the alternative i ended up choosing was to just take the cfp course myself you can do it online via correspondence course it costs about the same as 1 year of professional advice i also took the exam just to be sure i learned the stuff this is the extreme diy approach but it is cheaper over time and you know you are not going to defraud yourself you still might do things that are counterproductive and not in your interests but you know that already probably anyway i think it 's equivalent to about a quarter 's worth of work at a decent college or so there are about 6 textbooks to dig through you wo n't be an experienced expert at the end but you 'll know a lot to get an actual cfp cert you need 3 years experience on top of the courses and the exam i have n't done that just the book learning someone who puts cfp after their name will have the 3 years on top of the training some editorial many planners emphasize investing and many people looking for planners or books on finance emphasize investing this is a big mistake in my view investing is more or less a commodity and you just need someone who wo n't screw it up overcharge and/or lose your money on something idiotic or inappropriate some people are in plain bad and inappropriate investments do n't get me wrong but once you fix that and just get into anything decent your biggest planning concerns are probably elsewhere on investments i 'd look for a planner to just get you out of overpriced annuities and expensive mutual funds you may have been sold anything you were sold by a salesperson is probably crap and look for them to help you decide how much to invest and how much in stocks vs. bonds those are the most important investment decisions

this depends on the involved us citizen resident giving gifts is required to pay a gift tax the recipient of the gift however pays nothing the value of the gift at the time of the gift giving is used to determine the tax and an exclusion of $ 14000 per person per year as of 2013 is available to allow smaller gifts to be given without too much of a red tape there 's also a lifetime exemption which is shared between the gift tax and the estate tax this exemption is $ 5.25 m in 2013   the reason the gift tax exists in the us is because the us tax code is very aggressive this is basically double taxation similarly to estate tax gifts estates are after tax money i.e. income tax has been paid on them yet the government taxes them again why the excuse is to disallow shifting of income if one person has high income tax brackets he may give some of his income producing property to another person with lesser brackets who would then pay less income taxes for example parents would transfer property to children similarly capital gains could be shifted generation skipping tax is yet another complication to disallow people use gifts to avoid estate taxes a grandparent would gift stuff to grandchildren thus skipping a level of estate taxes the parents in between in other countries the tax codes may be less aggressive and not tax gifts inheritance as this money has been taxed before this is a more fair situation imho yet it means that wealth moves from generation to generation without the general public benefiting from it so if you 're a us person and considering giving or receiving a gift you need to consult with a tax adviser about the consequences similarly with other countries if you are subject to their tax laws

a moving average will act as support or resistance to a stock only when the stock is trending the way it acts as support for instance is similar to a trend line take the daily chart of cba over the last 6 months the first chart shows cba with an uptrend support line   the second chart shows cba during the same period with 50 day ema as a support   both can be used as support for the uptrend generally you can used these types of support or resistance in a downtrend to determine when to buy a stock and when to sell a stock if i was looking to buy cba whilst it was uptrending one strategy i could use was to wait until it hit or got very close to the support trend line and then buy as it re bounces back up if i already held the stock i could use a break down below the uptrend support line as a stop to exit out of the stock

i think people are conflating two sets of terms unsecured secured and good bad are not synonyms debt may be secured or unsecured if i take a loan against a car or house it is typically secured so the object is collateral against the loan bad debt in financial terms is a loan that is not expected to be recovered a bank might write off a loan or a portion of a loan as bad debt if the borrower goes bankrupt or into administration for example both secured and unsecured loans may be considered bad debt i think the context in which the question is being asked is how to distinguish between sensible and borrowing an extreme example of borrowing would be to buy a pc on a store card pcs devalue very quickly and a store card may charge 30 apr so paying the minimum off each month would mean paying   more than twice the sticker price for a product that is now worth less than half the original borrowed amount on the other hand a 3 mortgage when borrowing less than 60 of the value of a property is a good bet from a lender 's perspective and would be a good debt to have not as good as no debt but better a high apr one

gt;we were on the gold standard in name only since about 1910   there a few nuances behind the gold standard but all revolve around indebtedness and currency devaluation    the us actually started off in with a silver standard by the turn of the 18th century there was a fixed ratio of silver and gold to dollars silver was not required to back all of the currency gold was used as well    this bi metallic standard continued until gold and silver were legal tender    the us treasury was on a strict hard money standard doing business in only gold and silver until which the federal government from the banking system it was only after this move the federal government started the devaluation of silver in order to borrow from england silver came in gold came out this also largely the gold rush    then in the us started reducing the weight of silver coins in banks suspended payment in silver   but the basic weakness in a gold standard started with government wanting to manipulate value to unfairly skew debt loan situations    gt;there was not enough gold to remotely back the us currency   this is not true us currency did just fine and as governments print so too do prices go up so if there is only 50 billion currency units in and eggs cost 10 cents as they did for previous decades when the federal government prints its way to trillions that s where we end up with eggs costing 2 3 bucks that 's why your grandparents house cost 6,000 and ones today cost 600,000    gt;which is why during the great depression when people started wanting to turn their cash back in to gold there was no enough   no they turned back to gold because of the devaluation of the dollar if the dollar was falling as it is today why would you want to keep your assets in dollars gold can not be printed at whim this is one of the most important factors it forces government to be much more strict with debt if taxpayers were faced with higher taxes or devaluation to pay for the current iraq wars would it have happened no but since the government could print money at whim it served as an invisible tax    gt;and gold possession had to be outlawed    it was outlawed because as the dollar plummeted and gold was eventually made illegal the value of gold doubled and rapidly increased overnight this happened again in 1970 when nixon took us off the gold standard gold was made illegal to prevent hoarders and you make it sound like gold redemption is a bad thing when really its the government being naughty and citizens simply playing the game and by the rules set up by the government    gt;so no we were not on a gold standard   yeah i never said we were but there is a very important   reason we once were so government could nt devalue currency to rack up more debt a huge issue that has now played out to its logical conclusion maximum indebtedness mixed with massive mechanisms for manipulation   when you 're on a any fixed item standard your economy only can grow at roughly the rate you fond more of the fixed item    is that why the us did just fine between and 1913 over a hundred years the cost of many items was stable for decades nowadays we have a doubling effect with cars costing 4,000 in 1970 26,000 in 2000 45,000 in 2012 the same with houses food education medical services you name it   gt;there are many reasons for this and it is partially why for thousands of years of various gold standard there was so little economic growth once countries stopped limiting the amount of total economic growth to the amount of gold they could dig up that economies were able to grow at the sustained rate they have for the past years   wrong again this is because of productivity from technology and invention oil electricity automobiles airplanes and eventually computers infact as i said above fiat currency actually kills productivity    its hard to compare the turn of the century but we can see what happened after nixon took us off the gold standard here      as soon as the usa left the gold exchange standard   total factor productivity began to dramatically stagnate   the gold exchange standard was a free lunch for policymakers gdp growth could be achieved without any real gains in productivity or efficiency or in infrastructure but instead by just pumping money into the system   the gold exchange standard was a free lunch for businesses revenue growth could be achieved without any real gains in productivity or efficiency   gt;so besides the fact that the us has not in modern history been backed by gold despite the name there is ample evidence from hundreds of economies and thousands of years that being on a gold standard = little or no economic growth   since nixon took us off the gold standard in terms of dollar connection in anyway to gold the value of the dollar has plummeted 70 its over 95 if you go back to the early 1900s and currency debasement    there was plenty of economic growth while we were on the gold standard and to say otherwise is simply false

the preferred accounts are designed to hope you do one of several things pay one day late   then charge you all the deferred interest many people think if they put $ x a month aside then pay just before the 6 months 12 or no payment before 2014 period ends then i will be able to afford the computer carpet or furniture the interest rate they will charge you if you are late will be buried in the fine print but expect it to be very high pay on time but now that you have a card with their logo on it   so now you feel that you should buy the accessories from them they hope that you become a long time customer they want to make money on your next computer also their bill me later option on that site as essentially the same as the preferred account in the end you will have another line of credit they will do a credit check the impact both positive and negative on your credit picture is discussed in other questions   because two of the three options you mentioned in your question cash debit card imply that you have enough cash to buy the computer today there is no reason to get another credit card to finance the purchase the delayed payment with the preferred account will save you about 10 dollars 2000 1 interest 0.5 years   the choice of store might save you more money though with apple there are fewer places to get legitimate discounts here are your options how to get the limit increased you can ask for a temporary increase in the credit limit or you can ask for a permanent one some credit cards can do this online others require you to talk to them if they are going to agree to this it can be done in a few minutes some individuals on this site have even been able to send the check to the credit card company before completing the purchase thus increasing their credit limit ymmv i have no idea if it works   a good reason to use the existing credit card instead of the debit card is if the credit card is a rewards card the extra money or points can be very nice just make sure you pay it back before the bill is due in fact you can send the money to the credit card company the same day the computer arrives in the mail   having the transaction on the credit card can also get you purchase protection and some cards automatically extend the warranty

gt many of our policies set up public schools to fail is that your impression   maybe i wonder if schools main function is not education but babysitting we are definitely succeeding at our function of babysitting the two functions babysitting and education are intertwined quite nicely but it would be interesting to design an experiment where we test one and the other and see parent 's reactions    what would be the consequences of this experiment   provide each student with a monitor so they can watch all their classes from their house nothing else changes students can still ask questions like a conference call this would keep the education but take away the babysitting

the easiest and least expensive way of doing this similar to the answer from randy is to write a check and deposit it into the canadian institution since this transfer is between accounts you own the easiest thing to do is to do a deposit by mail contact your current institution on where you would need to mail your deposit to you can then write yourself a check on the us bank and mail it to the canadian bank be sure to write for deposit only along with your account number and branch number for canada on the back this is the slowest but cheapest method an alternative option is to use wire transfers but they can be very costly you 'll usually incur a fee when sending and when receiving i only recommend them when you need the money in the account fast they are usually settled within an hour

i think in such situations a good rule of thumb may be if you are asked to pay significant sums of money upfront before anything is done stop and ask yourself what would you do if they do n't do what they promised they know who you are but usually most you know is a company name and phone number both can disappear in a minute and what are you left with   if they said they 'd pay off the debt and issue the new loan fine let them do it and then you pay them if they insist on having money upfront without delivering anything unless it 's a very big and known and established company you probably better off not doing it either it 's a scam or in the minuscule chance they are legit you still risking too much you 're giving money and not getting anything in return

so i just graduated from uni with a finance degree this is what i would advise   1 figure out what you want to do and have a clear plan behind finance is very big so there are a lot of options to choose from there is ib er am operations corporate finance at an etc figure what interests you and focus towards it    2 when you have figured out what to do find out what you need to know to get the interview and full time offer the internet is your best friend here there are sites like wall street oasis reddit merger amp etc all these have a wealth of information    3 your year internship is important try to get the internship in the industry and role that you desire so start networking cold calling cold emailing basically try to meet as many people you can who can help you reach your goal this is pretty important    4 do n't be a complete and focus only on your gpa join student that interest you participate in case competitions and stock pitches this allows you to build a valuable skillset where in interviews you can always talk about it and people will at least know that you have an interest or passion for finance    5 and finally since you are at the last 1 and a half years of your college career just try not to be jaded a lot of people end up being like this cos they ca nt get that job they want or their gpa is crap try not to be them always be fighting and hustling to get the best grades best job you can cos this is prob the most crucial time in your college life

and specifically regarding prices of housing what factors drive prices in that regard i mean the houses are roughly the same but almost 3 times as expensive rent like so many things is tied to supply and demand on the demand side rent is tied to income people tend to buy as much house as they can afford given that mortgage interest is deductible and public schools financed through property tax performs better in valuable neighborhoods raise the minimum wage and economists expect rents to go up accordingly when employers and pensions offer cola adjustments it feeds into a price loop during the past ten years there was also some animal spirits irrational behavior present people feared that if they did n't buy now home prices would outpace their growth in income so even though it did n't make sense at the time they bought because it would make even less sense later if you assume prices only go up there 's also the whole california has nicer weather angle to explain why people move to sf or la on the supply side it 's all about housing stock in your old town you could find vacant lots or farmland in less than 5 minute 's drive from anywhere there 's far less room for growth in say the sf bay area or nyc there 's also building codes that restrict the growth in housing stock i 'm told co is one such place you would think that high prices would discourage people from moving or working there but between the university and the defense contractors they seem to have an iron grip on the market have you ever seen a cartoon where a character gets a huge bill at a restaurant and their eyes shoot out of their eye and they faint yeah that 's how i felt looking at some of the places around here remember restaurants have to cover the same rent problem you do and they have higher minimum wages and taxes etc moreover food has to be imported from miles away to feed the city likely even from out of state in california there 's also food regulations that in effect raise the prices if people are footing those higher bills i would n't be surprised if they 're racking up debt in the process and dodging the collectors calling about their lexus or taking out home equity loans to cover their lifestyle

gt;well first off the roads are more than just hobbies they really do go places a lot of the roads in my area would be unprofitable and people live down those roads what happens when a company decides that road is too expensive to maintain but decides to keep ownership the people have to move   yes if people want to live out somewhere that is inefficient other people who do not choose to live there should n't have to subsidize them i say this having grown up 17 miles from the nearest town in a completely rural environment   gt;it does n't have to but it 's unrealistic to expect that they wo n't take a profit from it but do you really think that if a company has a monopoly they 're going to charge you the bare minimum they can if you have no choice but to pay tolls or for driving passes for certain cities and you can only get them from a single company what motivation does that company have to keep them affordable and readily available they 're going to do like any company would and find that point of maximum profitability between cost of permit and number of permits   is this not a similar situation we currently have with electricity trash and various other pieces of our infrastructure people are not being because there is some level of regulation which is necessary for a functional society i 'm not necessarily advocating a completely free market as monopolies are dangerous i just think the government 's role is to big   gt;then there 's the whole reality that you will still pay for roads you do n't use if one company owns multiple roads they 're going to charge you enough money to expand roads to fix up other dilapidated roads etc more profitable roads will be used to offset less profitable roads etc basically if there 's a new neighborhood and they build a road to it if you 've been paying that company they 're using your money to build that road   not really i 'm paying to use a certain stretch of road right now what the company chooses to do with that money is their issue

i do n't know what country you live in or what the laws and practical circumstances of owning rental property there are but i own a rental property in the u.s. and i can tell you that there are a lot of headaches that go with it one maintenance you say you have to pay an annual fee of 2,400 for building maintenance does that cover all maintenance to the unit or only the exterior i mean here in the u.s. if you own a condo we call a unit like you describe a condo if you rent it it 's an apartment if you own it it 's a condo you typically pay an annual fee that cover maintenance from the walls out that is it covers maintenance to the exterior of the building the parking lot any common recreational areas like a swimming pool etc but it does n't cover interior maintenance if there 's a problem with interior wiring or plumbing or the carpet needs to be replaced or the place needs painting that 's up to you   with a rental unit those expenses can be substantial on my rental property sure most months the maintenance is zero things do n't break every month but if the furnace needs to be replaced or there 's a major plumbing problem it can cost thousands and you can get hit with lots of expenses while my place was vacant i turned the water heater down to save on utility expenses then a tenant moved in and complained that the water heater did n't work we sent a plumber out who quickly figured out that she did n't realize she had to turn the knob up then of course he had to hang around while the water heated up to make sure that was all it was it cost me umm i think $ 170 to have someone turn that knob but i probably saved over $ 15 on the gas bill by turning it down for the couple of months the place was empty two what happens when you get a bad tenant here in the u.s. theoretically you only have to give 3 days notice to evict a tenant who damages the property or fails to pay the rent but in practice they do n't leave then you have to go to court to get the police to throw them out when you contact the court they will schedule a hearing in a month or two if your case is clear cut like the tenant has n't paid the rent for two months or more you will win easily both times i 've had to do this the tenant did n't even bother to show up so i won by default so then you have a piece of paper saying the court orders them to leave you have to wait another month or two for the police to get around to actually going to the unit and ordering them out so say a tenant fails to pay the rent in real life you 're probably not going to evict someone for being a day or two late but let 's say you 're pretty hard about it and start eviction proceedings when they 're a month late there 's at least another two or three months before they 're actually going to be out of the place of course once you send them an eviction notice they 're not going to pay the rent any more so you have to go four five months with these people living in your property but not paying any rent on top of that some tenants do serious damage to the property it 's not theirs they do n't have much incentive to take care of it if you evict someone they may deliberately trash the place out of spite one tenant i had to evict did over $ 13,000 in damage so i 'm not saying do n't rent the place out what i am saying is be sure to include all your real costs in your calculation think of all the things that could go wrong as well as all the things that could go right

volume is really only valuable when compared to some other volume either from a historical value or from some other stock   the article you linked to does n't provide specific numbers for you to evaluate whether volume is high or low many people simply look at the charts and use a gut feel for whether a day 's volume is high or low in their estimation typically if a day 's volume is not significantly taller than the usual volume you would n't call it high the same goes for low volume if you want a more quantitative approach a simple approach would be to use the normal distribution statistics calculate the mean volume and the standard deviation anything outside of 1.5 to 2.0 standard deviations either high or low could be significant in your analysis you 'll need to pick your own numbers 1.5 or 2.0 are just numbers i pulled out of thin air it 's hard to read anything specific into volume since for every seller there 's a buyer and each has their reasons for doing so the article you link to has some good examples of using volume as a basis for strengthening conclusions drawn using other factors

i 'm loving this thread by the way   the answer to your question is yes the method and the martingale method lead to the same result   i think this is intuitive since they address the same things drift probability etc   heath amp 2000 have a nice paper in the journal of applied probability that shows the fairly general circumstances under which the two methods will always have the same result   it 's titled versus in finance an equivalence result with examples   my argument is that black scholes is really an equilibrium model not an arbitrage free model   despite that i 'm claiming that it is possible to use bs and any other equilibrium model in a no arbitrage manner by incorporating information from other securities but that this does n't make the underlying model and its assumptions a no arbitrage model   i think basically what i 'm trying to say is that i do n't think market completeness is really the issue but rather that the issue is the difference between the model and reality   equilibrium models make a statement about what reality should be given some parameters that you 're supposed to know with certainty all bets are off if you have to estimate them   arbitrage free models explicitly use external observed prices but do not explain why we observe those   in this context and using these definitions i 'd say black scholes is clearly an equilibrium model albeit one built from some arguments that involve arbitrage

i 've seen a lot of long and complicated answers here so here is my simple and short answer let 's say the economy consists of 10 apples and then an apple costs if you print 10 $ more you have 10 apples and then an apple costs that is it it 's not what said   over time prices go up however i would like to add something more on the topic inflation is theft if i hack the bank and steal 10 from each account it 's obvious that it is theft it 's a bit less obvious when the government prints out money and people loose 10 of the value in their bank accounts but the end result is the same final note some may disagree but i do not consider inflation when 5 of the apples rot and you have 5 apples and 10 $ and an apple now costs this is a drop in supply and if the demand stays the same prices will rise

the first thing you should do is write a letter to the collection company telling them that you dispute all charges and demand per section 809 of the fair debt collection practices act that they immediately validate and confirm any and all debts they you owe you should further request that that they only communicate with you by mail section 809 requires them to examine the legal documents showing you allegedly owe a debt and they are required to send this to you this all creates a useful paper trail when you send the letter be sure to send it as certified mail with a return receipt from your description it does n't sound like this will do anything but it 's important you do it within 30 days of them contacting you this is because the law allows them to assume the debt is valid if you do n't do it within 30 days of their initial contact i recommend you speak with an attorney most states have a statute of limitation on debt of about 4 or 5 years i do n't know if that applies to courts though whatever you do be very careful of the language you use when speaking with them always refer to it as the alleged debt or the debt you i owe you do n't want them your words later on as far as proving you paid it i would look through every scrap of paper i 'd ever touched looking for it if that proves fruitless try going to the courthouse and looking through their records if they 're saying you did n't pay that 's a long shot but still worth a try you could also try bank records from that time like if you have a visa statement showing $ paid to the nevada court or something like that if all else fails the law allows you to send the collector a letter saying that you refuse to pay the debt the collection company then legally must stop contacting you unless it 's to tell you they are suing you or to tell you they wo n't contact you again i strongly advise against this though your best bet is going to be speaking with a qualified attorney edit you should also pull your credit reports to make sure this is n't being reported there federal law gives you the right to have a free copy of each of your credit reports once every year if it is being reported send a certified letter with return receipt to each bureau which is reporting it telling them you dispute the information they then are required to confirm the information if they ca n't confirm it they must remove it if they do confirm it you are legally entitled to put a statement disputing the information next to it on your credit report i am not an attorney this is not legal advise you should consult an attorney who is licensed to practice law in your particular jurisdiction

under us law a bank is not obligated to honor a check that is more than six months old 4 404 bank not obliged to pay check more than six months old a bank is under no obligation to a customer having a checking account to pay a check other than a certified check which is presented more than six months after its date but it may charge its customer 's account for a payment made thereafter in good faith note the law says the bank is not obligated to honor the check but they are not forbidden from doing so i do n't have a survey on this but i think most banks wo n't honor a check after more than 6 months to a year i 've had a few occasions where early in the year someone accidentally wrote the previous year on a check like on january 10 2017 they dated the check january 10 2016 and the bank has given me a hard time about cashing it the statute of limitations to challenge payment or non payment of a check is 6 years 3 118 statute of limitations b except as provided in subsection d or e if demand for payment is made to the maker of a note payable on demand an action to enforce the obligation of a party to pay the note must be within six years after the demand   i understand your frustration about being denied money that you presumably worked for and earned but look at it from the other side suppose you wrote a check to someone and years later they still had not cashed it at some point you 'd want to be able to clear this off your bank account what if you want to close the account what happens when you die would your heirs have to keep this account open for years decades centuries on the possibility that someday someone will cash this check realistically there has to be some time limit 6 months should be plenty of time for someone to make it to the bank with a check if the company still exists then you could argue they have a moral obligation to pay you if they have records that show that they did indeed give you this check and you never cashed it there 'd be no question that you were trying to cheat them but a moral obligation and a legal obligation are two different things legally they paid you and it 's your problem that you failed to cash the check you could talk to a lawyer but if you live in the us i think you are out of luck of course other countries have different laws

you can choose to place lower buy limit orders but whether they get filled or not is not a given it depends on whether sellers care to accept your bid in your example of a 49.98 spread if you place a buy with limit of 49.99 it wo n't get filled if the order reaches the market while still at 49.98 immediately but will be added to the order book   by being added to the order book the markets bid and ask become 49.99   your order wo n't get filled until some seller places a market order or a sell limit order of 49.99 or less   no guarantee that that will happen and even if it does there 's nothing to say that your follow up buy at 49.98 will ever be filled   in fact your 49.98 buy order queues up at the end of the line behind all previously pending 49.98 bids since your order arrived after those other bids   since the initial conditions you supposed had a 49.98 bid such an order exists or at least did exist it might have been cancelled in the intervening moment basically your first buy at 49.99 if it happens has essentially no influence on whether your second buy at 49.98 will happen   you ca n't expect to move the market lower by making a bid that is higher 49.99 than the existing best bid 49.98   whatever influence your 49.99 order has is to raise the market 's price not lower it

first it depends on your broker   full service firms will tear you a new one discount brokers may charge   you 'll have to check with your broker on assignment fees theoretically this is the case of the opposite of my answer in this question are underlying assets supposed to be sold bought immediately after being bought sold in call put option your trading strategy reasoning for your covered call notwithstanding in your case as an option writer covering in the money calls you want to hold and pray that your option expires worthless   as i said in the other answer there is always a theoretical premium of option price + exercise price to underlying prices no matter how slight right up until expiration so on that basis it does n't pay to close out the option however there 's a reality that i did n't mention in the other answer if it 's a deep in the money option you can actually put a bid < stock price exercise price trade fee and hope for the best since the market makers rarely bid above stock price exercise price for illiquid options but it 's unlikely that you 'll beat the market makers + hft   they 're systems are too fast i know the philly exchange allows you to put in implied volatility orders but they 're expensive and i could n't tell you if a broker exchange allows for dynamic orders with the equation i specified above but it may be worth a shot to check out however it 's unlikely that such a low order would ever be filled since you 'll at best be lined up with the market makers and it would require a big player dumping all its holdings at once to get to your order if you 're doing a traditional true blue covered call there 's absolutely nothing wrong being assigned except for the tax implications   when your counterparty calls away your underlyings it is a sell for tax purposes if you 're not covering with the underlying but with a more complex spread things could get hairy for you real quick if someone were to exercise on you but that 's always a risk   if your broker is extremely strict they may close the rest of your spread for you at the offer   in illiquid markets that would be a huge percentage loss considering the wide bid ask spreads

buying a house is often more emotional than financial which makes that kind of advice tough to offer staying with the finance side you wrote 2 bedrooms is enough for me is it enough for your girlfriend is she on the same schedule for kids as you are 2 bedrooms means that with just one child you are less able to host a guest and the second child will need to share the bedroom nothing wrong with that just making sure you are aware of these things if the long term plan is to move to a new house a ten year horizon for the second house sounds good to me   i 'll make one brief comment on rent vs buy it 's easy to buy too big and discover you are paying for rooms you do n't use i have a house i 'll be glad to get rid of when our daughter goes off to college a dining room and formal living room go unused save for 3 or 4 days a year it already sounds like you 'll avoid this mistake   your question the right time when you are ready with the downpayment income and desire to do so you should at least have a feeling you plan to stay there for a time else the cost of buying selling would exceed any potential gain

one way to think of the typical fixed rate mortgage is that you can calculate the balance at the end of the month add a month 's interest rate times balance then divide by 12 then subtract your payment the principal is now a bit less and there 's a snowball effect that continues to drop the principal more each month   even though some might object to my use of the word compounding a prepayment has that effect e.g. you have a 5 mortgage and pay $ 100 extra principal if you did nothing else 5 compounded over 28 years is about so if you did this early on it would reduce the last payment by about $ 400 obviously there are calculators and spreadsheets that can give the exact numbers   i do n't know the rules for car loans but one would actually expect them to work similarly and no you are not crazy to expect that just the opposite

your credit score is really bad and it 's highly unlikely anyone will be willing to give you a mortgage especially if you still have bad debt showing up on your credit report what would help well clearing off any bad debt would be a good place to start ideally you want to get your credit rating up above though that may be optimistic here note though that bad debt falls off your credit report after a while exactly how long depends on your province note that making partial payment or even just acknowledging the debt will reset the timer however i mention this though because you mention some of your debt is from 5 or 6 years ago it may be just about to fall off it would also help if you can show that your credit is so bad because of mistakes from a number of years ago but you 've been making payments and staying on top of all debts for the past few years if that 's the case also it would help if you had a reasonable downpayment 20 minimum but you 'll be a lower credit risk if you are able to put down 50 75 you could also consider having someone with good credit co sign the mortgage note that most people will not be willing to do this as they take on substantial financial risk all that said there are some institutions which specialise in dealing with no credit or bad credit customers you pay more fees and will pay a vastly higher interest rate but this may be a good option for you check out mortgage brokers specialising in high risk clients you can also consider a rent to own but almost all the advice i 've ever seen say to avoid these if you can one late payment and you may lose all the equity you think you 've been building up note that things may be different if you are moving from the u.s. to canada and have no credit history in canada in that case you may have no credit rather than bad credit most banks still wo n't offer you a mortgage in this case but some lenders do target recent immigrants do n't rule out renting for many people regardless of their credit rating renting is a better option the monthly payments may be lower you do n't need a downpayment you do n't have to pay realtor and legal fees and pay again if you need to move a couple of sites provide more information on how your credit rating affects your possibility of getting a mortgage and how to get mortgages with bad credit and along with

this is n't new in the mid 80s rules were established by the irs to differentiate life insurance from modified endowment contracts placing upper limits on how much money could be placed in life insurance accounts relative to the coverage provided and how quickly fastest a policy can become paid in full is 7 years none of this closes the fundamental loophole but it exists for a reason taxation of life insurance is probably unwise and would result in less people using life insurance as a risk mitigation technique despite the fact that it 's very appropriate for that in some situations   the problem here is that once you get out of everyday people numbers and into very large sums the vehicle can be clearly abused to avoid taxes on investment gains while living and possibly avoid them altogether depending on how the estate is structured and this is bad for the average person who 'd like the to pay their percent towards the public needs the same way the average guy does

as a canadian resident the simple answer to your question is yes having worked as a tax auditor and as a certified financial planner you are required to file an income tax return because you have taxable employment income all the employer is doing is deducting it at source and remitting it on your behalf that does not alleviate your need to file in fact if you do n't file you will be subject to a no filing penalty the one aspect you are missing is that taxpayers may be entitled to tax credits that may result in a refund to you depending on your personal situation e.g spousal or minor dependents i hope this helps

the key to understanding where your money is going is to budget   rather than tracking your spending after the fact budgeting lets you decide up front what you want to spend your money on   this can be done with cash envelopes on paper or on excel spreadsheets however in my opinion the best most flexible and easiest way to do this is with budgeting software designed for this purpose as i explained in another answer when it comes to personal budgeting software there are two different approaches those in which you decide what to spend your money on before it is spent and those that simply show you how your money was spent after it is gone   i recommend the first approach   software designed to do this include ynab mvelopes and everydollar my personal favorite is ynab   you 'll find lots of help video tutorials and even online classes with a live teacher on ynab 's website    using one of these packages will help you manage spending whether it is done electronically or with cash   when you pay for something with a credit card you enter your purchase into the software and the software adjusts your budget as if the money is already spent even if you have n't technically paid for the purchase yet as far as strategy goes here is what i recommend   get started on one of these and set up your budget right away   assign a category to every dollar in your account   do n't worry if it is not perfect   if you find later on that you do n't have enough money in one of your categories you can move money from another category if you need to   as you work with it you 'll get better at knowing how much money you need in each category my other recommendation is this do n't wait until the end of the month to download your transactions from the bank and fit everything into categories   instead enter your spending transactions into the software manually every day as you spend   this will do two things first you 'll have the latest up to date picture of where your accounts are in your software without having to guess   second it will help you stay on top of your spending   you 'll be able to see early on if you are overspending in a particular category   ynab has a mobile app that i use quite a bit but if i do n't get a chance to enter a purchase right when i spend it i make sure to keep a receipt and enter the transaction in that evening   it only takes a couple of minutes a day and i always know how i stand financially

insurance is to mitigate risk you ca n't handle yourself   all insurance not just car insurance   the expected value of the insurance will always cost more than the expected value of your loss that 's how the insurance company makes money   but sometimes the known fixed cost is better for your ability to sleep at night than the unknown though likely lower variable cost if you were suddenly hit with a bill the size of your car tomorrow would you be ok   if so then you can handle the risk yourself and do n't need insurance   if not then you need the insurance the insurance company sells thousands of policies and it 's much easier to predict the number out of 1000 people that will get in an accident tomorrow than the chance that you specifically will get in an accident tomorrow   so they can manage the risk by making a small amount of money from people and buying the other guy a new car

no they do not stock funds and bonds funds collect income dividends in different    ways stock funds collect dividends   as well as any capital gains    that are realized from the underlying stocks   and incorporates these    into the funds’ net asset value or daily share price that ’s why a    stock fund ’s share price drops when the fund makes a distribution    the distribution comes out of the fund ’s total net assets with bond funds the internal accounting is different   dividends    accrue daily and are then paid out to shareholders every month or    quarter   bond funds collect the income from the underlying bonds and    keep it in a separate internal bucket   a bond fund calculates a    daily accrual rate for the shares outstanding and shareholders only    earn income for the days they actually hold the fund   for example if    you buy a bond fund two days before the fund ’s month end distribution    you would only receive two worth of income that month   on the    other hand if you sell a fund part way through the month you will    still receive a partial distribution at the end of the month    pro rated for the days you actually held the fund source   also via bogleheads most vanguard bond funds accrue interest to the share holders daily    here is a typical statement from a prospectus each fund distributes to shareholders virtually all of its net income    interest less expenses as well as any net capital gains realized    from the sale of its holdings the fund ’s income dividends accrue    daily and are distributed monthly the term accrue used in this sense    means that the income dividends are credited to your account each day    just like interest in a savings account that accrues daily since the    money set aside for your dividends is both an asset of the fund and a    liability it does not affect the calculated net asset value when the    fund distributes the income dividends at the end of the month the net    asset value does not change as both the assets and liabilities    decrease by exactly the same amount note that if you sell all of    your bond fund shares in the middle of the month you will receive as    proceeds the value of your shares calculated as number of shares    times net asset value plus a separate distribution of the accrued    income dividends

not only are absolute incomes adjusted for inflation not increasing but purchasing power is also decreasing decades ago the salary of one middle class worker can raise a family nowadays you ca n't even buy a home with two salaries especially in large metro areas there are numerous factors why this is happening   1 globalization why pay an american more when something can be done or made in vietnam for a fraction of the cost prices of non renewable resources will increase as third world countries modernize and their populations demand the same luxuries that we have   2 automation automation has eliminated many jobs further driving income inequality there are people with very high salaries since automation are making them much more productive and then there are jobs that have been completely eliminated because of automation i know of factories that laid off a large fraction of their operators because the machines are now automated but they did a hire few more engineers and technicians to increase productivity   3 scarcity of land everyone wants to live in areas where the jobs are but you can only build so much housing in one area so house prices go up faster than wages people with good jobs in industries where jobs are clustered in one place biotech software semiconductors finance etc actually can afford less real estate than one would think based on their income just because of their location   these issues will become even more relevant as technology continues to develop and globalization continues

almost always was a bit of hyperbole but in matters of cost vs. quality i 'd expect publicly traded companies to prioritize short term shareholder profit or be sued by said shareholders    can you give me any examples of where shareholders sued the company because they were n't making much profit or focused on long term rather than short term i ca n't think of any maybe if the company were grossly negligent in some way but in general no i do n't think that happens or at least i 've never heard of it and it sounds like a stupid thing for shareholders to do because they 're never under any obligation for a piece of the profit either

presumably this house is a great deal for you for some reason if you are willing to go to great lengths such as these to acquire it i suggest you have your father purchase the house with cash then you purchase the house from him you might want to discuss this with the title company it 's possible that there are some fees that they will waive if you close both sales through them in a short period of time if the home will appraise for a higher amount than purchase then you may be able to get a mortgage without a significant down payment if not then you will need to owe your father at least the amount of the down payment at closing time

a share of stock is a small fraction of the ownership of the company if you expect the company to eventually be of interest to someone who wants to engineer a merger or takeover it 's worth whatever someone is willing to pay to help make that happen or keep it from happening which means it will almost always track the company 's value to some degree because the company itself will buy back shares when it can if they get too cheap to protect itself from takeover it may also start paying dividends at a later date you may also value being able to vote on the company 's actions including whether it should offer a dividend or reinvest that money in the company basically you would want to own that share or not for the same reasons you would want to own a piece of that business because that 's exactly what it is

has a great answer about dividends generally but to answer your question specifically about yield traps here are a few things that i look for as with everything if it looks too good to be true it probably is   a 17 yield is pretty out of this world even for a reit   and i would n't bet on it holding up   compare a company 's yield to that of others in the same industry different industries have different standards for what is considered a high or low yield dividends have to come from somewhere and that somewhere is cash flow   look at the company 's financial statements   do they have sufficient cash flow to pay the dividend   have there been any recent changes in their cash flow situation   how are earnings holding up   debt levels cash on hand sudden moves in stock price   a sudden drop in the stock price will cause the yield to rise   sometimes this indicates a bargain but if the drop is due to a real worry about the company 's financial health see 2 it 's probably an indication that a dividend cut is coming what does their dividend history look like   do they have a consistent track record of paying out good dividends for years and years   companies with a track record of paying dividends consistently and/or increasing their dividend regularly are likely to continue to do so

alright i took the day off today so i 'll play along i 'm going to focus my answers to be us centric because this is the realm in which i have experience if you 're from elsewhere then accept my apology in advance   gt so you 're saying a company has no responsibility whatsoever to ensure its employees make fair wages    no i 'm not saying that- a company has a legal responsibility to ensure employees make wages considered fair under the flsa for one including any municipal or state laws surrounding employee pay as far as i know litigation surrounding uber 's flsa issues is still pending and as i 'm not a federal judge i ca n't weigh in on the legality of their various pending lawsuits   gt that the market will determine a person 's salary based on their   i 'm also not saying that- it 's weird of you to keep putting words in my mouth i do n't disagree with that sentiment but i definitely did n't argue it as a point in my earlier comment   gt what if market forces align to reduce wages in order to increase profitability   market forces do this on a regular basis at the corporate this is called a negative profit margin and it 's literally happening right now or probably in about 10 minutes when the nyse opens with a company who 's product you 're using to write this comment it 'll also probably trend back upward in the time it takes me to finish this comment unfortunately salaries and compensation packages for employees of most types are flat and focused on averages based on something called math the concept is more technically referred to as profit equals revenue minus cost with cost being a floating variable dependent on you guessed it market forces this gets a lot more complicated as you delve into specifics and as you seem to have a fairly untenable grasp on business operations as it is i 'm worried it 's futile to get too much more specific   gt that 's exactly what 's happened in the last 30 years and people like you protecting corporate greed is the reason why living wages has stagnated barely matching inflation while executive salaries have    i 'm not certain what i did to protect corporate greed in my comment besides buy a product i want at a cost i deemed fair but ignoring that- the ceo pay vs employee pay argument has been debunked about a thousand times over by anyone who again understands it 's division this time so be careful not to something a quick google search shows a figure reflecting wal mart 's ceo 's total compensation at mm including stock options salary and bonuses another google search shows a total 2.1 mm employees of the company quick division reflects that each employee could pocket about $ 10.5 a year if the firm outright did not pay their ceo by which that means they do n't have a ceo and thus do not have a functioning company congratulations your logic just made 2 million people unemployed   gt you 're either ignorant of the big picture or a shill for a system that exploits the masses   i 'm new to this subreddit so i do n't know if this is what passes for intelligent discussion around here but that 's a very narrow way of looking at the world i could also say you 're either ignorant of business operations or a shill for non functioning economies but i 'd like to believe an individual with the ability to use a computer is not that illiterate   i 'm confused about your argument as a are you saying i should n't shop at wal mart or take an uber because these companies do n't pay their employees salaries you 've deemed fair can i get a list of places i 'm allowed to buy things from then

there is the price they want and the price you pay everything is negotiable when its a service always possible but usually harder with actual goods you should always haggle and price match your vendors you can also try going to different vendors and not telling them its for a wedding and see if there really is a price difference for example call up a florist and say you need x y and z for a corporate or for a special event for which you can not give the details if you then tell them its actually a wedding and they blindly raise it without a good justification move on that said they jack up the price because they know most people will says it 's my wedding it 's once in a lifetime it 's my special day etc the same is true about diamonds their price does not reflect the actual supply and demand ratio just the perception that has been created however as mentioned in some of the comments above the service provided at a wedding may be different or more involved than just a normal dinner the more important issue is ensuring there are no back fees no hidden fees and you have well written well reviewed contracts for example we know a couple whose added a mandatory 20 gratuity regardless of the service which was provided most venues or restaurants will not be making the bar a lose leader but they will charge for other things   you can also save money by buying used or looking on ebay for prices closer to wholesale for the product i think a good analogy to this is the recent time magazine article on the price of healthcare it costs a lot because its a small market and its harder to navigate and most are not experienced shoppers in the area or do n't have control over the individual item costs

the point of short selling as a separate instrument is that you can you do it when you ca n't sell the underlying asset usually because you do n't actually own any of it and in fact believe that it will go down shorting allows you to profit from a falling price another non speculative possibility is that you do n't have the underlying asset right now and thus ca n't sell it but will get it at a certain point in the future e.g. because it 's bonds that you 've used to guarantee a loan or grain that 's still growing on your fields

condensed to the essence if you can reliably get more income from investing the cost of the house than the mortgage is costing you this is the safest leveraged investment you 'll ever make there 's some risk of course but there is risk in any financial decision taking the mortgage also leaves you with far greater flexibility than if you become rich but cash poor note that you probably should n't be buying at all if you may need geographic flexibility in the next five years or so that 's another part of the liquidity issue also it does n't have to be either or i borrowed half and paid the rest in cash though i could have taken either extreme because that was the balance of certainty that i was comfortable with i also took a shorter mortgage than i might have again trading off risk and return i decided i would rather have the house paid off at about the same time that i retire

the insurance company is must assume you do have a preexisting condition you are unaware of   the reason for that is that affordable care act precludes the insurance company from denying coverage of them if you do   insurance companies are businesses   they are in business to make you have a nonprofit insurer   they can not do that if you can buy insurance only when you need for them to pay out   so even though you may not have a preexisting condition they are from requiring an examination that would detect the most expensive preexisting conditions hidden cancers disorders   so the companies must do what takes business sense and either deny you coverage or charge a rate that covers the risk they would be forced to take    in your question on travel there was a response that suggested you get international health insurance instead of travel health insurance that would be considered credible coverage   you are trying to save money which on a personal level is a good idea   however that is against the societal and business need that you maintain health coverage during your healthy times to cover the costs of those who need expensive treatment   so you will be monetarily penalized should you choose to the society of insured people   once you have paid the higher rate for up to 18 months you should be able to get a better policy for people who have had continuous coverage   alternately you may be lucky enough to start working for a company that provides health insurance with out requiring continuous coverage

to try to answer the three explicit questions every share of stock is treated proportionately each share is assigned the same dollar amount of investment part of the contribution in the example and has the same discount amount 15 of $ 20 or $ 25 depending on when you sell usually so if you immediately sell 120 shares at $ 25 you have taxable income on the gain for those shares either selling immediately or holding for the long term period 12 18 mo can be advantageous just in different ways    selling immediately avoids a risk of a decline in the price of the stock and allows you to invest elsewhere and earn income on the proceeds for the next 12 18 months that you would not otherwise have had   the downside is that all of your gain $ per share is taxed as ordinary income    holding for the full period is advantageous in that only the discount 15 of $ 20 or $ 25 will be taxed as ordinary income and the rest of the gain sell price minus $ 20 or $ 25 will be taxed at long term capital gain tax rates which generally are lower than ordinary rates all taxes are due in the year you do sell   the catch is you will sell at different price higher or lower and thus have a risk of loss or gain you will never be federally double taxed in any scenario   the $ 3000 you put in will not be taxed after all is sold as it is a return of your capital investment   all money you receive in excess of the $ 3000 will be taxed in all scenarios just potentially at different rates ordinary or capital gain   all this ignores amt considerations which you likely are not subject to

this is a very trivial scam flow is like this send money to mr. x you in this case call mr. x and ask for the money back because mistake usually they ask for a wire transfer cash gift cards prepaid cards or something else irreversible mr. x initiates transfer back to scammer accept the transfer from mr. x dispute the original transfer or otherwise cancel it through the mr. x can not dispute his transfer to the scammer since it was genuinely and intentionally initiated by mr. x. end up with twice the money at the expense of mr. x in other countries this is usually done with forged checks but transfers can work just as well as long as the transfer can be retroactively canceled or reversed the scam works you mentioned money laundering this is definitely a possibility as well they transfer dirty money to you from sources and you send a gift to them with a clear paper trail when the audit comes the only proof is that you actually sent them the gift and no one will believe your story you 'll have to explain why the mr. z who 's now in jail sent you a $ 1 k of his drug money however in this case i think it is more likely a scam and the scammer did n't really know what he was doing

i am assuming you are asking for tax purposes in oregon there is a distinction between full year and partial year residency for tax purposes you are most likely considered a partial year resident since you moved into the state last year however there are also special conditions under which you might be considered a full year resident so check out the state 's tax residency rules here

it 's all about what you value personally i 'm and drive a $ 40 k luxury sports car   i also happen to wear a $ 6 k every day   i purchased both of these items because i thought they were beautiful when i saw them on the flip side because i spent 6 years living below the poverty line i spend almost nothing on a daily basis   my food budget is less than $ 50 a week and i never go out to eat   i wear my clothes and shoes and until they have holes and i drove my previous car a toyota into the ground   my cell phone is 5 years old   the walls of my apartment are bare   i do n't have cable tv i do n't subscribe to newspapers or magazines and i do n't own a pet   in all of these cases i do n't feel like i 'm sacrificing anything food and clothes and cell phones and pets just do n't matter to me if you truly feel that you 're missing something in your life by not having a luxury car that owning one would be more satisfying than owning the corresponding tens of thousands of dollars then go for it   just be sure to consider all the other things that money could buy before you do lastly buy in cash   do n't make monthly payments unless you enjoy giving money away to the bank

i transfer all their funds to my bank account are they paying tax on that transfer   gifts under $ 14,000 are excluded from taxation in the us but they 're going going to have a hard time arguing that it is a gift since they expect it back   the taxes are almost certainly going to exceed the amount you can make from your investments in the short term and if they are n't paid then your clients are going to be in hot water with the irs you need to have something set up that establishes you as merely managing the funds and not receiving them personally as a transfer   the other answers have good suggestions

most people on reddit do n't seem to get any system they 're talking about and this is the perfect example    the patent was approved before the sale it takes about 2 years to get a non controversial patent in the us maybe they were in talks for this acquisition 2 1/2 years ago but that 's somewhat unlikely given the timelines for most acquisitions    it would be so far and away more valuable to amazon to prevent a shopper at a competitor from seeing that they could get the same product for 30 less on amazon than to ever prevent someone in their forthcoming brick and mortar empire from doing it   as far as a brick and mortar store goes groceries is also a very low margin one yes they picked the high end market that would be better than your average safeway bi lo or walmart but it 's also a relatively small one compared to the alternatives and i think it 's dumb to expect that to make a difference groceries are the final frontier for amazon as far as making sure they can deliver anything anywhere today it 's basically having cold storage warehouses in every metro area without having to build them    edit yeah there was a missed double negative there obviously it 's in their interest to keep other businesses from preventing people in their stores from realizing they can get things cheaper on amazon

trade in values are generally below what you can get in a private sale to directly answer your question you should sell the crossover yourself and use the balance to purchase your new vehicle i would encourage you to use the $ 9k to finance directly without a lease especially if you are planning on financing after the lease term the lease will not save you money over the time you drive the vehicle in this case and worse will likely expose you to risk of having to pay additional fees if you break certain terms in the lease mileage wear and tear etc best option mathematically is to use the $ 9k to purchase a vehicle for cash this provides the lowest total cost of ownership   even if you are afraid of purchasing a lemon leasing a vehicle is awfully expensive insurance against that possibility you would have to rack up some significant repairs to justify the cost of the lease vs cash over the term of operating the vehicle

at least with us tax law where you only pay taxes at the higher rate for the income above the minimum for that tax bracket you will always wind up ahead taking the raise if you are simply concerned with after tax fica income   for example assume you were making $ the top end of the 10 bracket in the us and got a $ 100 raise you would be taxed roughly as follows after tax income before raise $ x 100 10 after tax income after raise $ x +   $ 100 x you can easily see that the second number is always higher than the first as long as the raise is a positive amount obviously

the actual price is represented on charts and not the change in price as a percentage because it is the actual price which is used in all other parts of analysis both technical and fundamental and it is the actual figure the security is bought and sold at a change in price has to be relative to a previous price at a previous time and we can easily work out the change in price over any given time period i think what you are concerned about is how to compare a certain actual price change in low priced securities to the same actual price change in a higher priced securities   for example $ 1.00 rise in a $ 2.00 stock representing a 50 increase in price $ 1.00 rise in a $ 10.00 stock representing a 10 increase in price on a standard chart both of these look the same as they both show a $ 1.00 increase in price so what can we do to show the true representation of the percentage increase in price it is actually quite simple you view the chart using a log scale instead of a standard scale most charting packages should have this option what may look like a bubble on a standard scale chart looks like a healthy uptrend on a log scale chart and represents a true picture of the percentage change in price example of standard price scale vs log price scale on a chart standard price scale   on the standard scale the price seems to have very little movement from to and then the price seems to zoom up after to this is because a 4 increase for example of $ 0.50 is only $ 0.02 whilst a 4 increase of $ 7.00 $ 0.28 so the increases seem much bigger at the end of the chart log price scale   on the log chart however these price changes seem to be more evenly displayed no matter at what price level the price change has occurred at this thus give a better representation of how fast or slow the price is rising or falling or the size of the change in price

let me start with something you might dismiss as trite correlation does not mean causation   a money manager charging say 1 is n't likely to take on clients below a minimum level   on the other hand there 's a long debate regarding how on average managed funds do n't beat the averages   i think that you should look at it this way people that have money tend to be focused on other things a brain surgeon making $ 500k yr may not have the time nor the inclination to want to manage her own money   i was always a numbers person i at the difference between raising 1.1 to the power getting i.e. getting times your investment after 40 years at 10 vs at 9 that 1 difference feels like nothing but after a lifetime 1/3 of your money has been skimmed off the top the data show that one can do better by simply putting their money into a mix of s&p index and cash and beat the average money manager over time regardless of convoluted 12 asset class allocations   similarly there are people who use a tax guy in quotes because i mean this as an individual whom they go to year after year not a storefront my used to go to one and i was curious what they got for their money each year he sent them a form 3 pages they needed to fill in every cell made its way into the guy 's tax program the last year i went with them to pick up the tax return i asked him if he noticed that they might benefit from small roth conversions each year or by making some of their ira rmd directly to charity he kindly told me that 's not what we do here and us away i planned both questions in advance the roth conversion was a strategy that one could agree made sense or dismiss as convoluted for some clients but the rmd issue was very different they did n't have enough schedule a deductions to itemize therefore the $ 3000 they donated each year was n't impacting their return by donating directly from their iras this money would avoid tax it would have saved them more than the cost of the tax guy who charged a hefty fee in my opinion it seemed to me this particular strategy should be obvious to one whose business is preparing returns

no the stock market and investing in general is not a zero sum game   some types of trades are zero sum because of the nature of the trade    but someone is n't necessarily losing when you gain in the sale of a stock or other security i 'm not going to type out a technical thesis for your question   but the main failure of the idea that investing is zero sum is the fact the a company does not participate in the transacting of its stock in the secondary market nor does it set the price this is materially different from the trading of options contracts   options contracts are the trading of risk one side of the contract wins and one side of the contract loses if you want to run down the economic theory that if bought her shares from bob someone else is missing out on 's money you 're free to do that   but that would mean that literally every transaction in the entire economy is part of a zero sum game and really misses the definition of zero sum game poker is a zero sum game   all players bet in to the game in equal amounts one player takes all the money   and hell i 've played poker and lost but still sometimes feel that received value in the form of entertainment

generally speaking most banks will require all of the signers on the account to be present   however and this is the big however the signers do not necessarily need to be the same people as the members you could have one of the members be the sole signer you could have an outside accountant be the signer etc regardless of who your signers are ie even if they are the same as the members you will absolutely need a resolution from the members giving the signers authority to be signers so for instance if you personally will be present but the other member wo n't be you will both need to sign the resolution appointing you as the signer

while i do not have an issue with treating customers clients well the whole mentality of the customer is always right needs to be re evaluated    in a case where a customer has unreasonable demands or is treating an employee poorly by no fault of the employee their privilege to be right ends in situations like that it is more important to stand up for your employees then it is to side with the customer if you do side with the customer in that situation it not only reinforces that behavior from the customer but makes the employee feel undervalued and will lead to morale issues if your workplace has consistent morale issues you will have a high turnover rate this will end up costing you considerably more not just in human capital but in workplace knowledge time and most prominently money chances are if a customer is being a huge drain of your resources they are likely not worth too much to your company to begin with see below    another reason why this mentality of every customer is valuable is a bad idea is found within the 80/20 principle simply put 80 of your revenue will come from 20 of your customer base and usually the 20 tend to be the lowest maintenance and have the lowest resource demand another application of this principle shows that 20 of your customer base accounts for 80 of the resource usage within your company the principle itself is not limited to 80/20 but the of a majority of x is provided by the minority of y is something that remains consistent across economies and cultures    in short not all customers are created equal and as a result do not deserve the same resources as one another in addition to this workforce integrity is more important in the long run than possibly losing a customer average firms provide good service excellent firms provide smart service

i 'm a manager of a charity shop so work with a wide range of unpaid volunteers which requires an especially soft touch most of the time everyone is different or people will just leave   it takes longer but the overall results are better and more long lasting     think of it like pushing a boat from the with your hand always applying a small pressure to get the boat to gradually move where you want rather than ramming into the side of a boat with a truck sure it 'll get you there quicker but will cause lasting damage   it 's also best to take it slow as you need time to learn the business and people   be clear about your approach with your boss managing their expectations is important   anyway here is what i 've learnt in my first year or so doing this job plus things i 've learnt along the way in my previous career as a software engineer radical career change where i 've managed people and been managed   1 be yourself   do n't pretend to be someone you 're not everyone will see right through you in an instant   you 'll change over time as you get used to managing people that 's fine but always be yourself through that   1 say thank you to everyone at the end of each day as you say goodbye   mean it   think of all the work they 've done today for you   1 spread the shit evenly   every job has crap parts make sure you and everyone else gets their fair share and no more   i regularly hoover clean the bathroom wash up and so on   1 ask do n't tell   if you orders people will do them but they 'll put no effort into it and you 'll distance yourself from them   ask if they could do something for you   it 's a nobody ever says no unless there is an issue which you need to deal with anyway   1 pick your battles   is it worth moaning at someone for that little   or can you get over that message another way   i.e. i do n't like people having drinks on the till counter so when i take over to cover for them for a break i just move it   after a while no drinks appear on the counter   1 be honest   if you do n't know say so ask for input   weigh up the options out loud then pick one explain why and go for it or better yet get the person that thought of it working with you not for you to implement it   if you 're wrong hold your hand up and try the other   1 always take responsibility when things go wrong that is actually your job   when things go well use you and   if things go badly sometimes i sometimes we but never   1 always be pro active with money   if you owe your staff money for any reason chase them to give it to them never let them chase you   if there even might be any problems at all with money let everyone know as soon as you know   go out of your way to ensure they get what they 're owed now not later   i just did this today actually i forgot to do expenses for someone and switched over the till so there was n't enough cash in the new till to cover it so i just took it from the money to bank and marked down why there was a discrepancy on the paperwork and will do the same tomorrow when that does n't match by the opposite amount   i should not do this at all but it 's the right thing to do   1 listen carefully   often employees have problems but wo n't bring them up either they do n't think anything will get done or they do n't want to get someone in trouble or something else   however if you listen and observe carefully often there are clues to the things that are bothering them and you 'll find ways to tackle them   1 do n't run a team meeting until you know everyone if you can avoid it   you do n't know shit about how the company works who the people are what makes them tick what they do and so on   all you 'll do is come across as a bit of a tool and distance yourself from them as boss   when you do run one just guide it do n't lead it   always hand over control of the conversation as much as possible except of course where you 've got things that they need to hear   1 never joke about your power   i.e. do n't mess about saying how you 'll fire them if blah or how you 'll give them all the shit work or mention pay etc   i had a boss that did that when drunk not in a serious way at all and he was very widely hated for pretty well nothing other than that   it served as a constant reminder that he 's separate from us   1 give people room but do n't be taken for a ride   if someone is late once fine i would n't even mention it   late again maybe i 'd make a light joke of it   late again we 'll have a chat always listen to what they have to say is there any way you can help   but do n't be taken for a ride   i 've had people pick me up on being late the very first time i was late and you know what i was more late for that job from then on than i 've ever been before or since   1 try to get your employees to come up with ideas to move the business forwards   it 's very easy to look at a business and say we need this that and the other doing like this   but you need to get your employees to buy into it or they just wo n't do it properly   it 'll be like getting blood out of a stone to start with but if you 're patient and support their ideas most people will come around   you need their input as they know their job better than you   1 edit always be clear what you want from people when   speak with them about the before hand to make sure they 're comfortable with it and think it can be done in the time   so many times i 've been given tasks with unrealistic deadlines the manager has n't wanted to listen to my protests then wonders why it did n't get done in time   it 's crazy really wanting something to be possible does n't make it so   a not so quick example   one volunteer said to me that we should halve the price of all the fiction books to .99 to compete with other shops   i personally do n't think that 's a good idea our shop has better quality stock and is much more organised but i have no evidence to the contrary and i honestly do n't really know so i say go for it and support it completely as a good idea   we tried it for a month and we made exactly the same amount of money sold twice as many books but no extra cash   so it was valuable to do and we discovered that maybe 1.49 might be a good option to try   but far more importantly they saw their ideas put into action right away and saw the results of that   it empowered them which is incredibly important for a wide variety of reasons that are too much to go into here but basically it makes them feel more respected enjoy their job more think more about the business and so on you know what it 's like when you 're empowered how good it feels   however it 's being empowered with the support that 's important something which you personally going into your new job do n't feel you have which leads to the anxiety and so on i 'm sure you 're feeling now   do n't put your employees in that position if you can help it   there is also another reason why i outright supported their idea from the offset   it did n't work although we did n't loose anything and i thought it would n't but i can say we tried   it was n't down to that one person they did n't feel bad that it did n't work because i was right behind it and it 's my job to take responsibility   if it had been their idea that had failed they would n't give any ideas ever again and everyone else would be put off too   as soon as anyone tries to take personal responsibility and they will stick to your guns in supporting them stronger than ever   now we 're getting a lot of ideas all the time they 're having in depth discussions amongst each other they 're pro active and so on   as a business we 're doing much better now because of it profits are up 15 from last year and we 've only just begun to kick things off and that 's going against a national trend downwards   we 've had several critical changes to our shop layout back room organisation results reporting stock handling processes and so on all from volunteer ideas and feedback   so the 15 is actually the tip of the iceberg what we 've got in place now should allow us to grow more quickly too   and remember you can make suggestions too of course but they 're just that suggestions   suggest them to your employees speak with several of them then get back to them when you 've made a decision   do n't say i 'm thinking of trying this say i was just thinking what about this   do you think it would work and talk about it   think of arguments against your idea see if they counter them and so on   now how many of these changes did i think of before hand and want to enact   about half so we 've got a significant number of successful ideas that i personally had n't thought of everyone 's happier and working harder for the business and we have a bright future   i have more ideas too and people listen to and respect them now just like i have with them   i think that 's the key to it all really   show your employees respect and they 'll show you it in return

i do n't see a tag for united states so i 'm having to assume this is us taxes   it does n't matter what app you use irs trades are all calculated the same first you have to report each trade on a 8949 and from that the totals go into a schedule d.   short term trades are stocks that you 've kept exactly one year or less long term trades are for 1 year + 1 day or more   trades where you sold a stock for a loss then bought that stock back again under 30 days do n't get to count as a loss   this only affects realized capital gains and losses you do n't count fees first take all of your short term gains then offset them by all of your short term losses   do the same for long term gains and losses   short and long term gains are taxed at different rates   you can deduct losses from short term to your long term and vice versa   then you can deduct the total losses up to $ 3000 household $ 1500 married filing separately per year on your regular income taxes or other dividend taxes   if you have over $ 3000 in losses then you need to carry that over to subsequent years edited per dave 's comments thanks dave

yah so the collapse of the housing market wiped out a generation of wealth in this country part of that was consumers signing onto toxic mortgages the other part were banks willfully toxic assets so i get the argument we need less regulation but your asshole cronies also were a huge part of why so many people lost everything now because of a generational loss of wealth student loan debt and stagnant income our society is forever changed the gap between the rich and poor is n't sustainable now maybe regulation is part of why we have n't built pieces back however let 's not forget that lies by banks were a big reason we are here most people have less than 1000 in savings and many many people have lost all the equity in their home then hedge funds bought up tons of real estate for dirt cheap and now charges rent so for most americans rentals and perpetual debt are the norm so i get it we need smart regulation but this does n't know what it 's like for most of america his industry keeps the economy going but also fucked it beyond recognition

do n't do debt   after a few years i forget how many the bad history will have rolled off but by then you will probably have no desire to go back into debt again if you do want to build up a credit score then at that point it 's essentially the same as starting from scratch   however from personal experience once you 've lived debt free for a few years you never want to get back on the debt wheel again a credit score is the output of a behavioral model that indicates the chances that a bank will earn money from your business do things that earn the banks money and you will have a high credit score

no this logic is dangerous   the apples to apples comparison between renting and buying should be between similar living arrangements one ca n't legitimately compare living in a 600 sq ft studio to a 3500 sq ft house   with the proposal you offer one should get the largest mortgage they qualify for but that can result in a house far too big for their needs borrowing to buy just what you need makes sense borrowing to buy a house with rooms you may never visit not a great idea   by the way do the numbers the 30 year rate is 4 you 'd need a $ 250,000 mortgage to get $ 10,000 in interest the first year that 's a $ house given an 80 loan on a median income do you think it makes sense to buy a house twice the us median   last a portion of the tax savings is lost to the fact that you have a standard deduction of nearly $ 6,000 in 2012 so that huge mortgage gets you an extra $ 4000 in write off and $ 600 back in taxes   do n't ever let the tax tail wag the investing dog or in this case the house dog   edit the investment return on real estate is a hot topic i think it 's fair to say that long term one must include the rental value of the house in calculating returns in the case of buying of way too big house you are not getting the return it 's the same as renting a four bedroom but leaving three empty   if i can go on a bit i own a rental it 's worth $ 200 k and after condo fee and property tax i get $ 10k yr a 5 return plus whatever appreciation now if i lived there i 'd correctly claim that part of my return is the rental value the rent i do n't pay elsewhere so the return to me is the potential growth as well as saved rent but if the condo rents for $ 1200 and i 'd otherwise live in a $ 600 apartment with less space the return to me is lost in my personal case in fact i bought a too big house not too big for our paycheck the cost and therefore the mortgage were well below what the bank qualified us for too big for the need i paid for two rooms we really do n't use

in this answer i wo n't elaborate on the possibilities of fraud or pure human error because something can always go wrong i will however explain why i think you should always keep receipts when the monthly or so time comes to pay your credit card bill your credit card company sends you a list of transactions that list has two primary purposes both of which i would consider equally important while for the former item a receipt is not necessary though it certainly does not hurt showing the receipt along with the bill to provide further proof that the payment was indeed connected to that bill the latter point does require you to store the receipts so you can check item by item whether each of the sums is correct and matched with a receipt at all so unless you can actually memorize all the credit card transactions you did throughout the past one or two months the receipts are the most convenient way of keeping that information until the bill arrives yes your credit card company probably has some safeguards in place to reveal fraud which might kick in in time the criteria are mostly it seems with credit cards or legitimate transactions here getting blocked every now and then simply because some travelling of the actual owner was misinterpreted as theft however it is your money it is your responsibility to discover any issues with the bill just as you would check the monthly transaction list from your bank account line by line ultimately that is why you sign the vendor copy of the receipt when buying something offline if you discover an issue in your list of transactions you have to notify your credit card company that you dispute one of the charges and then the charging vendor has to show that they have your signature for the respective transaction so to summarize do keep your receipts use them to check the list of transactions before paying your credit card bill edit the receipt often can not be replaced with the bill from the vendor the bill is useful for seeing how the sum charged by the respective vendor was created but in turn such bills often do not contain any payment information or when payment was concluded before the bill was printed as sometimes happens in pre paid scenarios such as hotel booking remarks such as payment received without any further indication of which one of your credit cards debit cards bank accounts stored value cards or cash was used

your impression about banks and bankers is very wrong   wall street banks can and often do lose in transactions   in fact banks go bankrupt and/or require massive bailouts to survive because they sometimes lose a ton of money   the business of investment banking often involves bearing risk for customers which by definition means they lose some of the time   generally the risks they take on individual transactions are not large enough to bring the whole bank down but sometimes they are   banking is a job like any other except that it has more risk than most anyway to your point how do underwriters make money on shares that fall in value before the sale   on the commission   the issuing company will normally pay the investment bank a percentage of the funds raised in the offering regardless of the price   of course it 's possible for the bank to still lose money if their contract stipulates a minimum price and they are not able to meet it   in that case the bank may lose on that offering contradicting your preconceived notion by the way one other question implicit in your post why was the secondary offering considered bad news   if the ceo and other insiders have private information that indicates that the stock is overvalued then doing a secondary offering at the inflated price will greatly enrich them   because this happens some times investors are wary about secondary offerings   this makes companies that would otherwise do a secondary offering shy away from it even if shares are not overpriced   therefore if a company is doing a secondary offering the market is likely to worry that the stock is overvalued even at a reduced price

yield on a treasury bond increases this primarily happens when the government increases interest rates or there is too much money floating around and the government wants to suck out money from the economy this is the first step not the other way around the most recent case was fed buying up bonds and hence releasing money in to the economy so companies and people start investing to push the economy on the growth path   banks normally base their interest rates on the treasury bonds which they use as a reference rate because of the probability of 0 default as mortgage is a long term investment so they follow the long duration bonds issued by the fed they than put a premium on the money lent out for taking that extra risk so when the governments are trying to suck out money there is a dearth of free flowing money and hence you pay more premium to borrow because supply is less demand is more demand will eventually decrease but not in the short run why do banks increase the rates they loan money at when people sell bonds not people per se but primarily the central bank in a country i.e. fed in us

i would like to offer a different perspective here   the standard fee for a credit card transaction is typically on the order of 30 cents + 2.5 of the amount the actual numbers vary but this is the ballpark this makes small charges frequently unprofitable for small merchants because of this they will often have minimum purchase requirements for credit debit card payments the situation changes for large retailers think wal mart target safeway home depot i can not find a citation for this right now but large retailers are able to negotiate volume discounts from credit card companies a guy who used to work in finance at home depot told me this once their transaction fees are much lower than 30 cents + 2.5 but you get the same reward points on your credit card debit card regardless of where you swipe it so my personal philosophy is large chain swipe away without guilt for any amount small merchant use cash unless it 's hundreds of dollars and then they may give you a cash discount in that case and make sure to carry enough cash for such situations when i was a student that was about $ 20 enough for coffee or lunch at a small place

if you are investing for 10 years then you just keep buying at whatever price the fund is at this is called dollar cost averaging if the fund is declining in value from when you first bought it then when you buy more the average price you bought in at is now lower so therefore your losses are lower and when it goes back up you will make more even if it continues to decline in value then you keep adding more money in periodically eventually your position will be so large that on the first uptick you will have a huge percent gain anyway this is only suggested because you are in it for 10 years other people 's investment goals vary

brokers usually have this kind of information you can take a look at interactive brokers for instance you are interested in the initial margin which in this case is $ so you need that amount to buy sell 1 future in the contract specification you see the contract is made for 100 ounces at the current price $ that would be a total of $ 180,000 it is equivalent to saying you are getting 30x leverage if you buy 1 future and the price goes from $ 1,800 to $ the contract would go from $ 180,000 to $ you make $ 5,000 or a 82 return i am pretty sure you can imagine what happens if the market goes against you   futures are great when your timing is perfect

there is not one right way it depends on the level of detail that you need one way would be create the following accounts when you pay the phone bill when you are paid with the reimbursement that is when you pay the phone bill you must debit both phone expense to record the expense and also reimbursements due to record the fact that someone now owes you money if it 's useful you could add another layer of complexity when you receive the bill you have a liability and when you pay it you discharge that liability whether that 's worth keeping track of depends i never do for month to month bills afterthought i see another poster says that your method is incorrect because a reimbursement is not salary technically true though that problem could be fixed by the account to something like income from employer the more serious problem i see is that you are reversing the phone expense when you are reimbursed so at the end of the year you will show total phone expense as $ 0 this is clearly not correct you did have phone expenses they were just reimbursed you really are treating the expense account as an asset account phone expenses due to be reimbursed by employer

but their strategy is not debt spending to increase demand every time we start getting anywhere near a balanced budget they cut taxes again so that they can continue blaming the deficit on pork barrel spending forcing ever more draconian budget cuts that will never ultimately balance the budget it 's called a starve the wiki strategy    deficit spending does drive demand short term but as this debt rises so does the rent seeking cost of that debt after some point this debt cost exceeds the benefits derived from the debt incurred in any given year just because you cab say the debt incurred this year exceeds the cost of the debt incurred this year does not mean that these benefits will remain positive overall as the debt remains on the books indefinitely not just for the year they were incurred this is not to claim that all debt is bad but you ca n't make broad statements about the benefits of debt in general   most such debt spending is a complete waste because your taxes are not defined by how much they take from your paycheck alone when debt is used for consumption spending rather than investment spending that increases productive capacity this consumption leaves fewer goods and services remaining on the market for the rest of the consumers competing for it raising your cost of living your tax rate is not determined by how much money the government takes from you it 's determined by how much they spend that is how much they are taking from the consumer market    granted given the low wages relative to capital prod media newshour jpg demand consumption is overly suppressed resulting in an wiki overproduction problems which makes debt spending look even more financially appealing because it 's not actually suppressing the already excessive demand constraints but this is because you wages have been suppressed so instead of paying taxes you are working for a lower income in fact the loss of wages relative to capital returns i.e. your cost of living actually well exceeds your tax cut your just paying those taxes through lower wages or an increased cost of living instead of taxes out of your paycheck so your being conned out of that money while the people doing it are pretending to cut taxes   the same applies to the rich sites files in a different way there is a limit to how rich you can get from a population of poor people when you cut wages too far below productive capacity to save cost it dries up demand people ca n't afford as much of your product as you can produce so they cut jobs i. production to match market demand which drives demand even lower pushing inflation and the velocity of money to historic lows in spite of an increased money supply this also makes it unprofitable to invest in new productive capacity when market demand is already saturated wages relative to capital returns must increase to fix it but if you take it too far it drives inflation to unacceptable levels but at the present ratio we are a long ways from that

from experience mastercard and visa charge vendors about the same around while american express and diners club are astonishingly expensive and you 'll find that few small retailers are very comfortable accepting these the variation comes from the volume of trade that vendors provide   a big retailer will negotiate a very low rate while smaller businesses will be hit with higher charges

according to the options industry council put options   the shares and therefore the options may continue trading otc but if the shares completely stop trading then if the courts cancel the shares whereby common shareholders receive nothing calls will become worthless and an investor who exercises a put would receive 100 times the strike price and deliver nothing the reason for this is that it is not the company whose shares you have the option on that you have a contract with but the counterparty who wrote the option if the counterparty goes bankrupt then you may not get paid out depending on assets available at liquidation this is counterparty risk but unless the two are the same if the company whose shares you have a put option on declares bankruptcy then you will get paid

usually sell every month arguably every day you own the house it is costing you money for mortgage and taxes and upkeep unless it is also producing income or you are actually living in it that is a serious problem in any sane market it is extremely unlikely that the house can gain enough value to offset that loss   renting it out even if you lose money versus the costs would at least slow the bleeding but unless you actually want to deal with rental or strongly expect to return very soon selling rapidly for a good price is usually optimal of course when setting the asking price and negotiating offers you are going to have to consider exactly this trade off

it very much comes down to question of semantics and your particular situation some people do not view a house and most upgrades as an investment but rather an expense   i certainly agree that this is probably the case if you pay someone else to make the repairs and upgrades   however if you are a serious that may not be the case   of course if the house is a money pit and/or you were unfortunate to buy when prices where ridiculously high you 'll have a hard time making any money on this investment   to continue this game of semantics you may also consider the value you extract from your home while you are living in it on to the mortgage itself   chances are that it is a long term relatively low rate loan and that the interest is deductible   so there are some disadvantages to paying it down early even without early payment penalties   paying down early on the principal is a disadvantage from a tax perspective   how much of a disadvantage hinges on the rate now a debt is a liability on your personal balance sheet   it drags down any returns you may have from investing   however a home lone is not generally subject to the rule of paying off your high interest debt before investing   it should not be relatively high and it pays for something necessary   it may be that any credit card debt you have may have paid for something considered necessary   however with the relatively high interest rates you have to question just how necessary any credit card debt really is   not to mention that there is no tax advantage so it comes down to the fact that a home loan should be relatively low interest paying for something you must have and that you hopefully have some tax advantage from the interest you pay on it

there are several reasons first if you sell your stock at any price you may be selling it for less than you originally bought it for   thus you will take a loss right at the beginning of your scheme   if you rinse and repeat the problem only gets worse   every time you sell your stock you will have to sell it at an even lower price in order to lower the price even more   then you buy it back and just resell it an even lower price   it should be clear that you are not making any money this way second even if you do n't sell it at an absolute loss you must sell it at a relative loss in order to lower the price   in other words if someone will currently buy your shares for $ x and you want to lower the price you must sell them for less than $ x.   but you could have made more money by selling them for $ x since someone was already willing to buy them at that price   in order to bring the price down significantly you have to sell the stock for less than people currently believe it is worth which means you 're incurring a loss relative to just selling it at the market rate   of course you can still make money if it goes back up again but selling it at an extra loss this way just makes it harder to break even third if you sell the stock at $ x whoever you sold it to is not going to sell it right back to you at $ x because then they would not make any money   you could in theory buy it from someone else but the same principle holds if the stock price has just gone down people who have it may be waiting for it to go back up   this is doubly true if anyone suspects you have been trying to manipulate the stock price because they will then suspect that the price drop is artificial and it will soon go back up fourth even if someone did sell it right back to you at the price you sold it for then what   you now hold the stock at a lower price but you do n't gain unless it goes back up   if it was n't going up before until you took action there is no reason to suppose it will go back up now   in fact if you had enough shares to significantly influence the price other people may have been fooled into thinking the value is actually lower now the basic problem is that in order for you to buy it at a low price someone else has to sell it at that low price   it is easy to sell someone a stock for less than it 's worth but it will be hard to get people to sell it back to you for less than it 's worth   if you engage in deceptive practices to get people to do this you may be guilty of securities fraud

as your main concern seems to be that you are not sure whether you can ever get a house and actually support the expenses it incurs when you have one here is a very simple answer   you say you are currently decreasing your creditcard debt by 2k per month at that rate it will be finished within 2 years try to pay it off completely if this succeeds in the next 2 years you can be confident that you can afford a 500k house paying back 50k high interest debt in 2 years is very roughly equivalent to back 500k low interest debt over 20 years a reasonable time period in my environment so just pay back the creditcard as fast as you can if two years sounds like a long time there is nothing stopping you to pay it back a little bit faster even   note this is written under the assumption that your student loan burden will not increase over time

it is possible but unlikely securities firms would prefer never to settle externally rather they prefer to wait until the liabilities can be netted   they are forced to make and take payment in three business days the reason why is because settlement is costly in the same way as any other business would prefer to build trade credit instead of taking or making payment rapidly the only circumstance where a financial firm would wish to take full delivery is when a counterparty is no longer trusted to be solvent
