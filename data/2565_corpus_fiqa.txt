switzerland was once known for its high regard for private property rights   recently it is has started to violate those rights by forcing banks to turn over the names of account holders to the us government   not a great trend another aspect that makes switzerland an attractive place for people and businesses is the swiss 's neutral policy   the swiss government is not deploying the swiss military around the globe to fight terrorism to spread democracy to advance its own power or other such murderous government programs   the swiss people do not have to worry about the payback that arrives because of such government programs the swiss were traditionally extreme advocates of individual gun rights which allows the people to provide protection for themselves against others and against the government   this too is changing read section on the enemy within in a not so favorable direction i also the swiss franc was the last major currency to sever its tie to gold   the currency use to be highly desired due to its tie to gold   i think the currency is still highly regarded but the swiss central bank is participating in the currency war and has attempted multiple times in the past couple of years to its currency so it does not appreciate against the euro or dollar

as per wikipedia of right now here are unemployment figures for switzerland and surrounding countries liechtenstein unfortunately does not have a large job market given its total population of about 37,000 people and note that the german figure of 4.5 is the lowest it has been for decades i 'd expect this number to go up and the swiss one to stay constant bottom line you will have an easier time finding a job in switzerland plus all the other good points the other answers raised great mountains great chocolate low taxes clean streets etc

the point of buying an index fund is that you do n't have to pick winners as long as the winners are included in the index fund which can include far more than 500 stocks you benefit on average because of overall upward historical market performance picking only the top 50 capitalized stocks in the s&p 500 does not guarantee you will successfully track the s&p 500 index because the stocks in the tail can account for an outsized amount of overall growth the top 50 stocks by market capitalization change over time and these stocks are not necessarily the stocks that perform better   as direct example the 10 year average annual return for the s&p top 50 is while the 10 year average annual return for the s&p 500 is issues of trading and balancing to maintain these aside these indices are not the same

really a comment on joetaxpayer 's answer but it 's too long there 's one big factor that for some people tips things strongly in favor of the roth while the limits on paper for traditional and roth are the same in practice they are not you can contribute more to a roth than you can to a traditional while the contribution limits are the same in both cases the roth holds after tax dollars and an after tax dollar is worth more than a pre tax dollar   if you 're not maxing your contribution this is completely irrelevant but if you are maxing your contributions and would like to contribute more this is a big push in the roth direction illustration   you 're in the 25 bracket you have $ 100k in a traditional ira   what 's it really worth   $ 75k because the irs will take $ 25k as you pull it out   you have the same $ 100k in a roth it 's really worth $ 100k as the ira wo n't take anything

what i think was being asked and so this is how i interpreted it is not the transition from public to private but a corporation itself buying all its shares back and as a result having no shareholders   in this case we could envision that all outstanding shares would be become treasury stock   my argument was that this would never happen in a practical setting   obviously if you interpret the question differently for instance to be about all the shares of firm being purchased by someone else as in a private equity buyout you get very different answers about practicality   so i 'm not disagreeing with you at all i just read the question differently

go to a good bookstore and find a book about saving on income tax unlike other countries where filling in your tax returns usually means you have to pay extra money in germany filling in your tax return usually means that you will be paid money and the more tax deductible items you can fill in the more money you will get back   at the very least ask some german colleagues about the most typical tax deductible items they love getting taxes back

people are trying ideas like this actually   though they generally are n't very public about it   while keshlam ventures into hyperbole when mentioning watson he is certainly correct human language parsing is a extremely hard problem while it is not always true that the big players will know before the news sometimes that would qualify as insider trading   the volume spike that you mention generally comes as the news arrives to the major and minor players   so if you have an algorithm run after the volume spike the price will likely have adjusted significantly already you can try to avoid this by constantly scanning for news on a set of stocks however this becomes an even harder problem   or maybe by becoming more specific and parsing known important and specific news sources farm report for instance and trying to do so faster than anyone else   these are some methods people use to not be too late

speaking from experience yes this was 9 years ago though and may have changed due to stricter laws i lived in london and was moving to nyc and wanted to have a functioning bank account upon arrival i banked in london with hsbc and asked them if they could set me up they connected me with the right people in the us and after many forms i had a fully functional us bank account with a foreign address and without having a social security number and i was am just your average person you will most likely not be able to get a credit card through them because of lack of credit history unless you are ridiculously rich or go for a secured credit card but a debit card should be possible my advice is to talk to your local bank and see if they can help you although it will help if they operate in the us good luck i have heard from various expats that american express may be willing to issue cards in the states based on their existing relation with clients in other countries but i digress if you have an amex in switzerland or sweden i would recommend talking to them

to expand on what and some others are saying   the only way to look at it is that the parents have invested because the parents get a of the property in the end rather than the original loan amount plus interest   it is investment it is not a loan of any kind   one way to understand this is to imagine that after 20 years the property in value or halves in value   the parents participate as if they had invested in 75 ownership of the property and the op as if 25 ownership of the property note that with a loan there is a potentially changing outstanding loan balance that could be paid to end the loan to pay off the loan and there is an agreed upon an interest rate that is computed on the outstanding balance none of those apply to this situation further with a loan there is no of the property though the property may be used to secure the loan that is n't ownership basically since the situation bears none of the qualities of a loan and yet does bear the qualities of investment the parents have bought a ownership of the property the parents have invested in 75 of the real estate and the op is renting that 75 from them for the total rent the op is paying the parents for their 75 of the property is then at least $   a rental rate of $ for 75 of the property equates to a rental price of $ for the whole property this arrangement is only fair to both parties when the fair market rental value of the whole property is $ it is unfair to the op when the fair market rental value of property is less and unfair to the parents when the fair market rental value of property is more    of course the fair market rental value of the property is variable over time so the overall fairness would need to understand rental values over time i feel like this is n't actually a loan if i can never build more equity in the condo am i missing something no it is n't a loan   you and your parents are co investing in real estate   further you are renting their portion of the investment from them for comparison with a loan you have 100 ownership in the property from the start so you the owner would see all the upside downside as the property valuation changes over time whether the loan is paid off or not the borrower owes the loan balance and interest not some of the property   a loan may be secured by the property using a lien but that is quite different from ownership   typically a loan has a payment schedule setup to reduce the loan balance steadily over time so that you eventually pay it off   with a loan you gain equity the amount you own outright free clear in two ways 1 by gradually paying off the loan over time so the portion of the property grows and 2 if the valuation of the property increases over time that gain in equity is yours not the lenders   however note that the legal ownership is all 100 yours from the start are my parents ripping me off with this deal that does n't allow me to build my equity in my home you can evaluate whether you are being ripped off by comparing the $ rate to the potential rental rate for the property over time which will be a range or curve and there are real estate websites like or others to help estimate what fair market rent might be are there similar deals like this   a straight forward loan would have the borrower with 100 legal ownership from the start just that the property secures the loan   whereas with co investment there is a division of ownership that is fixed from the start    it is unusual to have both investment and loan at the same time where they are setup for gradual change between them   investment and loan can certainly be done together but would usually be done as completely separate contracts one loan one investment with no adjustment between the two over time to do both investment and loan would be unusual but certainly be possible i would imagine however that is not the case here as being described   i am not familiar with contracts that do both so as to take over the equity ownership investment over time while also reducing loan balance   perhaps some forms of rent to own work that way something to look into still usually rent to own means that until the renter owns it 100 the landlord owns 100 rather than a gradual transfer over time gradual transfer would imply co ownership for a long time something that most landlords would be reluctant to do    transfer of any particular of real estate ownership typically requires filing documents with the county and may incur fees   i am not aware of counties that allow gradual transfer with one single filing   still the courts may honor a contract that does such gradual transfer outside of county filings if so what should i do explain the situation to your parents and in particular however far out of balance the rental rate may be   decide for yourself if you want to rent vs. buy and where that property or some other   if your parents are fair people they should be open to negotiation   if not you might need a lawyer    i suspect that a lawyer would be able to find several issues with which to challenge the contract the other terms are important as well namely gross vs. net proceeds as others point out because selling a property costs a to real estate agents and possibly some taxes as well and as the others have pointed out if the property ultimately looses value that could be factored in as well it is immaterial to judging the fairness of this particular situation whether getting a bank loan would be preferable to renting 75 from the parents   further loan interest rates do n't factor into the fairness of this rental situation but of course interest rates do factor into identifying the better of various methods of investment and methods of securing a place to live e.g. rent vs. buy contributed by if your parents view this as an investment arrangement as described then you need to clarify with them if the payments being made to them are considered a buy out of their share this would allow you to gain the equity you seek from the arrangement terms would have to be or have been declared to that effect this would involve specifying some schedule and/or rates   it would have to be negotiated this it is not something that could go assumed or

gt women entered the work force en mass and with twice as many potential employees the cost of labor decreased   sorry i 'll have to disagree with this   yes between the 60s and 80s married women started staying in the paid workforce   but this only increased the employment to population ratio from to about in 2000 it has since dropped down to   also since work that had previously been unpaid such as child minding house cleaning nursing of elders and food preparation increasingly became part of the paid economy   much of that extra labor was occupied in these new positions and so would n't have increased the overall competition for jobs   the idea that extra bodies competing for jobs would drive down the price of labor also needs to be justified   in a theoretically ideal market the actual number of players in the market does n't influence the price   only by assuming that the increase in supply increased the job seeker 's desperation for a job do we lower the price at which they are willing to sell their labor   but why should we assume job seekers became more desperate between the 60s and the 90s when the unemployment rate was about the same in both those periods

while i do not have an issue with treating customers clients well the whole mentality of the customer is always right needs to be re evaluated    in a case where a customer has unreasonable demands or is treating an employee poorly by no fault of the employee their privilege to be right ends in situations like that it is more important to stand up for your employees then it is to side with the customer if you do side with the customer in that situation it not only reinforces that behavior from the customer but makes the employee feel undervalued and will lead to morale issues if your workplace has consistent morale issues you will have a high turnover rate this will end up costing you considerably more not just in human capital but in workplace knowledge time and most prominently money chances are if a customer is being a huge drain of your resources they are likely not worth too much to your company to begin with see below    another reason why this mentality of every customer is valuable is a bad idea is found within the 80/20 principle simply put 80 of your revenue will come from 20 of your customer base and usually the 20 tend to be the lowest maintenance and have the lowest resource demand another application of this principle shows that 20 of your customer base accounts for 80 of the resource usage within your company the principle itself is not limited to 80/20 but the of a majority of x is provided by the minority of y is something that remains consistent across economies and cultures    in short not all customers are created equal and as a result do not deserve the same resources as one another in addition to this workforce integrity is more important in the long run than possibly losing a customer average firms provide good service excellent firms provide smart service

almost all major no load mutual fund families allow you to do the kind of thing you are talking about however you may need an initial investment of between $ 1000 to $ 3000 depending on the fund   once you have it however annual fee 's are usually very little and the fees to buy that companies funds are usually zero if it 's a no load company vanguard etc   with the larger companies that means you have a pretty large selection of funds but generally each fund has a minimum initial purchase once that 's met then you can buy additional amounts in small quantities without a problem for someone on a smaller budget many low cost brokers etrade as mentioned by scottrade as mentioned by myself in another similar question today allow you to start with smaller initial balances and have a small selection of funds or etf 's that you can trade from without commission   in the case of scottrade they have like 15 etf 's that you can trade comission free   check with the various low cost brokerages such as etrade scottrade and tdameritrade to see what their policies are and what if any funds etf 's they allow you to trade in without commissions keep in mind that for mutual funds there may still be a fund minimum initial investment that applies be sure to check if that is the case or not   the lack of any minimum investment makes etf 's a slightly more attractive option for someone who does n't have the buy in that many funds require

it is true that this is possible however it 's very remote in the case of the large and reputable fund companies such as vanguard fdic insurance protects against precisely this for bank accounts but mutual funds and etfs do not have an equivalent to fdic insurance one thing that does help you in the case of a mutual fund or etf is that you indirectly through the fund own actual assets in a cash account at a bank you have a promise from the bank to pay and then the bank can go off and use your money to make loans you do n't in any sense own the bank 's loans with a fund the fund company can not legally take your money out of the fund except to pay the expense ratio they have to use your money to buy stocks bonds or whatever the fund invests in those assets are then owned by the fund legally a mutual fund is a special kind of company defined in the investment company act of 1940 and is a separate company from the investment advisor such as vanguard funds have their own boards and in principle a fund board can even fire the company advising the fund though this is not likely since boards are n't usually independent a quick google found this article for more maybe someone can find a better one if vanguard goes under the funds could continue to exist and get a new adviser or could be liquidated with investors receiving whatever the assets are worth of course all this legal stuff does n't help you with outright fraud if a fund 's adviser says it bought the s&p 500 but really some guy bought himself a yacht madoff style then you have a problem but a huge well known etf has auditors tons of different employees lots of brokerage and exchange traffic etc so to me at least it 's tough to imagine a risk here with a small fund company with just a few people and there are lots of these then there 's more risk and you 'd want to carefully look at what independent agent holds their assets who their auditors are and so forth with regular mutual funds not etfs there are more issues with diversifying across fund companies with etfs there probably is n't much downside to diversifying since you could buy them all from one brokerage account maybe it even happens naturally if you pick the best etfs you can find personally i would just pick the best etfs and not worry about advisor diversity update maybe also deserving a mention are exchange traded notes etns an etn 's legal structure is more like the bank account minus the fdic insurance of course it 's an iou from the company that runs the etn where they promise to pay back the value of some index there 's no investment company as with a fund and therefore you do n't own a share of any actual assets if the etn 's sponsor went bankrupt you would indeed have a problem much more so than if an etf 's sponsor went bankrupt

as far as i knew a similar law was already on the books something about the commercial can be no louder than the volume of the show before it so the show would run at say 75 of normal output volume thus why your systems dvd players always seem louder they 're just not cut then they would run one loud explosion or word scene etc but short enough that you would n't turn it down then the commercials could be super loud

excellent summary i 'm going to steal the analogy as it is related to how i discuss the problems of austerity to people convinced it is fiscally conservative and the right thing to do when in a poor income generating situation i usually explain the difference as going into debt to fund better education or skills in well researched high demand areas and thereby improve your earning potential versus cutting spending until you are living in a box eating cat food thereby making it harder to get back on your feet

i do n't know australian law but i will give my us perspective here   the custom in the us is for officers and directors to be by the corporation and that llcs have an even broader power to even to remove the duty of loyalty   moreover directors will typically be able to purchase insurance to protect them from loss in the event of liability for us corporations not llcs the duty of care prudence requires that directors behave responsibly in weighing major decisions and consult experts and specialists before coming to rash decisions   it usually becomes a court case in the context of a large public company in the midst of an acquisition event   the only people with standing in the us are shareholders   if all the other shareholders are directors then it may be hard for them to blame you additionally if you are concerned about the of your actions there may be sources to rely on   first discussion with your fellow directors can be a helpful guide though will not usually you from any accusation of wrongdoing and disclosure tends to cure almost any accusation of breaching the duty of loyalty   second boards often secure the advice of legal counsel and sometimes bring on lawyers as members or will outright hire counsel for the board   third there may be services that will provide you with generic advice e.g. uk companies house and us based which might set you at ease a little bit i do n't know the details of australian law as i say   but my sense of common law countries is that like the us they are primarily concerned about negligence or neglecting to understand the business and make informed decisions fraudulently engaging in self interested transactions that either hurt the company or should have been offered to the company and not bothering to seek out information   as long as you are active informed engaged and not engaging in secret deals outside the company especially deals where either side is competing with the company then that would be more than sufficient under the us standard if you are concerned about liability then inquire into by the company in the us the company can usually pay all legal costs of directors insurance and legal counsel   i imagine your business partners are no more savvy than you are   my impression is you are to relatively rare and exotic expression of corporate law at least in the us but i 'll close by repeating that i do n't know australian corporate law

i 'd try to gently point out to your husband that what he thinks he wants to do now and what he might want to do in 20 or 30 years are not necessarily the same thing when i was 40 i was thinking that i would work until i died now i 'm 58 and have health problems and i 'm counting down the days until i can retire even if your husband is absolutely certain that he will not change his mind about retiring in the next 20 + years maybe something will happen that puts things beyond his control like medical problems or simply getting too old to be able to work is he sure that he will be able to continue to put in 40 hour weeks when he 's 80 90 100 just because you put money away for retirement does n't mean that you are required to retire if you put money away and when the time comes you do n't want to retire great now you can collect the profits on your investments in addition to collecting your salary and live very well or have a nice nest egg to leave to your children putting money away for retirement gives you options retirement does n't necessarily mean sitting around the house doing nothing until you waste away and die of boredom my parents were busier after they retired then when they were working they spent a lot of time on charity work visiting people in the hospital working with their church that sort of thing some people start businesses as they have retirement income coming in they do n't have to worry about the business earning enough to provide a living so they can do something they want to do because they think it 's fun or contributes to society or whatever etc

yes you can send in a 2012 1040-es form with a check to cover your tax liability however you will likely have to pay penalties for not paying tax in timely fashion as well as interest on the late payment you can have the irs figure the penalty and bill you for it or you can complete form 2210 on which these   matters are figured out yourself and file it with your form 1040 the long version of form 2210 often results in the smallest extra amount due but is considerably more time consuming to complete correctly alternatively if you or your wife have one or more paychecks coming before the end of 2012 it might be possible to file a new w-4 form with the hr department with a request to withhold additional amounts as federal income tax i say might because if the last paycheck of the year will be issued in just a few days time it might already have been sent for processing and hr might tell you it is too late but depending on the take home pay it might be possible to have the entire $ 2000 withheld as additional income tax instead of sending in a 1040-es the advantage of doing it through withholding is that you are allowed to treat the entire withholding for 2012 as satisfying the timely filing requirements so no penalty for late payment even though you had a much bigger chunk withheld in december and no interest due either   if you do use this approach remember that form w-4 applies until it is replaced with another and so   hr will continue to withhold the extra amount on your january paychecks as well   so file a new w-4 in january to get back to normal withholding fix the extra exemption too so the problem does not recur in 2013

when people even people in the media say the stock market is up because of x or the stock market is down because of y they are often engaging in what nicolas taleb calls the narrative they see the market has moved in one direction or another they open their newspaper pick a headline that provides a plausible reason for the market to move and say oh that is why the stock market is down very rarely do statements like this actually come from research asking people why they bought or sold that day sometimes they may be right but it is usually just story telling in terms of old fashioned logic this is called the post hoc ergo proper hoc fallacy now all the points people have raised about the us deficit may be valid and there are plenty of reasons for worrying about the future of the world economy but they were all known before the s&p report which did n't really provide the markets with much new information note also that the actual bond market did n't move much after hearing the same report in fact the price of 10 year us treasury bonds actually rose a tiny bit take these simple statements about what makes the market go up or down on any given day with several of salt

no your business can not deduct your non business expenses   you can only deduct from your business income those reasonable expenses you paid in order to earn income for the business moreover for there to be a tax benefit your business generally has to have income but i expect there are exceptions hst input tax credits come to mind the employment income from your full time job would n't count as business income for your corporation the corporation has nothing to do with that income it 's earned personally by you with respect to restaurant bills these fall under a category known as meals entertainment   even if the expense can be considered reasonable and business related e.g. meeting customers or vendors the canada revenue agency decided that a business can only deduct half of those kinds of expenses for tax purposes with respect to gasoline bills you would need to keep a mileage and expense log only the portion of your automobile expenses that relate to the business can be deducted   driving to and from your full time job does n't count of course i 'm not a tax professional   if you 're going to have a corporation or side business you ought to consult with a tax professional a point on terminology a business does n't write off eligible business expenses it deducts them from business income   write off is an accounting term meaning to reduce the value of an asset to zero e.g. if you damaged your car beyond repair one could say the car is a write off
# 67356
as some others have pointed out it 's key to remember the difference in market value and accounting value   to simplify things book value is the only item that specifically depreciates it happens in the world of accounting to try to time when did i use a long term asset with when did i obtain value from that asset for a house governments usually allow owners to claim depreciation of the building over a set period of time this does not affect your resale value of the house   similarly for a commercial property governments set laws for how an individual or a company can time the use of that asset vs. their accounting some companies can have totally depreciated zero cost assets that are still very productive    market property values are derived from 3 specific sources value in trade is an estimate of the value that others would be willing to pay for a similar asset that 's why you can buy a house today and in a normal market the same house should be worth a similar amount of money in the future value in use can be more interesting this is where a farmer can extract $ 100,000 in value per year from 10 acres of land but as a region develops a manufacturing company can generate $ 300,000 per year from the same 10 acres of land the company can buy out the farmer at a fair price > $ 100,000 per year and still net positive from the investment   income approach tends to be focused on properties that have a cash flow but can be adapted to other property estimates it evaluates the current business case for any property with the cost of money down the overall investment price and the expected value from any returns   remember the market value is very simply the price you could obtain if you sold the asset at a given time it is rarely considered in terms of how much will this go down   book value is an accounting exercise and declines by a set amount every year because it means you can estimate the cost of owning an asset vs the value it generates in a particular time period

it 's difficult to quantify the intangible benefits so i would recommend that you begin by quantifying the financials and then determine whether the difference between the pay of the two jobs justifies the value of the intangible benefits to you some you are making $ 55,000 per year but your employer is also paying for a number of benefits that do not come free as a contractor   begin by writing down everything they are providing you that you would like to continue to have   this may include you also need to account for the fica tax that you need to pay completely as a part time employee normally a company pays half of it for you   this usually amounts to of your income start by researching the cost for providing each item in the list above to yourself   for health insurance get quotes from providers   for bonuses average your yearly bonuses for your work history with the company   items like stock options you need to make your best guess on calculations now lets call your original salary s.   add up all of the costs of the list items mentioned above and call them b.   this formula will tell you your real current annual compensation now you want to break your part time job into hours per year not hours per month as months have differing numbers of working days   assuming no vacations that is 52 weeks per year multiplied by 20 hours or 1040 hours 780 if working 15 hours per week   so to earn the same at the new job as the old you would need to earn an hourly wage of the full equation for 20 hours per week works out to be assumptions do not take this section as representative of your situation only a ballpark estimate you must do the math yourself   i recommend a little spreadsheet to simplify things and play what if scenarios   however we can ballpark your situation and show how the math works with a few assumptions when i got quoted for health insurance for myself and my partner it was $ 700 per month or $ 8400 per year   if we assume the same for you then add 3 401k matching that we 'll assume you 're taking advantage of $ the equation becomes other considerations keep in mind that there are other considerations that could offset these calculations   variable hours are a big risk as is your status as a temporary employee   though on the flip side you do n't need to pay taxes out of each check allowing you to invest that money throughout the year until taxes are due   also if you are considered a private contractor you can write off many expenses that you can not as a full time employee

the price the provider charges you is the amount he would like to get for his services let 's take an example you do a blood test at a lab and they charge you $ if you have insurance and the provider has a contract with that insurance meaning they take them the contract limits what they can charge and what the will get for the example that might be this is what the insurance pays them or what you pay them if you have deductible note that if you have no insurance you owe them they are typically willing to negotiate that you only pay maybe $ but it still will be much higher than the insurance price why the reason is that the insurance agreed payment of $ does not cover their cost but the insurance forces them to make that contract or basically be out of business let 's say for example they need $ to make a living on it so they lose 5.00 $ on every insured customer one in 235 customers has no insurance and his price is calculated as + 235 5.00 = $ so his bill covers the losses for all insured under payers all numbers are examples made up to illustrate the math the provider does my typically comes between 800 and 1400 and gets reduced to around 20 so the numbers are not completely off the ratio and concept works for doctors and hospitals the same just not as significant a difference

a insured high interest savings bank account is both safe and liquid i.e. you can withdraw your money at any time   at present time you could earn interest of per year if you shop around if you are willing to truly lock in for 2 years minimum rates go up slightly but perhaps not enough to warrant loss of liquidity look at gic rates to get an idea any other investments such as mutual funds stocks index funds etfs etc are generally not consistent with your stated risk objective and time frame better returns are generally only possible if you accept the risk of loss of capital or lock in for longer time periods

i think the key concept here is future value   the nav is essentially a book keeping you add up all the assets and remove all the liabilities   for a public company this is spelled out in the balance sheet and is generally listed at the bottom   i pulled a recent one from cisco systems because i used to work there and know the numbers   and you can see it here roughly $ 56 billion   another way to think about it in theory and we know about this right the nav is what you would get if you liquidated the company instantaneously   a definition i like to use for market cap is the current assets plus the perceived present value of all future earnings for the company so let 's that a little   the term present value is really important because a million dollars today is worth more than a million dollars next year   a company expected to make a lot of money soon will be worth more i.e. a higher market cap than a company expected to make the same amount of money but later   the all future earnings part is exactly what it sounds like   so again following our cisco example the current market cap is billion which means that the market thinks they will earn about $ 85 billion over the life of the company in present day dollars

trading at the start of a session is by far higher than at any other time of the day this is mostly due to markets incorporating news into the prices of stocks in other words there are a lot of factors that can affect a stock 24 hours a day but the market trades for only 6.5 hours a day so a lot of news accumulates during the time when people can not trade on that news then when markets finally open people are able to finally trade on that news and there is a lot of price discovery going on between market participants in the last minutes of trading volumes increase as well this can often be attributed to certain kinds of traders closing out their position before the end of the day for example if you do n't want to take the risk a large price movement at the start of the next day affecting you you would need to completely close your position

context is key here futures do n't really have to do with a time in the future in this context   futures are a capital market futures market just like stocks are a market stock market both capital markets have the ability to affect each other up until 30 years ago there was a separate use for the futures market but in the days since they are mostly used for stock derivatives financial futures are the most widely traded contracts since 1980 hugely the commodity futures that the market was designed for   so there is overlap and one affect the other i 'm not going to go into too much detail here but basically the futures market trades 24 hours a day 6.5 days of the week and the   stock market trades 8 12 hours a day 5 days a week   so when the stock market closes the futures market is still running will react and effect the broad stock market   hope that gets you started in your research

i feel i should respond to you if not only for our yang similarity in names i 'm also in finance or rather a recent grad and i ca n't help but picture you as someone who feels investment banking is the end all career and does n't really enjoy the industry that much in the first place as many people mentioned before attitude goes a long way but i think you need to reassess whether you actually like finance or if you 're in it just for the money in either case the motivation should already be there for you to achieve so what 's stopping you

i suspect is correct and that your bank will cash a check from the us department of the treasury   especially since they 're the same ones who guarantee the u.s. dollar   they may hold the funds until the check clears but i think you 'll have good luck going through your bank   of course fees and exchange rate are a factor    consider browsing the irs and us treasury department websites for suggestions faqs    i suggest you line up a way to cash it and make sure there 's enough left after fees and exchange rate and postage to get the check that the whole process is worth it all before you ask it to be shipped to you    if there 's no way to do it through your bank through a money exchange business those at the airport come to mind or through your government postal bank and the check is enough that you 're willing to go through some trouble then you should look into assigning power of attorney for this purpose   i do n't know if it is possible but it might be worth looking into look for us based banks in your area

@joetaxpayer gave a great response to your first question here are some thoughts on the other two 2 transaction fees for mutual funds are tied to the class of shares you 're buying and will be the same no matter where you buy them a shares have a front end load the fee charged and the lowest expenses and can be liquidated without any fees b shares have no up front load but come with a 4 7 year period where they will charge you a fee to liquidate technically called contingent deferred sales charge and slightly higher management fees after which they often will convert to a shares c shares have the highest management fees and usually a to 18-month period where they will charge a small percentage fee if you liquidate there are lots of other share classes available but they are tied to special accounts such as managed accounts and 401-k plans not all companies offer all share classes c shares are intended for shorter timeframes eg 2 5 years a and b shares work best for longer times use a b share if you 're sure you wo n't need to take the money out until after the fee period ends most fund companies will allow you to exchange funds within the same fund family without charging the edit no load funds do n't charge a fee in or out usually they are a great option if they are available to you most self service brokerages offer them few full service brokerages offer them the advantage of a brokerage versus personal accounts at each fund is the brokerage gives you a single view of things and a single statement and buying and selling is easy and convenient 3 high turnover rates in bond funds depending on how actively the portfolio is managed the fund company may deliver returns as a mix of both interest and capital gains and the management expenses may be high with a lot of churn in the underlying portfolio bond values fall as interest rates rise so at least in the usa be prepared to see the share values of the fund fall in the next few years the biggest risk of a bond fund is that there is no maturity date so there is no point in time that you have an assurance that your original investment will be returned to you

if you do business in a state then you need to register your business in that state   i suspect that you have a misconception of what it means to do business in a state   if you are a shop then you very likely are not doing business in any state except the one state where you work examples of when you are doing business in a state include having an office in the state or having employees in the state   merely selling something to a client in that state is not enough to be doing business in the state each state is different but unless you are doing something that is in some sense close to having an office or an employee in a state then you have nothing to worry about   for example if you regularly travel to a state to do work for a client then it is possible that you could be doing business in that state i have no idea if that would be sufficient in any state   but if you are just working out of your basement running a website then you are only doing business in your own state

oddly enough in the usa there are enough cost and tax savings between buy and hold of a static portfolio and buying into a fund that a few brokerages have sprung up around the concept such as to make it easier for small investors to manage numerous small holdings via fractional shares and no commission window trades a static buy and hold portfolio of stocks can be had for a few dollars per trade   buying into a fund involves various annual and one time fees that are quoted as percentages of the investment   even 1 2 can be a lot especially if it is every year   typically a us mutual fund must send out a 1099 tax form to each investor stating that investors share of the dividends and capital gains for each year the true impact of this is not obvious until you get a tax bill for gains that you did not enjoy which can happen when you buy into a fund late in the year that has realized capital gains   what fund investors sometimes fail to appreciate is that they are taxed both on their own holding period of fund shares and the fund 's capital gains distributions determined by the fund 's holding period of its investments for example if abc tech fund bought google stock several years ago for $ 100/share and sold it for $ in the same year you bought into the abc fund then you will receive a capital gains distribution on your 1099 that will include some dollar amount which is considered your share of that long term profit for tax purposes the amount is not customized for your holding period capital gains are distributed pro rata among all current fund shareholders as of the ex distribution date morningstar tracks this as potential capital gains exposure and so there is a way to check this possibility before investing funds who have unsold losers in their portfolio are also affected by these same rules have been called free rides because those funds if they find some winners will have losers that they can sell simultaneously with the winners to remain tax neutral   see on the lookout for tax traps and free riders morningstar pdf in contrast buying and holding a portfolio does not attract any capital gains taxes until the stocks in the portfolio are sold at a profit   a fund often is actively managed   that is experts will alter the portfolio from time to time or advise the fund to buy or sell particular investments note however that even the experts are required to tell you that past performance is no guarantee of future results

the way i would use it is every trade done by a broker has a client side and a street side   the client side is for their brokerage account and the street side is whoever they traded with say john doe calls me at charles schwab and wants to buy 100 ibm   i look at the market and decide that the best execution is on arca   i trade on arca for the client   then i book a client side trade into his account and a street side trade against arca   if i myself was a dealer in ibm and executed against my inventory the street side would basically be internal booking a trade against my account

well then in that case you should actually integrate a monte carlo return scenario with your equity values   ultimately it 's not going to matter what your is because it 's going to be equal in both cases so you 're really just talking about return differences   again it would be impractical for these two options   maybe just look at cash outlay an amortization table of sorts and that 's how you 'd calculate the breakeven point   you could inflate the cash difference by a small margin perhaps 0.5 to account for something like a cd or an but the big difference is going to be the interest rate with respect to a mortgage vs. a perpetual cash payment of rent that never any real value
# 282987
i think playing certain kinds of lottery is as economically sound as buying certain kinds of insurance   a lottery is an inverted insurance let me elaborate   we buy insurance for at least two reasons the first one is clear we pay a fee to protect ourselves from a risk which we do n't want to or can not bear although on average buying insurance is a loss because we pay all the insurance 's office buildings and employee 's salaries it still is a reasonable thing to do but it should also be clear that it is unreasonable to buy insurance for risks one could easily bear oneself the second reason to buy insurance is that it puts us at ease we do n't have to be afraid of theft or of a mistake we make which would make us liable or of water damage to our house in that sense we buy freedom of for a fee even if the damage would n't in fact ruin us that 's totally legitimate now i want to make the argument that buying a lottery ticket follows the same logic and is therefore not economically unreasonable at all while buying a lottery ticket is on average a loss it provides us with a chance to obtain an amount of money we would normally never get eric made this argument already the lottery fee buys us a small chance of something very valuable much as the insurance frees us from a small risk of something very bad if we do n't buy the ticket we may have 0 chance of becoming extremely rich if we buy one we clearly have a chance > 0 which can be considered an improvement imagine you 'd have a chance to save the life of a loved one with a ticket who 'd be 100 doomed otherwise you 'd bite even the second argument that an insurance puts us at ease can be mirrored for lotteries the chance to win something may provide entertainment in our otherwise dull everyday life considering that playing the lottery only makes sense for the chance to obtain more money than otherwise possible one should avoid lotteries which have lots of smaller prizes because we are not really interested in those it would be more economical to save the money for smaller amounts we ideally only want lotteries which lean on the big money prizes

the previous answers have raised very good points but i believe one facet of this has been neglected while it 's true that the total accessible supply of gold keeps rather slowly as was mentioned earlier the fact remains that gold like oil is a non renewable natural resource so at some point we are going to run out of gold to mine due to this fact i believe gold will always be highly valued of course it can certainly always fluctuate in value in fact i expect in the reasonably near future to see a decline in the price of gold due to investors selling it en masse to re enter the stock market when the economy has recovered more substantially

without knowing your credit situation or your full budget it 's a little difficult but i 'd go with the snowball method for now it may seem like not a big deal to have this kind of debt but you really should be looking at it as if your walking around with your hair on fire   it 's a huge emergency debt especially looming cc debt with high rates can make things worse think water on grease fire really quickly so the faster you get rid of it the better   good luck
# 591636
yes there are a number of reasons for this most notably some form of tax credits transfer over from year to year if you file your taxes and the cra will only pay you deductions if all your taxes have been filed if you do n't owe them anything you wo n't necessarily get in trouble but do n't expect to get any money back from them until you file also while it 's probably much too late for this if you have a partner you can transfer a certain amount of tax deductions to them and save them some money the site is here

although there is no single best answer to your situation several other people have already suggest it in some form always pay off your highest after tax interest loan first that being said you probably also have heard about the differentiation for good debt vs. bad debt good debt is considered a mortgage for buying your primary home or as is the case here debt for education as far as i am concerned those are pretty much the only two types of debt i 'd ever tolerate there may be exceptions for health medical reasons everything else is consumer debt and my personal rule is do n't buy it if you do n't have the money for it meaning do n't take on consumer debt one other thing you may consider before accelerating paying off your student debt the interest paid on it may be tax deductible so you should look at what the true interest is on your student loan after taxes if it is in the very low single digits meaning between 1 3 you may consider using the extra money towards an automatic investment plan into an etf index fund but that would be a question you should discuss with your tax accountant or financial adviser it is also critical in that case that you do n't view the money invested as found money later on unless you have paid off all your debt this part is the most difficult for most people so be very cautious and conscious if you decide to go this route at any rate congratulations on making so much progress paying off your debt keep it going

the big difference for me under the high deductible plan has been that instead of paying the co pay now i am now responsible for the negotiated rate until i reach the deductible limit the hsa is only a way to funnel medical payments through a tax free account the insurance company and the doctor do n't care about the hsa if we go out of network then i am responsible for the full rate but they only count the negotiated rate as a credit against the out of pocket deductible this big difference makes it very important to pick a doctor in network for your example i would have paid $ 50 under the ppo but $ 200 under the high plan if i go out of network i would have to pay whatever the doctor want me to pay but the insurance company would only credit me $ 200 against my deductible i can pull the extra $ 350 from the hsa it is hard to get good pricing information from some doctors but the price difference for me has been so large that in network is the only way to go for prescriptions the high deductible plan has been worse because we pay the full price with no discounts for the medicine until we reach the plan deductible that makes the cost of the prescriptions as much as 10x 's more expensive in fact the annual cost of our prescriptions all but guarantees that we hit the deductible each year

at 5 this means you expect rents to double every 14 years i bought a condo style apartment 28 years ago sold a while back by the way and recently saw the going rate for rents has moved up from $ 525 to $ 750 after all this time the rent has n't increased four fold   if rents appear to be too low compared to the cost of buying the house people tend to prefer to rent on the flip side if the rent can cover a mortgage and then some there 's strong motivation to buy if not by the renters then by investors who seek a high return from renting those houses thereby pushing the price up   the price to rent ratio is n't fixed it depends in part on interest rates consumer sentiment and banks willingness to lend similar to stock 's p e there can be quite a range but too far in either direction is a sign a correction is due

having spent all of 3 minutes reading about this my impression is insurers are going to have to have more money on hand to cover every line of business as independent silos instead of keeping it all pooled together and being able to shift money around as needed between their lines of business   in order to acquire this capital they will take on more debt now as the expectation is interest rates will rise in the future which would increase their cost of debt vs. acquiring the debt now when interest rates are low

first off some companies do something like this   microsoft for example was well known for consistently hitting earnings estimates every quarter nearly never missed them and most of the time did n't exceed by much either   in order to do this and not be prosecuted for accounting fraud you typically have to be a service or good company like microsoft used to be where you can manipulate the amount of product on hand and move costs fairly easily from one quarter to the next   a company like say home depot or caterpillar both of which have tangible goods they 're either or producing has less flexibility there although they will still try to move profits around to match earnings estimates more closely however you have to be consistently doing well to be able to do this   you ca n't manufacture additional total revenue so if you have one down quarter you have to either have moved some revenue into it from the previous quarter or you have to be able to move some into it from the next quarter   that obviously does n't work consistently unless you 're a fast growing company or have an extremely stable base   it 's also hard to do this in a legal seeming fashion technically this sort of manipulation is illegal so decisions have to be justifiable   companies like microsoft that are expanding can also do things to encourage slightly lower expectations   a company in need of a stock price bump issues press releases touting its inventions and products as amazing things that will drive profits through the roof and an aggressive profit forecast just as easy to issue a press release with a conservative forecast meaning the bar will be lower to hit    it 's also not really necessary to manipulate earnings to have a consistently well performing stock   this article for example shows that companies who miss earnings estimates do n't really suffer much when controlling for their actual earnings changes of course in the long run   your price might drop a bit but if your company is otherwise sound it will recover finally companies do sometimes come out with information ahead of earnings that cause expectations to be lowered   for example just lowered its earnings expectations due to various reasons   some companies choose to do this in order to dilute the effect on the market   i 'm not sure if this is ever required but it seems to me that some companies are much quicker to restate earnings expectations than others

a company whose stock is available for sale to the public is called a publicly held or publicly traded company   a public company 's stock is sold on a stock exchange and anyone with money can buy shares through a stock broker this contrasts with a privately held company in which the shares are not traded on a stock exchange in order to invest in a private company you would need to talk directly to the current owners of the company finding out if a company is public or private is fairly easy   one way to check this is to look at the wikipedia page for the company   for example if you take a look at the apple page on the right sidebar you 'll see type public followed by the stock exchange ticker symbol aapl   compare this to the page for mars inc. on that page you 'll see type private and no stock ticker symbol listed another way to tell if you can find a quote for a share price on a financial site such as google finance or yahoo finance you can buy the stock   you wo n't find a stock price for mars inc. anywhere because the stock is not publicly traded

keep in mind that credit takes time to build    your best short term solution is to save enough cash to put enough of a down payment that the lower loan to value ratio outweighs the lack of credit history   if there 's enough equity to ensure that the bank will get their money back if they have to foreclose you will have a better chance of securing financing in addition the stability and consistency of your employment may also be a factor that makes it difficult for you to get a loan without a substantial down payment finally do n't ignore the risk present in resting a property that you have a loan on   make sure you have a plan in place to pay your payments if the other half goes for several months or you risk losing the entire property my advice is to rent somewhere else for enough time that you can save up a lot of cash to purchase a duplex rather than getting in a rush and doing something unwise like apply for a bunch of credit cards you do n't need

if you are going to be a long term investor you are only going to buy and hold you will not sell thus future price is not relevant only dividend payout is relevant divide the dividend by the price you paid to get the yeald   edit   once again the will not allow me to add a comment so i have to edit a previous post   what you call active investor is not really investing it is speculating when you try to buy low sell high you have at best a 50 50 chance of picking the low you then pay a commission on that buy after you buy then you have a 50 50 chance at best of picking the high you also have to pay the commission on the sell 50 times 50 is you have at best a 25 chance of buying low and selling high you are churning your account which makes money for the broker whether you make money or not if instead you buy and hold a dividend paying security then the going price is irrelevant you paid for the security once and do not have to pay for it again meanwhile the dividends roll in forever buy low sell high is a fools game warren buffet does not do it he buys and holds

i would suggest you forget everything you learned in economics the only applicable knowledge is accounting 101   step 1 an accrual basis financial statement there is no step 2 if you do n't do this most small business do everything cash basis simpler cheaper but useless for analysis you would get better answers from the local fortune teller than a cash basis statement    make one change from the general rules if you have debt or are paying interest for inventory include that in your cost of sales this is actually proper but the rule is little known and often ignored interest on debt up to the amount of inventory is a cost of inventory   step 2 gross profit if you seem to be working hard and still losing money it may be because you are selling products for less than they cost you in this case the more you sell the more you lose so suggestions like advertising or doing anything to increase sales are actually destructive   step 3 price products at the level necessary to turn a profit at current sales and overhead when we have enough sales we will make a profit is the philosophy of a start up business it is toxic for a going concern   step 4 if sales are unsustainable at the price that produces a profit have the courage to sell or close the business i have seen people waste their lives on futile endeavors just because they ca n't make that tough decision   finally step 0 ignore all other suggestions but this they are well meaning but ill informed to reiterate growing sales while losing money on every transaction is a huge mistake trends books charts and graphs analytics and market research are the tools of con men and fortune tellers business is arithmetic and nothing more or less   fyi if i do n't get at least one upvote this is the last time i am giving my valuable professional advice away for free on reddit folks will have to rely on the suggestions of their fellow college kids

not unless you have something else to put up as collateral the bank wants a basic assurance that you 're not going to immediately move the money to the caymans and disappear 999 times out of 1000 the collateral for a home mortgage is the home itself which you would n't be able to take with you if you decided to disappear so signing up for a 30 year mortgage on a nonexistent house is probably going to get you laughed out of the bank it 's sometimes possible to negotiate something else as collateral you may for instance have a portfolio of securities worth the loan principal that you can put in escrow for the term of the loan the securities will stay in your name and make you money but if you default on the loan the bank goes to the escrow company and takes the portfolio for their own the bank will consider the risk of value loss on the securities in the portfolio and may ask for a higher collateral value or only allow a lower loan amount in all cases it 's usually a bad idea to go into long term personal debt just to get cheap money that you can use to beat the interest rate with some business plan or investment if you have a business plan take that to the bank with an llc and ask for a business loan the business itself if the plan is sound should become valuable and the terms of business loans take that into account allowing for a shrinking collateral transferring the initial personal risk of the loan to the business

it 's a hard decision to make especially without knowing the complete contract details i would in general stay away from financial advisors like or other pyramid selling companies in german they usually only offer a very limited range of products in most cases they sell only 1 or 2 products and tell everyone that these offers are the best and fit exactly to the client i would prefer an insurance broker requires an education which could in theory offer any product coming to your situation if you already have a product which is maxed out i see no point in another private insurance without any aid the insurance construction allows you to save some taxes but it does cost you a premium i would buy the funds preferable etfs on my own this comes down to the question does the insurance construction payoff for you for the costs it generates

how you answer is actually dependent on when they ask if it is early in the process the question answer is to determine the type of loan you are looking for auto loan home loan home improvement loans education loans all have products that are geared to those uses in many cases they will use the item you are purchasing as collateral for the loan in return for this they will offer you a low interest rate because they know they can protect their money be the collateral   for these standard loans they will ask for more specifics before they give a check for the money because they need to know exactly what you are spending the money on and they will need to file legal paperwork to protect their money if it is n't one of those standard loans then you are looking at a loan that is only backed by your signature that loan could have a high interest rate they are asking as part of the process of assessing their risk unless you are putting a lie on a form i am not sure being puts you in jeopardy   in some cases they do n't care people get lines of credit without knowing exactly what they are going to spend the money on

the banks see small apartments as a higher risk because usually very small apartments are harder to sell especially during a falling market when there is an oversupply of these apartments the price of small apartments will also fall a lot quicker in a falling market regarding yield vs capital growth the emphasis here is on high yielding properties in small country towns with small populations how many properties can you buy with cash properties with good growth will enable you to build equity quicker and enable you to build a larger portfolio in my opinion you need a combination of good yield and reasonable growth because without yield you can not replace your earned income with passive income but without growth you ca n't expand your portfolio so a combination of good yield with reasonable growth will give the best outcome

the values of 12 26 and 9 are the typical industry standard setting used with the macd however other values can be substituted depending on your trading style and goals the ema is considered the long moving average when in this case it is compared to the shorter ema if you used a ema and a ema then the ema would be considered the long ma it is based on what you are comparing it with apart from providing signals for a reversal in trend macd can also be used as an early indication to a possible end to a trend what you look out for is divergence between the price and the macd see chart below of an example   here i have used 3d and 1 for the signal as i did not want the signal to show up i am simply using the macd as a momentum indicator which work by providing higher highs in the macd with higher highs in price this shows that the momentum in the trend is good so the trend should continue however the last high in price is not met with a higher high in the macd the green lines demonstrate bearish divergence between price and the macd which is an indication that the momentum of the trend is slowing down this could provide that the trend may be about to end and to take caution i.e. not a good time to be buying this stock or if you already own it you may want to tighten up your stop loss

long term capital gains are taxed at 15 this year so the most you stand to save is $ 150 i would n't sell anything at a loss just to offset that unless you planned on selling anyways   a few reasons the long term capital gains rate will go up to 20 next year so your losses will be worth more next year than this year short term capital gains rates will go up next year as well so again better off saving your losses for next year you must use capital losses to offset capital gains if you have them but if you do n't have any capital gains you can use capital losses to offset ordinary income up to a limit $ 3,000 a year iirc   so if you just bite the bullet and pay the 15 on your gains this year you could use your losses to offset your likely higher rate ordinary income next year fyi complete chart for capital gains tax rates is here i also posted another answer about capital gains to this question a while back that might be useful

a simple way to ask the question might be to say why ca n't i just use the same trick with my own shares to make money on the way down why is borrowing someone else 's shares necessary to make the concept a viable one why is n't it just the inverse of going long a simple way to think about it is this to make money by trading something you must buy it for less than you sell it for   this applies to stocks like anything else   if you believe the price will go up then you can buy them first and sell them later for a higher price   but if you believe the price will go down the only way to buy low and sell high is to sell first and buy later   if you buy the stock and it goes down any sale you make will lose you money i 'm still not sure i fully understand the point of your example but one thing to note is that in both cases i.e. whether you buy the share back at the end or not you lost money   you say that you made $ 5 on the share price dropping but that is n't true at all you can see in your example that your final account balance is negative in both cases   you paid $ 20 for the shares but only got $ 15 back you lost $ 5 or in the other version of your example paid $ 20 and got back $ 5 plus the depreciated shares if you had bought the shares for $ 20 and sold them for say $ 25 then your account would end up with a positive $ 5 balance that is what a gain would look like   but you ca n't achieve that if you buy the shares for $ 20 and later sell them for less at a guess you seem to be confusing the concept of making a profit with the concept of cutting your losses   it is true that if you buy the shares for $ 20 and sell them for $ 15 you lose only $ 5 whereas if you buy them for $ 20 and sell for $ 10 you lose the larger amount of $ 10   but those are both losses   selling early as the price goes down does n't make you any money it just stops you from losing more money than you would if you sold later

i was hoping to comment on the original question but it looks to me like the asker lives in the eu where credit cards are a lot less common and a lot of the arguments car rental building up of credit etc brought forward by people living in the us just do n't apply   in fact especially airlines and other merchants will charge you extra when using a credit card instead of a debit card and this can add up fairly quickly i hold a credit card purely for travelling outside the eu and occasionally i will travel for work and make my own arrangements then it can come in handy as i am able to reclaim my expenses before i have to pay my credit card bill in this case i will also claim the extra credit card fees from my employer this however is for my personal convenience and not strictly necessary i could fill out a bunch of paperwork and claim the costs from my employer as an advance in the eu i find that if my visa debit card will not work in a shop neither will my credit card so on that note it 's pretty pointless so to answer the asker question if you live and travel in the eu   you do n't need a credit card ever if you travel to the us it would be advantageous to get one occasionally banks will offer you a credit card for free and there 's no harm in taking it apart from the fact that you have one more card to keep track off but if you do set up a direct debit to pay it off automatically   and as other people have said do n't spend money you do n't have if you are not absolutely sure you ca n't do this do n't get a credit card

when you say that you are not sure what amount of money would make a difference in the future it indicates that you have not clearly identified your long term financial goals consider monthly budgeting to be one of the stepping stones to long term financial planning how much you can afford depends not only on your savings and income but also your future expenses if you want to buy a house in 2 years for example you may want to scrimp and save just a little longer to secure a larger down payment if you want to retire early then similarly saving money now should bring you not short term financial wealth but long term security how much you can afford will depend on how your current financial situation matches up with your future goals the rules of thumb you listed ie of income may be good starting places but that does n't mean they are the right answer for you in your current situation

currency like gold and other commodities is n't really much of an investment at all it does n't actually generate any return its value might fluctuate at a different rate than that of the us dollar or euro but that 's about it it might have a place as a very small slice of a basket of global currencies but most us european households do n't actually need that sort of basket it 's really more of a risk management strategy than an investment strategy and it does n't really reflect the risks faced by an ordinary family in the us or europe or similar investments should n't generally be particularly exciting generally exciting opportunities mean that you 're speculating on the market not really investing in it if you have a few thousand dollars you do n't need and do n't mind losing you can make some good money speculating some of the time but you can also just lose it all too maybe there 's a little room for excitement if you find amazing deals on ordinary investments at the very bottom of a stock market crash when decent solid companies are on sale much cheaper than they ordinarily are

respectfully i am of the opinion that you are mixing issues   paying a mortgage off early vs investing is a question that 's been well discussed at money se if you project a higher tax adjusted return on the investments than your current mortgage rate invest else pay the mortgage down   if the rent covers the mortgage you can maintain the investing it does n't matter for this discussion if the rent produces a profit so long as all expenses are covered   renting aside in the us now my mortgage is 3.5 2.6 after taxes so long as i expect a return well above this level long term i 'll stay investing and let the mortgage die its slow death another decade or so   i 'm sorry i can offer a formula it 's less about the same or more the mortgage is fixed right but the market return is unknown

your mortgage terms are locked in the servicer new owner can not   change the terms without your consent but the servicer can be more aggressive in taking action   as specified in your mortgage contract against you for example if the mortgage agreement calls for penalties for missing a payment or making it late your friendly neighborhood banker might waive the penalty if the payment is received a day late once but perhaps not the second or the third time but the servicer does n't know you personally and does not care you are hit with the penalty right   away if the payment was received a day late because of delays in the post office too bad if you used a bank bill payment service that guarantees on time arrival talk to the bank all   perfectly legal and what you agreed to when you signed the contract if you can set up electronic payments of your mortgage payments you can avoid many of these hassles if you are sending in more money than what is due each month you should make sure that the extra money reduces the principal amount owed easy enough if you are sending a physical check with a coupon that has an entry line for extra payment applied to principal on it but the best mortgage contracts from the bank 's point of view are those that say that extra money sent in applies to future monthly installments that is if you send in more than the monthly payment one month you can send in a reduced payment next month the bank will gladly hold the extra amount sent in this month and apply it towards next month 's payment so read your mortgage document i know i know the fine print is incomprehensible to see how extra money is applied finally re financing your mortgage because you do n't like the servicer is a losing proposition unless you can somehow   ensure that your new bank will not sell your new mortgage to the same servicer or someone even worse

these kinds of credit card offers are incredibly common more often you will get a certain reward if you spend $ x within y days of getting the card in many cases you can take advantage of them with very little downside however are you responsible enough to have a credit card and be able to pay off the balance every month if not the interest charges could quickly wipe out the $ 50 bonus you get and hard inquiries and new accounts could potentially affect your credit score particularly if you do n't have a well established credit history there 's also the chance you get denied in which case you add a hard inquiry to your credit report for no gain

in most countries trading platforms are legally required to be overseen by a regulator in the us this is the sec securities and exchanges commission this regulatory oversight is required in order to operate i.e. have clients in that country and the company will lose the right to operate in that country if they do not comply with the regulations if you believe that you have genuine cause to complain that a trading platform that you are using within your jurisdiction is behaving unfairly towards you you can report this to the regulator and they will investigate so long as you can provide them with some concrete evidence note that in many jurisdictions gambling websites are also regulated they are in the uk for example and so arguments about their fairness are specious a big problem with a lot of these complaints is that people who lose money are very vocal about blaming everyone else people who make money are very vocal about their own amazing skills think about that

you 'll be taxed when you sell the house but not before that or if you do some other transaction that realizes the gain talk to your real estate attorney or accountant for more details a home equity line of credit is simply a secured loan it 's a loan conditioned on if you fail to pay it back they have a lien on your house and may be able to force you to sell it to pay the loan back
# 57211
i am not sure how anyone is answering this unless they know what the loan was for   for instance if it is for a house you can put a lien on the house   if it is for the car in most states you can take over ownership of it    point being is that you need to go after the asset    if there is no asset you need to go after you friend   again we need more specifics to determine the best course of action which could range from you suing and wages from your friend to going to small claims court   part of this process is also getting a hold of the lending institution   by letting them know what is going on they may be able to help you they are good at tracking people down for free also the lender may be able to give you options   for example if it is for a car a bank may help you clear this out if you get the car back plus penalty   if a car is not in the red on the loan and it is in good condition the bank turns a profit on the default   if they can recover it for free they will be willing to work with you   i worked in repo when younger and on more than a few occasions we had the cosigner helping   it went down like this co signer gets pissed like you and calls bank bank works out a plan and tells cosigner to default cosigner defaults banks gives cosigner rights to repo vehicle cosigner helps or actually vehicle bank gets car back bank car bank asks cosigner for x amount sometimes nothing but not usually cosigner pays x bank does not hit credit bank releases loan and sells car   i am writing this like it is easy but it really requires that asset is still in good condition that cosigner can get to the asset and that the friend still is around and trusts cosigner   i have seen more than a few promise to deliver and come up short and couple conspiring with the friend    i basically think most of the advice you have gotten so far is crap and you have n't provided enough info to give perfect advice   seeking a lawyer is a joke   going after a fleeing party could eat up 40 50 billable hours   it is n't like you are suing a business or something   the lawyer could cost as much as repaying the loan and most lawyers will act like it is a snap of their fingers until they have you dry just really advice for the most part i would suggest talking to the bank and defaulting but again need 100 of the details    the other part is cosigning the loan   why the hell would you cosign a loan for a friend   most parents wo n't cosign a loan for their own kids   and if you are cosigning a loan you write up a simple contract and make the non payment penalties extremely costly for your friend   i have seen simple contracts that include 30 interests rates that were upheld by courts

they are right to ask for the money back because you were not entitled to that money however you may have a defense called basically you can try to show that because of the government 's unreasonable delay in asking for the money back in the meantime you relied on the assumption that it was your money in good faith and spent it and now to have to come up with the money that you assumed you would n't need would cause great harm to you

so the key factor here imho is the amount we are talking about   $ 2 k is just not a lot of money   if you lose every penny you can recover   on the other hand it is unlikely to make you wealthy   so if i was you i would buy in more for the fun of it all now if it was a large amount of money that we were talking about it would be about a percentage of my net worth   for example lets say the minimum was 20 k and you really believed in the company   if i had a net worth of less than 200 k i would not do it   if i had a larger net worth i would consider it unless i was near retirement so if i was 30 hand a net worth of 300 k i would probably invest as even if i did lose it all i could recover     having said all that it does not sound like you completely agree that the company will be profitable   so in that case do n't buy also i have the opportunity to buy my own company 's stock at a discount   however i do not for two reasons   the first is i do n't like investing in the company i work for   secondly they require you to hold the stock for a year

from the irs perspective there 's no difference between your taxes and your sole proprietorship 's taxes they 're all just your taxes while i could see it being very useful and wise to track your business 's activities separately and use separate bank accounts and the like this is just a convenience to help you in your personal accounting and not something that needs to relate directly to how tax forms are completed or taxes are paid when calculating your taxes if you want to figure out how much you owe vs. how much your business owes you 'll have to do so yourself one approach might be just to take the amount that your schedule c puts as income on your return and multiply by your marginal tax rate another approach might be to have your tax software run the calculations as though you had no business income and see what just your personal taxes would have been without the business if you think of the business income as being first and should use up the lower brackets rather than your personal income maybe do it the other way around and have your software run the calculations as though you had only the business income and no other personal investment income and see what the amount of taxes would be then once you 've figured out a good allocation the actual mechanics of paying some personal tax amount from your personal bank account and some business tax amount from your business bank account are up to you i 'd probably just transfer the money from my business account to my personal account and pay all the taxes from the personal account writing two separate checks one from each account that total to the correct amount i 'm sure would work just fine as well you can probably make separate payments from each account electronically through direct pay or as well as long as all taxes are paid by the deadline i do n't think the irs is too picky about the details of how many payments are made

i researched quite a bit around this topic and it seems that this is indeed false long ter asset growth does not converge to the compound interest rate of expected return while it is true that standard deviations of annualized return decrease over time because the asset value itself changes over time the standard deviations of the total return actually increases       thus it is wrong to say that you can take increased risk because you have a longer time horizon   source

many answers here have given what look to be useful perspectives on your question   i want to point out an interesting technical issue if an employer contracts with an insurer it agrees to cover all employees or all that fill some pre specified definition and no one else and to offer only a limited range of options if you buy insurance directly you obviously have a huge range of choices including the technically illegal one of no insurance at all your first thought is probably hey that 's great more options more chances to pick the plan that 's right for me sorry no   yes you have more options but so does everyone else if you are working for some large company you get insurance period if you suspect you have an expensive health condition you can not buy more insurance if you believe yourself to be healthy as a horse you can not get insurance and pocket the difference   healthy people and sick people are all in the same predictable pool if you buy insurance freely the insurer knows that the you are the more likely you are buy insurance a phenomenon called adverse selection   as a result the premiums fees a person buying his own insurance pays are much higher because most of his fellow policy holders are even if he himself is just risk averse on the other hand if you are risk neutral if you can survive a $ 10,000 bill if it happens to arise you can save big by finding the imaginable insurance where all your fellow policy holders will be and healthy people like yourself

that 's a big possibility but they may also be cutting margins and taking advantage of their supply chain and logistics given that they 're doing this from day 1 it 's got to be either cutting margins or taking a short term loss if they are using their deep pockets to drive out competition they should rightly attract regulatory attention

as soon as you get some actual legal action you hire a lawyer and that $ 23k is gone in a matter of weeks they clearly let have another business to run only a fool would bother chasing this   in terms of what legal trouble we 'll as you must know since you have experience right it 's legal trouble as soon as someone else decides to spend the time and money making it so just because you think there is no issues does n't stop them attempting to sue claim copyright in the suit design for example they will have a lawyer on their side saying sure if course this is illegal let 's go get em if and when that happens you are in a bind because turning up to court with no representation is a non starter so even if you are right you have to expose yourself to the bills to get to that point

if you believe that you are a location for possible power disruptions then you much better be gotten ready for things to take place you can not stop the power interruption to take place in your place however you can find a service so that even with a power disruption experience you can still continue with what you are doing all you require is a commercial backup generator that will provide you with the needed electricity based upon the power that it has kept the generator usually works by transforming power into electrical energy that is why you have the opportunity to continue home activities as the power interruption goes on

as you mentioned in the title what you 're asking about comes down to volatility   dca when purchasing stock is one way of dealing with volatility but it 's only profitable if the financial instrument can be sold higher than your sunk costs   issues to be concerned with let 's suppose you 're buying a stock listed on the nyse called foo this is a completely fake example   over the last six days the average value of this stock was exactly $ 1   over six trading days you put $ 100 per day into this 2 at market close on january 11th you have shares of foo   you paid $ for it so your average cost before fees is $ = $ per share let 's look at this including your trading fees $ + $ 30 = $ 1.01 per share when the market opens on january 12th the quote on foo could be anything   patents customer wins wars politics lawsuits press coverage etc could cause the value of foo to fluctuate   so let 's just roll with the assumption that past performance is consistent selling foo at $ 0.80 nets $ 0.80 $ 5 $ + $ 30 =   $ loss selling foo at $ 1.20 nets $ 1.20 $ 5 $ + $ 30 =   $ profit every day that you keep trading foo those numbers get bigger assuming foo is a constant value   also remember even if foo never changes its average value and volatility your recoverable profits shrink with each transaction because you pay $ 5 in fees for every one speaking from experience it is very easy to paper trade   it is a lot harder when you 're looking at the ticker all day when foo has been $ 0.80 $ 0.90 for the past four days and you 're $ 300 under water on a $ 1000 portfolio   now your mind starts playing nasty games with you if you decide to try this let me give you some free advice unless you have some research such as support resistance information or data on why foo is a good buy at this price let 's be honest you 're gambling with dca not trading end notes

retail is not in crisis in fact it in in a stage   you see the problem sears is facing and wal mart will face is the fact that the digital transformation is proving to be a jobs engine therefore meaning it will not stop   additionally you have the problem of selection wal mart sears kmart all use to work for busy busy americans in a up swinging economy   quick one stop shops that were often much cheaper then their local counter parts   this was achieved by using the same model that is now completely obsolete   that model paired large broad selection spanning multiple departments and categories   this model could never afford to display a full variety of products in any one category so it choose a selection of strong selling brands   it was all mass appeal   today more and more consumers want a bigger selection nicer cutting edge products and knowledge   additionally they want speed and convenience   nothing about this describes a wal mart which are usually located in between residential areas as opposed to strip malls which have into many suburban areas   same with sears   malls scream traffic and time and are usually located far away from main street and my street     want a true prediction   the death of sears is followed by a rapid decline in wal mart as kroger wal mart in reach and scale   grows across the landscape capitalizing on excess retail space   amazon splits into two with grocery pharmacy being a major piece of a new company and they continue to streamline your grocery visit   and last but not least main street   with the big department stores disappearing their competition will fill the void   best part of this scenario is the result in the economic market

right so does n't that mean they would be more inclined to have you trade when you do n't necessarily need to   also would n't trading on a retail be easier and less restrictive ie they may make you use a certain strategy your capital is tied up with them for at least a year you do n't need a 56 7 for me i 'm starting to see the only benefit is their guidance and insight which might not be in the trader 's best interest

not that they 're necessarily lacking although i would n't be surprised if they are relative to the developed world i 'm not going to get into a country by country analysis as there are 40 + in africa and all with different laws but more that the governments institutions like the courts for example there are so corrupt and terrible at what they do that nobody respects them and therefore property rights exist in name only contrast that with the us and canada europe singapore hong kong etc where property rights have a bastion of strong institutions defending them and there is a large part of the difference look at zimbabwe where mugabe literally stole land from the white farmers and how they 're doing versus sa where the government generally respects property rights although the has had some huge issues recently and how relatively well sa is doing    better yet take it a step further out and look at what happened when nationalized the oil industry in it 's no surprise that foreign companies do n't want to invest there and investors do n't want to buy their debt leading to higher interest premiums when the government is literally stealing property from ppl entities via nationalization

before the prevalence of electronic trading trading stocks was very costly dropping from in the late 1970s to less than a nickel per share today   exchange fees for liquidity takers are per share currently when orders were negotiated exclusively by humans stocks used to be quoted in fractions rather than decimal such as $ 50 1/2 instead of something more precise like $ that necessary ease of negotiation for humans to rapidly trade extended to trade size as well   traders preferred to handle orders in round lots 100 shares for ease of calculation of the total cost of the trade so 100 shares at $ 50 1/2 would have a total cost of $   the time for a human to calculate an odd lot of 72 shares at $ would take much longer so would cost more per share and these costs were passed on to the client these issues have been negated by electronic trading and simply no longer exist except for obsolete brokerages   there are cost advantages for extremely large trades well above 100 shares per trade brokerage fees today run the they can be as insignificant as what interactive brokers charges to as high as a full service broker that could charge hundreds of usd for a few thousand usd trade   with full service brokerages the charges are frequently and quoted at the time a trade is requested   with discount brokerages there is usually a fee per trade and a fee per share or contract   interactive brokers will charge a fee per share or option only and will even refund parts of the liquidity rebates exchanges provide as close as possible to having a seat on an exchange   even if a trader does not meet interactive brokers minimum trading requirement the monthly fee is so low that it is possible that a buy and hold investor could benefit from the de minimis trade fees it should be noted that liquidity providing hidden orders are typically not but are at least discounted the core costs of all trades are the exchange fees which are per share or contract   over the long run costs charged by brokers will be in excess of charges by exchanges and interactive brokers fee schedule shows that it can be reduced to a simple markup over exchange fees    exchanges sometimes have a fee schedule with lower charges for larger trades but these are out of reach of the average individual

here 's a good definition of a consumer loan what is a consumer loan b. pointed out there are some states california loves to be the oddball does n't it that treat some loans in a more unconventional manner but the gist of it is that a consumer loan is normally unsecured meaning there 's no collateral or lien associated with it   a signature loan would be a good example of a consumer loan   many times loans made by non banks finance companies that loan for consumer purchases for instance would be considered to be consumer loans i hope this helps good luck

market caps is just the share price multiplied by the number of shares it does n't represent any value if people decide to pay more or less for the shares the market cap goes up or down it does represent what people think the company is worth   nav sounds very much like book value it basically says how much cash would we end up with if we sold everything the company owns paid back all the debt and closed down the business since closing down the business is rarely a good idea this the value of the business enormously take a who owns nothing but a pair of scissors but has a huge number of repeat customers charges $ 200 for a haircut and makes tons of money every year the business has a huge value but nav = price of one pair of used scissors

there are 2 that help make sense of insurance following those 2 rules normal insurance makes sense ca n't afford to replace your car insure it can afford to lose your tv do n't insure it people with a net worth in the low millions have very similar insurance needs to the middle class for example they might be able to afford a new car when they total it but they probably ca n't afford to pay for the long term care of the person they accidentally ran over similarly they probably need to insure their million dollar house just like average people insure more affordable housing   very wealthy people still have the same basic choices but for different assets   if you are a billionaire then you might not bother to insure your $ 30k childhood home or your fleet vehicles but you probably would insure your $ 250 m mansion your $ 100 m yacht and your more pricey collectible cars   it 's also worth noting that very wealthy people are at much higher risk of being sued for negligence or personal injury as such they are more likely to purchase personal liability or umbrella insurance coverage to protect against such risks multi million dollar personal injury suits would never be filed against a poorer person simply because they could n't afford to pay even the plaintiff 's lawyer fees when they lost the court case insurance also makes sense when the insurance company is likely to grossly underestimate the risk they are taking   for example if i am a really bad driver but i have a clean record thanks to my army of lawyers then insurance might actually be a good deal for me even on average to take the very wealthy stereotypes to the extreme perhaps my eccentric billionaire neighbor and i are in an escalating which i think will result in my accidentally running his car into my neighbor 's precious ferrari

just to confirm you do n't pay interest when holding a bond the issuer of the bond pays you interest the idea of calculating present value is as you suggest you discount future payments using an appropriate rate these future payments include both the coupon payments you receive through the life of the bond and the principal repayment at the maturity of the bond each should be discounted from the due date of the payment to today 's date a typical rate to use would be the interest you yourself could earn by investing elsewhere this gives you some idea of how much it would cost to get those payments another way or perhaps some standard rate for example the interbank rates such as libor or

i have won a large amount of money on an online casino how reputed is the company have you done any research around it it has taken 2 months for me to see any payouts last week i received $ 2300 check from them   did you win everything in the same period if so there is no reason why they sent you a smaller check of $ 2300 instead of the full amount this should raise a red flag why would someone write multiple checks the only valid reason is you won in different months the payout for first month was $ 2300 and they sent a check the payout for next month is large amount the request for bank details that they would rather wire me the money and they are asking for my banking account number and routing number although giving bank account number and routing has some risks this is the fundamental information that is need to make a credit to your account directly you would be giving this to quite a few entities people in most countries this information is printed on every check that you write from your account is this safe or am i stupid for even considering this online world is full of traps and this could be a scam so proceed with extreme caution insist of check in worst case open a different savings account that does not allow direct debits does not have over draft etc use this to receive money and move it into your regular account

you need to do the maths exactly the cost of buying a car in cash and using a loan is not the same the dealership will often get paid a significant amount of money if you get a loan through them on the other hand they may have a hold over you if you need their loan no cash and the bank wo n't give you money   one strategy is that while you discuss the price with the dealer you indicate that you are going to get a loan through them and then when you 've got the best price for the car that 's when you tell them it 's cash remember that the car dealer will do what 's best for their finances without any consideration of what 's good for you so you are perfectly in your rights to do the same to them

if it makes you feel any better i now bank with a credit union these wf assholes called me one day to tell me that someone had tried to withdraw $ 500 from my account and that i needed to sign up for a more secure account of course with a $ 16 monthly charge so i did what anybody would do went to the bank and ask questions right after i got there and mention the problem they told me that nothing was wrong with my account that no transactions were attempted and even if they did attempt them and were canceled they would still show up but they did n't few minutes later i got another call from that guy and he was telling me that the problem was taken care of and that i did n't need to go to the bank after that i was just suspicious basically what it came down to was that somebody was trying to set me up for accounts that i did n't ask for just so he can get promoted at my expense they gave me a opportunity to report him but i did n't because i knew him personally he was one of my friends and at the time he had two kids i did n't want him to lose his job i told him that what he did was completely fucked up and that you do n't do that to people outside of wf that same day i withdrew all my money i still remember cutting the conversation short after wf tried to convince me all kinds of ways not to do that i been with a credit union about 3 years now and so far so good

i would make a change to the answer from if you buy a call that 's because you expect that the value of call options will go up so if you still think that options prices will go up then a sell off in the stock may be a good point to buy more calls for cheaper it would be your call at that point no pun intended here is some theory which may help an options trader in a bank would say that the value of a call option can go up for two reasons the vix index is a measure of the levels of implied volatility so you could intuitively say that when you trade options you are taking a view on two components the underlying stock and the level of the vix index importantly as you get closer to the expiry date this second effect diminishes big jumps up in the vix will produce smaller increases in the value of the call option taking this point to its limit at maturity the value of the call option is only dependent on the price of the underlying stock an options trader would say that the vega of a call option decreases as it gets closer to expiry a consequence of this is that if pure options traders are naturally less inclined to buy and hold to expiry because otherwise they would really just be taking a view on the stock price rather than the stock price the implied volatility surface trading options without thinking too much about implied is of course a valid strategy maybe you just use them because you will automatically have a mechanism which limits losses on your positions but i am just trying to give you an impression of the bigger picture

you realize that most of the money raised through the ipo process does n't go into the company 's bank account those shares were shares that were held by the investors and original owners and it 's those prior pre ipo shareholders that got their money back along with a tidy profit   the cash on its books was there before the ipo and after the ipo process was more about a change in stock owners ship than anything else    edit as the sec disclosure mentioned in comments below states the facebook ipo raised $ for facebook 's use the rest of the transaction was from the investors selling their shares mark zuckerberg still owns more than 55 of shares outstanding the $ is still about 10 of the company value nothing to ignore but clearly most of the money from the ipo did n't go to the company

how is the business organized if as a general partnership or llc that reports as a partnership you will be getting distributed to you each year your ownership of the earnings or loss but note this is a paperwork transfer on the form k-1 which must then carryover to your tax return it does not require the transfer of cash to you if organized as an s corp you should be holding shares of the company that you may sell back to the s corp generally as outlined in the original articles of incorporation the annual dividend earnings remaining after all expenses are paid should be distributed to you in proportion to the shares you hold if a c corp and there is only one class of stock that you also hold a percentage of the only profits that must be distributed proportionally to you are declared dividends by the board of directors most family run business are loosely formed with not much attention paid to the details of partnership agreements or articles of incorporation and so do n't handle family ownership disputes very well from my experience trying to find an settlement is the best and least expensive approach to separation from the business but if this ca n't be done or there is a sizable value to the business you may have to get your own legal counsel

your three options are options 2 and 3 are obviously identical other than transaction costs so if you want to keep the stock go for option 1 otherwise go for option 3 since you have the same effect as option 2 with no transaction costs   the loss will likely also offset some of the other short term gains you mentioned

i do n't know where your trade figures are from etrade td ameritrade fidelity etc all have trading costs under 10 usd per share so i 'm not sure where your costs are coming from i doubt currency conversion or anything like that will double the cost as for your question the answer is it depends how much trading will you do in what types of investments for example schwab charges no commission on etf purchases but this is not an advantage if you wo nt buy etfs consider minimums different brokers have different minimum cash balance deposit requirements so make sure you can meet those it 's true that you can get real time quotes anywhere but consider the other services for example td ameritrade pools research reports for many publicly traded companies which are nice to read about what analysts have to say different brokers given different research tools so read about offerings and see what 's most useful to you you can open different brokerage accounts but it 's much more convenient to have a one stop place where you can do all you trading pick a broker which is low cost and offers a variety of investments as well as good customer support and a straightforward system

and the fact that if notes trade up high enough they tend to get taken out with lower yielding notes pending the call schedule so in theory there is more limited upside in high yield whereas equity could theoretically trade to infinity   the positives for high yield is that they generate monthly cash flow via coupon payments and have less down side relative to equities naturally this lower down side comes at the expense of lower up side as well

i have worked for bnp bnp paribas a french bank   from my experience it is the easiest sale to make when working for a bank because saving is sold as a long term investment your client is not likely to close the account any time soon from this product on you could open a broker account if the client wants to take more risks yet another sale if the client is very keen on no risks there are insurance products they make plenty of money from insurance or callable investments that you can propose retail banking works by attracting a maximum number of people and selling them a maximum amount of product   to answer you question is it profitable i am sure it is not right now your savings account costs the bank money because of super low rates in the eu i think it is all about increasing or maintaining market share that you see some banks offering some cash just for opening an account   at the moment we have to sell credit cards to people that is where banks make good money if you would like me to go more in depth on a specific subject i mentioned here just ask hope it helped

the formula you are looking for is pretty complicated it 's given here you might prefer to let somebody else do the grunt work for you this page will calculate the probability for you in your case you 'd enter standard and standard oh you did n't say what you 're paying on your debt let 's say it 's 6 i.e. .06 note that this page will give you the probability that the actual number will be less than or equal to the standard score enter all that and click the magic button and the probability that the investment will produce less than 6 is or 34 the handy rule of thumb is that the probability is about 68 that the actual number will be within 1 standard deviation of the mean 95 that it will be within 2 standard deviations and that it will be within 3 which is n't exactly what you want because you do n't want within but less than but you could get that by just adding half the difference from 100 for each of the above i.e. instead of 68 95 it would be 84 98 99.9 oh i missed that in a follow up comment you say you are paying 4 on a mortgage which you are adjusting to 3 because of tax implications probability based on mean and sd you gave of getting less than 3 is 26 i did n't read the article you cite i assume the standard deviation given is for the rate of return for one year if you stretch that over many years the sd goes down as many factors tend to even out so while the probability that money in a given say mutual fund will grow by less than 3 in one year is fairly high the 25 35 we 're talking here sounds plausible to me the probability that it will grow by an average of less than 3 over a period of 10 or 15 or 20 years is much less further thought there is of course no provably true formula for what makes a reasonable risk suppose i offered you an investment that had a 99 chance of showing a $ 5,000 profit and a 1 chance of a $ loss would you take it i would n't even though the chance of a loss is small if it happened i 'd lose everything i have is it worth that risk for the modest potential profit i 'd say no of course to someone who has a billion dollars this might be a very reasonable risk if it fails oh well that could really cut in to what he can spend on lunch tomorrow

no not deductible but if you work more than one job you run the risk of having too much ss withheld each employer does n't know what the others pays you tax time this   and much thanks to dilip for the following clarification not only does each employer not know what the others pays you but even if you tell him he will not care he is required to withhold social security tax on the wages he pays you and send in an equal amount as his contribution regardless of what anyone else pays you if the sum of your taxable wages from all employers exceed the maximum wages subject to social security the excess withholding is credited towards the income tax due and thus reduces the amount to be paid or increases the refund you are owed but the employer 's excess contribution that he sent in is not returned to him also there is no such things as excess medicare tax having been withheld because there is no maximum wage beyond which medicare tax does not apply

you 're potentially in very deep water here you do n't know who this person is that you 're dealing with   before you 'd even met him he just gave you his banking info seemingly without a second thought    you have no idea what the sources of his money are so what happens if the money is stolen or otherwise illegal   if it is determined that you used any of that money you 'll be on the hook to return it at the very least   who knows what the legal ramifications are either so it sounds like you began spending his money before you had any kind of written agreement in place   does n't that seem odd to you to have someone just so trusting as to not even ask for that was the source of the email about the $ 2500 from paypal or from him or his advisor   paypal always sends you a notice directly when funds are received into your account and even if they were going to put a temporary hold on them for whatever reason sometimes they do that it would still show up in your account i would highly can i be more advise you not to go anywhere near his bank account until or unless you can absolutely verify who he is where his money comes from and what the situation is if you start dipping into his account whether you think you 're somehow entitled to the money or not he could cry foul and have you arrested for theft this is a very odd situation and for someone who says he 's normally cautious and skeptical you sure let your guard down here when you started spending his money without making any serious effort to confirm his bona just because he passes himself off as smart and the doctor type does n't mean squat   the very best scammers can do that ever see the movie catch me if you can based on a true story so you have no basis for knowing he 's anything at all i am thoroughly confused as to why you 'd just willfully start using his money without knowing anything about him   that 's deeply because you 've opened yourself up to a world of potential criminal and civil liability if this situation goes south if this guy was giving you money as an investment in your business and you instead used some of that money for your own personal expenses then you could land in very serious trouble for co mingling of funds   even if he told you it was okay it does n't sound like there 's anything in writing so he could just as easily deny giving you permission to use the money that way and have you charged with embezzlement you need to step back take a deep breath stop using his money and contact a lawyer for advice   every attorney will give you a free consultation and you need to protect yourself here be careful my friend   if this makes you suspicious then you need to listen to that voice in your head and find a way to get out of this situation

pay off the highest interest loan rate first you must be doing something funky with how long your terms are if you give a bit more info about your loan 's such as the term and how much extra you have right now to spend it could be explained in detail why that would be the better choice using your numbers you have to make sure when you are analyzing your different loan options that you make sure you are comparing apples to apples ie make sure that you are either comparing the present value future value or amortization payments   edit using some of your numbers lets say you have 5000 dollars in your pocket you have 3 options excel makes these calculations easier do nothing in 80 months your student loan will be payed in full and you will have owing on your mortgage and 5000 in your no bank interest   for mortgage pay off student loan and allocate student loans amortization to mortgage in 80 months you will have $ owing on mortgage and student loan will be paid in full for mortgage pay 5000 on mortgage in 80 months student loan will be paid in full and you will have $ owing on mortgage for mortgage

now a days your stocks can be seen virtually through a brokerage account back in the days a stock certificate was the only way to authenticate stock ownership you can still request them though from the corporation you have shares in or your brokerage it will have your name corporation name and number of shares you have you have to buy shares of a stock either through a brokerage or the corporation itself most stock brokerages are legit and are fdic or sipc insured but your risks are your own loses the $ 10 you are referring to is the trade commission fee the brokerage charges when you place an order to buy or sell a stock the brokerage will charge you $ 10 so for example if you bought 1 share of a $ 20 stock the total transaction cost will be $ 30 depending on the state you live in you can basically starting trading stocks at either 18 or 21 you can donate gift your shares to virtually anyone when you sell a stock and experience a profit you will be charged a capital gains tax if you buy a stock and sell it for a gain within 1 year you will taxed up to 35 or your tax bracket but if you hold it for more than a year you will taxed only 15 or your tax bracket

that is called substitution of collateral and yes it can be done but only with consent of the lender the best case for this kind of maneuver is if the second house is larger and more valuable than the first another possibility is that you have two mortgages on the first house and none on the second and you want to move the second mortgage on the first house to the second one effectively making it a first mortgage in these instances the lender has a clear incentive to allow a substitution of collateral because the second one is actually better than the first one the potential problem in your case is if the second house were more expensive than the first house you could not use the sale proceeds of the first house as to buy the second house without borrowing additional money in that case a possible solution would be to go back to the lender on your first house for a larger mortgage with the proceeds of that mortgage being used to retire the earlier mortgage depending on your credit payment record etc they might be willing to do this

get a lawyer to put this in contract form with everything spelled out explicitly what is fair is what the two of you agree upon my own suggestion divide the property into things which are yours his and shared then have each of you be responsible for all your costs plus half the shared costs but get all the benefits of your half that would mean that if he rents out his half all the rental income is his if you decide to live in your half all the savings of not paying rent are yours   each of you pays your half of mortgage insurance and other shared costs repairs to shared infrastructure should be done by someone both of you trust if you agree the work is needed and he does it rather than your hiring someone you owe him the appropriate percentage of the costs the two of you will need to agree on whether you owe him for that percentage of his time as well make sure you agree on some mechanism for one person offering to buy the other out or to sell their half to the other party or potentially to someone else entirely personally i would try to do that at opportunity to avoid some of the ways this can go wrong see past comments about the hazards of guaranteeing a loan this works or does n't work similarly does that address your question

your maximum risk is 100 if you buy the stock 15 off and your company goes bankrupt tomorrow you 've lost everything it also sounds like you have foreign exchange risk one can debate how much risk this is in terms of expected outcomes but that was not your question however if you purchase the company stock and buy put options at the same time you can lock in a sale price ahead of time and absolutely limit your risk depending on the amount of stock we 're talking about you can buy currency futures as well to hedge the exchange risk you do n't necessarily have to buy the break even strikes you can buy the ones that guarantee a positive return these are probably fairly cheap   note that a lot of companies have policies that prohibit beneficiaries from shorting the company stocks in which case you might not be able to hedge yourself with put options

in the us and in most other countries dividends are considered income when paid and capital gains losses are considered income loss when realized this is called in accounting recognition we recognize income when cash reaches our pocket for tax purposes so for dividends it is when they 're paid and for gains when you actually sell assuming the price of that fund never changes you have this math do to when you sell of course the capital loss gain may change by the time you actually sell and realize it but assuming the only price change is due to the dividends payout it 's a wash

title insurance protects you from losing rights to your property in case of a court decision let 's look at an example i recently found in local newspapers one old woman sold her apartment to person a. the deed was by a notary public who verified that indeed in was that old woman putting her signature on the deed then person a sold the apartment to person b etc then after several deals some unfortunate buyer bought that apartment the deal looked so he 's got a mortgage to pay for the apartment later it turned out that the old lady died three months before she sold the apartment and the notary public was corrupt old lady 's heirs filed a lawsuit and the deal was void so the ultimate buyer lost all rights to the apartment although he purchased it legally this is the case when title insurance kicks in you need one if there 's a chance for a deal to be deemed void

it 's clearly a risk but is it any different than investing in your own business yes it is different   if you own a business you determine the path of the business   you determine how much risk the business takes   you can put in extra effort to try to make the business work   you can choose to liquidate to preserve your capital    if you invest without ownership perhaps the founder retains a 50 plus one share stake then whomever controls the business controls all those things   so you have all the risks of owning the business in terms of things going wrong without the control to make things go right   this makes investing in someone else 's business inherently riskier    another problem that can occur is that you could find out that the business is fraudulent   or the business can become fraudulent   neither of those are risks if you are the business owner   you wo n't defraud yourself    angel investing that is to say investing in someone else 's startup is inherently risky   this is why it is difficult to find investors even though some startups go on to become wealthy google youtube facebook twitter etc   most startups fail   they offer the possibility of great returns because it 's really hard to determine which ones will fail and which will succeed   otherwise the business would just take out the same loan that jane 's getting and leave jane out of it

as andy t says it is very common for landlords to have a residential mortgage typically capital + interest on their own home and a buy to let mortgage typically interest only on each rental property that they own however before going down this route you will need to do some homework buying and letting a property is covered by a fair amount of legislation and tax rules and in the last couple of years the amount of regulation has increased as has the amount of tax you 're likely to pay letting a property can be profitable but you need to do the maths first and make sure you do everything by the book using a reputable letting agent at least for your first tenant should help avoid common pitfalls there are a number of good websites on this subject note that the rules in england wales scotland and northern ireland are all different so make sure that you get the right information

there is no catch you 've been a good customer and your bank wants to reward you for it one of the ways you build credit is by having more credit available so by increasing your credit limit its lowering your credit utilization rate one of the factors that go into your credit score which is a good thing so your bank trusts you with more credit which again is a good thing you can also request a line of credit increase yourself without waiting for the bank to do so but there 's a 6 month wait between each increase assuming you get one i always ask every 6 months and have gotten approved each time and it 's helped my credit score tremendously

disclaimer i am not an accountant nor a tax pro etc etc yes a canadian corporation can function as a partial income tax shelter   this is possible since a corporation can retain earnings profits indefinitely and corporate income tax rates are generally less than personal income tax rates   details if you own and run your business through a corporation you can choose to take income from your corporation in one of two ways   as salary or as dividends salary constitutes an expense of the corporation i.e. it gets deducted from revenue in calculating corporate taxable income   no corporate income tax is due on money paid out as salary   however personal income taxes and other deductions e.g. cpp would apply to salary at regular rates the same as for a regular employee dividends are paid by the corporation to shareholders out of after tax profits   i.e. the corporation first pays income tax on taxable income for the fiscal year and resulting net income could be used to pay dividends or not at the personal level dividends are taxed less than salary to account for tax the corporation paid   the net effect of corporate + personal tax is about the same as for salary leaving out deductions like cpp the key point dividends do n't have to be paid out in the year the money was earned   the corporation can carry profits forward retained earnings as long as it wants and choose to issue dividends or not in later years given that here 's how would the partial income tax shelter works at some point for you to personally realize income from the corporation you can have the corporation declare a dividend you 'll then have to pay personal income taxes on the income at the dividend rates   but for as long as the money was invested inside the corporation it was subject only to lesser corporate tax rates not higher personal income tax rates   hence the partial aspect of this kind of tax shelter or if you 're lucky enough to find a buyer for your corporation you could qualify for the lifetime capital gains exemption on proceeds up to $ 750,000 when you sell a qualified small business corporation   this is the best exit strategy unfortunately not an easy one where the business has no valuable assets e.g. a client base or intellectual property the major sticking point   you need to have real business revenue   a regular employee of another company ca n't funnel his personally earned employment income into a corporation just to take advantage of this mechanism   sorry

since the deduction balances out the future tax presumably i am    only paying tax on the gains however over 20 years those gains could    be greater than the original $ 4000 itself doubling would only take    3.6 annual return over 20 years if i put it into a roth ira i do n't get a tax deduction but i get to    withdraw the original $ 4000 and all the gains tax free in about 20    years it seems the roth ira is a better deal tax wise but i would like to    hear if i am missing something you are missing the time value of money $ 4000 now does not have the same value to you as $ 4000 years in the future in fact the $ 4000 now has the same value as the money it grows into principal + earnings in the future so a certain percentage of tax on the $ 4000 now has the same effect to you as the same percentage of tax on the $ 4000 + earnings in the future no matter how much earnings is it 's simple math if you start with the same amount of pre tax money and have the same flat percentage tax rate then both traditional and roth will leave you with the same amount of money regardless of how many times the gains are try it for yourself

no in fact you did n't really say anything your initial comment just on the fact he used the total bond market number instead of the muni bond market number from 2007 2008   and were dead on anything else about the article which would lead one to believe that that was all you saw fit to comment on       which is the equivalent to reading a story of a bank robbery and getting hung up on the article reporting the total dollar amount in the bank instead of the total dollar amount in the cash that were robbed from and not talking about anything else        also your initial complaint about what numbers he uses for the bond market is n't a lie   you personally feel that he should only mention the 2007 2008 bond market but if you actually read how he used it he was n't saying anything other than that is the size of the bond market in the context it 's used in the story there 's nothing wrong with the number   he did n't say they were scamming everything in the market it was a one off sentence about the size of the total bond market that in fact is vulnerable to the exact same type of illegal activity he talked about

ending up with nothing is an unlikely situation unless you invest 100 in a company stock and the company goes under in order to give you a good answer we need to see what options your employer gives for 401k investments the best advice would be to take a list of all options that your employer allows and talk with a financial advisor here are a few options that you may or may not have as an option from an employer definitions from wikipedia a target date fund also known as a lifecycle dynamic risk or age based fund is a collective investment scheme usually a mutual fund designed to provide a simple investment solution through a portfolio whose asset allocation mix becomes more conservative as the target date usually retirement approaches an index fund or index tracker is a collective investment scheme usually a mutual fund or exchange traded fund that aims to replicate the movements of an index of a specific financial market an exchange traded fund etf is an investment fund traded on stock exchanges much like an etf holds assets such as stocks commodities or bonds and trades close to its net asset value over the course of the trading day most etfs track an index such as a stock index or bond index etfs may be attractive as investments because of their low costs tax efficiency and stock like features the capital stock or stock of an incorporated business constitutes the equity stake of its owners which one can you lose everything in you can lose everything in stocks by the company going under in index funds the entire market that it follows would have to collapse the chances are slim here since the index made up of several companies the s&p 500 is made up of 500 leading companies publicly traded in the u.s.   a pacific europe index such as msci eafe index is made up of companies the chances of losing everything in an etf are also slim the etf that follows the s&p 500 is made up of 500 companies an pacific europe etf such as msci eafe etf is made up of companies target date funds are also slim to lose everything target date funds are made up of several companies like indexes and etfs and also mix in bonds and other investments depending on your age what would i recommend i would recommend the index funds and/or etfs that have the lowest fee that make up the following strategy for your age why not target date funds or stocks target date funds have high fees later in life when you are closer to retirement you may want to add bonds to your portfolio at that time if this is the only option to add bonds then you can change your elections stocks are too risky for you with your current knowledge if your company matches by buying their stock you may want to consider reallocating that stock at certain points to your index funds or etfs

with the scenario that you laid out ie 5 and 10 loans it makes no sense at all the problem is when you 're in trouble the rates are never 5 or 10 getting behind on credit cards sucks and is really hard to recover from the problem with multiple accounts is that as the banks tack on fees and raise your interest rate to the default rate usually 30 when you give them any excuse late payment over the limit etc the banks will also cut your credit lines as you make payments making it more likely that you will bump over the limit and be back in default status one payment even at a slightly higher rate is preferable when you 're deep in the hole because you can actually pay enough to hit principal if you have assets like a house you 'll get a much better rate as well in a scenario where you 're paying 22 25 interest your minimum payment will be $ 150 200 a month and that is mostly interest and penalty one big loan will usually result in a smaller payment and you do n't end up in a situation where the banks are for position so they get paid first the danger of consolidation is that you 'll stop triggering defaults and keep making your payments so your credit score will improve then the will start circling and offering you more credit cards edit mea   i wrote this based on experiences of close friends whom i 've helped out over the years not realizing how the law changed in 2009   back around 2004 a single late payment would trigger universal default on most cards jacking all rates up to 30 and slashing credit lines resulting in over the limit and other fees credit card banks generally apply payments in order to interest on penalties penalties interest on principal principal in a way that makes it very difficult to pay down principal for people deep in debt they would also offer payment plans to entice you to pay bank b vs. bank a which would trigger fees from bank a. another change is that minimum payments were generally 2 of statement balance which often did n't cover the monthly finance charge the new law changed that resulting in a payment of 1 of balance + accrued interest under the old regime consolidation made it less likely that various circumstances would trigger default and gave the struggling debtor one throat to choke with the new rules there are definitely a smaller number of scenarios where consolidation actually makes sense

you ca n't really avoid inflation as the population grows the amount of money needed will grow as well because the people will grow up and go to work and earn money and someone has to create it to pay them one of the definitions of inflation is increasing amount of money increasing amount of money causes devaluation for example if instead of 1000 dollars we now have 2000 dollars in circulation because the population tripled in the last 50 years while in russia the population remained the same and they have the same 1000 rubles as they had 50 years ago 1 ruble will no longer cost 1 dollar but rather 2 i.e. prices rise this is very simplified of course and there are a lot of causes and triggers for inflation inflation when controlled and within certain limits is necessary for growth as mentioned but when uncontrolled and very high it causes a lot of damage and that 's what troubles people about inflation not its mere existence as to bringing the prices the prices do n't go down the   gallon of gas will not go back to $ 0.25 it 's just the buying power of the money goes down because of inflation you could buy a gallon of gas for 0.25 50 years ago but you had to work for 1/2 hour to earn these 0.25 now you have to pay $ 4 but if you still need to work for 1/2 hour for that then the price did n't rise effectively

if this is a practical rather than hypothetical question the best advice that we could give would be to see a lawyer   if you think your teenager has done something illegal get a lawyer   the lawyer will then take care of notifying the relevant parties and manage the accusations    in most cases it would be sufficient to notify the police directly   they understand the concept of scams and many of them have teenagers of their own   most of the time they will try to work with you rather than against you   but if you are really worried about it this is what lawyers do   a lawyer can separate the teenager and the police so the teenager makes no admissions   but the lawyer can get the necessary information to the police so that neither the teenager nor you is subject to an of justice charge    we can help you by pointing to resources or suggesting ways to document what has happened or is happening   or just point out that something is a scam   but if you are worrying about prosecution we ca n't really help you   you ca n't the relevant details to us   there is no asker answerer confidentiality   everything is published on the internet with archives   without those relevant details how good will our advice be    talk to a lawyer   the lawyer can tell you what you can and can not do   and what you tell the lawyer is privileged   so even if you admit the lawyer ca n't then tell anyone   and if you 're worried that the lawyer might be restricted by what you 've said you can fire the lawyer and hire another    the first thing to do when you find yourself in a hole is stop digging   trying to fix things for your teenager is digging   go to a lawyer and share your concerns   maybe some of them are   from what you 've shared you could go to the police   but perhaps there is more that we do n't know   if so and you are reluctant to share publicly on the internet that 's sensible   go to a lawyer and share in private    if you are indigent and ca n't afford an attorney look into legal aid   they may be in the phone book   if not call the local bar association and ask for a referral for free legal advice for someone low income   try to have a generic description of the problem e.g. you 're worried that someone scammed your teenager into doing something illegal    and just to say this one more time   as you 've described things it seems like you should be able to just go to the police and the bank and describe the scam   i do n't hear anything that they would prosecute   if you 've left something out that changes things then a lawyer is the way to go   then you can disclose everything to get advice

as mr. money money mustache once said if you have credit card debt you should feel like your hair is on    fire student loan debt is different than credit card debt   rather than having spent the money on just about anything it was invested in improving yourself and probably your financial future   this was probably a good decision however unlike most credit card debt if you ever have to file for bankruptcy your student loans will not be erased   they will follow you forever pay your debts off as quickly as you can   while it may be true that long term return on the stock market is about 7 you can not assume that this will always be the case especially in the short term   what if you had made this assumption in 2007 to assume that your stocks will beat a 6.4 guaranteed return over the next few years is not really investing   it 's gambling

it depends on how you place your stop order and the type of stop orders available from your broker if you place a stop market order and the following day the stock opens below your stop your stock will be stopped out at or around the opening price meaning you can potentially end up with quite a large gap if you place a stop limit order say you place your stop at $ 10.00 with a limit price of $ 9.90 and if the price opens below $ 9.90 say at $ 9.50 your limit sell order of $ 9.90 will be placed onto the market but it will not be executed until the price goes back up to $ 9.90 or above the third option is to place a guaranteed stop loss and as specified you are guaranteed your stop price even if the price gaps down below your stop price you will be paying an extra fee for the guaranteed stop loss order and they are usually mainly available with cfd brokers so if you are in the usa you might be out of luck

rather than trying to indirectly game your credit score i would instead shop around and see if there are other lenders that will pre qualify you with your credit the way it is today   bofa and other large banks can be very in how they qualify loans a local bank or credit union may be more willing to bend the traditional rules and pre qualify you    i 'm thinking about using fha if you can put 20 down then a conventional mortgage will likely be cheaper than an fha loan since fha loans have mortgage insurance built in while conventional mortgages typically do n't require it if you borrow less than 80 of the house 's value   i would shop around before jumping to an fha loan

while one credit provider or credit reference agency might score you in one way others may score you differently including treating different things that contribute to your score differently different credit providers may also not see all of your credit score as potentially some data may not be available to all credit suppliers further too many searches may trigger systems that recognise behavior that is a sign of possible fraudulent activity such as applying for many items of credit in a short space of time whether this would directly affect a score or trigger manual checks is also likely to vary in situations like this a person could have applied for say a dozen credit cards with all the credit checks being performed before there is any credit history for any of those dozen cards

in short thanks to the answers and comments posted so far   no actual money is magically disappeared when the stock price goes down but the value is lost the value changes of a stock is similar to the value changes of a house the following is the long answer i came up with based on the previous answers and comments alone with my own any experts who find any of the following is 200 out of place and wrong feel free to edit it or make comments everything below only applies if the following are true the stock price is only decreasing since the ipo because the company has been spending the money but not making profits after the ipo the devaluation of the stock is not the result of any bad news related to the company but a direct translation of the money the company has lost by spending on whatever the company is doing the actual money do n’t just disappear into the thin air when the stock price goes down all the money involved in trading this stock has already distributed to the sellers of this stock before the price went down   there is no actual money that is literally disappeared it was shifted from one hand to another but again this already happened before the price went down    for example i bought some stocks for $ 100 then the price went down to $ 80 the $ 100 has already shifted from my hand to the seller before the price went down i got the stock with less value but the actual money $ 100 did not just go down to $ 80 it ’s in the hand of the seller who sold the stock to me   now if i sell the stock to the same seller who sold the stock to me then i lost $ 20 where did the $ 20 go it went to the seller who sold the stock to me and then bought it back at a lower price the seller ended up with the same amount of the stocks and the $ 20 from me did the seller made $ 20 yes but did the seller ’s total assets increased no it ’s still $ 100 $ 80 from the stocks and $ 20 in cash did anyone made an extra $ 20 no although i did lost $ 20 but the total cash involved is still there i have the $ 80 the seller who sold the stock to me and then bought it back has the $ 20 the total cash value is still $ 100 directly i did lost $ 20 to the guy who sold me the stock when the stock has higher value and then bought it back at a lower price but that guy did not increased his total assets by $ 20 the value of the stock is decreased the total money $ 100 did not disappear it ended up from one person holding it to 2 people holding it i lost $ 20 and nobody gained $ 20 how is that possible assume the company of the stock never made any profit since it ’s ipo the company just keeps spending the money to really track down where the $ 20 i lost is going it is the company has indirectly spent that money so who got that $ 20 i lost it could be the company spent $ 20 for a birthday cake the $ 20 went to the cake maker the company never did anything to make that $ 20 back so that $ 20 is lost again assume the stock price only goes down after   its ipo then buying this stock is similar to the buying a sport car example from joetaxpayer in one of the answers and buying an apple example from one of the comments from joetaxpayer ’s answer   go back to the question does the money disappears into the thin air when the value of the stock goes down no the money did not disappear it switched hands it went from the buyer of the stock to the company and the company has spent that money then what happens when the stock price goes down because bad news about the company i believe the actual money still did not just disappear if the bad news turn out to be true that the company had indeed lost this much money the money did not disappear it ’s been spent lost by the company if the bad news turn out to be false the stock price will eventually go up again the money is still in the hand of the company as a summary the money itself did not disappear no matter what happens it just went from one wallet to another wallet in many different ways through the things people created that has a value

my recommendation is to not ask for a credit increase but just increase the utilization of one card if you have multiple cards and decrease the utilization of the others and continue paying off all cards in full each month   in a   few months you   will likely be offered a credit increase by the card that is getting increased use   the card company that is getting the extra business knows that you are paying off big bills each month and keeping your account in good standing and they will likely offer you a credit increase all by themselves because they want to keep your business   if no offer is forthcoming you can call the card company and ask for a credit increase if they refuse tell them that you will be charging very little on the card in the future   or even canceling your card though that will cause a hit on your credit score because of their refusal and switch your high volume to a different card

i would say it actually applies to more readily to things like eating dinner than moral acts the rationalization part need not be a justification it may simply be the narrative your mind creates to give the illusion of agency to the actions you perform   what i was getting at originally though is that most people rationalize emotional decisions after the fact the mark of a higher moral being is one whose rational morals are informed by but ultimately its   emotional instincts    your counterexample of deserved is telling there are two distinct lines of thought in justice punitive and preventative punitive focuses on retribution while preventative focuses on isolation or elimination of an individual from a situation where it can do further harm    i think most punitive measures are at heart an emotional response to a situation or an entity while preventative usually is informed by emotion but ultimately rational this is another division in the potential reasons why someone might cheat a large organization on the emotional side one might live in a dramatically unequal society in which such organizations often blatantly act in a manner which is contrary to all social conditioning we receive from a very young age despite this they thrive this observation might lead to resentment and a sensation that such organizations deserve to be punished for their deeds and a persons deeds might be justified because of this at least in their heads   alternatively one might think that the continued existence of such organizations and the systems which make them successful is a force for human misery and therefore work to lessen their impact and/or ultimately destroy them    i think it is interesting that most people would find the punitive motive for behavior to be childish destructive and immoral in these terms despite this they will happily apply it to individual humans who it is and frustrating to me that people in moments of anger and grief when these observations are most important will not see this even when it is presented to them plainly i chalk it up to the dominance of emotion over reason

i think the closest you can come is to buy health insurance which had the company 's bet on trends in healthcare costs already built into it but as you 've posed the question i agree that the answer is no at best you might find someone willing to give you short odds that the rate increases over 20 or long odds that it does n't go up at all or something of that sort and that is n't a bet the markets are designed to handle

can you get a cashier 's check from your bank made out in the charity 's name and mail it to the charity from what i recall of the last few times i 've gotten a cashier 's check from the bank it did n't have anything on it that identified me a determined person could probably trace it back to you but you 're not really looking for strong anonymity another possibility would be a postal money order but i 'm not sure whether you can leave the from section blank the money order would have a fee but the cashier 's check should be free it is at both my local bank and my cu

paying off the debt is low risk low reward   you 're effectively guaranteed a 4 return   if you buy a mutual fund you 're going to have to take some risk to have a decent chance of getting better than 4 and change return in the long run which probably means a fund that invests primarily in stocks   buying a stock mutual fund is high risk high reward especially when you 're in significant debt   on the other hand 4 and change is very low interest   if you wanted to buy stocks on margin financing stock investments directly with debt you 'd pay a heck of a lot more   bottom line   it comes down to your personal risk tolerance

i assume the op is the us and that he is like most people a cash basis tax payer and not an accrual basis tax payer suppose the value of the rental of the unit the op is occupying   was reported   as income on the op 's 2010 and 2011 w-2 forms but the corresponding income   tax was not withheld   if the op correctly these income numbers onto his tax returns correctly computed the tax on the income reported on his 2010 and 2011 1040 forms and paid the amount due in timely fashion   then there is no tax or penalty due for 2010 and 2011 nor is the company entitled to withhold tax on this income for 2010 and 2011 at this time the tax on that income has already been paid by the op directly to the irs and the company has nothing to do with the matter anymore suppose the value of the rental of the unit the op is occupying   was not reported as income on the op 's 2010 and 2011 w-2 forms   if the op correctly these income numbers onto his tax returns correctly computed the tax on the income reported on his 2010 and 2011 1040 forms and paid the amount due in timely fashion   then there is no tax or penalty due for 2010 and 2011 should the op have declared the value of the rental of the unit as additional income from his employer that was not reported on the w-2 form and paid taxes   on that money possibly but it would be reasonable to argue that the op did nothing wrong other than not checking his w-2 form carefully he simply assumed the income numbers included the value of the rental and copied whatever the company issued w-2 form said onto his 1040 form at least as   of now there is no reason for the irs to question his 2010 and 2011 returns because the numbers reported to the irs on copy a of the w-2 forms match the numbers reported by the op on his tax returns     my guess is that the company discovered that it had not actually declared the value of the rental payments on the op 's w-2 forms for 2010 and 2011 and now wants to include this amount as income on subsequent w-2 forms now reporting a lump sum benefit of $ 38 k but no actual cash   would have caused a huge amount of income tax to need to be withheld and the op 's next couple of paychecks might well have had zero take home pay as all the money was going towards this tax withholding instead the company is saying that it will report the $ 38 k as income in 78 equal installments weekly paychecks over 18 months   and withhold $ 150 as the tax due on each installment if it does not already do so it will likely also include the value of the current rent as a benefit and withhold tax on that too so the op 's take home pay will reduce by $ 150 at least and maybe more if the current rental payments also start appearing on the paychecks and tax is withheld from them too i will not express an opinion on the legality of the company withholding an additional $ 150 as tax from the op 's paycheck but will suggest that the solution proposed by the company have the money appear as taxable benefits over a period have tax withheld and declare the income on your   2012 2013 and 2014 returns is far more beneficial to the op than the company declaring to the irs that it made a   mistake on the 2010 and 2011 w-2 's issued to the op and that the actual income paid was higher not only will the op have to file amended returns for 2010 and 2011 but the company will need to amend its tax returns too in summary the op needs to know that he will have to pay taxes on the value of the waived rental payments    for 2010 and 2011 the company 's mistake in not declaring this as income to the op    for 2010 and 2011 does not absolve him of the responsibility    for paying the taxes what the company is proposing is a very reasonable solution to the    problem of recovering from the mistake the alternative as points out is to amend    your 2010 and 2011 federal and state tax returns to declare the    value of the rental during those years as additional income    and pay taxes and possibly penalties on the additional    amount due this takes the company completely out of the picture    but does require a lot more work and a lot more cash now rather    than in the future
