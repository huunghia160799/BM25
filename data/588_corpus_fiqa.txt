0 bonds are desirable for some individuals it depends on your situation 0 bonds are usually sold well below par value eg a 100 $ face value bond for 2020 might sell for 90 $ today hence your gains will be capital gains a similar investment paying interest would be taxed as income and smaller portion of capital gains in many countries us canada capital gains are taxed at a more favourable rate then income this is especially true when holding these investments in corporations

no there is n't there are a number of reasons that institutions buy these bonds but as an individual you 're likely better off in a low yield cash account by contrast there would be a reason to hold a low yield non zero bond rather than an alternative low yield product

some investment trusts have zero dividend preference shares which deliver all their gains as capital gains rather than income even if the trust was investing in income yielding stocks they 've rather gone out of fashion after a scandal some years ago   good 2014 article on them here includes the quote   because profits from zero dividend preference shares are taxed as    capital gains they can be used tax efficiently if you are smart about    how you use your annual capital gains tax allowance

gt;we also have the highest expenditures as a percent of gdp than any other nation needless to say we spend a lot on health care also   that is in large part do to insane healthcare costs passed on to the consumers by the aca healthcare spending has increased on average 1.5 annually since 2009 where as the highest growth in spending from 1991 until 2006 was 1.3 i m willing to admit my research may be incomplete or inaccurate here as the available are pretty limited in my short time researching    gt;we do have arguably the best health care services in the world that is mostly only true if you are very wealthy   that s a dumb statement leftists make there is no excuse to not put yourself in debt for the best healthcare possible idk about you but i 'd rather be in a lot of debt getting first rate healthcare than get affordable care from a 2nd rate community college doctor did you also know that medical debt does nt effect your credit score so even if you default on medical debts it does nt effect any part of your life so why would nt you go in debt and then slowly pay off that debt with no fear of negative repercussions for not paying   gt;when you break it down on results per dollar spent the us does n't even break the top 20 when you break it down on infant mortality and life expectancy we have been on a backward slide for a while now although those rates improved for the short while that the aca has been in effect as have the net increase in costs at the end of the day the cost of health care has grown 3x faster than inflation and 20x faster than the average income for over 30 years now so no health care in this country is not the best to the average person   i do nt have health insurance and an er visit with costs me less out of pocket than 90 of the country why is that do you think it has to do with the fact that with the aca hospitals know they are getting paid with 0 questioning on pricing so charge whatever they want and with me they think shit this guy might not ever pay us lets just give him a decent price and get some money from him because all we can do is send his bill to collections you clearly do nt know how the system works especially because you think its my responsibility to provide you with health insurance you keep saying i need to travel and experience the world when all you need to do is go to google and look at what a wonderful job switzerland does with their healthcare the swiss do everything better they have some of the best services in the world and a very affordable healthcare plan with many options that is affordable to the tax payers unlike the aca you have a very clear bias as i m assuming you 're a bernie supporter who loves democratic socialism despite all of its short   gt;and yes space x has been able to estimate a savings of $ 300 m less commercial does a great job of expanding on the research and knowledge that has come from government sponsored r&amp;d. you see that in every modern technological advancement from the internet cellular phones gps medical procedures etc there are so many modern inventions that have sprung from government patents and government research programs   this is the dumbest statement you ve made this entire time the notion that inventions that were made on the governments dime my dime is somehow the product of the government is asinine at best you re operating under the assumption that these inventions would nt have been made without government funding which is false they all would have been made on a smaller budget granted maybe a little bit further down the road but not by much considering technology has expanded with no help from any government more in the last 20 years than in the prior 200 because that s what technology does it makes life easier for everyone and almost itself take apple for instance where is all the government funding they recieved to be one of the most innovative companies in human history or microsoft can max 10 things government funding invented when i can walk into your house and point out 10000 things the government had no hand in at all

first you should maintain a monthly expense and find out the burn rate there would be certain expenses that are annual but mandatory school fees insurance premium property taxes etc so the ideal emergency fund depending on your industry should be 3 month to 6 months plus your mandatory yearly payments more so if they come together for example most of my annual payments come out in may and i bank on the bonus payout in april to cater to this spike in expense so if i were to lose a job in march my emergency funds would be sufficient for routine expenses if i do n't provision for additional funds second you need to also figure out the reduced rate of monthly burn and ideally the emergency funds should be for 3 months of normal burn and 6 months of reduced burn

the cobra idea is interesting but i am not sure it will be cheaper than obamacare health insurance is just insanely expensive best for him to ask hr before   the good news is that in two years he should be eligible for medicare which should be a better option so as dave said go with obamacare or cobra depending on cost and other factors doctors in network etc and wait for medicare to kick in also given that his income is going to go very low really soon he will be eligible for obamacare low income subsidies which will reduce the bill even further further if you get a silver or bronze obamacare plan you can stash away $ 3,300 in a health savings account hsa tax free which should further help with expenses i am sorry your dad is having to leave his job of 30 + years because of some new jerk however i hope that the advice you get here will help you find good options for your dad

gt if the buyside was showing demand what 's wrong with hft for reacting with supply   in my example hft is n't actually adding supply liquidity   they 're just grabbing it and flipping it   gt the example you gave is akin to me going from car dealership to car dealership yelling loudly about what car i want and the price i 'd like it at would you be upset if someone heard you and decided to sell their car to you later down the line    not the same   the equivalent would be me yelling about wanting to buy a porsche 911 and you buying them all before i can finish my own purchase then offering to resell them to me at a higher price   gt;in this case the buy side trader is being stupid    maybe certainly if all this could be eliminated by avoiding market orders   this is a major critique many people have with brad k. instead of serially going from exchange to exchange he could have sent orders to all exchanges at the same time parallel and likely received much better prices    he did do this at his time at rbc sent orders to all exchanges at once   the result would be apparently liquidity asks at the market disappearing and his orders getting filled at higher prices   gt;in my opinion the hft player here is simply facilitating price discovery by reacting to demand as a market maker that 's his job   i think that 's a of what these particular hfts are doing   's a good article let me know what you think   interesting   it certainly goes against a lot of what lewis wrote   and i suppose that 's the problem very few of us are actually qualified to say what is actually true   i know little about market structure and as i said have no involvement in high liquidity stocks   the fund managers next door to me also trade pretty illiquid stuff that i strongly doubt any hft ever touches and they 're value investors anyway not arb hfs or something

i do n't know why there is so much confusion on such a simple concept the answer is very simple a stock must eventually pay dividends or the whole stock market is just a cheap ponzi scheme a company may temporarily decided to reinvest profits into r&d company expansion etc but obviously if they promised to never pay dividends then you can never participate in the profits of the company and there is simply no intrinsic value to the stock for all of you saying yeah but the stock price will go up please people get a life the only reason the price goes up is in anticipation of dividend yield otherwise why would the price go up   but the company is worth more and the stock is worth more a stocks value is not set by the company but by people who buy and sell in the open market   to think a stock 's price can go up even if the company refuses to pay dividends is analogous to person a says hey buy these paper clips for $ 10 but those paper clips are n't worth that it does n't matter because some fool down the line will pay $ 15 but why would they pay that because some fool after him will pay $ 20 ha ha

our mortgage has been sold to a secondary market player there are multiple ways in which the deal is struck at times the risk of default is with original fi with recourse at times it is with secondary fi without recourse the rate can be discounted so the original fi collects the emi as per 3.75 and pays to the secondary fi at 3.25 or it can also be one time fixed amount how could this possibly be financially beneficial for the original loan holder as indicated there are multiple ways the original fi makes money either one time or over the period depending on how the deal is struck are they truly making enough money from the mortgage fees and first payment 's interest to to warrant their need to clear up their credit line for new mortgages    are mortgages always sold for less than the remaining principal no broadly speaking the mortgage fees cover the cost for initiating the loan there may be a very small amount banks may make this is incidental the actual money is made in the interest that is collected every month if a bank as say 5 loans for 100 k each it is very reputed brand and 10 people need 100 k loans then it makes sense for the first fi to give loan to 5 people for 100 k each and sell this at profit to secondary fi take the 100 k 5 and give it off to new 5 people effectively making more money on the original 500 k the bank had

i 'm not aware that any us bank has any way to access your credit rating in france especially as you basically do n't have one in the us banks are not the only way to get finance for a home   in many regions there are plenty of owner financed or owner will carry homes   for these the previous owner will provide a private mortgage for the balance if you have a large downpayment   no strict lending rules no fancy credit scoring systems just a large enough downpayment so they know they 'll get their money back if they have to foreclose   for the seller it 's a way to shift a house that is hard to sell plus get a regular income often this mortgage is for only 3 10 years but that gives you the time to establish more credit and then refinance   maybe the interest rate is a little higher also but again it 's just until you can refinance to something better or sell other assets then pay the loan off quick for new homes the builders developers may offer similar finance for both owner will carry and developer finance a large deposit will trump any credit rating concerns   there is usually a simplified foreclosure process so they 're not really taking much of a risk so can afford to be flexible make sure the owner mortgage is via a title company trust company or escrow company so that there 's a third party involved to ensure each party lives up to their obligations

it is true as noted that you generally do not know when stock that you 're holding has been loaned by your broker to someone for a short sale that you generally consent to that when you sign up somewhere in the small print and that the person who borrows has to make repay and dividends the broker is on the hook to make sure that your stock is available for you to sell when you want so there 's limited risk there there are some risks to having your stock loaned though   the main one is that you do n't actually get the dividend   formally you get a substitute payment in lieu of dividends   the payment in lieu will be taxed differently   whereas qualified dividends get reported on form 1099-div and get special tax treatment substitute payments get reported on form 1099-misc box 8 is just for this purpose   substitute payments get taxed as regular income not at the preferred rate for dividends the broker may or may not give you additional money beyond the dividend to compensate you for the extra tax whether or not this tax difference matters depends on how much you 're getting in dividends your tax bracket and to some extent your general perspective if you want to vote your shares and exercise your ownership rights then there are also some risks   the company only issues for the number of shares issued by them   on the broker 's books however the short sale may result in more long positions than there are total shares of stock financially the extra longs are offset by shorts but for voting this does not balance i 'm unclear how this is resolved i 've read that the the brokers essentially depend on shareholder apathy but i 'd guess there 's more to it than that if you want to prevent your broker from loaning out your shares you have some options

michael pryor is 100 correct here this is almost certainly a scam if you want confirmation look at the feedback of the buyers and of folks who buy stuff from them you 'll typically find that they run through a bunch of low value auctions build up some feedback then all of the sudden buy and sell lots of laptops or other high value items it 's a big scam that has been going on for a decade or more if you are actually trying to sell things like computers overseas particularly to third world countries the sign of a legitimate buyer is usually someone who will have you ship to an import export company who handles the customs stuff and the bureaucratic nonsense required to deal with government on the other side i had a bunch of sun equipment in the late 90 's that was purchased by folks in latin america via ebay they bought from ebay because the local resellers had a monopoly on the products or could n't get sufficient quantities all of them used companies mostly in miami which handled the actual export at the customer 's expense

to expand on the comment made by you 're looking to take a short position   a short position essentially functions as follows   here 's the rub you have unlimited loss potential   maybe you borrow a share and sell it at $ 10   maybe in a month you still have n't closed the position and now the share is trading at $ 1,000   the share lender comes calling for their share and you have to close the position at $ 1,000 for a loss of $ 990   now what if it was $ 1,000,000 per share etc to avoid this unlimited loss risk you can instead buy a put option contract   in this situation you buy a contract that will expire at some point in the future for the right to sell a share of stock for $ x.   you get to put that share on to someone else if the underlying stock price were to instead rise above the put 's exercise price the put will expire worthless but your loss is limited to the premium paid to acquire the put option contract there are all sorts of advanced options trades sometimes including taking a short or long position in a security   it 's generally not advisable to undertake these sorts of trades until you 're very comfortable with the mechanics of the contracts   it 's definitely not advisable to take an unhedged short position either by borrowing someone else 's to sell or selling an option when you sell the option you take the risk because of the unlimited loss potential described above

ultimately you are the one that is responsible for your tax filings and your payments it 's all linked to your ssn after all if this fee interest is the result of a filing error and you went through a preparing company which assumes liability for their own errors then you should speak to them they will likely correct this and pay the fees   on the other hand if this is the result of not making quarterly payments then you are responsible for it source comptroller of maryland site if you do not have maryland income taxes withheld by an employer you can make quarterly estimated tax payments as part of a pay as you go plan if your employer does withhold maryland taxes from your pay you may still be required to make quarterly estimated income tax payments if you develop a tax liability that exceeds the amount withheld by your employer by more than $ 500 from this watered down public facing resource it seems like you 'll get hit with fees for not making quarterly payments if your tax liability exceeds $ 500 beyond what is withheld currently $ 0

friend there is a difference between following the letter of the law vs the spirit of the law   because something is legal does n't make it the ethical choice   if i 'm walking behind someone and they happen to drop a $ 100 bill without noticing i can certainly pick it up and put it in my pocket legally but its hardly the moral thing to do     taken to the extreme if it was legal to buy and sell slaves i still would n't do it even if it provided a monetary benefit   or if i drove by a person dying and bleeding on the street it would be legal for me to drive home and do nothing i think not so sure as i write it   while i agree with you that tax laws are at fault its reprehensible to me that corporations making huge profits using the infrastructure of the region choose tax avoidance as opposed to doing what is not only right but better in the long run for all parties   keep in mind that these favorable tax laws were lobbied by corporations with the intent to avoid taxes in mind   i fully respect your perspective and you 're entitled to make choices based on whether they are legal or not but i choose to live life differently   best of luck

credit cards have three important advantages none of them are for day to day borrowing of money safety credit cards have better fraud protection than checks or cash and better than most debit check cards if you buy something with a credit card you also get the issuer 's think visa assurances that your will get the product you paid for or your money back at almost any time if a product you buy is not what you expect you can work with the issuer even if the store says screw you security credit cards are almost universally accepted as a security against damages to the vendor hotels car rentals boat rentals etc will accept a credit card as a means of securing their interests without that you may have to make huge deposits or not be able to rent at all for example in my area you can not rent a car on debit or cash you must use a credit card around here most hotel rooms require a credit card as well this is different from area to area but credit cards are nearly universally accepted emergencies if you 're using your credit card properly then you have some extra padding when stuff goes wrong for example it may be cheaper to place a bill on a credit card for a couple months while you recover from a car accident than to deplete your bank account and have to pay fees bonus some cards have perks like miles points or cash back some can be very beneficial you need to be careful about the rules with these bonuses for example some cards only give you points if you carry a balance some only give miles if you shop at certain stores but if you have a good one these can be pretty fantastic a 3 cash back on purchases can make a large difference over time

does the 5 year rule apply on the after tax 401k > roth 401k > roth    ira conversion of the 20000 including 10000 earnings that was    originally pre tax no the after tax amounts are not subject to the 5 years rule the earnings are how does this affect roth ira withdrawal ordering rules with respect    to the taxable portion of a single conversion being withdrawn before    the non taxable portion taxable portion first until exhausted to better understand how it works you need to understand the rationale behind the 5-year rule consider you have $ 100 k in your ira traditional and you want to take it out just withdrawing it would trigger a 10 k statutory penalty on top of the taxes due but you can use the backdoor roth ira right so convert the 100 k and then it becomes after tax contribution to roth ira and can be withdrawn with no penalty one form filled ad 10 k saved to block this loophole here comes the 5 years rule you can not withdraw after tax amounts for at least 5 years without penalty if the source was taxable conversion thus in order to avoid the 10 k penalty in the above situation you have a 5-year cooling period which makes the loophole useless for most cases however amounts that are after tax can be withdrawn without penalty already even from the traditional ira so there 's no need in the 5 years cooling period the withdrawal attribution is in this order roth ira rollovers are sourced to the origin e.g. if you converted $ 100 to the roth ira at firm x and then a year later rolled it over to firm y it does n't affect anything and the clock is ticking from the original date of the conversion at firm x. 5-year period applies to each conversion rollover from a qualified retirement plan see here distributions are applied to the conversions in fifo order so in one distribution depending on the amounts you may hit several different incoming conversions the 5 years should be check on each of them and the penalty applied on the amounts attributable to those that do n't have enough time 5-year period for contributions applies starting from the beginning of the first year of the first contribution that established your roth ira plan the penalty applies to the amounts that were included in your gross income when conversion occurred i.e. does n't apply on the amounts converted from after tax sources note the difference from the traditional ira distributions from pre tax sources are prorated between the non deductible basis amounts and the deductible earnings amounts taxable that is why the taxable amounts are first in the ordering of the distributions

while i certainly agree with the principle of paying down debt there is some value in having a healthy cash cushion   if an emergency expense were to come up and your credit has been cut off or reduced to the point where you have no excess credit then having real cash on hand is critical i would perform the following thought experiment   what if my available credit had been cut off   how much would i need in cash to survive for 1 month 3 months 5 months etc   consider what time period you 'd be comfortable with and set that amount as your minimum desired cash on hand while it may seem extreme to not have access to credit at all during the credit crisis many banks and lenders tightened their lending reducing credit limits closing lines of credit calling loans raising rates etc suze orman recommends cash savings equivalent to 8 months living expenses that does n't mean 8 months salary but 8 months of what it would take to live on   at one point in the midst of the economic crisis i thought that made sense the simple dollar blog considers suze 's recommendation and the idea of emergency fund vs. debt repayment   worth reading is suze right do emergency funds now trump debt repayment

every economy wants growth and for growth to come you need investments so you must provide some motive for people to risk their money every investment has inherently a degree of risk or if you want uncertainty about the outcome as a result the tax on capital gains is lower than on other types of income because the risk is almost zero the tax is considered in the calculation of the net interest rate and you can see this as the interest which the investors demand in order to invest their money

you 're making $ 100k together per year you 're not in the hole you 're in the top 25 of all households and the top 10 of non family households as yours would be   to be blunt you 're not in the rely on assistance area you 're in the save up for your downpayment sector my suggestion would be to figure out a way to save more than $ a month for now   $ 100k gross income means you have about $ 8k net income per month $ 2k for rent and other necessities means you have $ 6k per month that you can potentially save   even half of that $ 3k per month means you have $ saved by the end of this year and $ on an annual basis as far as marriage or domestic partnership i would n't get into one based on whether it helps you afford a home   it might be a good idea because it helps you handle some of the details arising when you have joint property perhaps but not solely for the financial aspect and as far as how much home is realistic   $ 250k is certainly realistic if you can save up enough for a good down payment   try to get to the 20 25 range   if you 're already halfway there another year of renting wo n't kill you and it will mean no pmi and much better rates    also consider a 15 year mortgage we 're in the same general income category as you and manage a 15 year on a $ 250k range house quite nicely   it does n't add all that much to your monthly payment amount compared to what you 'd expect particularly since the monthly payment includes property taxes which wo n't increase based on the length of the mortgage now that we have actual numbers from the op so without cutting anything you have $ 2k yourself you can be saving   this assumes your rent number of $ is your portion of rent and not the 100 amount   that 's $ per year just by yourself   on top of that you 've got another $ 40k or so coming from your partner at least some of which should be available as well if he she is going to be co owning   but if not at least you have about $ 2000 a month you can be saving   you could also downsize the car cut cable tv downsize the phone and have another $ 500 or so available but it does n't really look like you need to do that given how much you have available now i 'd look at what you 're doing with that per month right now and see how you can free most of it up   you have n't mentioned a few things like utilities not sure if that 's just or if your partner is paying them so perhaps not all of it is available   but even $ 1000 a month is $ 12000 to add to the $ 20000 you have now which makes a big dent in that down payment

hi all confused about how employee option pools interact with pre money and post money vc valuations   from what i understand the pool essentially dilutes pre money valuation a quote from startup tools calculating true pre money valuation    gt say the vc wants 20 if the company is valued at $ 10 m then the vc would put in $ 2.5 m for a post money of $ 12.5 m $ 2.5 m $ 12.5 m = 20 however if a 30 option pool is added then the post money will be $ 20 m the pool will be $ 6 m and the vc will put in $ 4 m $ 1.5 m or 60 more than before the pre money would have jumped to $   i get that in both cases the founder stays at a $ m true valuation and a pool dilutes founder pre money ownership from to in this case but it seems like the pool is adding value out of nowhere the only additional money is coming from the vc but somehow the pool is worth $ 6 m

the fact is that the annual debt expenses to annual revenue is the key figure at any point in time as well as a model of how these change dynamically   since optimal annual tax revenue is roughly proportional to gdp and since annual debt expenses are proportional a function of yield and changes over time to debt level the debt gdp ratio has been used for a long time as a reasonable   gt   also keep in mind that by borrowing in it 's sovereign currency the us has an enormous amount of monetary tools to handle the debt if it ever became a problem   most of those tricks come with increased yields the currency risk portion of the yield on sovereign debt and so do n't actually help in the case of a death spiral   ask brazil or dozens of other countries   that thinking is also part of why ltcm failed ltcm assumed russia would print money to pay off debt instead of defaulting   also note that the only reason greece short increased their debt was because for once the currency risk component was small   thus while their debt expense income level was reasonable with low yields as their debt gdp increased their yields increased to reflect the greater sovereign default risk   it 's why debt gdp would have been a better measure for greece that a flow based measure   imo the only reason the us is n't already in deep shit is because the us dollar is the de facto reserve currency   this is probably keeping the us yields lower than they would otherwise be in which case our debt payments would be closer to 20 of government revenue

it certainly is possible for a run on the bank to drive it into insolvency   and yes if the bank makes some bad loans it can the problem generally this does not happen though   remember that banks usually have lots of customers and people are depositing money and making mortgage payments every day so there is usually enough on hand to cover average banking withdrawl activity regardless of any bad loans they have outstanding banks have lots of historical data to know what the average withdrawl demands are for a given day   they also have risk models to predict the likelihood of their loans going into default   a bank will generally use this information to strike a healthy balance between profit making activity e.g. issuing loans and satisfying its account holders in the event of a major withdrawl demand there are some protections in place to guard against insolvency there are regulations that specify a reserve requirement   the bank must keep a certain amount of money on hand so they ca n't take huge risks by loaning out too much money all at once   regulators can tweak this requirement over time to reflect the current economic situation if a bank does run into trouble it can take out a short term loan   either from another bank or from the central bank e.g. the us federal reserve   banks do n't want to pay interest on loans any more than you do so if they are regularly borrowing money they will adjust thier cash reserves accordingly if all else fails and the bank ca n't meet its obligations e.g. the fed loan fell through the bank has an insurance policy to make sure the account holders get paid   in the us this is what the fdic is for   worst case the bank goes under but your money is safe these protections have worked pretty well for many decades   however during the recent financial crisis all three of these protections were under heavy strain   so one of the things banking regulators did was to put the major banks through stress tests to make sure they could handle several bad financial events without collapsing   these tests showed that some banks did n't have enough money in reserve   not long after banks started to increase fees and credit card rates to raise this additional capital keep in mind that if banks were unable to use the deposited money loan it out invest it etc the current financial landscape would change considerably

first make sure you understand the objective of an etf   in some cases they may use leverage to get a multiple of the index 's return that is different than 1   some may be ultra funds that go for double the return or double the inverse of the return and thus will try to apply the appropriate leverage to achieve that return those that use physical replication can still have a small portion be used to try to minimize the tracking error as there is something to be said for what kind of tracking error do you accept as the fund 's returns may differ from the index by some measure yes   for example if you were to have a fund that had a 50 and -50 return in back to back periods what would your final return be   answer which if you need to visualize this take $ 1 that then becomes $ 1.50 by going up 50 and then becomes $ .75 by going down 50 in a compounded fashion   this is where you have to be careful of the risks of leverage as those returns will compound in a possibly negative way

fsemx has an annual expense ratio of 0.1 which is very low what that means is that each month the fsemx will pay itself one of 0.1 of   the total value of all the shares owned by the shareholders in the mutual fund   if the fund has cash on hand from its trading activities or dividends collected from companies   whose stock is owned by fsemx or interest on bonds owned by fsemx the   money comes out of that but if there is no such pot or the pot is not large enough then the fund manager has the authority to sell some shares of the stocks held by fsemx so that the employees can be paid etc if the total of cash generated by the trading and the dividend collection in a given year is say 3 of the share value of all the outstanding mutual fund   then only 2.9 will be paid out as dividend and capital gain distribution   income to the share holders the remaining 0.1 already having been paid to fsemx management for operating expenses    it is important to keep in mind that expenses are always paid even if there are no profits or even if there are losses that year so that no dividends or capital gains distributions are made   you do n't see the expenses explicitly on any statement that you receive   if fsemx sells shares of stocks that it holds to pay the expenses this reduces   the share value nav of the mutual fund shares that you hold   so if your mutual fund account lost 20 in value that year because the market was falling and you got no dividend or capital gains distributions either remember that only 19.9 of that loss can be blamed on the president or congress or wall street or public sector unions or your neighbor 's refusal to ditch his old pc in favor of a new mac and the rest 0.1 has gone to fsemx to pay for fees you agreed to when you bought fsemx shares if you invest directly in fsemx through fidelity 's web site there is no sales charge and you pay no expenses other than the 0.1 annual expense ratio   there is a fee for selling fsemx shares after owning them only for a short time since   the fund wants to discourage short term investors whatever other fees lists might be descriptive of the uses that fsemx puts its expense ratio income to in its internal management but are not of any importance to the prudent investor in fsemx who will never encounter them or have to pay them

ditto to md tech but from a more philosophical point of view when you buy stock you own it just like you own a cell phone or a toaster or a pair of socks that you bought the difference is that a share of stock means that you own a piece of a corporation you ca n't physically take possession of it and put it in your garage because if all the stock holders did that then all the company 's assets would be scattered around all the stock holder 's garages and the company could n't function like if you bought a share in a football team you could n't take one of the football players home and keep him in your closet because then the team would n't be able to function i might want to take one of the home but that 's another subject in pre electronic times you could get a piece of paper that said xyz corporation 1 share you could take physical possession of this piece of paper and put it in your filing cabinet i 'm not sure if you can even get such certificates any more i have n't seen one in decades these days it 's just recorded electronically that does n't mean that you do n't own it it just means that someone else is keeping the records for you it 's like leaving your car in a parking lot it 's still your car the people who run the parking lot does n't own it they are keeping it for you but just because they have physical possession does n't make it theirs

buying pressure means there are more interested buyers than there are ready sellers putting upward pressure on prices that might include institutional buyers who are slowly executing buy orders because they still want the best prices possible without clearing out the market buying pressure does n't have to be related to volume at all if everyone who owns shares think they are going to be worth far more than recent market prices they will not offer them for sale that means there is more demand to buy than there is a supply of shares to be bought that condition can exist regardless of trading volume

i agree with mrchrister about first considering how necessary the renovations are is it a nice to have or a need to have as well as the importance of consulting a realtor if you are selling your home as they will advise you wisely   for instance they might advise you to replace the with a neutral ceramic tile as you would be assured a better resale value on your dollar spent than if you were to replace the old with new or there are many types of renovations that simply do n't pay off and others that do provide good return on investment like intelligent kitchen and bathroom updates   i found this roi grid at which is pretty consistent with what i remember reading in the toronto star this spring top 10 renovations ~ average return    on investment painting and interior decorating = 73 kitchen renovations = 72 bathroom renovations = 68 exterior painting = 65 flooring upgrades = 62 window door replacement = 57 family room addition = 51 fireplace addition = 50 basement renovation = 49 furnace heating updating = 48 if you are selling your home and your realtor has suggested improvements they are probably necessary and not doing them might serve as an to quickly selling your home so factor in the potential costs of carrying your home for additional weeks months or worse overlapping mortage costs if it takes your home longer to sell and you end up owning two homes simultaneously for a bit as far as your question should you pay cash for or take out a loan one factor to consider if you live in canada is the home renovation tax credit which applies to that take place until feb 1 2010 and can deduct up to $ 1,350   so if you have to do a reno and yours qualifies for this tax credit and you wo n't have the cash before that deadline factor in the cost of borrowing vs. the $ 1,350 good luck

so child your goal is to make money this is usually achieved by selling goods say lemonade at a price that exceeds their cost say sugar water and well lemons options at first are very much same in that you can buy the right to engage in a specific future trade you make money in this situation if the eventual returns from the scheduled trade cover the cost of purchasing the option otherwise you can simply opt out of the trade you purchased the right to trade after all not any type of obligation makes sense good because what follows is what makes options a little different that is if you sell that same right to engage in a specific trade the situation is seemingly reversed you lock in your return at the outset but the costs are n't fully realized until the trade is either consumed or declined by the owner of the option and keep in mind that it is always the owner of the option who is in the driver 's seat they may sell the option hold on to it and do nothing or use it to engage in the anticipated trade and that 's really all there 's to it

there are no legal reasons preventing you from trading as a f-1 visa holder as noted in this money se answer per this article here are the things you need to set up an account what do i need to have for doing stock trading as f1 student typically most of the stock brokerage firms require social security    number ssn for stock trading the reason is that for your capital    gains it is required   by irs for tax purposes if you work on campus    then you would already get ssn as part of the job application    process typically once you get the on campus job or work    authorization using or opt you use that offer letter and take    all your current documents like passport and apply for ssn    at social security office check full details at    ssa website ssn is typically used to report job wages by employer    for tax purposes or check eligibility of benefits to irs government i do not have ssn can i still do stock trading as f1 student while many stock brokerage firms require ssn you are not out of luck    if you do not have one you will have to apply for an itin number    individual taxpayer identification number   and can use the same when    applying for stock brokerage account   while some of the firms accept    itin number it totally depends on the stock brokering firm and you    need to check with the one that you are interested in the key thing is that you 'll need either a ssn or itin to open a us based brokerage account

the answer depends on whether the company involved has limited liability most but not all public and listed companies and corporations have this but not all so it is worth checking and understanding what you are getting involved with    the expression limited liability means that the owners shareholders of a company have a liability up to the amount of the face value of the shares they hold which they have not yet paid for the difference is usually minor but basically it means that if you buy $ 10 of shares you have no liability but if the company gives you $ 10 of shares and you pay them in cash or kind $ 5 then you still have a liability of $ 5 if the company fails the debtors can come after you for that liability   an unlimited liability company is a different animal altogether lloyds insurance is probably the most famous example lloyds worked by putting together to underwrite risk if the risk does n't happen the consortium keeps the premiums if it does they cover the loss most of the time they are very profitable but not always for example the which covered asbestos caused the bankruptcies of a great many very wealthy people

i 'd like to make two points to focus on your test case of japan   you point out that about a third of them believe they 'll work until they die   that means more than a majority of them believe they 'll retire   in a democracy where a majority of people make decisions it is completely expected that the majority will dictate the policy   of course there is around that last statement because people who believe they 'll retire could very well be of the mindset that they 'll handle their retirement savings themselves rather than rely on government   similarly some people that expect to work until they die might realize that there 's a risk that they wo n't be able to to focus on the case of government run pensions   the pension program that a government runs is n't like a private savings plan where its purpose is to get you a good rate of return   at best it 's an insurance policy more accurately it 's just a tax and you should think of it this way   the reason you should think of it that way is several fold   one if the pension fund is ever short the government will make up the difference from the general fund   two the government can spend the money from the pension fund on other programs if the law changes which over the course of a lifetime is entirely possible   three no one has a legal right to withdraw their contributions directly   four the point of the program is to take care of old people so they are n't starving in the street   to do this they take the money of the young and give it to to old people   the money you pay in does n't go to investments of any sort it goes directly to the elderly   ultimately this is why you ca n't opt out and why you should think of those contributions as a tax and not as savings

the most important thing to remember is that being vat registered you must add vat to every bill so every bill will be 20 higher if the bill payer is a company they do n't care because they deduct the 20 vat from their own vat bill if the bill payer is a private person their cost of your services has just gone up by 20 and it is going to hurt your business so the question is what kind of customers do you have   but if your customers are companies then the flat rate scheme mentioned above is very little work and puts a nice little amount of extra cash in your pocket suitable if your bills are mostly for your work and not for parts that you buy for the customer and bill them for

short answer liquidity well you have to see it from an exchange 's point of view   every contract they put up is a liability to them   you have to allocate resources for the order book the matching engine the clearing etc   but only if the contract is actually trading they start earning the big money now for every new expiry they engage a long term commitment and it might take years for an option chain to be widely accepted and hence before they 're profitable   compare the volumes and open interests of big chains versus the weeklies and you 'll find that weeklies can still be considered illiquid compared to their monthly cousins having said that like many things this is just a question of demand   if there 's a strong urge to trade july weeklies one day there will be an option chain   but personally i think as long as there are the summer there will be no rush to ask for jul and aug chains

why simply because it has been mandated as law and so you may have no choice in the matter whether to contribute or not quoting from gov.uk workplace pensions automatic   a new law means that every employer must automatically workers    into a workplace pension scheme if they next even if you think you will work until you die you can still access the money saved in the pension scheme when you attain the required minimum age for withdrawals under your scheme for instance that may be age 55 but it may also vary by scheme becoming fully retired as in stopping all work is not a requirement to access retirement income from your pension scheme in the eyes of a pension scheme retirement is typically when you elect to take your income benefits according to the established rules of the scheme quoting from working past state pension age continuing in work and your workplace pension   if you reached the age at which you can start claiming your workplace    pension scheme you do n't need to stop work in order to claim you have    a number of options including taking some of the pension you 've built    up while continuing to work for the same employer as to why things are set up this way while some younger folk may today expect to continue working until death for a variety of reasons that is n't always possible two typical such reasons are disability and involuntary unemployment i.e. willing and able but still ca n't land the next job moreover plans change young workers with health and vitality may expect they 'll always feel but end up learning otherwise over time and may come to appreciate the savings that were forced upon them the forced savings aspect of state and state sponsored pension schemes are meant to provide some safety net for those later years when it is a strong possibility that one ca n't continue to work the alternative is to be a 100 burden on family and/or society

firstly the agent does n't work for you he works for himself   it 's in his interest not to get you a house at the lowest cost but to sell you a house the higher the price the higher his commission is or the higher the probability that the seller will sell it meaning less work for him it depends on the market what price you should give if i were you i would do my own research about this area and not just trust the agent 's assessment of it being a seller 's market not sure where we are talking about but as you know house prices have fallen a lot in the last few years and the economy is n't doing that well it also depends on yourself every house is different and there 's an emotional attachment to buying property how much do you really want this house would it matter if you did n't get it are you prepared to keep looking if this is your dream house then maybe it is worth offering a bit more to ensure that you get it if not and you are prepared to wait then yeah i would shoot a little lower and see what they say one thing i will say though is generally even if you give them a low offer unless they 're getting lots of other offers or they have to sell urgently alot of the times the seller will come back and try to negotiate with you anyway after all it 's business and they 're there to get the highest price

long term gov't bonds fluctuate in price with a seemingly small interest rate fluctuation because many years of cash inflows are discounted at low rates   this phenomenon is in a high interest rate environment for example just the principal repayment is worth p + what it will be in 30 years at 4 while an overnight loan paying an unrealistic 4 is worth essentially the same as the principal p + this is more profound in low interest rate economies because taking the countries undergoing the present misfortune one can see that their overnight interest rates are double us long term rates while their long term rates are nearly 10x as large as us long term rates   if there were much supply at the longer maturities which have been restrained by interest rates only manageable by the highly skilled or highly risky a 4 increase on a 30 bond is only about a 20 decline in bond price while a 4 increase on a 4 bond is a 50 decrease the easiest long term bond to manipulate quantitatively is the perpetuity where p is the price of the bond i is the interest payment per some arbitrary period usually 1 year and r is the interest rate paid per some arbitrary period usually 1 year   since they are expressly linked a price can be implied for a given interest rate and vice versa if the interest payment is known or assumed at a 4 interest rate the price is at the price is a 1 increase in interest rates and a 0.8 decrease in price longer term bonds such as a 30 year or 20 year bond will not see as extreme price movements the constant maturity 30 year treasury has fluctuated between 5 and 2.5 to now from before the great recession til now so prices will have more or less doubled and then reduced because bond prices are inversely proportional to interest rates as generally shown above at shorter maturities this phenomenon is negligible because future cash inflows are being discounted by such a low amount   the one month bill rarely moves in price beyond the bid ask spread during expansion but can be expected to collapse before a recession and rebound during

in your particular condition could buy the condo with cash then get your mortgage on your next house with less than 20 down i.e. with mortgage insurance but it would still be an owner occupied loan   if you hate the mortgage insurance you could save up and refi it when you have 20 available including the initial down payment you made i.e. 80 ltv ratio total   or perhaps during the time you live in the condo you can save up to reach the 20 down for the new house   or perhaps you can just rent somewhere then get into the house for 20 down and while there save up and eventually buy a condo in cash later   or perhaps buy the condo for 50 down non owner occupied mortgage ianal but some things that may come in handy you do n't have to occupy your second residence owner occupied mortgage for 60 days after closing on it   so could purchase it at month 10 i suppose   in terms of locking down mortgage rates you could do that up to 3 months before that even so i 've heard    it 's not immediately clear if rent backs could extend the 60 day intent to occupy or if so by how long 1 month might be ok but 2 dunno also you could just buy one or the other or both of your mortgages as a 20 down conventional non owner occupied mortgage and generate leeway there ex buy the home as non owner occupied and rent it out until your year is up though non owner occupied mortgage have worse interest rates so that 's not as appealing   or buy one as a secondary residency mortgage   consult your loan officer there they like to see like geographic distance between primary and secondary residences i 've heard if it 's hud fha mortgage the owner occupancy agreement you will sign is that you will continue to occupy the property as my primary residence for at least one year after the date of occupancy unless extenuating circumstances arise which are beyond my control ref i.e. you plan on living in it for a year so you 're kind of stuck in your case   maybe you 'd want to occupy it as quickly as possible initially to make the year up more quickly apparently you can also request the lender to agree to arbitrarily rescind the owner occupancy aspect of the mortgage half way through though i 'd imagine you need some sort of excuse to convince them   might not hurt to ask

yes exactly var is just a single confidence interval   to go from model to strategy you need to design some kind of indicator i.e. when to buy and when to short or stay out in practice this will look like a large matrix with values ranging from -1 to 1 corresponding to shorting and holding respectively for each security and each day or hour or minute or tick etc which you then just multiply with the matrix of the stock returns the resulting matrix will be your daily returns for each stock you can then just row sum for daily returns of a portfolio or calculate a cumulative product for cumulative returns   a simple example of an indicator would be something like a value of 1 when the price of the stock is below the 30 day moving average and 0 otherwise you can use a battery of econometric models to design these indicators but the rest of the strategy design is essentially the same and it 's relatively easy to build a one size fits all back testing code   i 'll try to edit this post later and link a blog that goes through some of the code   edit simple machine learning model trade is a post that discusses implementing a simple ml strategy you can ignore most of the content but if you go through the github you 'll see how the ml model is implemented as a strategy   an even easier example can be found from the github connected to this how to measure the performance of a trading where the author is just using a totally arbitrary signal as you can see deriving a signal can be a ton of work but once you have actually simulating the strategy can be done in just a few lines of code   hopefully the author wo n't mind me linking his page here but i find his coding style to be very clean and good for educational purposes

when you sell a house around between 7 10 of the sales price will go to various fees mostly to the agents but also to county fees city fees deed tax and possibly covering closing costs for the buyers so if you sell a $ 400k house for the same price you buy just in fees you 're out $ 40k mortgages are structured so that the frontend is very interest heavy while at the end you 're mostly paying towards principal so for the first two years you will pay down very little of the principal figure around $ 2500 for the mortgage and without running the numbers i bet you would pay an average for the first two years of around $ in interest $ mortgage interest is tax deductible so you 'll get some of that back that 's also $ 16,800 in equity you 'll have on the house so you 'll get that back out when you sell rough numbers i would be you lose around $ 50k buying the house and selling for the same price two years later that does n't take into account having to do any maintenance and it assumes you can sell quickly when you want to renting is not throwing away money you do n't lose any money you get a place to live in exchange you do n't build equity sure but you do n't need to worry about maintenance and other related issues when you 're looking to be somewhere short term renting is generally the best idea

in the united states the general policy is that the irs would consider it income when you have access to the money i work for a company that has a contract with another company near the end of the year i turn in a time card that has my hours that i worked as of that date because they do n't pay me until early january the money on the check is counted in the new year i could n't touch the money until they issued the check if they had paid me on december 31st it would have counted as the old year even if i only had a short window to have access to it before the year ended it would even count as old year money if i held on to the december check but did n't deposit it until march so it would become income when you could use it so if you could access it via a check or debit card or transfer it to the bank it is now income of course that is in the united states you would need to see what the situation is in singapore the edge cases always depend on the country

there are several reasons one mutual funds provide instant diversification   to build a diverse portfolio manually by buying individual shares requires a lot of time and effort   if your portfolio is not diverse then it is wrong to say buying shares gives higher return in many cases diversification will increase your returns two mutual funds reduce transactions costs   if you buy individual shares you pay transactions costs every time you buy or sell   if you buy and sell the shares of many companies you must perform many transactions and thus incur heavy fees   with mutual funds a single transaction gets you access to many companies   in addition it is often possible to buy mutual funds without paying transactions costs at all although you will still pay fund expenses three sort of a combination of the previous two it is just easier   many people can easily buy mutual funds with no cost and little effort through their bank   it is also simple to set up auto investment plans so that you automatically save money over time   all of these things are much more complicated if you try to buy many individual shares four if you buy the right kinds of funds low cost index funds it is probably more lucrative than buying individual shares   the odds that through carefully selected stock buying you will earn more than the market average are small   even professional stock pickers consistently underperform broad market indexes in short it is not true that buying shares gives higher return and even if it were the convenience and diversification of mutual funds would still be good reasons to use them

i invested a small amount of money with prosper and later with lending club i do n't know why there is such a discrepancy but over half of my prosper loans defaulted while only 1 of my lending club loans has defaulted so far i think that p2p lending is for early adopters right now there are regulation issues transparency issues legal issues etc once all of those issues get worked out i think that p2p lending will eventually overtake conventional lending and it will be more profitable for both the lender and the borrower the internet is simply eroding the value that banks are adding to the process primarily aggregation of funds and the system has to change

as mhoran said the risks of buying a bankrupt company are huge and even successful bankruptcy do n't involve keeping the same stock for instance the gm bankruptcy was resolved by the company more or less selling all its valuable assets brands factories inventory to a new version of itself using that money to pay off what liabilities it could and then dissolving the new company then issued new stock and you had to buy the new stock to see it rise the old stock became worthless aa could have gone the same way delta could have bought it out of bankruptcy and consumed it outright with any remaining shareholders being paid off at market value that 's probably the best the market was hoping for instead the deal is a much more equal merger brings a very large airport network and aircraft fleet to the table and delta brings its cash an also considerable fleet and network and a management team that 's kept that airline solvent the stockholders therefore expect to be paid off at a much higher per share price either in a new combined stock in delta stock or in cash

to avoid going on and on in the comments i 'm going to add this point that seems to be missing from the other answers banks often offer me deals while negotiating to open an account since they are under high pressure to open an account    would these happen to be the advertised account opening deals like a $ 200 new checking account bonus if you deposit at least $ x and leave it for at least 90 days   this kind of deal is not unique to you   this is not offered to you because of your unique negotiating ability you need to understand the authority of the person you 're dealing with   products are designed in the corporate arm of the bank   once a product is ready it 's rolled out to branches to be sold sometimes with some fancy sign up bonus   a checking account is a product just like an iphone   apple took the jack out of the iphone 7 no amount of negotiating with the genius at the apple store will put it back for you vote with your wallet show the bank you 're unhappy by leaving

junk bonds aka high yield bonds are typically those bonds from issues with credit ratings below not all such companies are big risks they are just less financially sound than other higher rated companies if you are not comfortable doing the analysis yourself you should consider investing in a mutual fund etf or unit trust that invests in high yield bonds you get access to better quality issues because a huge amount of the debt markets goes to the institutional channels not to the retail markets high yield junk bonds can make up a part of your portfolio and are a good source of regular income as always you should diversify and not have everything you own in one asset class there are no real rules of thumb for asset allocation it all depends on your risk tolerance goals time horizon and needs if you do n't trust yourself to make wise decisions consult with a professional whom you trust

this depends on the particular index of course capital gains taxes occur when stock is sold for a profit this occurs less frequently in an index fund where an active manager frequently buys and sells stocks after all he wants to be active the index fund only sells stocks when the particular stock leaves the index for an index such as the s&p 500 this does not happen that often   the more specific the criteria of the index fund the more often the selling of stock and thus the need to pay capital gains taxes occurs

summary it 's because you are effectively contributing more money in the second case so you have more money at the end   the effect of being covered by an employer retirement plan in the case of a 401(k that means either you or your employer contributed to it during the year is that it prevents you from deducting traditional ira contributions unless your income is below a very low level for single filing status it phases out at an magi of between $ and $ since you are unable to deduct the traditional ira contribution but you entered that you are still making the full $ 5500 contribution every year that means you are making a non deductible contribution of $ 5500 every year instead of a deductible contribution nondeductible contributions are after tax whereas deductible contributions are pre tax because your taxable income is reduced by the amount of the contribution so you effectively do n't pay income tax on the income you used to contribute $ 1 of pre tax money is not the same as $ 1 of after tax money if your marginal tax rate is 25 then $ 1 of pre tax money is equivalent to $ 0.75 of after tax money however since in both cases you are putting in the same nominal amount of contribution $ 5500 but one is pre tax and one is after tax in the after tax case you are effectively contributing more money i.e. more money is taken out from your bank account that year the $ 5500 pre tax contribution is equivalent to only $ 5500 0.75 = $ after tax i.e. you are only short $ from your bank account at the end of the year after making a $ 5500 deductible contribution whereas you are short $ 5500 after making a $ 5500 non deductible contribution so it 's not a fair comparison the non deductible traditional ira contributions are not taxed when withdrawn though the earnings earned from those contributions are still taxed so that 's why you are left with a greater amount this is a similar situation to what happens when you try to compare a $ 5500 deductible traditional ira contribution to a $ 5500 roth ira contribution it will look like the roth ira case leaves you with much more money but that 's again because you are effectively contributing more money because the roth ira contribution is after tax so it 's not a fair comparison the roth ira case will produce a much greater advantage than the non deductible traditional ira contribution case because for a roth ira both the contributions and earnings will not be taxed at withdrawal

in general you can only be charged for services if there is some kind of contract the contract does n't have to be written but you have to have agreed to it somehow however it is possible that you entered into a contract due to some clause in the home purchase contract or the contract with the home owners association there are also sometimes services you are legally required to get such as regular inspection of heating furnaces though i do n't think this translates to automatic contracts but in any case you would not be liable for services rendered before you entered into the contract which sounds like it 's the case here

if you have an increasing population but a steady supply of wealth then there will be a perceived effect of decline   as the average person can afford less and less   if inflation is factored in this effect is accelerated as the value of money is reduced but the availability of that money is as well   in this model those who have tend to accumulate as they produce and those who do not have tend to lose wealth as they consume to fill basic needs at ever increasing prices with a declining source of income exacerbating the effect    if you control your population prevent inflation and deflation and maintain a constant production consumption cycle that is perfectly in balance then you could have that utopian society   but in practice there is waste   that waste makes maintaining that balance impractical at best   people have different desires and motivations   so while that utopian society that you propose seems possible at the theoretical level when solely looking at the mechanics and economics in practice it becomes more about managing the people   which makes the task virtually impossible as for the debt issue that is the strategy of many of the western nations   most of them experienced growth over the last 50 years that was unprecedented in history   many of them simply assumed it would continue indefinitely and failed to plan for a downturn   in addition they planned for the growth and borrowed based on the assumptions   when the growth slowed several continued to use the same projections for their budgeting with the effect of spending money they would not take in   so in a way yes the growth is needed to service the continued growth of debt unless the government issuing that debt is willing to reduce its expenses

there are two things to consider taxes beneficial treatment for long term holding and for espp 's you can get lower taxes on higher earnings also depending on local laws some share schemes allow one to avoid some or all on the income tax for example in the uk ¬£ 2000 in shares is treated differently to 2000 in cash vesting restricted stocks or options can only be sold exercised years after being granted as long as the employee keeps his part of the contract usually staying at the same place of works through the vesting period this means job retention for the employees that 's why they do n't really care if you exercise the same day or not they care that you actually keep working until the day when you can exercise arrives by then you 'll get more grants you 'll want to wait to vest and so on this would keep you at the same place of work for a long time because by quitting you 'd be forfeiting the grants

your assumption that funds sold in gbp trade in gbp is incorrect in general funds purchase their constituent stocks in the fund currency which may be different to the subscription currency where the subscription currency is different from the fund currency subscriptions are converted into the fund currency before the extra money is used to increase holdings an etf on the other hand does not take subscriptions directly but by creation and redemption of shares the principle is the same however monies received from creation of etf shares are converted into the fund currency and then used to buy stock this ensures that only one currency transaction is done in your specific example the fund currency will be usd so your purchase of the shares assuming there are no sellers and creation occurs will be converted from gbp to usd and held in that currency in the fund the fund then trades entirely in usd to avoid currency risk when you want to sell your exposure supposing redemption occurs enough holdings required to redeem your money are sold to get cash in usd and then converted to gbp before paying you this means that trading activity where there is no need to convert to gbp or any other currency does not incur currency conversion costs in practice funds will always have some cash or cash equivalents on hand to pay out redemptions and will have an idea of the number and size of redemptions each calendar period so will use futures and swaps to mitigate fx risk where the same firm has two funds traded in different currencies with the same objectives it is likely that one is a wrapper for the other such that one simply converts the currency and buys the other currency denominated etf as these are exchange traded funds with a price in gbp the amount you pay for the etf or gain on selling it is the price given and you will not have to consider currency exchange as that should be done internally as explained above however there can be a temporary arbitrage opportunity if the price in gbp does not reflect the price in usd and the exchange rate put together

monopolies do n't always charge more than a competitive market this is true but it 's still anti competitive to have a monopoly regardless if the consumer benefits from a lower price   i think it 's important to breed competition even in the rare cases where consumers might benefit from a lower price in the long run innovation would be stifled and consumers could be worse off   i just wanted to add that comment to the discussion i do n't think it applies to this scenario because amazon and whole foods make up a whopping 3 of the retail grocery market

property sold at profit is taxed at capital gains rate if you held it for more than a year which you have based on your previous question thus deferring salary wo n't change the taxable amount or the tax rate on the property it may save you the 3 difference on the salary but i do n't know how significant can that be the 25 depreciation recapture rate or whatever the current percentage is is preset by your depreciation and can not be changed so you 'll have to pay that first whatever is left above it is capital gains and will be taxed at discounted rates 20 iirc you need to make sure that you deduct everything and capitalize everything else all the non deductible expenses and losses with regards to the property for example if you remodeled its added to your basis reduces the gains if you did significant improvements and changes the same if you installed new appliances and carpets they 're depreciated faster you can appropriate part of the sale proceeds to these and thus reduce the actual property related gain also you need to see what gain you have on the land the land can not be depreciated so all the gain on it is capital gain your cpa will help you investigating these and maybe other ways to reduce your tax bill do make sure to have proper documentation and proofs for all your claims do n't make things up and do n't allow your cpa cut corners it may cost you dearly on audit

somewhat   the balance sheet will include liabilities which as michael points out would tell you the totals for the debt which would often be loans or bonds depending on one 's preferred terminology   however if the company 's loan was shorter than the length of the quarter then it may not necessarily be reported is something to point out as the data is accurate for a specific point in time only my suggestion is that if you have a particular company that you want to review that you take a look at the sec filing in full which would have a better breakdown of everything in terms of assets liabilities etc than the a summary page   would be where you could find a link to the 10-q that has a better breakdown though it does appear that apple does n't have any bonds outstanding   there are some companies that may have little debt due to being so profitable in their areas of business

advice from a long time flipper you negotiate price based on four factors and none of these are set in stone how much you love the house   is this house a 100 out of 100 for you or a 85 or a 75   how much have you compromised what is the likelihood that you will find a house that will make you just as happy or at least close   you might have a house that is a 95 out of 100 but there are five other houses that you rated between 93 95    what is your timeframe   know that playing takes longer and can knock you out of the game sometimes and takes a little while to find a new game what is the relative housing market   zillow and other such sites are crap   yes the give you a generalized feel for a community but their estimates are off sometimes by 30 40   other factors like street noise updates to and so on are huge factors   you will have to really navigate the area and look for very comparable houses that have recently sold   then use average housing movements to extrapolate your future houses cost as a buyer you have two jobs   buy the house you want and manage your agent   your agent wants you to buy a house as soon as possible and to increase their reputation   those are their only two factors of working    by you offering closer to the asking price they are able to get their sales as quick as possible   also other agents will love working with them   in fact your agent is selling you on the home and the price   agents hardly worry about you paying too much as most buyers the deal they get on their home   admitting that you paid too much for your house is more of an admission of ignorance of yourself compared to agent if you decide to low ball the owner your agent spends more time with you and possibly reduces their reputation with the selling agent   so it is common for agents to tell you that you should not offer a low price as you will insult the owner my advice   unless the home is truly one of a kind for the market offering anything within 20 of the asking price is definitely within range   i have offered 40 less   if a house is asking too much and has been on the market for 8 months there is no way i am going in with an offer of even 15 lower   that leaves you no room    what you do first think about how much you think this house could sell for in the next 3 months   in your example let 's say 80 k based on conservative comps   then take the most you would actually pay for it   let 's say   70 k is about as high of an opening offer i would go    do not tell your agent your true breaking points   if you tell your agent that you would go to 75 k on the house   then that is what their negotiations will start at   remember they want the sale to happen as soon as possible   very likely the other agent especially if they know each other will ask if how flexible you are going to be   then next thing you know your agent calls you back and says would you be willing to go 77 k or the owner is firm at do not give up your position   you should never forecast to your agent what your next bid or offer would be for the house   never get into scenarios or future counters    so you offer   if your agent asks you how firm that is   very firm   if your agent does n't want to take the offer to them thank you for being my agent but i am going to be working with someone that represents what i want    if the owner says you are done too me   well that 's how it goes   if the owner stays firm at asking or lowers then you can come up if you feel comfortable doing so   but understand what your goal is   is it to get a house or to get a good deal on a house   mine was always to get a good deal on a house   so i might offer 72 k next   if they did n't budge i am out   if they moved down i went from there    easy summary the fact is if they are n't willing to negotiate with you enough it always ends the same   you give them your take it or leave it offer   you tell your agent that if he she comes back with one penny over it comes from their commission god i have said this 100 times in my life and it is the best negotiation tactic you have with your agent   the owner says yes or no and it is over

time value of money the simple calculation for this is fv = pv which reads the future value is equal to the present value times 1 plus the interest rate multiplied by itself by the number of periods that will pass a simple way to look at this is that if interest rates were a dollar would be worth where n is the number of years passing   the concept of compound interest can not be separated from the above compounding is accounting for the interest on the interest that has accrued in prior periods if i lend you a dollar at 6 simple interest for 30 years you would pay me back $ 1 + $ or $ 2.80 but 1.06 ^ 30 = so that dollar compounded at 6 annually for 30 years is $ quite a difference   often the time value of money is discussed in light of inflation a dollar today is not the same dollar as 30 years ago or 30 years hence in fact inflation has eroded the value of the dollar by a factor of 3 over the past 30 years an average item costing $ 100 would now cost $ 300 so when one invests at the very least they try to stay ahead of inflation and seek additional return for their risk   one of compounding is the rule of 72 this rule states that if you divide the interest rate into the number 72 the result is the number of years to double so 10 per year will take about 7.2 years to double 8 9 years etc it 's not 100 precise but a good back of napkin calculation   when people talk about the total payments over the thirty year life of a mortgage they often ignore the time value of money that payment even ten years from now has far less value than the same payment today

to me the key is a budget   each month before it begins decide on what to spend on each dollar that you earn   money should be allotted for normal expenses such as housing food transportation and utilities if you have any consumer debt that should be a priority   extra money should go to eliminate that debt there should be money allotted to savings goals such as retirement home down payment or vacation home   also there should be money set aside for clothing and giving   giving is an important part and often overlooked part of wealth creation    somewhere in there you should also give yourself a bit of free money   for example one of the things i spend my free money on is coffee   i buy freshly ground coffee from a really good supplier   it is a bit expensive but that is okay as it does not preclude me from meeting other goals if you still have money left after all of that increase your giving some your savings some and your free money some   you can then spend that money without guilt if your budget includes $ 100 of free money per month and you want something that costs $ 1000 save up the $ 1,000 and then buy it   do not borrow to buy free money stuff    doing those sorts of things will make you weigh purchasing decisions very carefully if you find that you can not stick to a budget you should enlist a friend to be your accountability partner   they have to be very good with money

first of all kudos for thinking about budgeting at 21 years old   so many people do n't plan with their money and years later wonder where it all went you are doing a lot of things right with your budget   you 've got saving goals namely your next car and a down payment on a house   you are saving almost 20 of your income for retirement which is amazing i like the luxury fund too   it is good to put some money aside that you can spend on whatever you want guilt free because you know that everything important is already planned for when it comes to budgeting one thing to remember is that your budget does not have to be perfect and it is not set in stone   if you find that your amount for living costs which i 'm assuming includes things like food utilities and rent is too low you can allocate more money to it and reduce something else   there is no need to feel bad if you end up having to change some things around in the budget congratulations on being debt free   i would encourage you to stay out of debt   keep the credit cards paid in full each month and save up for your next car so you can pay cash for that too another saving goal that i would recommend adding to your budget would be an emergency fund   this is basically a pile of cash that is available to you in case something unexpected and urgent comes up that you have n't planned for   by having the emergency fund in place you wo n't be forced to go into debt due to an emergency   the amount recommended is usually 3 to 6 months worth of your expenses

whether behaving illegally or not and their behavior is sometimes illegal wal mart can certainly not be trusted to do what 's good for its workers or those of its suppliers communities or the us economy   refer to publication for one example     you 're right that determining what policies will help can be tricky   that does n't mean we should just let the market do as it will   if we 've learning nothing from the recent bubbles it 's that this is clearly dangerous   moreover it is citizens and our that should have more say that a self interested private business

i work at a large accounting firm the reason major accounting firms do n't have mass layoffs is because the regulatory environment creates a huge demand for accountants in fact many of the newer regulations that create this demand are a result of legislators attempting to remedy the problems that caused the financial meltdown in the first place   it 's the same with fields such as medicine certain jobs simply have steady demand that is n't impacted in the same way as other jobs during a recession it does n't mean there 's some sort of profiteering going on not that that does n't happen

as has been said before going from nothing to something is an infinite percent increase it is not 100 maybe you had a dollar and now have $ 101 that is a 10000 increase quite remarkable i often work with percent changes like spc = 100 where i compute the percent with respect to the average first this is more stable as often measurements can have noise the average is more reliable   second advantage is also that this is so going from 95 to 105 is a 10 increase while going from 105 to 95 a 10 decrease of course you need to explain what you show

the existing irs guidance in the us related to bitcoin indicates it will be taxed as property    you 'll sell your coins then when you file your taxes for that year you will indicate the dollar value that you sold as a capital gain with a $ 0 cost basis since you ca n't prove your initial cost   you can use a block chain explorer to get an idea of when the coins were transferred to your wallet to lay to rest any idea that someone paid you $ 1,000,000 for some sort of nefarious reason today prepare to be audited i 'd probably shop around for a local tax guy willing to prepare your return   additionally i probably would n't sell it all at once or even all in a single year it 's obvious but i think it 's worth saying there 's no law against making money   you bought the equivalent of junk a number of years ago that by some kind of magic has a value today   you 're capitalizing on the value increase   i do n't think there 's a reason to worry about the government

it 's good to ask this question because this is one of the fundamental in market at any time t for each product on a typical exchange there are two well defined prices at time t there is literally no person in the market who wants to sell below the ask so all the people who are waiting to buy at the bid or below could very well be waiting there forever   there 's simply no guarantee that any seller will ever want to part with their product for a lesser price than they think it 's worth so if you want to buy the product at time t you have a tough choice to make you get in line at the bid price where there 's no guarantee that your request will ever be filled and you might never get your hands on the product you decide that owning the product right now is more valuable to you than ask bid quantity so you tell the exchange that you 're willing to buy at the ask price and the exchange matches you with whichever seller is first in line now if you 're in the market for the long term the above choice is completely immaterial to you   who cares if you pay $ 10.00 1000 shares or $ 10.01 1000 shares when you plan to sell 30 years from now at $ 200 or $ but if you 're a day trader or anyone else with a very short time horizon then this choice is extremely important if the price is about to go up several cents and you got in line at the bid and never got filled then you missed out on some profit if you cross the spread to buy at the ask and then the price does n't go up or worse goes down you 're screwed   in order to get out of the position you 'll have to cross the spread again and sell at at most the bid meaning you 've now paid the spread twice plus transaction fees and regulatory fees for nothing all of the above also applies in reverse for selling at the ask versus selling at the bid but most people like to learn in terms of buying rather than selling

my answer would be yes in addition i 'm not sure that anything requires you to roll your current 401(k into a new one if you do n't like the investment options   keeping existing funds in your current 401(k if you like their investment options might make sense for you though they obviously would n't be adding funds once you 're no longer an employee as for the terms of the potential new 401(k the matching percentage and vesting schedule match what i 've seen at past employers   my current employer offers the same terms but there 's no vesting schedule

best strategy that has worked for me is to remember first of all that you hardly ever need anything right now try this if you see something you want to buy leave it for at least two weeks better yet a month if after that time you have hardly thought about it then you almost certainly do n't need it but if you 've thought quite a lot about owning it and how it will be beneficial then perhaps it 's worth picking up you will probably find that a small percentage of things you 'd like to buy make it through that screening period

having worked for a financial company for years my advice is to stay away from all the freedom funds offered   they 're a new way for fidelity to justify charging a higher management fee on those particular funds   that extra 1 or so a year is great for making the company money it will kill your rate of return over the next 25 + years you 're putting money into your retirement account   all these funds do is change the percentage of your funds in stocks vs. more fixed investments bonds etc so you have a higher percentage in stocks while you 're young and slowly move the percentage more towards fixed as you get older   if you take a few hours every 5 years to re balance your portfolio and just slowly shift more money towards fixed investments you 'll achieve the same thing without the extra annual fee so how much difference are we talking here   let 's do a quick example   based on your salary of $ 70k and a 4 match by your company you 'll have $ a year to put in your 401(k your 4 plus matched 4   i 'll also assume an 8 annual return for both funds   here is what that 1 extra service charge will cost you fund with a 1 service charge annual fee paid year 1 $ 60.00 annual fee paid year 25 assuming 8 growth in assets $ total fees year 1 through 25   $ fund with a 2 service charge annual fee paid year 1 $ annual fee paid year 25 assuming 8 growth in assets $ total fees year 1 through 25   $ that 's a total of $ in extra fees over 25 years on just the investment you make this year   next year if you invest the same amount in your 401k that will be another $ paid over 25 years to the management company   this pattern repeats each year you pay the higher management fee   trust me if you invest that money in stock instead of paying it as fees you 'll have a whole lot more money saved when it 's time to retire my advice pick a percentage you 're comfortable with in stocks at your age maybe 85 90 and pick the stock funds with the lowest management fees the remaining 10 15 should go into a fixed fund   make sure you pick at least some of your stock money i do 20 25 and select a diverse lots of different countries international fund for any retirement money you plan to save above the 4 getting matched by your company set up a roth ira   that will give you the freedom to invest in any stocks or funds you want   find some low cost index funds such as vti for stocks and for bonds and put your money in those   invest the same amount every month automatically and your cost average will work itself out through up markets and down good luck

$ 1000 is not that much and i think the best you can do with them is keeping them in a high yield savings account look at the online savings accounts that give 1 and more not the regular bank savings accounts which are worthless if you need money all of a sudden for a school book or rent or bills or some other emergency expense you do n't want to deal with selling stocks or funds which may be at loss or breaking into your cd 's it is usually considered a good practice to keep cash that would keep you afloat for 5 6 months in savings or some cash equivalent as an emergency fund

first off leaving money in a 529 account is not that bad since you may always change the beneficiary to most any blood relative   so if you have leftovers you do n't have to pay the 10 penalty if you have a for instance that can use it   but if you would rather have the money out then you need a strategy to get it out that is tax efficient my prescription for managing a situation like this is not to pay directly out of the 529 account but instead calculate your cost of education up front and withdraw that money at the beginning of the school year   you can keep it in a separate account but that 's not necessary   the amount you withdraw should be equal to what the education costs which may be estimated by taking the budget that the school publishes minus grants and scholarships   you should have all of those numbers before the first day of school   this is amount $ x. during the year write all the checks out of your regular account   at the end of the school year you should expect to have no money left in the account   i presume that the budget is exactly what you will spend   if not you might need to make a few adjustments but this answer will presume you spend exactly $ x during the fall and the spring of the next year in order to get more out of the 529 without paying penalties you are allowed to remove money without penalty but having the gains taxed $ y + $ z   you have the choice of having the 529 funds directed to the educational institution the student or yourself   if you direct the funds to the student the gains portion would be taxed at the student 's rate   everyone 's tax situation is different and of course there is a between the parent 's taxes and student 's taxes but it may be efficient to have the 529 funds directed to the student   for instance if the student does n't have much income they might not even be required to file income tax   if that 's the case they may be able to remove an amount $ y from the 529 account and still not need to file   for instance let 's say the student has no unearned income and the gains in the 529 account were 50   the student could get a check for $ 2,000 $ 1,000 would be gains but that low amount may mean the student was not required to file or if it 's more important to get more money out of the account the student could remove the total amount of the grants plus scholarships $ y + $ z   no penalty would be due just the taxes on the gains   and at the student 's tax rate generally but check your own situation finally if you really want the money out of the account you could remove a check $ y + $ z + $ p   you 'd pay tax on the gains of the sum but penalty of 10 only on the $ p portion this answer does not include the math that goes along with securing some tax credits so if those credits still are around as you 're working through this consider this article which requires site sign up   in part this article says how much to withdraw     for most parents it will be 100 of the beneficiary ‚Äôs qualified higher education expenses paid this year tuition fees books supplies equipment and room and board less $ 4,000 the $ 4,000 is redirected to the american opportunity tax credit when to withdraw it     take withdrawals in the same calendar year that the qualified expenses were paid designating the     since it is usually best that the form be issued to the beneficiary and show the beneficiary ‚Äôs social security number i prefer to use either option 2 or 3 2 a check made out to the account beneficiary or 3 a check made out to the educational institution what about scholarships     the 10 percent penalty on a non qualified distribution from a 529 plan is waived when the excess distribution can be attributed to tax free scholarships while there is no direct guidance from the irs many tax experts believe the distribution and the scholarship do not have to match up in the same calendar year when applying the penalty waiver if you 're curious about timing taking non penalty grants and scholarship money out there is this link which says you probably are allowed to accumulate grants and scholarship totals for tax purposes over multiple years

bonds still definitely have a place in many passive portfolios   while it is true that interest rates have been unusually low yields on reasonable passive bond exposures are still around 2 4   this is significantly better than both recent past inflation and expected inflation both of which are near zero    this is reasonable if not great return but bonds continue to have other nice properties like relatively low risk and diversification of stock portfolios the losses you mention in the op   so to say that bonds are no longer a good idea is certainly not correct   one could say bonds may no longer be a good idea for some people that have a particularly high risk tolerance and very high return requirements however to some extent that has always been true it is worth remembering also that there is some compelling evidence that global growth is starting to broadly slow down and many people believe that future stock returns and in general returns on all investments will be lower   this is much much harder to estimate than bond returns though   depending on who you believe bond returns may actually look relatively better than the have in the past edit in response to comment   corporate bond correlation with stocks is positive but generally not very strong except for high yield junk bonds so while they do n't offset stock volatility negative correlation they do help diversify a stock portfolio   government bonds have essentially zero correlation so they do n't really offset volatility as much as just not add any   negative correlation assets are generally called insurance and you tend to have to pay for them   so there is no free lunch here   assets that reduce risk cost money assets that add little risk give less return and assets that are more risky tend to give more return in the long run but you can feel the pain   the mix that is right for you depends on a lot of things but for many people that mix involves some corporate and government bonds

it is true that this is possible however it 's very remote in the case of the large and reputable fund companies such as vanguard fdic insurance protects against precisely this for bank accounts but mutual funds and etfs do not have an equivalent to fdic insurance one thing that does help you in the case of a mutual fund or etf is that you indirectly through the fund own actual assets in a cash account at a bank you have a promise from the bank to pay and then the bank can go off and use your money to make loans you do n't in any sense own the bank 's loans with a fund the fund company can not legally take your money out of the fund except to pay the expense ratio they have to use your money to buy stocks bonds or whatever the fund invests in those assets are then owned by the fund legally a mutual fund is a special kind of company defined in the investment company act of 1940 and is a separate company from the investment advisor such as vanguard funds have their own boards and in principle a fund board can even fire the company advising the fund though this is not likely since boards are n't usually independent a quick google found this article for more maybe someone can find a better one if vanguard goes under the funds could continue to exist and get a new adviser or could be liquidated with investors receiving whatever the assets are worth of course all this legal stuff does n't help you with outright fraud if a fund 's adviser says it bought the s&p 500 but really some guy bought himself a yacht madoff style then you have a problem but a huge well known etf has auditors tons of different employees lots of brokerage and exchange traffic etc so to me at least it 's tough to imagine a risk here with a small fund company with just a few people and there are lots of these then there 's more risk and you 'd want to carefully look at what independent agent holds their assets who their auditors are and so forth with regular mutual funds not etfs there are more issues with diversifying across fund companies with etfs there probably is n't much downside to diversifying since you could buy them all from one brokerage account maybe it even happens naturally if you pick the best etfs you can find personally i would just pick the best etfs and not worry about advisor diversity update maybe also deserving a mention are exchange traded notes etns an etn 's legal structure is more like the bank account minus the fdic insurance of course it 's an iou from the company that runs the etn where they promise to pay back the value of some index there 's no investment company as with a fund and therefore you do n't own a share of any actual assets if the etn 's sponsor went bankrupt you would indeed have a problem much more so than if an etf 's sponsor went bankrupt

can i work on 1099 from my own company instead of on w2 the reason is    on w2 i ca n't deduct my commute health insurance and some other    expenses while on 1099 i think i can able do that since i am going to    client place to work not at my own office i am not sure whether i    should able to do that or not if you have llc unless you elected to tax it as a corporation you need neither 1099 nor w2 for tax purposes the llc is disregarded so it is from tax perspective a sole proprietorship or partnership if multiple members being a w2 employee of your own llc is a bad idea for all these above expenses which can i use company 's debit credit    card or i need to use only my personal debit credit card it would be better to always use a business account for business purposes does n't matter much for tax per se but will make your life easier in case of an audit or a legal dispute limited liability protection may depend on it if i work on 1099 i guess i need to file some reasonable taxes on    quarterly basis instead of filing at year end if so how do i pay my    tax on quarterly basis to irs i mean which forms should i file and    how to pay tax unless you 're a w2 employee you need to do quarterly estimate payments using form 1040-es if you are a w2 employee even for a different job and even if it is not you but your spouse with whom you 're filing jointly you can adjust your spouse 's withholding using form w4 to cover the additional tax liability this is imho a better way than paying estimates there are numerous questions on this search the site or ask another one for details

yes this unions are what ruined the german economy and put them at the bottom of the list of world manufacturers they are bleeding so many jobs to china   and south east asia experts are predicting they wo n't have any manufacturing sector jobs left within the year this is going to exacerbate germany 's already sky high unemployment rate and god knows how they are going to pay off their enormous national debt   on another point i just do n't understand how we allow police and fire unions as they do n't make those jobs any safer and just end up costing the tax payers more money if it were n't for them we could pay our police and fire fighters minimum wages that would equate to about a hundred dollars in tax savings for each and every property owner in a municipality   furthermore the rights of the workers are best represented by their employers and not an expensive corrupt union you can clearly see the efficiency with which large employers like flour takes care of their non union employees sure the non union people have a much higher medical debt load less home ownership and more frequent bankruptcies due to unpaid medical debt but that is not without its advantages

credit history is local so when you move to the us you start with the blank slate credit history length is a huge factor so in the first year expect that nobody would trust you and you may be refused credit or asked for deposits i was asked for deposits at cell phone company and refused for store cards couple of times my advice get a secured credit card that means you put certain sum of money as a deposit in the bank and you get credit equal to that sum of money and if you have something like a car loan that helps too of course you should n't buy a car just for that but if you 're buying anyway just know it 's not only hurting but also helping when you pay once you have a year or two of the history and you 've kept with all the payments you credit score would be ok and everybody would be happy to work with you in 4 5 years you can have excellent credit record if you pay on time and do n't do anything bad if you are working it the us a lot of help at first would be to take a letter from your company on an official letterhead saying that you are employed by this and that company and are getting salary of this and that that can serve as an assurance for some merchants that otherwise would be reluctant to work with you because of the absence of credit history if you have any assets overseas especially if they are held in a branch of international bank in us dollars that could help too in general do n't count too much on credit for first 1 2 years though you 'd probably could get a car loan for example but rates would be exorbitant easily 10 percentage points higher than with good credit but it will get better soon

edit to answer what i think you question is i do not know of anything other than trip cancellation insurance   and you must be very careful that the policy you purchase for your trip covers the circumstance you described   essentially you opted not to take the flight   not all trip cancellation policies will cover that how to find trip cancellation insurance getting your money back now this is an act of god in the insurance world   you can not reasonably expect the airline to know the future weather pattern anymore than you could and therefore since the plane did fly you owe them the money based on the ticket you bought   you did n't just buy a ticket there is a contract with rules about refunds and transferring and such it is a bummer situation and i understand you point of view but this is n't the airline 's fault if anybody is to blame for you missing your flight and therefore not getting a refund it is your employer   their requirements for you be in one city and then another are the cause    while your employer can not predict the weather they are ultimately the ones who could give you the okay to be late   if you absolutely can not be late and it was critical that you drive out and miss your flight then your company gets to pay for the flight and the car   that is the cost of doing business for them this is also why when flying for business that you pay the higher price and get the refundable transferable ticket   they cost more but situations like these illustrate they are worth it for the company

the equity you have is an asset locked away until you sell and sometimes pledged as a loan if you wish the idea that it 's dead money is nonsense it 's a pretty illiquid asset that has the potential for growth at the rate of inflation or slightly higher long term and provides you an annual dividend in the form of free rent   in this country most people who own homes have a disproportionate amount of their wealth in their house this is more a testament to the poor saving rate than anything else for me a high equity position means that i can sell my home and buy a lesser sized house for cash i am older and my own goal with the mrs is to have the house paid and college for the kid fully funded before we think of retiring for others it 's cash they can use to rent after they retire i hope that helped there 's nothing magic about this just a lot of opinions

there is no like false advertising or misleading that you can claim or even reporting them to the better business bureau or something which maybe is n't enough but is something   is there a way to report web scams that is actually effective because this seems to border on being a very widespread scam   they did actually take my money ebay amazon and other major sites have policies that are pretty tight and can hold up i wonder if this company can be compared to this but with very bad policies ebay ca n't just enact any policy and get away with it if they take my money it seems like there is legal recourse you buy a product from me i ca n't enact any policy on the purchase you make i ca n't have fine print that says that you purchased this toy gun and so if it turns out to be a real gun and it kills your kid too bad maybe that is a bad analogy i 'm just saying websites are subject to reasonable questioning of their policies under the law or at least business institutions    i posted a 3 star review but the comment if they post it is very direct and negative without making any specific claims again we 'll see i guess they can reject that as well

private industry is not inherently more efficient it 's all about incentives   competition creates efficiency    bureaucracy reduces efficiency   a large poorly run company without real competition has no incentive to be efficient   give a large company a 30 year exclusive contract with no strings attached and they will almost certainly perform worse than the government   write the contract such that it has to renewed every 2 years and their pay is based on performance and maybe it will be more efficient   of course corrupt politicians do n't write contracts like that

the extent that you would have problems would depend on if the annuity is considered qualified or non qualified if the annuity is qualified that means that the money that was put into it has never been taxed and a rollover to an ira is simple   the possible issues here are tax issues and a cpa is likely the best person to answer this question   two other things to consider in such an event is the loss of any living benefit or death benefit variable annuities have been through quite the evolution in the last 15 years death benefits have been around longer than living benefits but both are usually based on some of a high water mark of the variable sub accounts you might want to ask the question how will my living or death benefits be affected if i roll this over

there is no simple way to calculate how much house any given person can afford in the answer keshlam gave several handy rules of thumb are mentioned that are used as common screening devices to reject loans but in every case further review is required to approve any loan   the 28 rule is the gold standard for estimating how much you can afford but it is only an estimate all the details that you do n't want to provide are required to give you anything better than an estimate in the spirit of joetaxpayer 's answer i 'm going to give you a number that you can multiply your gross income by for a good estimate but my estimate is based on a 15 year mortgage assuming a 15 year mortgage with a 3 interest rate it will cost $ per $ 100,000 borrowed so to take those numbers and wrap it up in a bow you can multiply your income by and have the amount of mortgage that most people can afford if you have a down payment saved add it to the number above for the total price of the home you can buy after closing costs are added in property taxes and insurance rates vary widely and those are often rolled into the mortgage payment to be paid from an escrow account banks may consider all of these factors in their calculators but they may not be transparent if you ca n't afford to pay it in 15 years you really ca n't afford it compare the same $ 100k loan in 30 years at 4 you pay about $ with a total of about $ in interest over the life of the loan in 15 years at 3 you pay about $ but the total interest is only $ 24k and you are out of the loan in half of the time the equity earned in the first 5 years is also different with for the 15 year loan vs. 9.5 on the 30 year loan   without too far into general economics 15 year loans would also have averted the mortgage crisis of 2008 because more people would have had enough equity that they would n't have walked out on their homes when there was a price correction

although this scheme is likely to get shut down rather quickly by either your broker or credit card company some points you seem to have missed out on properly timed you should be able to get days of grace period 30 day billing cycle + 25 day grace period assuming you pay everything off every month and charge immediately following the statement date   you will need to avoid certain card issuers that code all transactions with financial institutions as cash advances citibank in if it is possible it would be in your best interest to lower cash advance limits to 0 to avoid any chance of cash advance fees if your credit card attempts to process it as a cash advance the transaction will just be declined and you wo n't be out anything otherwise one cash advance fee will eat several months worth of profits as far as investments with guaranteed principal goes the only thing you can realistically do is money market accounts and maybe treasury notes anything else and the short term price fluctuation may leave you high and dry if this scheme were to work you would be much better off attempting to get rewards for the purchases than anything you could invest in if you used a 2 card and it every month you would be looking at a 24 return on credit card rewards even 1 rewards gives you a 12 annual return which is going to beat anything you could invest the money in

the point of title insurance is that when you buy a house it is possible that you may eventually find out that the seller did n't actually own the property either because they were trying to deceive you or some transfer of ownership in the past was n't carried out properly if that happens you can find yourself with no house and still owing the the purchase price hardly anybody can afford to take that kind of hit which is why you need some form of protection against it the traditional way of doing this was to get a lawyer to do a title search in which they check that everything in order however this costs tens of dollars at least to do the work for every sale and hardly ever finds anything title insurance is a company volunteering to take the hit for you if there turns out to be a problem in return for a payment of less than the title search would cost in essence they are saying that it 's cheaper to take the risk than do the work what are the statistics this report seems to indicate that payout is around 5 of premium but title insurance is a one off premium and the payout can theoretically happen many years down the line however it is almost certain that the insurance companies have done the math and believe that selling this insurance will be profitable for them so they believe that payouts are going to be substantially less than 100 is title insurance worth it for you if the payout is 5 of premiums the in a purely statistical sense it is not worth it you would on average gain more by not taking it however that is true of almost all insurance the policy is there to protect you in the unlikely but not impossible event where you would otherwise lose a huge amount of money unless you can afford to lose the value of your house you need some form of protection we 've already seen that the only other form of protection is a title search and they cost more the other issue is that if you are taking a mortgage your will absolutely insist that you have either a title search or title insurance there is no other way and title insurance is the cheaper of the two in this case it is best to look on the title insurance as simply a cost of doing business it 's irrelevant whether it 's worth it or not you ca n't do the transaction without it

i am not preparing for a sudden major catastrophic collapse in the us dollar i am however preparing for a significant but gradual erosion of its value through inflation over the space of several years to a decade to that end i 've invested most of my assets in the stock market roughly 80 through major world index funds and limited my bond exposure maintaining a small stake in commodity etfs gold silver platinum and palladium due to both inflation risk and the inevitability of rising interest rates i do n't think most companies mind if the dollar falls gradually as the bulk of their value is in their continuing income stream not in a dollar denominated bank account i also try to keep what i can in tax deferred accounts if after several years your stocks were up 100 but inflation reduced the dollar 's value by 50 you 're still stuck paying taxes on the entire gain even though it was meaningless i 'm also anticipating tax hikes at some point though not as a result of the dollar falling it helps that i 'm young and can stand a lot of investment risk

the assumption that bonds have been issued with a negative coupon is not correct or at least is has not occurred thus far   we 'll look at this future possibility in the final paragraph for now lets look at the current bond market the issuance of government bonds which carry a negative gross redemption yield is the result of governments issuing bonds at an issue price which exceed the nominal redemption price and any coupon yield receivable over the life of the bond   i can find no instances of bonds with a negative coupon though many have tiny positive coupon yields the short seller of a bond with a negative gross redemption yield will be liable to pay the buyer the interest amount determined by the coupon   if the short seller has borrowed the bonds in order to sell them then the short seller will receive the interest due from the lender to offset the interest paid to the buyer   if the short seller has not borrowed the bonds but has sold them using some sort of synthetic contract such as a contract for difference then the short seller will pay the coupon without receiving any offsetting payment i thought this was an interesting question and it will be interesting to see if at some time in the future governments do ever issue bonds with a negative coupon   to date this does not appear to have happened so what would happen if we assume that a government issues a bond with a negative coupon   the buyer of the bond would be required to pay the equivalent yield to the government according to the bond contract specification   if an investor sells short such a bond they would then become entitled to receive the interest from the buyer   if they have borrowed the bonds in order to sell them short then they would pay any interest received back to the lender this chain should eventually end with the ultimate owner lender paying the government their dues   if they have sold short using a synthetic contract then presumably they would keep the interest from themselves

say you have $ 15,000 of capital to invest you want to put the majority of your capital into low risk investments that will yield positive gains over the course of your working career   $ 5,000 government bonds and mutual funds split how you want   $ 9,500 low risk trusted companies with positive historical growth if the stock market is very unfamiliar for you i recommend google finance yahoo finance and 's to learn about smart investments you can make you can also research the investments that hedge fund managers and top investors are making google warren buffett or carl icahn portfolio and this will give you an idea of stocks you can put your money into do not leave your money into a certain company for more than 25 years rebalance your portfolio and take the gains when you feel you need them you have no idea when to take your profits now but 5 years from now you will be a smart and experienced investor a safe investment strategy to start is to put your money into an etf that the s&p 500 over the past 20 years the s&p 500 has yielded gains of about 270 during the financial crisis a few years back the s&p 500 had lost over 50 of its value when it reached its low point however from when it hit rock bottom in 2009 it has had as high percentage gains in six years as it did in 12 years from 1995 to 2007 which about 200 the market is very strong and will treat your money well if you invest wisely $ 500 medium high risk speculative stocks there is a reason this category accounts for only approximately 3 of your portfolio this may take some research on the weekend but the returns that may result can be extraordinary speculative companies are often innovative low priced stocks that see high volatility gains or losses of more than 10 over a single month the likelihood of your $ 500 investment being completely evaporated is very slim but if you lose $ 300 here the thousands invested in the s&p 500 low risk stocks government bonds and mutual funds will more than recuperate the losses   if your pick is a winner however expect that the $ 500 investment could easily double triple or gain even more in a single year or over the course of just a few perhaps 2 4 years will see a very large return i hope this advice helps and happy investing sending your money to smart investments is the key to financial security freedom and later a comfortable retirement good luck matt

if the stock market dropped next month providing you with a rare opportunity to buy stocks at a deep discount would n't you want to have some of your assets in investments other than stocks if you do n't otherwise have piles of new cash to throw into the market when it significantly tanks then having some of your portfolio invested elsewhere will enable you to back up the proverbial truck and load up on more stocks while they are on sale i 'm not advocating active market timing rather the way that long term investors capitalize on such opportunities is by choosing a portfolio asset allocation that includes some percentage of safer assets e.g. cash short term bonds etc permitting the investor to rebalance the portfolio periodically back to target allocations e.g. 80 stocks 20 bonds when rebalancing would have you buy stocks it 's usually because they are on sale similarly when rebalancing would have you sell stocks it 's usually because they are overpriced so do n't consider safer investments strictly as a way to reduce your risk rather they can give you the means to take advantage of market drops rather than just riding it out when you are already 100 invested in stocks i could say a lot more about diversification and risk reduction but there are plenty of other great questions on the site that you can look through instead

intrinsic value is a myth   there is no such thing   subjective human demand is the only thing that gives anything value   this subjectivity is different person to person and can change very quickly historically there are two main uses for gold jewelry and money   how can you tell when a particular type of money is undervalued   it disappears from circulation since people prefer to use money that is overvalued   this phenomenon is paraphrased in 's law bad money drives out good money the coinage act of established the us dollar as grains of silver or grains of gold   this established a government ratio of 15 ounces of silver to 1 ounce of gold   in the late 18th century there was a large production of silver from mexico and the market ratio of silver to gold increased to to 1 by   the government ratio however was still 15 to 1   this was enough incentive for people to exchange their silver coins for gold coins at the government ratio melt the gold and sell the gold bullion overseas at the market value   thus gold coins disappeared from circulation as people either hoarded the gold or sent it abroad   people used the overvalued silver coins i.e. the bad money domestically and gold coins disappeared from the market in an attempt to correct the problem of disappearing gold coins the coinage act of was enacted   it kept the us dollar at grains of silver but changed the definition to grains of gold which established a government ratio of 16 to 1   this was close to the market ratio of gold to silver at the time so both gold and silver coins appeared in circulation again   the gold rush of produced a lot of gold and the market ratio of silver to gold became to 1   now gold was overvalued so people began exchanging their gold coins for silver coins at the government ratio melt the silver and sell the silver bullion overseas at the market value   people used the overvalued gold coins i.e. the bad money domestically and silver coins disappeared from the market when you see gold circulating everywhere you will know it is overvalued compared to other types of money   paper money always drives gold out of circulation since the market ratio of paper to gold severely under values gold source here

the real question is what can you not do   if you track all your monetary actions you know everything about your monetary situation   that means you have the tools to ask and answer what if questions such as if i get a 10 raise could i take longer vacations   you could calculate how much you spend per day on vacation and then consider the amount of your raise and how much of it you 'd need to allocate to vacations to say be able to take a two week vacation instead of a one week vacation how much more would i have to earn to move to this nicer apartment   this may seem like a simple question but a surprising number of people ca n't answer it in a reliable way because they do n't have a clear understanding of how much money they make and how much of it they can afford to spend on housing   if you find you have lots of spare income maybe you can move to the nicer place right away if not at least you can get a sense of how much more money you 'd need to make it happen if i started taking the bus to work how much would i save   you can look at how much you spend on gas and compare that to the price of a bus pass   by separating out categories like gas repairs and car insurance you can also calculate different scenarios like if you still kept your car but only used it for occasional trips versus if you sold the car and used only public transportation if i want to take a trip to what can i cut back on to save the money   using your table you can pencil out scenarios like suppose i stop eating out for lunch at work and just bring my lunch how long would i have to do that to save enough to pay for a plane ticket these are just a few random examples   the general idea is that with a record of hard numbers you can start to consider potential tradeoffs in an objective way that is you can ask how much in category x would i have to give up to gain this thing i want in category y the real trick in making use of your data is not so much what you can do but how exactly to do it   you may have to become more of a spreadsheet wizard to really delve into these questions   also if you have programming expertise you can even use something like python to do calculations that might be in a spreadsheet

instead of going to the dealership and not knowing if you will be able to get a loan or what the interest rate might be go to a local credit union or bank first before you go car shopping and talk to them about what you would need for your loan   if you can get approval for a loan first then you will know how much you can spend and when it comes time for negotiation with the dealer he wo n't be able to confuse you by changing the loan terms during the process   as far as the dealer is concerned it would be a cash transaction that having been said i ca n't recommend taking a car loan   i of course do n't know you or your situation but there are lots of good reasons for buying a less expensive car and doing what you can to pay cash for it   should you choose to go ahead with the loan i would suggest that you get the shortest loan length that you can afford and aim to pay it off early

it depends on many factors but generally the bid ask spread will give you an idea there are typically two ways to buy or sell a security with a limit order you would place a buy for 100 shares at $ then it 's easy in the worst case you will get your 100 shares at $ 30 each exactly you may get lucky and have the price fall then you will pay less than $ 30 of course if the price immediately goes up to say $ 35 nobody will sell at the $ 30 you want so your broker will happily sit on his hands and rake in the commission while waiting on what is now a hail mary ask with a market order you have the problem you mention the ticker says $ 30 but say after you buy the first 5 shares at $ 30 the price shoots up and the rest are $ 32 each you have now paid on average $ per share this could happen because there is a limit order for 5 at $ 30 and 200 at $ 32 you would have filled only part of that 200 you would be able to see these in the order book sometimes shown as bid ask spread or market depth however the order book is not law just because there 's an ask for 10k shares at $ 35 each for your $ 30 x stock does n't mean that by the time the price comes up to $ 35 the offer will still be up the guy or algorithm who put it up may see the price going up and decide he now wants $ 40 each for his 10k shares also people are n't obligated to put in their order maybe there 's a trader who intends to trade a large volume when the price hits a certain level like a limit order but he elected to not put in a limit order and instead watch the ticker and react in real time then you will see a huge order suddenly come in out of nowhere so while the order book is informative what you are asking is actually fundamentally impossible to know fully unless you can read the minds of every interested trader as others said in normal securities meaning traded at a major exchange especially those in the s&p500 you simply ca n't move the price the market is too deep you would need millions of dollars to budge the price and if you had that much money you would n't be asking here on a qa site you would have a professional financial advisor or even a team that specializes in distributing your large transaction over a longer time to minimize the effect on the market with stocks such as otc and especially worthless penny stocks with market caps of $ 1 mil or less what you say is a real problem you can end up paying multiples of the last ticker if not careful and you do have to be careful about it which is why you should n't trade penny stocks unless you know what you 're doing and if you 're asking this question here you do n't

the simple answer is technically bonds do n't have earnings hence no p e. what i think the op is really asking how do i compare stock and bond etfs some mature stocks exhibit very similar characteristics to bonds so at the margin if you are considering investing between 2 such investments that provide stable income in the form of dividends you might want to use the dividend price ratio d p of the stock and compare it to the dividend yield of the bond if you go down to the basics both the bond and the stock can be considered   the present value of all future expected cashflows the cash that accrues to the owner of the stock is future dividends and for the bond is the coupon payments if a company were to pay out 100 of its earnings then the dividend yield d p would be conveniently e p. for a company with p e of 20 that paid out it 's entire earnings one would expect d p = 1/20 = 5 this serves as a decent yard stick in the short term ~ 1 year to compare mature stock etfs with stable prospects vs bond funds since the former will have very little expected price growth think utilities hence they both compete on the cashflows they throw off to the investor this comparison stops being useful for stock etfs with higher growth prospects since expected future cashflows are much more volatile this comparison is also not valid in the long term since bond etfs are highly sensitive to the yield curve interest rate risk and they can move substantially from where they are now

a 15 discount is a 17.6 return 100/85 = for a holding period that 's an average 15.5 days a half month it would be silly to compound this over a year as the numbers are limited   the safest way to do this is to sell the day you are permitted in effect you are betting 12 times a year that the stock wo n't drop 15 in 3 days you can pull data going back decades or as long as your company has been public and run a spreadsheet to see how many times if at all the stock has seen this kind of volatility over 3 day periods even for volatile stocks a 15 move is pretty large you 're likely to find your stock doing this less than once per year it 's also safest to not accumulate too many shares of your company for multiple reasons having to do with risk spreading diversification etc   2 additional points   the brexit just caused the s&p to drop 4 over the last 3 days trading this was a major world event but on average we are down 4 one would have to be very unlucky to have their stock drop 15 over the specific 3 days we are discussing   the dollars at risk are minimal say you make $ 120k yr $ 10k month 15 of this is $ 1500 and you are buying $ worth of stock the gains on average are expected to be $ does n't seem like too much but it 's $ over a years time $ in profit for a maximum $ 1500 at risk at any month 's cycle

one of the things i have enjoyed about consulting is the exposure to multiple companies and multiple business units within those companies in the year i have been at the group i have already worked with multiple clients on projects that span across the respective organizations it has been very interesting to contrast the clients and more specifically the corporate cultures that exist within those companies   i have participated in and watched various projects being driven in different parts of a client 's business and it is interesting to see which projects have been are and will be successful the other day i was reading a report of some analysis done by one of the world 's largest and most respected consulting firms the analysis was essentially outlining a path for success for a broad spectrum of projects of varied and complexities the analysis which was very good by the way touched on a lot of elements of the business that would impact the likelihood of project success elements like governance data analysis process design etc the analysis and the accompanying recommendations were undoubtedly sound given the caliber of the firm the background research done to support the report and my own confirmation based on what i have picked up about the client i try and get my hands on these types of reports whenever possible to see how the big boys are doing it to shape my own thinking and to have examples of successful presentations i am however always surprised that these reports fail to mention what i consider to be a very big influence on the success of a project and ultimately the success of the organization as a whole   at their core companies are merely people a group of people with a collective identity a corporate culture if you will reflecting back on my many interactions with the people that make up these organizations it has become very evident to me that a collaborative corporate culture is a huge in determining the success of any project although it is a macro factor the collaborative spirit of an organization everything that the company does and/or attempts to do   here is an example to give context of the premise i am talking about   at client a the project team i worked with was designing an extremely innovative complex and challenging system that has the potential to alter the way they do business without going into too much detail it was a massive undertaking with relatively limited   at client b the scope of work i was involved in was relatively straightforward and mirrored business practices at other organizations the bulk of the effort on my part was driving the creation and adoption of a framework to promote cross functional interaction amongst project teams a very realistic undertaking with appropriate   below are that illustrate typical exchanges in both organizations in both organizations i have been directed to connect with a particular individual or group of individuals as it was thought that our respective works may be related in some fashion   client a me let me give you a brief overview of the project i am working on john doe recommended i connect with you as your project may with mine in some manner we may be able to help each other continue with my overview   other party wow this is great i actually have really in depth knowledge of x and would love to get involved in the work you are doing i am actually simultaneously driving y effort and it would be great if we were aligned at a high level we are both supporting strategy a so connecting now would really set us up for success feel free to include me on your future meetings and i will pass along our high level overview also have you thought about connecting with so and so they are working in the z space on a project and it may help to drive your project forward as well   client b me let me give you a brief overview of the project i am working on john doe recommended i connect with you as your project may    other party well we have already gotten our project approved at such and such level and we have found that we really do n't have any with your project   me oh ok well i am not really looking to create additional work for anyone i am just looking to leverage the work we are both already doing we may be able to help each other    other party again our project team is really busy and we are on a tight deadline we do n't have the resources we need i have told john doe time and again we need more help but until we get it i just really need to focus on x.   me ok well how about i jump in to what it is we are actually doing and if there are n't any opportunities for collaboration or any synergies to be gained from working together that is fine i just wanted to be proactive about connecting the dots across the organization continue with my overview   other party meeting concludes   these are n't of a single event they are of month 's of interactions that give a good representation of single events in a variety of contexts on a daily basis of course there are exceptions however i have found that exceptions within both cultures are extremely rare based on my personal experience this only my point can you begin to see why a collaborative corporate culture is so foundational to the success of any endeavor regardless of scope complexity etc   the other aspect that adds to the importance of a sound corporate culture is the self fulfilling nature of culture which organization do you think future collaborative behavior even those people that want to collaborate within client b are consistently met with resistance those in client a are inspired by the positive interactions enhanced results and they are more likely to actively seek out others to help and work with both are accelerated in opposite directions just by the nature of the prevailing culture   so how do you create and a culture that collaboration that my friends is a question i do n't pretend to have all the answers too maybe i 'll be so lucky to figure that one out someday

time for a lawyer essentially regardless of the situation it 's not right for him to be paying the mortgage and only get half the value out of the equity in the house all other things aside no court i can think of would allow that the could happens are many but the most common include keep in mind that if he keeps paying the mortgage enough most courts will end up giving him ownership outright essentially they will say he has already bought her out by paying her half of the debt   unfortunately any way he goes he is going to need to take action when there is a missed mortgage payment a bad tax year or some other legal issue some one is injured on the property the last thing he is going to want is for the courts to decide the issue for him for example john breaks an arm while climbing a tree on the property line john takes the owners of the property to court he says but my sister owns half and the courts decide then and there that because he 's been paying the mortgage alone he owns the house alone seems like a win except now he owns the liability alone and owns john $ 1,000,000 for a silly lawsuit alone   point is this ownership of property comes with risks and responsibilities he really needs to get those risks and responsibilities under control so he can mitigate them or he could end up in a very nasty situation in the years to come

do n't forget inflation    with a roth 401k or ira you do n't pay any taxes on inflationary or real gains   you pay taxes at the beginning and then no more taxes unless you invest money after you distributed from it    with a regular taxable investment account not a 401k or ira you pay taxes on the initial amount   and then you pay taxes on the gains both inflationary and real   so you effectively pay taxes on the inflated principal twice   once at initial earning and once when it shows up as inflationary gains   i 'll give an example later    with a traditional 401k or ira you pay no taxes on the initial amount   you pay taxes on the distributed amount   that includes taxes on gains but it only taxes them once not twice   all the taxes are paid at distribution time    here 's a example   this is not a real example with real numbers but the numbers should n't be ridiculously off   they could happen   i 'm going to ignore variation and pretend that all the numbers will be the same each year so as to simplify the math    so you pay a 25 marginal tax rate and want to invest $ 12,000 plus any tax savings    roth   $ 12,000 principal traditional ira trad   $ 16,000 principal with $ 4000 in tax savings taxable investment account tia   $ 12,000 principal let 's assume that you make an 8 rate of return and inflation is 3   both numbers are possible although higher and lower numbers have occurred in the past   that gives you returns of $ for the roth and tia cases and a return of $ for the trad case   pay no annual taxes on the roth or trad cases   pay 25 marginal tax on the tia case that 's $ 240    balances after one year    roth   $ trad   $ tia   $ inflation decreases the value of the roth and tia cases by $ 360 in the roth and tia cases   and by $ 480 in the trad case    ten years of inflationary gains cumulative    roth   $ trad   $ tia   $ net buildup including inflationary gains roth   $ trad   $ tia   $ real value minus inflation to maintain spending power    roth   $ trad   $ tia   $ now take out $ 3000 per year after taxes   that 's $ 3000 in the the roth and tia cases as you already paid the taxes   in the trad case that 's $ 4000 because you have to pay 25 tax which will cost $ 1000    do that for five years and the new balances are   roth   $ trad   $ tia   $ the tia will run out in the 8th year   the roth and trad will both run out in the 9th year    so to summarize   the traditional ira initially grows the most   the tia grows the least   the tia is tax advantaged over the traditional ira at that point but it still runs out first   the roth ira grows about the same as the traditional after taxes are included    note that i left out the matching contribution from a 401k   that would help both those options   i assumed that the marginal tax rate would be 25 on the traditional ira distributions   it might be only 15 which would increase the advantage of the traditional ira   i assumed that the 15 rate on capital returns would still be true for the entire period   if that is increased the tia option gets a lot worse    inflation could be higher or lower   as stated earlier the tia account is hit the worst by inflation

wow very by some of the answers i will comment on those later to directly answer your question here is a link to a brochure that explains the three basic and is written in straightforward language link text that is step one step 2 is a question cheapest when initially or for long term without a doubt term initially is the cheapest however every 10 years or 20 years it increases in price as the name term implies it is temporary coverage will end at some point 75 or 80 depending upon plan design chosen it is possible that if you choose term you can outlive your coverage and all you have are a bunch of cancelled cheques young people with a mortgage children and other debts should buy a lot of term as the mortgage will be paid off the kids will no longer be dependent these needs are temporary however some needs are permanent what about leaving a legacy at death to a charity insurance is a good solution and can provide a tax deduction too term is n't a good fit or a business owner wishing to transfer his her business at death to their children taxes will be due and permanent insurance such as whole life and universal life can be arranged to provide cash to pay tax whenever this happens   let me ask you who received 10 in the last ten years on their equity portfolio almost zero people did however a whole plan would have generated a guaranteed return of 3.0 plus a non guaranteed return via dividends that the combined internal rate of return   on a combined basis would be about 5.6 after taxes life a bond portfolio yield internal rate of return is dependent on age at buying years of investing all insurance software can show you the internal rate of return irr is what is the return after tax that you must get to equal the equity or death benefit from a permanent insurance plan someone mentioned by term and invest the difference that is what universal life is term and invest the difference except the difference is growing tax sheltered outside investments with comparable risk are taxable there is no easy answer for what type is right often a combination is the key question you should ask is how much is enough then consider types based upon your needs and budget here is a link where you can calculate how much you need i hope this helps a bit

i 've been thinking about this   here 's what i came up with   please let me know what you think     1 the whole world is on a fiat money system   the central banks were all easing together in a coordinated way   so currencies remain relatively stable relative to each other also the price of goods is n't rising nearly as quickly as the money supply is being expanded because    2 the growth of the internet globalization are deflationary because skilled people in poor countries have access to the global marketplace and are willing to produce far more per dollar than rich country citizens   3 the growth of inequality is deflationary   as wealth concentrates at the top there are fewer and fewer customers who can afford the products services that are being mass produced   so there 's a mismatch between high supply and low demand   4 a poor slow economy low spending debt defaults and business personal bankruptcy is deflationary   we treat credit as money and when debt is wiped out so is the credit that we were accounting for in the money supply   5 the money created over the last 10 years or so has n't had a chance to trickle down yet it 's still tied up in financial market instruments stocks bonds etfs etc held by mostly institutional investors until the next big bubble bursts    so there are many deflationary forces to balance out against the money creation

pretty simple when is cash value life insurance a good or bad idea it is never a good idea how can life insurance possibly work as investment it ca n't   just as car home or health insurance is not an investment   note for counter example providers   intent to commit insurance fraud is not an investment why not live your life so in 15 or 20 years you are debt free have a nice emergency fund built and have a few 100 thousand in investments   then you can self insure   if you die with a paid off home no debt 20 k in a money market and in retirement accounts would your spouse and children be taken care of

gt they 're so inexpensive to make   oh no argument here they 're a stop gap measure to prevent from the network pov cash   i just think the networks are being short sighted and responding far far too early in a show 's life   it 's not unlike stock investing trying to respond to every twitch of the viewing polls   the most watched episode in tv history of mash was of a show that was n't very popular to begin with in fact it went 2 or 3 years before it started clearly leading the shows in it 's time slots   coincidentally that 's about the time they gave up the pure pink style and went for the moral high ground

i disagree with the selected answer there 's no one rule of thumb and certainly not simple ones like 20 cents of every dollar if you 're 35 you 've made a good start by making a budget of your expected expenses if you read the mr. money mustache titled the shockingly   simple math behind early retirement you will understand that it is usually a mistake to think of your expenses as a fixed percentage of your income in most cases it makes more sense to keep your expenses as low as possible regardless of your actual income   in the financial independence community it is a common principle that one typically needs 25 30 times one 's annual spending to have enough money to sustain oneself forever off the investment returns that those savings generate this is based on the assumption of a 7 average annual return 4 after inflation so the real answer to your question is this update brought to my attention that this formula does n't work that well when the savings rates are low 20 range this is because it assumes that money you save earns no returns for the entire period that you are saving this is obviously not true investment returns should also count toward your annual spending goal for that reason it 's probably better to refer to the blog post that i linked to in the answer above for precise calculations that 's where i got the 37 years at 20 savings rate figure from depending on how large and small x and y are you could have enough saved up to retire in 7 years at a 75 savings rate 17 years at a 50 savings rate or 37 years at the suggested 20 savings rate for olds as you go through life your expenses may increase eg starting a family starting a new business unexpected health event etc or decrease kid wins full scholarship to college so could your income however in general you should negotiate the highest salary possible if you are salaried use the 25x rule and consider your life and career goals to decide how much you want to save and stop thinking of expenses as a percentage of income

and i 'm reading through the pack of stuff   there should be a soft copy of terms and conditions if so please put up a link generally 0 apr comes with some strings attached the literature on the bank of america site shows 0 apr only for balance transfers done with 60 days   on one of the comparison sites the bank of america card shows 0 only for balance transfers and purchases done in first 60 days 0 introductory apr for 12 billing cycles for purchases and for any balance transfers made in the first 60 days then variable apr 3 fee min $ 10 applies to balance transfers which means that if you spend say $ 200 in first 2 months you can repay this $ 200 in next 12 months at 0 apr however if you spend another $ 100 in 3 month this should be paid in full along with a portion of $ 200 else interest would start for all of $ 300 generally 0 apr do n't make sense as there are lots of hidden terms and conditions and the real benefit may not be that great   edits the literature looks quite confusing on the main page it says introductory apr    0 for 12 billing cycles    applies to purchases and to any balance transfers made within 60 days of opening your account this would mean say you do a balance transfer within 60 days of 120 and say you make purchases with 60 days of 120 total liability is 240   scenario 1 assume you do not use this card then you can safely keep making payments of 20 per month for next one year scenario 2 in 3rd month you swipe for 100 more now the total due will be 100 + 20 if you make the payment of 120 then fine if you make a payment of only say 50 then the interest will be calculated for 240 40 payments for 2 of current month i.e. on 250 however the detailed terms of conditions seem to limit this only to balance transfer of 120 in first 60 days and not to any purchases in first 60 days with terms so vague my suggestion do n't get this card for these benefits get this if you need a regular card

not absurd at all without social media you and i and many many many more others would have never known about the as quickly as we did   without social media there would n't have been conversation and understanding about what was happening   twitter and facebook were monumental in spreading awareness of what was is happening as a result of the arab spring

just take it to a bank that will count it and give you cash or put it in your account   do n't bother counting it and rolling it   they will just break the rolls and throw it into a change counting machine   i did that once and never will again after i saw that years ago   the local bank i used for this offered it as a free service you could also use those coinstar machines found in many grocery stores and various outlets but they take like 8 or 9   unless time hassle is of concern why do that when there are possible free options

i think microsoft is far from being the next ibm keep in mind mobile hardware is n't for everyone even amazon abandoned it   microsoft has done a great job with their cloud platforms the microsoft office suite to compete with google 's their entire surface line of laptops and tablets purchasing linkedin etc   i would say they are making the right and relevant moves to not only stay relevant but shake up the status quo that they were living in for a long time

the language in the starbucks accounts is highly ambiguous but starbucks has no treasury shares which helps work out what is going on   where it says respectively it is referring to the years 2014 and 2013 rather than issued and even though it does n't read that way not easy to work out the figures are   authorised 1200 2014 issued 2014 outstanding 2013 issued 2013 outstanding

i expect the company wanted to pay you for a product on a purchase order rather than as   a contract laborer whatever would they be willing to re issue the check to you as a sole proprietor of a business named abc consulting or anything like that you can register your sole proprietor business with the state using a doing business as dba or fictitious name and then open the bank account for your business using the check provided by the customer as the first deposit there is likely a smaller registration fee for the dba if they wo n't re issue the check and you have to go the llc route up $ 125 doing odd jobs or borrowing from a friend or parents seriously anyone can earn that amount of money in a week or two besides the filing fee for the llc your bank may require you to provide an operating agreement which is not required by the state the operating agreement can be simple or more complex if you have a partner even if it 's a spouse if you do have a partner it is essential to have such an agreement because it would specify the responsibilities and benefits allocated to each partner particularly in the event of equity distributions taking money out of the business or liquidating and ending the llc there are websites that will provide you a boilerplate form for operating agreements but if your business is anything more than just single member llc you should pay an attorney to draw one up for you so the wording is right it 's a safeguard against potential future lawsuits and while we 're at it do n't forget to obtain a ein equivalent to a ssn from the irs for your llc there 's no cost but you 'll have to have it to file taxes as a business for every year the llc exists and has income good luck

it does n't make a lot of sense to buy a house condo and rent it out now on the other hand i think finishing your basement and then renting it out is an excellent idea   the ror is excellent as long as you can deal with the strangers in the basement have the extra driveway space and negative association with renting out your basement hth

could you perhaps expand on your reasoning behind wanting to take a loan in the first place why would you even consider taking a loan for as much as ¬£ 7,500 or even much less if you are n't planning on buying investing in anything in particular and you 're not in a bad financial situation if your account never drops below a hundred or two pounds why would you need to loan money just get yourself a credit card for those times when you might find yourself without money for a short while but really it sounds to me like you should be able to set aside a small sum of money every month and create your own savings buffer to cover these situations

's the real scoop i would hire more people and buy more inventory and put more into capital investment if i paid less taxes   you would do so if there was money to be made doing so    it 's as simple as that    corporate taxes are on net income     if hiring one more person contributed further to your bottom line you 'd do so     that is the only thing that drives you    if the incremental cost of the hire is lower than the increased revenue    period   corporate taxes are on net income    meaning you 're still going to get more money you 're just going to get a little less of that incremental income growth than you thought     you 'll still hire
