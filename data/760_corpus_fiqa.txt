while ianal tax or otherwise i have always found that keeping original receipts is the only way to go while anything can at some level be forged or faked a photo is one more step removed from the original   a mere listing on a web site is n't much proof of anything keep your originals for a suggested seven years while the irs is trying to audit much faster than that and any of fraud can be investigated at any time you should be well and clear with originals kept that long

10 to 20 return on investment annually when i hear that an investment has a return on it i avoid it because in my opinion and based on my experience 10 annually is not an i start to ask questions only if one talks about return of 30 annually or more these kind of returns are possible but very rare   what sort of things do we need to look out for with alternative investment first the quality of the website and the documentation provided then the resume of the founders who are those guys i check their linkedin profile if they have none i am out a linkedin profile is a minimum if you manage an investment company i also look for diversification and this is the case with yieldstreet how do we assess the risks associated with alternative investments i would never put more than 10 of my capital in any investment alternative ones included i also try to find financial information on the promoter itself in yieldstreet case check the legal advisor i remember an international fraud case i analyse the promoter i investigated had seven small trust involved in british virgin islands in panama in in portugal in the united states and canada plus a banking account in switzerland and the biggest shareholding company in the isle of man no need to talk about what happened after the investors were all non residents in the involved and no legal recourse were possible they lost everything these promoters regularly change to avoid detection as far as yieldstreet is concerned what i read and checked seems interesting thanks for your question i will check it out myself more i am also a very cautious investor to evaluate alternative investments is difficult but no need to be afraid or to avoid them we are accredited investors after all

most 0 interest loans have quite high interest rates that are deferred if you are late on a payment you are hit with all the deferred interest they 're banking on a percentage of customers missing a payment   also this is popular in furniture car sales because it 's a way to get people to buy who otherwise would n't they made money on the item sale so the loan does n't have to earn them money even though some will traditional banks lenders do make money from interest and rely on that they would have to rely on fees if interest were not permitted

there are obviously lots of complexities here and there are rules against price or market manipulation that are somewhat due to the rules inclusion of the 's intent but generally speaking you can publicly promote the value of a company whose stock you own provided that you now if you the value of a company publicly and sell it immediately thereafter pump and dump the regulators might suggest that your actions imply that you did n't believe it was so wonderful and were misleading the public to move the price      that said a fair might be that you loved it for all the reasons you said at lower price but thought it had run its course once it got to higher price    again if it can be demonstrated that your reason for praising it was to push the price higher your intent may land you in hot water this is n't legal advice or a full analysis but if essentially declared his honest reasons for loving a stock in which he is invested and discloses that investment letting others know he is biased he 's probably ok especially if he intends to hold it long term

it 's about how volatile the instrument is brokers are concerned not about you but about potential lawsuits from their perceived inadequate risk management letting you trade extremely volatile stocks with high leverage   on top of that they run the risk of losing money in scenarios where a trader shorts a stock with all of the funds the company rises 100 or more by the next day in which case the trader owes money to the broker if you look in detail you 'll see that many of the companies with high margin requirements are extremely volatile pharmaceutical companies which depend heavily of fda approvals

it is possible to pay down debt including interest without issuing new debt money to pay for it i think this is the heart of your question let me present a highly contrived example in which society has four people and one bank here is a bank with $ 100 in initial deposits total money supply in this society is $ 100 we assume there is no currency circulating since you 're interested in debt money this bank lends out $ 90 to bob at 1 year maturity and 10 apr bob spends this $ 90 with charlie to buy raw materials charlie deposits $ 90 in the bank the money supply just grew from $ 100 to $ 190 bob does something with the raw materials and adds some kind of value eventually selling the finished goods for $ 110 in our little silly economy the only people who have money are adam and charlie so we must assume that between the two of them they buy $ 110 worth of goods from bob let 's say adam buys $ 60 and charlie buys $ 50 the actual amounts do n't matter bob deposits this money at the bank still $ 190 of money supply at the end of 1 year bob instructs the bank to transfer payment from his deposit account to his loan account the bank wipes clean his debt and the money remaining in bob 's account represents his return who is this david guy he 's the owner of the bank he $ 9 in interest from the loan to bob and he pays $ 5 to adam as interest on adam 's deposit the remaining $ 4 is the profit to the bank 's owner money supply decreased from $ 190 to $ 100 after bob pays off his loan i realized after writing this the one thing i left out is where does adam get $ 100 to start with presumably adam starts off with some kind of currency either fiat money or commodity money iow debt money ca n't be created out of nothing it has to be expanded on top of some kind of currency

since i have 10k in my account after down payment will i get a    good interest rate on the loan when the bank considers your loan they will see $ regardless they will want to see certain amount of savings that would allow you to continue paying your loan in case of an emergency and $ 10 k might not be enough i was planning to put down 15 but i have been told that i should buy    something called pmi to satisfy the rest 5 and if i take that my    interest will be more and sometimes bank will not go for anybody who    pays less than 20 is that true yes after downpayment + closing costs how much money in the savings    accounts is the bank looking for to say that i am a good buyer depends on the bank my wild guess would be they 're looking for several months worth of loan payments you should have ~6 months worth of savings for emergencies regardless of loans

the biggest concern is how you get $ 250,000 in unsecured credit it 's unlikely that you will be loaned that amount at a percentage lower than what you expect to earn unsecured credit lines are rarely lower than 10 and usually approach 20 on top of that for a bank to approve you for that credit line you have to have a high credit score and an income to support the payments on that credit line but lets suspend disbelief and assume that you can get the money you want on loan you would then be expected to pay back that 10 but investments do n't go up uniformly some years they go up 15 20 and other years they go down 10 what do you do if you have to sell some of your investments in a down year that money is no longer invested and you ca n't recover it with the following up year because you had to take too much out to cover the loan payments you 'll be out of money long before the loan is repaid because you can expect there will be bad years in the stock market that will eat away at your investment there were a lot of people who took their money out of the market after the crash of 2008 if they had left their money in through 2009 they would have made all that money back but if you have a loan to pay you have to pull money out in the bad years as well as the good years unless you have a lucky streak of all good years you 're doomed

you 're certainly referring to ex post facto laws and while the us is prohibited from passing criminal laws that are retroactive the us supreme court has upheld many tax laws that apply tax code changes retroactively you might ask a similar question on law se for a more thorough treatment of the legalities of congress passing those laws but i will stick to the personal finance portion of the question what this means is that you ca n't expect that the current tax laws will be in force in the future and your investment retirement plans should be as flexible as possible you may wish to have some money in both roth and traditional 401(k accounts you might not want to have millions of dollars in roth accounts because if congress does act to limit the tax benefits of those accounts it will probably be targeting the larger balances if you are valuing tax deductions you should put slightly more weight on deductions that you can take today than deductions that would apply in the future if you do find yourself in trouble because of a retroactive change be sure to consult a tax lawyer that specializes in dealing with the irs to possibly negotiate a settlement for a lower amount than the full tax bill that results from the changes

from what i 've heard in the past debt can be differentiated between secured debt and unsecured debt    secured debt is a debt for which something stands good such as a mortgage on your house   you have a debt but that debt is covered by the value of an asset and if you needed to free yourself of the debt then you could by selling that asset    this is what is known as good debt    unsecured debt is debt that is incurred where the only thing that is available to pay it back is your income   an example of this is credit card debt where you purchase something that could n't be sold again to pay off the debt    this is know as bad debt you have to be careful about thinking that house debt is always good debt because the house stands good for it though   the problem with that is that the house could go down in value and then suddenly your good debt is bad debt or no longer secured   cars are very risky this way because they go down in value   it is really easy to get a car loan where before long you are upside down     this is the problem with the term good debt the label makes it sound like it is a good idea to have that debt and the risk associated with having the debt is and allows yourself to feel good about your financial plan   perhaps this is why so many houses are in foreclosure right now people believed the good debt myth and thought that it was ok to borrow more than the home was worth to get into a house   thus they turned a secured debt into an unsecured debt and put their residence at risk by levels of debt they could n't afford other advice i 've heard and tend to agree with is that you should only borrow for a house an education and maybe a car danger on that last one being careful to buy a modest house car etc that is well within your means to repay    so if you do have to borrow for a car go for basic transportation instead of the $ 40,000 bmw   keep you house payment less than of your take home pay pay off the school loans as quickly as possible regardless of the label good bad unsecured secured i think that less debt is better than more debt    there is definitely such a thing as too much good debt

can you deduct interest paid to your father on your personal income taxes interest paid on passive investments can be deducted from the amount earned by that investment as an investment expense as long as the amount earned is greater than the total paid for the interest expense also beware if the amount of interest paid is greater than the yearly gift tax exclusion as the irs might interpret this as a creative way of giving gifts to your father without paying gift tax do you pay taxes on the interest you pay   no because is an expense not income you would not count interest paid to him as taxable income does your father owe taxes on the interest he collects from you yes that is income to him and the last question you did n't ask but i expect it is implied do you owe taxes on the quarterly profits yes that is income to you    the forbes article how to arrange a loan between family members is a bit dated but still a good source of information you really should write a formal note signed by both you and your father indicating the amount borrowed the interest rate you are paying on that amount and when the loan will be repaid if your father has set the interest rate too low this could also be considered a gift to you though we would really be talking about large amounts of money to hit the gift tax limit on interest alone

you are forgetting one crucial point regarding the money supply   the us federal reserve increases the money supply meaning some of the money is not really loaned it just appears out of nowhere   at first glance this seems even worse over the short term the fed changes the money supply to help the economy in whatever way it sees fit   but over the long term the money supply increases to reflect economic growth   as new technology is introduced more can be accomplished with the same labor and resources and thus the money supply needs to be increased   money is really just a convenient replacement for the barter system so if there are more things to barter for goods and services then there should also be more things to barter with money also keep in mind inflation   the cost of goods and services goes up over time due to the inflation of currency and so the money supply must also be increased so that those goods and services do not artificially increase in value which would be very bad

yeah i mean it 's natural economics that jobs go to low wage countries so i guess i ca n't be mad at that but in addition there 's also a shift in debt from what was usually mortgages to student loan debt it 's not good because you 're no longer paying yourself as you did with a mortgage so money just gets burned you ca n't shed that debt ever    people frame it like a bubble but it 's more like a long term hamper on consumer spending imo if the fed wants to help the economy this would be the most effective bailout for lifting long term growth i do n't have any student debt and i still think this is probably one of the better answers

the price the provider charges you is the amount he would like to get for his services let 's take an example you do a blood test at a lab and they charge you $ if you have insurance and the provider has a contract with that insurance meaning they take them the contract limits what they can charge and what the will get for the example that might be this is what the insurance pays them or what you pay them if you have deductible note that if you have no insurance you owe them they are typically willing to negotiate that you only pay maybe $ but it still will be much higher than the insurance price why the reason is that the insurance agreed payment of $ does not cover their cost but the insurance forces them to make that contract or basically be out of business let 's say for example they need $ to make a living on it so they lose 5.00 $ on every insured customer one in 235 customers has no insurance and his price is calculated as + 235 5.00 = $ so his bill covers the losses for all insured under payers all numbers are examples made up to illustrate the math the provider does my typically comes between 800 and 1400 and gets reduced to around 20 so the numbers are not completely off the ratio and concept works for doctors and hospitals the same just not as significant a difference

there are too many nuances to the question asked to explore fully but here are a few points to keep in mind if you are a cash basis taxpayer most individuals are then you are not required to pay taxes on the money that has been billed but not received as yet   if you operate on an accrual basis then the income accrues to you the day you perform the service and not on the day you bill the client you can make four equal payments of estimated tax on the due dates and if these together with any income tax withholding from wage paying jobs are at least 90 of your tax liability for that year then you owe no penalties for underpayment of tax regardless of how your income varied over the year if your income does vary considerably over the year even for people who only have wages but who invest in mutual funds the income can   vary quite a bit since mutual funds typically declare dividends and capital gains in december then you can pay different amounts in each quarterly installment of estimated tax this is called the method a part of form 2210 that is best avoided unless you really need to use it   your annualized income for the payment due on june 15 is 2.4 = times your taxable income through may 31 thus on form 2210 you are allowed to assume that your average monthly taxable income   through may 31 will continue for the rest of the year you then compute the tax due on that annualized income and you are supposed to have paid at least 45 of that amount by june 15 similarly for september 15 for which you look at income through august 31 you use a multiplier of 1.5 = and need to pay of the tax on the annualized income and so on   if you these numbers and pay too little tax in any installment then you owe penalties for that quarter   most people find that the tax due for the entire year and paying it in equal installments is simpler than keeping track of nuances of the annualized method even simpler is to pay 100 of last year 's tax in four equal installments 110 for high earners and then no penalty is due at all if your business is really taking off and your income is going to be substantially higher in one year then this of last year 's tax deal could allow you to postpone a significant chunk of your tax bill till april 15

this is very interesting and i am fully in support of the us moving to a single payer system such as we have here in the uk but i am a little confused us costs are markedly higher than the second most expensive country that 's clear however by my reading of the data presented it seems as though no distinction is made between the government paying for health care and the individual paying for health care much of that 1.4 t is coming out of the individual 's pocket rather than the insurance company 's and that for me is the crux of the whole issue

joetaxpayer 's answer is dead on but let me give my own two cents with a little bit of math otherwise i personally find that people talking about diversified portfolios tends to be full of buzzwords   let 's say that buffett 's investments are $ 10 million he would like to earn this year or $ 700,000   he can invest that money in coca which might return or he can invest in genius moves that will make headlines like buying huge stakes in goldman sachs which might return and he makes plays for the long haul based on the expected value of the investments so if he splits it 50/50 $ 5 $ 5 million then his expected value is by diversifying he does reduce the expected value of the portfolio he is not giving $ 10 m the chance to turn into $ 1.5 million or $ 2 million for him the expected value of that shock and portfolio with all $ 10 million invested in it is $ by taking less risk for less reward his expected return is lower but his risk is lower too   scale this example back up into the $ 100 million or billion range that buffett invests in and that extra margin makes the difference   in the context of your original article the lower risk cake and underwear investments let buffett go big on the things that will make 20%+ returns on billions of dollars without completely destroying his investment capital when things take a turn for the worse

equity does not represent production divisions in a company i.e. chocolate strawberry and vanilla does not make sense   in sole proprietorship equity represents 1 owner   in partnership equity has at least two sub accounts namely partner 1 and partner 2   in corporations equity may have common stockholders and preferred stockholders or even different class of shares for insiders and angel investors   as you can see equity represents who owns the company it is not what the company does or manufactures   first and foremost define the boundary of the firm are your books titled the books of the family of doe the books of mr mrs doe or the books of mr mrs doe sons   ask yourself who owns this family if you believe that a marriage is perpetual until further notice then it does not make any sense to constantly calculate which parent owns the family more in partnership firm profits are attributed to partner 's accounts using previously agreed ratio for example because partner 1 is more hard working and valuable to the firm   does your child own this family does he she have any rights to use the assets to earn income from the assets to transfer the assets to others or to enforce private property rights if they do n't have a part of these rights they are certainly not part of equity   so what happens to the expenses of children if you follow the partnership model there are two ways the first way is to attribute the loss to the parents family since you do not expect the children to repay it is an unrecoverable loss written off the second way is to create a account to aggregate all child expense then create a separate book called the books children 1 and classify the expense in that separate book   i advise using the family of doe as the firm 's boundary and having 1 equity account to simplify everything it is ultimately up to you to decide the boundaries

i 'm going to put this very very simply   the banking system does create money through leveraging and the money multiplier this is absolutely true   the current theory is that this is how the economy is expanded because of the basic premise that an economy can only grow with ample amounts of land labor and capital and it is assumed that the money multiplier allows the development and purchase of all of these things that have the net effect of growing the economy beyond the level of debt built up as part of the process of wealth creation   i have no problem with the above in principle the problem comes when the cycle of debt is built up recklessly and irresponsibly with little if any regulation   that leads to a system in which debt and interest buildup faster than wealth is created   i also have issues with who ends up holding a piece of the pie as it is called but that 's a separate issue entirely   the fed 's job is to stop the economy from collapsing overnight due to fluctuations in the price of money   it would be no different if money was backed by gold and in fact part of the reason why we abandoned that notion as laid out at bretton woods was because of how gold was being sold as a commodity thus affecting the price of money the way speculation on fiat currency occurred due in part to charles de being an asshole   in today 's world where arbitrage happens almost instantaneously and markets shift rapidly there is danger in not having a central bank that can regulate the price of currency to prevent disastrous inflation or economy unemployment   every nation in the world has one because they are necessary in the context of the current economy   banking regulation is a multi tiered problem that involves regulatory capture congressional payoffs a closed circle in terms of who is qualified to even run such institutions and numerous other problems but this is not unique to the banking industry every regulatory body in existence suffers from the same problem   at the moment the chairman of the fed is an appointed position that exists so that key economic decisions will be isolated from the political pressure that elections result in avoiding hastily thrown together and shoddy economic policy based solely upon politics   the independence of like greenspan is questionable but in theory it 's supposed to prevent decision making   in short what i just explained is what everyone else here already knows   welcome to the party

some of it is very simple but almost all of it is very non intuitive imagine that donald trump owns a lot of property that is valued at $ 1bn so he puts that up as collateral to buy some gold worth $ dollars a little while later the banks discover that the properties are only worth $ 100 mm    in this case $ 900 mm has suddenly disappeared and moreover the banks are in deep shit because the donald owes them $ and has posted collateral worth $ 100 mm    when they try to rough up donald he tells them that instead if they go along with his ponzi scheme they might be able to sell his new $ property to someone else for $ 4bn this way the banks will get their money bank and donald will make a nice little profit so the banks lend him some more money    this scheme only works until people start refusing to buy these properties at donald 's prices this is a nutshell what has happened property prices were much higher than they should have been and banks had derivatives which were n't worth as much as they claimed when the market people up to this fact the prices came crashing down and money disappeared

i researched quite a bit around this topic and it seems that this is indeed false long ter asset growth does not converge to the compound interest rate of expected return while it is true that standard deviations of annualized return decrease over time because the asset value itself changes over time the standard deviations of the total return actually increases       thus it is wrong to say that you can take increased risk because you have a longer time horizon   source

bid and ask prices are the highest buy price and lowest sell price in the market which does n't mean one must only buy sell at prices that said one can buy sell at whatever price they so wish although doing it at any other price than the bid ask is usually harder as other market participants will to the bid ask price so in theory you can buy at ask and sell at bid whether or not your order will be filled is another matter altogether

do n't do debt   after a few years i forget how many the bad history will have rolled off but by then you will probably have no desire to go back into debt again if you do want to build up a credit score then at that point it 's essentially the same as starting from scratch   however from personal experience once you 've lived debt free for a few years you never want to get back on the debt wheel again a credit score is the output of a behavioral model that indicates the chances that a bank will earn money from your business do things that earn the banks money and you will have a high credit score

you could buy bitcoins they are even more deflationary than swiss francs   but the exchange rate is currently high and so is the risk in case of volatility   so maybe buy an altcoin instead see altcoin market capitalization for more information basically all you 'd be doing is changing into bitcoin altcoin   you do n't need a bank to store it you do n't need to stockpile cash at home   stays liquid there 's no stock portfolio albeit a coin portfolio unlike in stocks there are no noteworthy buy and sell commissions and the central bank ca n't just change the bills as in classic cash currency   the only risk is volatility in the coin market which is not a small risk   should coins have been going down then for as long as you do n't need that money and keep some for use on a bank account you can just wait until said coins re climb volatility goes both ways after all

one reason for this is that many people do n't simply allow their houses to rot and decay if you 're talking about a house built in 1980 and left vacant and for 35 years it probably will be in pretty poor shape   but a homeowner generally wants to preserve their house and maintain it in good condition so they invest in things like new roofs siding gutters windows paint new furnaces hot water heaters air conditioners etc all this stuff costs money and for tax purposes can often be factored into the cost basis of the house when it is sold but it maintains the value of the property a small hole in the roof may be fairly cheap to fix but if left it could eventually cause much of the building to rot making the structure near worthless if a car into your living room you do n't generally leave it there most people repair the damage   it 's not uncommon in some areas to have 100 year old houses or 300 + year old houses in some countries that were built well in the first place and have been well maintained in the interim   people also renovate their homes ripping out outdated construction and appliances and sometimes building new additions decks etc this also serves to make the property more attractive and increases its value

restricting the discussion only to internet hacking    in option 2 or option 3 you have to realize that the funds are credited to a specific registered bank account so the max damage an hacker can do is liquidate your holding in option 2 the banking internet login and the broker internet login will be different for example hdfc bank and hdfc securities in option 3 if you choose your bank then it will be the same login if you choose a non bank as provider then there is a different login the risk is no different to investing in shares in the end its up to an individual there is nothing that stops you from opening multiple accounts in option 2 and option 3 and buying the stocks worth particular value from an overall risk point of view option 2 seems best suited as the units are held in a demat from by a depository

assuming you plan to buy a whole number of shares and have a maximum dollar value you intend to invest it may be better to wait for the split if the figures do n't quite work out nicely for example if you are going to invest $ 1,000 and the stock pre split is $ 400 and the split is 2 for 1 then you 'd buy 2 shares before the split unless you have an extra $ 200 to add meanwhile after the split you could buy 5 shares at $ 200 so that you invest all that you intend aside from that case it does n't really make a difference since the split is similar to getting 2 nickels for a dime which in each case is still a total value of 10 cents

as other answers have pointed out professional real estate investors do own residential investment properties however small residential units typically are not owned by professional real estate investors as your experience confirms this has a fairly natural cause the size of the investment opportunity is insufficient to warrant the proper research due diligence to which a large investment firm would have to commit if it wanted to properly assess the potential of a property for a small real estate fund managing say $ 50 mm it would take 100 properties at a $ 500 k valuation in order to fully invest the funds this number grows quickly as we decrease the average valuation to reflect even smaller individual units it is unlikely that you will find large institutional investors buying stocks with market caps of $ 20 mm they simply can not invest a large enough portion of total aum to make the diligence make economic sense   as such institutional real estate money tends to find its way into large multi family units that provide a more convenient purchase size for a fund

the bank wo n't let you because differences in required account features business accounts have different features many of them legal features that are required by businesses for instances do you want to be able to deposit cheques that are written out to your business name you need a business account for that your business could be sold then it would n't be your business so it would n't make sense to put the business account under your personal name the bank account and the cash it holds is a business asset and should be owned by the business so when the business is sold the account goes with it this is especially the case for a corporation that has shareholders and not a sole proprietorship for a business you could also in theory assign other people as signing authorities on the business account e.g. your corporate treasurer and the individuals performing that role could change over time business accounts allow for this kind of use market segmentation the bank has consciously undertaken to segment their product offerings in order to maximize their profit market segmentation helps the bottom line even if there were zero legal reasons to have separate personal vs. business accounts banks would still make it their policy to sell different account types according to use because they can make more money that way consider an example in another industry the plain old telephone company also practices segmentation personal business do you want a telephone line for a business and listed as such in the phone book you need a business line do you want a phone line hooked up at a non residential address you need a business line here it 's clear it is less of a legal issue than with the bank account and it does n't matter that the technical features of the phone line may be identical for the basic product offerings within each segment the phone company has chosen to segment and price their product offerings this way q. why do companies choose to charge some kinds of customers more than others for essentially the same underlying service a. because they can

when we talk about compounding we usually think about interest payments if you have a deposit in a savings account that is earning compound interest then each time an interest payment is made to your account your deposit gets larger and the amount of your next interest payment is larger than the last there are compound interest formulas that you can use to calculate your future earnings using the interest rate and the compounding interval   however your mutual fund is not earning interest so you have to think of it differently when you own a stock and your mutual fund is simply a collection of stocks the value of the stock hopefully grows let 's say for example that you have $ 1000 invested and the value goes up 10 the first year the total value of your investment has increased by $ 100 and your total investment is worth $ 1100 if it grows by another 10 the following year your investment is then $ having gained $ 110   in this way your investment grows in a similar way to compound interest as your investment pays off it causes the value of the investment to grow allowing for even higher earnings in the future so in that sense it is compounding however because it is not earning a fixed predictable amount of interest as a savings account would you ca n't use the compound interest formula to calculate precisely how much you will have in the future as there is no fixed compounding interval   if you want to use the formula to estimate how much you might have in the future you have to make an assumption on the growth of your investment and that growth assumption will have a time period associated with it for example you might assume a growth rate of 10 per year or you might assume a growth rate of 1 per month this is what you could use in a compound interest formula for your mutual fund investment   by reinvesting your dividends and capital gains and not taking them out in cash you are maximizing your compounding by allowing those earnings to cause your investment to grow

it depends solely on the risk your willing to take for example few years back one of the leading banks in my country was offering 25 interest rate for 5 year fixed deposits and the lending rate in the market was around 12 so people borrowed money from other banks and invested in the high return fixed deposits after 6 months the bank filed for bankruptcy and people lost their money later investigations revealed that abnormal high return was offered because the bank had a major liquidity problem so all depends on the risk associated with return on your investment higher the risk higher the return

housing prices are set by different criteria it can become memoryless the same as the stock if the criteria used to set its price in the past is no longer valid for example take phoenix or las vegas in the past these were considered attractive investments because of the economical growth and the climate of the area while the climate has n't changed the economical growth stopped not only there but also in the places where people buying the houses lived which is all over the world really what happened to the housing market dropped sharply and stays flat for several years now at the bottom so it does n't really matter if the house was worth $ 300 k in phoenix 5 years ago you can only sell it now for k and that 's about it the prices have been flat low for several years and the house price was $ 50 k but does it mean its going to stay so no once economy gears up the prices will go up as well so its not exactly memory less but the stocks are not memory less as well there is correlation between the past and the future performance if the environment conditions are similar the performance is likely to be similar for stocks however there 's much more environment conditions than the housing market and its much harder to predict them but even with the housing people were burnt a lot on the misconception that the past performance correlates to the future it does n't necessarily

ianal or an accountant but there is a useful notion of technical insolvency which you it sounds like you probably meet and which is a distinct concept from actual insolvency couple of choice quotes from that link if a company or person is technically insolvent that merely means    that it has a negative net asset value its liabilities are greater    than its assets    the significance of technical insolvency depends on circumstances it    may be an indicator of serious problems that may lead to actual    insolvency or it may be perfectly acceptable a technically insolvent company is free to keep trading as long as the    directors reasonably believe that the company will be able to pay its    debts and again as long as an creditor does not use the    courts to force a liquidation which is basically what @keshlam 's comment on your question is saying

true blue preferred shares are considered loose hybrids of credit and equity   they are more senior than common equity in bankruptcy liquidation but pay out a dividend which is not mandatory financial institutions issue the bulk of genuine preferred shares because of their need for more flexibility than a bond but not so much that they can afford the cost to shareholders by diluting common equity since it is a credit like security that receives none of the income from operations but merely pays out a potentially unpredictable yet fixed amount of income it will perform much more like a bond rising when interest rates fall and vice versa and since interest rates do not move to the extent of common equity valuations price variances will correspond much more to bonds than common equities   if the company stops paying the preferred dividend or looks to become in financial trouble the price of the preferred share should be expected to fall there are more modern preferred however   it has now become popular to fund intermediate startups with convertible preferred shares   because these are derivatives based upon the common equity they can be expected to be much more variant

nafta affected u.s. workers in four principal ways first it caused the loss of some 700,000 jobs as production moved to mexico most of these losses came in california texas michigan and other states where manufacturing is concentrated to be sure there were some job gains along the border in service and retail sectors resulting from increased trucking activity but these gains are small in relation to the loses and are in lower paying occupations the vast majority of workers who lost jobs from nafta suffered a permanent loss of income   second nafta strengthened the ability of u.s. employers to force workers to accept lower wages and benefits as soon as nafta became law corporate managers began telling their workers that their companies intended to move to mexico unless the workers lowered the cost of their labor in the midst of collective bargaining negotiations with unions some companies would even start loading machinery into trucks that they said were bound for mexico the same threats were used to fight union organizing efforts the message was if you vote in a union we will move south of the border with nafta corporations also could more easily local governments into giving them tax reductions and other subsidies   third the destructive effect of nafta on the mexican agricultural and small business sectors several million mexican workers and their families and was a major cause in the dramatic increase in undocumented workers flowing into the u.s. labor market this put further downward pressure on u.s. wages especially in the already lower paying market for less skilled labor   fourth and ultimately most important nafta was the template for rules of the emerging global economy in which the benefits would flow to capital and the costs to labor the u.s. governing class in alliance with the financial elites of its trading partners applied nafta ’s principles to the world trade organization to the policies of the world bank and imf and to the deal under which employers of china ’s huge supply of low wage workers were allowed access to u.s. markets in exchange for allowing american multinational corporations the right to invest there   please thank bill clinton

i had the same thing happen to me in late 2010   i contacted the big company 's bored sounding payroll department after through the phone menu and more than one all of our operators are busy please call back later < click > and told them i had this extra money   the guy in india told me that my petition would be investigated and that a ticket would be opened   i heard nothing for a couple of weeks   i followed up with payroll   they said that my petition investigation had determined that i did indeed get paid extra and they 'd be sending me a letter demanding the overpayment i received no letter and a month later january 2011 i got a w-2 with the paycheck included on it   i decided that i 'd spent enough of my own time and effort on it and if they wanted it back the ball was in their court   i changed my bank account numbers to prevent them from auto debiting my account and spent the money as if it was mine    i have not heard anything about it since then from what i was able to determine once i 'd made a good faith effort to return it i was in the clear and for what it 's worth it 's not like you can just return it   among other things i certainly was n't just going to mail the company a check and hope for the best

rent deposit returned to you is not an income its your money to begin with the homeowner is taxed on taking it and can expense the refund but for you there 's no taxable event atm rebate is what it is rebate a cash discount over the money paid basically the bank refunded you a fee you paid atm rebate is a refund of the atm fee you paid to a third party atm operator again your money the atm operator and the bank both have taxable income deduction but its not your problem you just got your money back no income no taxable event neither should appear on your tax forms and similarly nor should credit card points cash rebates frequent flyer miles etc all are in fact either a refund of your money paid or a merchant discount to you not an income

gt;you understand the purpose of insurance right it 's ok to tax the rich but not ok for them to cash in on insurance   you understand that no employees pay for this insurance right the rich employees do n't pay for this benefit the employers do    that being said this is not something that is an easy question to answer one one hand if someone is out of a job then the black and white answer is yes they are absolutely allowed to use these benefits the other hand if this person has the ability not to utilize these benefits because they were able to create a by investments or simply saving then why would they need to use it i think that using this specific benefit should be a last resort not one to use because you do n't want to use any of your money not that i m saying this happened but again if someone is making this kind of money one would think they should have the wherewithal to have an emergency savings fund for this exact situation    there is nothing inherently illegal about this however it is imo morally questionable

this is your best answer so far a detail left out is that derivatives are mostly known for the amount of leverage allowed which is typically about 20 1 or 5 down this is legal because it 's generally assumed that someone is not going to buy or sell the underlying asset that they will offset their long or short position long before the contract 's delivery date your derivative futures instead of forwards because they 're a standardized size traded on an exchange and more liquid will call you when you lose about half of your 5 to tell you to either transfer some money to cover your position or to ask you to exit your position at a loss   are traded through clearinghouses not exchanges and they can be for any underlying asset for any delivery date for any price so long as parties agree on it just think of it as a contract

you need to go read a good history book not   the problem prior to the cra of 1965 is that the government itself bigotry   this is unacceptable because all citizens are supposed to be equal before the law and their     the cra its bounds however insofar as it attempted to enforce equality by some definition in the private sector and this leads to no good endgame   it puts the government bottom into the position of deciding what is fair and who should get what   this always leads to some people 's rights being more important than others   none of us much likes say the kkk worldview but a 's rights should not be less defended just because they are   once you start picking and choosing whose rights are more important you open a door that leads to really harmful things   in this case a person with a particular faith may be forced by their own government to support someone who 's worldview they object to   tl;dr you 're still supporting the slaves just now just the people whose point of view you do not support   this is tyranny

depending on your income you may owe amt instead of the taxes from the regular code   even if you do n't do that you may hit the place where you have to at least check if you owe amt as you probably know amt was established early on to catch the wealthiest of tax payers who were able to use various loop holes in the code to pay much less tax than one would expect   over time the limits on amt have not risen with the rising wage gap and amt catches an increasing number of tax payers each year   if the limit is not raised at all for 2010 then it will catch even more people this year    amt has worked it 's way into the upper middle class fairly solidly especially if you exercise stock options whose strike price is significantly different than the current sale price

this questions is rational but in my view definition of savings will be like this savings is that amount of money which will be useful in unexpected future cash demanding events or they will stay ideal through out your life human can purchase pursue   any luxury items at any point of time in their life but there will come several unavoidable events which will take away your savings and some how you will not have any control over it example you found out you have a cancer at the age of 45 doctor says you can under go several treatments and will be fine again for this you will have to spend $ 1 m now this can be considered as unavoidable expense and only your savings will be helpful to you in this kind of situations so savings is nothing but a money kept at a safe location which will be used in such unavoidable situations or they will stay ideal during your entire life time and your next generation will be able to use them after your death

what is being described in 's answer though helpful is perhaps more similar to a financial spread bet exactly like a the provider of a spread bet takes the other side of the bet and is counter party to your trade a cfd is also a bet between two parties now if the cfd provider uses a market maker model then this is exactly the same as with a spread bet and the provider is the counter party however if the provider uses a direct market access model then the counter party to your contract is another cfd trader and the provider is just acting as an intermediary to bring you together basically doing the job of both a brokerage and an exchange a cfd entered into through a direct market access provider is in many ways similar to a futures contract critically though the contract is traded over the counter and not on any centralized and regulated exchange this is the reason that cfds are not permitted in the us the providers are not authorized as exchanges whichever model your cfd provider uses it is best to think of the contract as a bet on the future price movements of the underlying stock or commodity in much the same way as with any other derivative instrument such as futures forwards swaps or options finally note that because you do n't actually own the underlying stock just as has highlighted you wo n't be entitled to any of the additional benefits that can come with ownership of a stock such as dividend payments or the right to attend shareholder meetings response to question so if i understand correctly the money gained through a direct market access model comes from other investors in the same cfd who happened to have invested in the wrong direction the asset was presumed to take what happens then if no one is betting in the opposite direction of my investment your understanding is correct if literally nobody is betting in the opposite direction to you then you will not be able to trade this is true for any derivative market if suddenly every single buyer were to remove their bids from the s&p futures then no seller would be able to sell this is a very extreme scenario as the s&p futures market is incredibly liquid loads of buyers and sellers at all times   however if something like this does happen the flash crash of 2010 for example then the centralized futures exchanges such as the cme have safeguards in place the market become locked limit so that it can only fall so far there may be no buyers below the lock limit price but the market can not fall through it cfd providers are not obliged to provide such safeguards which is why regulators in the us do n't permit them to operate it may be the case that if you 're trying to buy a cfd for a thinly traded and ill liquid stock there will be no seller available one possibility is that the provider will offer a hybrid model and in the absence of an independent counter party they will take the opposite side of your bet and then offset their risk by taking an opposing position in the underlying stock

thanks for responding i ve been weighing my options and i still have quite a ways to go before i m stick certified but i am actually leaning more towards focusing on welding first and foremost because its faster money if i get on my cousins crew i could potentially make close to 50 60k my first year and that s just as a helper not an actual therefore there s potential to advance to an actual welding job where i could make 100k+ hopefully i have some luck and get that opportunity early in my career   that will give me time to pay off my student loans all the money my family has helped me with buy a house which will eventually become another income and even save a lot after that s all paid off i think that s the safer option for me starting off and then ill have more money to invest in local such as the pizza joint and most likely open a welding shop a little later i just need to bust ass and make as much money as possible for the next 4 or 5 years so i can settle down and not travel for work as much    nothing is set in stone yet and obviously i m weighing all options but i wanted to get opinions on the subject especially because the pizza joint expanding idea was just presented to me the other day

the sec 30-day yield you 're seeing is a standardized yield calculation set out by the securities exchange commission   it can be useful for comparing bond funds but it does n't guarantee what you 'll actually earn from a fund important the sec 30-day yield represents a bond fund 's returns from the previous 30 days expressed as an annual percentage of the current fund price yes an annual percentage in other words do n't expect return on your money every 30 days   such a return is too good to be true return in today 's low rate environment   per year   more reasonable even then the you see is merely an estimate one based on assumptions of what you might expect to earn if you keep your money in place for the next year   the estimate is based on the assumptions that these are n't reliable assumptions   's price does fluctuate   you are not promised to get your principal back with a bond fund   only an individual bond promises your principal back and only at maturity so earning $ on $ 10,000 invested for a full year while taking on interest rate and other risks might not be worth the trouble of putting your money in a brokerage account you 'll need to transfer the money in and out and there are potential trading fees to take into account   how much to buy sell units an fdic insured high interest savings account makes more sense

as i understand it the usual rule is that the country you are resident in taxes you on your worldwide income but gives you credit for foreign tax paid the country you are not normally resident in taxes you only on income from that one country note that residence for tax purposes can have different rules from residence for immigration purposes at least in the uk being resident in the country for more than half the tax year normally makes you tax resident and there are some other cases too i expect other countries are similar but the details of the rules and the start end of the tax years may vary i do n't know the exact rules for finland and belgium but i expect your belgian taxes will be based on your belgian income only and your finnish taxes will be based on your worldwide income but with a credit for your belgian taxes engaging accountants from both countries to confirm the exact rules and what exactly you should put on the forms is almost certainly a good idea

how you should record the mortgage payments depends on if you are trying to achieve correct accounting according to the standards or if you are just tracking everything for you and your friends if you 're just keeping track for personal reasons i 'd suggest that you set up your check or journal entry your preference how you 'd like it to be recorded   then memorize that transaction   this allows you to use it as many times as you need to without having to set it up each time   also note there is no way to record a transaction that decreases cash and increases equity if you 're trying to keep track of everything according to accounting standards which it should be if you 've set up an official business then you have a lot more tracking to do with each payment   mortgage payments technically do not affect the equity accounts of the owners   each mortgage payment should decrease the bank balance increase interest expense and decrease the mortgage balance not to mention tracking any escrow account you may have   the equity accounts would be affected if the owners are contributing funds to the bank account but equity would increase at the time the funds are deposited not when the mortgage payments are made hope this helps

i 've often encountered the practices you describe in the netherlands too this is how i deal with it avoid gyms with aggressive sales tactics my solution is to only sign up for a gym that does not seem to have one on one sales personnel and aggressive sales tactics and even then to read the terms and conditions thoroughly i prefer to pay them in monthly terms that i myself initiate instead of allowing them to charge my account when they please 1   avoid gyms that lack respect for their members maybe you 've struggled with the choice for a gym because one of those evil gyms is very close to home and has really excellent facilities you may be tempted to ask for a one off contract without the shady wording but i advise against this   think about it this way even though regular t&c would not apply the spirit with which they were drawn up lives on among gym personnel management they 're simply not inclined to act in your best interest so it 's still possible to run into problems when ending your membership in my opinion it 's better to completely avoid such places because they are not worthy of your trust of course this advice goes beyond gym memberships and is applicable to life in general hope this helps 1 credit cards are n't very popular in the netherlands but we have a charging mechanism called automatic collection which allows for arbitrary merchant initiated charges

but why ca n't two companies exchange goods directly without paying vat this would make the famous fraud scam impossible and businesses wo n't have to deal with complicated refunds sales tax in the united states works as you describe   sales tax is charged only to end customers not to businesses that themselves charge sales tax   but this means that a criminal business can charge tax and just pocket it unless someone else reports it   they can also evade income tax the same way   not to mention other issues like cross jurisdiction taxes e.g. internet sales often evade sales tax    the whole point of a value added tax vat is that they charge at each level   this creates a system where each buyer reports the tax paid to the seller so as to be able to deduct it   so the seller has to pay the vat that they charged   or the tax authorities know and can revoke their vat license    if only the end user is charged tax then fraud is easier than under a vat   so easy i doubt they have a special name for it   the fraudulent business just collects tax from end users and disappears   or simply fails to record those transactions   you could call it missing transaction record fraud but why bother   it 's just straight up tax fraud   the complexity of the fraud arises from the difficulty of evading a vat

correct   but this is only true when a central bank is involved   so if there 's a single institution that has a territorial monopoly on the production of money and competing currencies are n't allowed via legal tender laws then the debt based money system op describes is n't actually the system being used   that 's the problem with his post   he 's trying to make it seem like our current system of fiat currencies is somehow natural or emergent   it 's not   what we have now is the result of a legal monopoly

oracle is the most prevalent software in the banking and financial system if not   in the front end then on the back end oracle has made so much profit for the financial sector that they ended up acquiring sun systems and now bundle their own hardware along with their software and databases   there is perhaps not a single bank in the world that does not use oracle in some form or another be it aml mis erp or core banking   it remains a mystery to me how the heads of banking and the fed can sit in front of the senate banking committee and when asked what is your exposure   their response was i do n't know   bankers are dumb by their very nature and cultivated to look the other way but even for them and their corrupt single digit iq i think oracle must really suck as a database if they could not run a simple sum query   conclusion oracle colluded in the 2007 financial crisis and sucks as a database and financial system

the u.s accredited investor laws apply to investments in the u.s. foreign countries may or may not have their own laws regarding investment in startups and if so the foreign laws apply one way around the net worth minimum is to be a member of the management team active management investors do n't need to be accredited because they can see what 's going on on a day to day basis the accredited investor laws apply to the target companies not to the investors basically a start up company ca n't take other people 's money from a non accredited investor but you can invest your own money in it if you are a manager

gambling is never a wise investment even assuming that the stated odds are correct there can be multiple winners and the jackpot is shared between the winners so the individual payout can be significantly less than the total jackpot if i were to take a dollar from you and a dollar from your buddy on the promise that i 'd give the two of you a total of $ 3 back if you both guessed the result of a single fair coin toss would you take the offer note also that the jackpot value is quite misleading it 's the sum of the annual payments and if you reduce that to present value it 's significantly less

these are the things to focus on do not put yourself in debt with a car there are other better solutions   1 get a credit card unless you already have one this and get the best cash back or points card you can get at the best rate   start with buying gas and groceries every month do not run the balance up pay the card off every single month this is important never carry a balance above 25 of your credit limit   every 8 months or so call your credit card company and ask for a credit line increase they should be able to do this without pulling your credit you are only looking for the automatic increment that they can automatically approve this will help increase your available credit and will help keep your credit utilization low only do this is you are successfully doing the other bullet points above   2 pay all of your bills on time this includes everything from water electricity phone bill etc never be late setup automatic payments if you can   3 minimize the number of hard credit inquiries is particularly important when you are looking for your mortgage lender do not let them pull your credit automatically you should be able to provide them your credit score and other information and get quotes from those lenders do not let them tell you then ca n't do this they can   plan when you close a credit line closing them will do two things lower your credit limit often times increasing your credit utilization and it may hurt your average age of credit open one credit card and keep it forever   note credit karma is a great tool you should check your score monthly and see how your efforts are influencing your score i also like citi credit cards because they will provide you monthly with your fico score which credit karma will only provide transunion and equifax   this is educational information and you should consider talking to a banker lender who can also give you more detailed instructions on how to get your credit improved so that they can approve you for a loan   many people can get their score above 720 in 1 2 years time going from no credit doing the steps described above it does take time be patient and do n't fall for gimmicks

there is the opportunity cost   let 's say it cost you $ 1000 to buy 0.25 discount over n number of years that saves you let 's say $ 2000 thus your profit is $ 1000 what if you took that $ 1000 and invested it would you have more than $ 2000 after n number of   years obviously answering this question is not easy but you can make some educated guesses for example you can compare the return you 'll likely get from investing in cd or treasury bond a bit more risky is to invest in the stock market but an index fund should be fairly safe and you can easily find the average return over 5 10 year period   for example if your loan is $ 200,000 at 0.25 per year you 'll get $ 500 in savings over 10 years that 's $ 5000 $ 1000 to buy the point you end up with $ 4000   using the calculator on this site i calculated that if you invested in the dow jones industrial average between 2007 and 2017   you total return would have been 111 assuming dividends are reinvested or you would've had a total of $   i 'm not sure how accurate those numbers are but it seems likely that buying points is a pretty good investment if you stay in the house for 10 years or more

value averaging has you shift the balance of your portfolio over time not the amount of contributions   so you can only do it if you have a portfolio holding both risky assets shares etc and some cash you start out by making a plan about how much you will contribute every month and at what rate you expect the share part of the portfolio to grow   perhaps based on 20th century data you think an 8 growth rate is reasonable   or alternatively if you know your desired final amount obviously you can work backwards to a desired rate from that if in any month the share part is falling below its expected growth path you would put more money into it possibly your whole paycheck contribution plus some from the savings cash account   on the other hand if the share component is growing too fast you would put all your additional savings into cash   so if your investments are doing well you 're not supposed to spend the excess money but rather to put it aside into a dedicated cash account to top up your share component when prices fall in theory this has the auto benefit of dollar cost averaging but even better when prices are high you 'll automatically buy fewer shares or even sell some conversely when prices are low you 'll buy extra shares from your reserve account if it turns out your estimate was unreasonably optimistic and over your lifetime shares only ever average 3 you 'll end up with an entirely share portfolio and a ride than you might have liked   if you have horrible luck and over your entire investing life shares return less than cash which has happened though not yet in the usa then this will be worse than a standard balanced portfolio the original book value averaging by has a pretty good explanation of various cases though i would say some of the examples are worked in excessive detail i have not implemented this myself one reason being that the amount i 'm able to save from year to year varies as it probably does for you and so predicting a path is not quite so simple as he assumes   you could still do it i suppose i think you could get a very crude approximation to this by simply directing your savings into cash when the share market 's rate of growth over the last several years is above what you think is the long term average

the policy you quoted suggests you deposit 6 minimum that $ 6,000 will cost you $ 4,500 due to the tax effect yet after the match you 'll have $ 9,000 in the account taxable on withdrawal but a great boost to the account   the question of where is less clear there must be more than the 2 choices you mention most plans have too many choices this into my focus on expenses a few years back pbs frontline aired a program titled the retirement gamble in which fund expenses were discussed with a focus on how an extra 1 in expenses will wipe out an extra 1/3 of your wealth in a 40 year period very simple to illustrate this go to a calculator and enter .99 raised to the power of 40 is the result my 401(k has an expense of .02 that 's of 1 raised to the same 40 gives in other words a cost of .8 over the full 40 years my wife and i are just retired and will have less in expenses for the rest of our lives than the average account cost for just 1 year   in your situation the knee jerk reaction is to tell you to maximize the 401(k deposit at the current 2016 $ 18,000 that might be appropriate but i 'd suggest you look at the expense of the s&p index sometime called large cap fund but see the prospectus and if it 's costing much more than i 'd go with an ira roth if you ca n't deduct the traditional ira much of the value of the 401(k beyond the match is the tax differential i.e. depositing while in the 25 bracket but withdrawing the funds at retirement hopefully at 15 it does n't take long for the extra expense and the holy cow my 401(k just turned decades of dividends and long term cap gains into ordinary income effect to take over understand this now not 30 years hence   last to answer your question how much i often recommend what may seem a cliche continue to live like a student half the country lives on $ 54 k or less there 's certainly a wide gray area but in general a person starting out will choose one of 2 paths living just at or even above his means or living way below and saving say 30 40 off the top even 30 does n't hit the extreme saver level if you do this you 'll find that if when you get married buy a house have kids etc you 'll still be able to save a reasonable percent of your income toward retirement   in response to your comment what counts as retirement savings there 's a concept used as part of the budgeting process known as the envelope system for those who have an income where there 's little discretionary money left over each month the method of putting money aside into small buckets is a great idea in your case say you take me up on the 30 40 challenge 15 of it goes to a hard and fast retirement account the rest to savings according to the general order of emergency fund 6 12 months expenses to cover a job loss another fund for random expenses such as new transmission i 've never needed one but i hear they are expensive and then the bucket towards house down payment keep in mind i have no idea where you live or what a reasonable house would cost regardless a 20 25 downpayment on even a $ 250 k house is $ that will take some time to save up if the housing in your area is more bump it accordingly   if the savings starts to grow beyond any short term needs it gets invested towards the long term and is treated as retirement money there is no such thing as saving too much when i turned 50 and was let go from a 30 year job i was n't unhappy that i saved too much and could call it quits that day had i been saving just right i 'd have been 10 years shy of my target

you 're not responsible for the mortgages on the property those are agreements between the lender and the borrower the risk you have is that the title search missed something   if the seller i.e. the bank or banks who foreclosed did not have full rights to sell the property and there was another party who had a lien on the property or had an interest in it in some fashion that party could make a claim that would interfere with your purchase   you would n't be responsible for the loan but you might not end up with the title to the property if that happened

no because of the balance transfer fees which could be 4 unless of course you get a deal for 12 months of no payment and you pay it back in 12 months in which case a 4 annual interest rate is much less than a loan at that point you are gambling that you will be responsible with the payments and the card company is taking the opposite bet

is she entitled to more of the equity because she made more no   equity should be determined by how much each paid   but she is entitled to more of the equity if she paid more   and that may be what she is saying   that she contributed more to the household 's finances than you did    if you always paid the mortgage out of the joint account you could presumably go back and look at the account to find out how much each of you contributed to it   that would give you a reasonable split for the remainder of the equity after your initial investment   if you both put your entire paychecks into the joint account every time then it will be the same as the ratio of what you each made   that would also make sense for splitting up whatever remains in that account    while you 're doing that you may want to ask for more for your original $ 65,000   by my calculation if your mortgage was 3.5 that $ 65,000 saved the household more than $ 12,000 in interest that became equity instead   so you could reasonably bump your return on the initial investment up to $ while making the concession on the rest of the equity    this is just a suggestion for a framework for splitting the equity   if you can agree on a split it will almost certainly be easier than going to a mediator or court

it 's called leverage here 's an example from real estate the underlying appreciation on a house in certain parts of america is something like 7 a year so if you bought the house all cash your return would be something like 7 a year actually a little more because of the rent you would be collecting or saving if you were the renter suppose you buy the same house 20 down 80 mortgage the rent pays for your mortgage taxes insurance etc like it is supposed to the house goes up the same 7 each year but now your rate of return is 35 that is your down payment you get the whole appreciation but put up only 20 of the money the bank and your renter did the rest

the plan is perfectly valid and legal as tax rules currently stand there is no limit to the amount you can rollover or convert to roth assuming your 401(k is traditional pre tax you 'll have to pay income taxes on the amount you convert above personal exemption + standard deduction which is currently about $ 10k year for single filers the other caveat is you 'll need funds to live off of while your conversion money is for 5 years in your roth ira if you start the conversion while you are still working you 'll be paying taxes on it in your marginal bracket which will negate much of the benefit of the pre tax 401(k if your living expenses are low you can convert about $ 10k year without federal income taxes while living off capital gains from a taxable account which have a 0 rate in the 15   income tax bracket goes up to about $ year

one scenario described in the original question a non insider who trades after informal conversations with friends where no insiders directly benefit from any such disclosure might not be illegal   ianal this is just my personal interpretation of articles in the news recently the appeals court said prosecutors needed to show that the person disclosing the information received a clear benefit something more than the nurturing of a friendship in a 1980 case the supreme court rejected the idea of a general duty between all participants in market transactions to forgo actions based on material nonpublic information

smart money merriam webster is simply a term that refers to the money that successful investors invest   it can also refer to the successful investors themselves   when someone tells you to follow the smart money they are generally telling you to invest in the same things that successful investors invest in   for example you might decide to invest in the same things that warren buffett invests in    however there are a couple of problems with blindly following someone else 's investments without knowing what you are doing first you are not in the same situation that the expert is in   warren buffett has a lot of money in a lot of places   he can afford to take some chances that you might not be able to take   so if you choose only one of his investments to copy and it ends up being a loser he is fine but you are not second when warren buffett makes large investments he affects the price of stocks   for example warren buffett 's company recently purchased $ 1 billion worth of apple stock   as soon as this purchase was announced the price of apple stock went up 4 from people purchasing the stock trying to follow warren buffett    that having been said it is a good idea to watch successful investors and learn from what they do   if they see a stock as something worth investing in find out what it is that they see in that company

suppose you 're writing a put with a strike price of 80 say the asset price goes down to 70 so the holder of the put will exercise the option ie he has a right to sell a share worth 70 for rs 80 whereas a put option writer has an obligation to buy at rs 80 a share trading at rs 70 always think from the perspective of the holder if the holder exercises the option the writer will suffer a loss maximum loss he suffers will be the break even which is strike price reduced by the premium paid if he does n't exercise the option the writer will make a profit which can maximum be the put premium received

if i understand you correctly your logic goes wrong right at the beginning it sounds like you think one could avoid the income tax that would otherwise be owed to the us because of earning the money that was sent as a gift that 's not normally true from the irs 's gift tax faq may i deduct gifts on my income tax return making a gift or leaving your estate to your heirs does not ordinarily affect your federal income tax you can not deduct the value of gifts you make other than gifts that are deductible charitable contributions so the person who sends $ 10k to their parents does n't pay any less income tax than if they had kept the $ 10k in the us or had just send the $ 10k overseas directly to their own bank account gifting and re gifting did n't accomplish anything from the point of view of irs taxes you may have been confused by the annual exclusion that 's mentioned on that same page this exclusion is an exclusion for the gift tax this is a separate tax on gifts usually paid by the person who gives the gift if it were n't for the exclusion one would pay taxes twice on the money sent to their parents first when the money is earned and then again when the gift is given the exclusion helps avoid this second tax

1 are the definitions for capital market from the two sources the same yes   they are from two different perspectives   investopedia is looking at it primarily from the perspective of a trader and they lead off with the secondary market this refers to the secondary market a market in which individuals and institutions trade financial securities this refers to the primary market organizations institutions in the public and private sectors also often sell securities on the capital markets in order to raise funds also the investopedia definition leaves much to be desired but it is supposed to be   so you are comparing apples and oranges to some extent   one is an article as short as it may be this other one is an entry in a dictionary 2 what is the opposite of capital market according to the definition in investopedia   it 's not quite about opposites this is not physics   however that is not the issue here   the investopedia definition simply does not mention any other possibilities   the wikipedia article defines the term more thoroughly   it talks about primary secondary markets in separate paragraph 3 according to the wikipedia 's definition why does stock market belong to capital market given that stocks can be held less than one year too if you follow the link in the wikipedia article to money market as money became a commodity the money market is nowadays a component of the financial markets for assets involved in short term borrowing lending buying and selling with original maturities of one year or less the key here is original maturities of one year or less here 's my attempt at explaining this financial markets are comprised of money markets and capital markets    money is traded as if it were a commodity on the money markets   hence the short term nature in its definition   they are more focused on the money itself      capital markets are focused on the money as a means to an end companies seek money in these markets for longer terms in order to improve their business in some way a business may go to the money markets to access money quickly in order to deal with a short term cash crunch   meanwhile a business may go to the capital markets to seek money in order to expand its business note that capital markets came first and money markets are a relatively recent development    also we are typically speaking about the secondary capital market when we are talking about the stock or bond market   in this market participants are merely trading among themselves   the company that sought money by issuing that stock bond certificate is out of the picture at that point and has its money    so facebook got its money from participants in the primary market the underwriters   the underwriters then turned around and sold that stock in an ipo to the secondary market   after the ipo their stock trades on the secondary market where you or i have access to trade it   that money flows between traders   facebook got its money at the beginning of the process

setting up an entity that is partially foreign owned is not that difficult it takes an additional 1 1.5 months in total and in this particular case you guys would be formed as a joint venture it will cost a bit more about 3 5000 if you 're serious about owning a part of a business in china you should carefully examine what he means by more complicated from my point of view i have set up my own in china and examined the possibilities of a and even considered using a friend to set up the company under their personal name as a domestic company which is what your supervisor is doing any difference between the three are not really a big deal anymore and comes down to the competency of the agencies you are using and the business partner themselves    it cost me 11,000 for a including the agency and government registration fees only chinese speaking   you should also consider the other shareholders who may be part of this venture as well if there are other shareholders and you are not providing further tangible contribution you will end up replaced and unless of course you trust them too because they are actually paying money to be part of the business and you are not they will not part with equity for you   i 'm not a lawyer but think you should not rely on any promises other than what it says on a company registration paper good luck

you can deduct what you pay for your own and your family 's health insurance regardless of whether it is subsidized by your employer or not as well   as all other medical and dental expenses for your family as an itemized deduction on schedule a of form 1040 but only to the extent that the   total exceeds 7.5 of your adjusted gross income agi 10 on tax returns for year 2013 onwards as pointed out in 's comment you can not deduct any health insurance premium or other medical expense that was paid for out of pre tax dollars nor indeed can you deduct any medical expense to the extent that   it was paid for by the insurance company directly to hospital or doctor or reimbursed to you for a covered expense e.g. if the insurance company reimbursed you $ 72 for a claim for a doctor 's visit for which you paid $ 100 to the doctor only $ 28 goes on schedule a to be added to the amount that you will be comparing to the 7.5 of agi threshold and the $ 72 is not income to you that needs to be reported on form 1040 depending on other items on schedule a your total itemized deductions might not exceed the standard deduction in which case you will likely choose to use the standard deduction in this case you lose the deduction for medical expenses as well as all other expenses deductible on schedule a. summary of some of the discussions in the comments    health care insurance premiums can not be paid for    from hsa accounts irs pub 969 page 8 column 2 near    the bottom though there are some exceptions   nor    can health care insurance premiums be paid from an    fsa account irs pub 969 page 17 column 1 near the top if you have a business on the side and file a schedule c as a self employed person you can buy medical insurance for that business 's employees and their families too if you like as an employment benefit and pay for it out of the income of the schedule c business thus saving on taxes but be aware that if you have employees other than yourself in the side business they would need to be covered by the same policy too   you can even decide to pay all medical expenses of your employees and their families too no 7.5 limitation there as an employment benefit but again you can not discriminate against other employees if any of the schedule c business in this matter   of course all this money that reduced your schedule c income does not go on schedule a at all if your employer permits your family to be covered under its health insurance plan for a cost of course check whether you are allowed to pay for the insurance with pre tax dollars   the private non schedule c insurance would of course be paid for with post tax dollars   i would doubt that   you would be able to save enough money on taxes to make up the difference between $ and $ but it might also be that the private insurance policy covers a lot less than your employer 's policy does   as a rule of thumb group insurance through an employer can be expected to offer better coverage than privately purchased insurance whether the added coverage is worth the additional cost is a   different matter   but while considering this matter keep in mind that privately purchased insurance is not   always guaranteed to be renewable and a company might decline to renew a policy if there were a large number of claims a replacement policy might not cover pre existing conditions for some time six months a year or maybe even permanently   so do consider these aspects as well   of course an employer can also change health insurance plans or drop them entirely as an employment benefit or you might quit and go work for a different company but as long as the employer 's health plan is in existence you and continuing members of your family can not be discriminated against and denied coverage under the employer 's plan

two main points to answer this in my opinion first most people do n't start with say half a million dollar to buy all the stocks they need in one shot but rather they accumulate this money gradually so they must make many buys in their lifetime similarly most people do n't need to withdraw all their investment in one day and should n't do this anyway as it cuts the time of investment so there will be many sells performing a single buy or sell per year is not efficient since it means you have lots of cash sitting doing nothing so in this sense low cost indexing lets you quickly invest your money and withdraw it when needed after say you retire without worrying about commission costs each time the second and most important point to me to answer this is that we should make a very clear distinction between strategy and outcome today 's stock prices and all the ups and downs of the market are just one possible outcome that materialized from a virtually number of possible outcomes it 's not too hard to imagine that tomorrow we hear all iphones explode and apple stock comes crashing down or that in a parallel universe amazon never takes off and somehow sears is the king of online commerce another item in the outcome category is your decisions as a human being of when to buy and sell if that exploding iphone event does occur would you hold on to your stocks would you sell and cut your losses does the average person make the same decision if they had $ 1000 invested in apple alone vs $ 1 m   index investing offers a low cost strategy that mitigates these uncertainties for the average person again here the key is the word average picking a handful of the stocks as you mention might give you better returns in 30 years but it could just as easily give you worse and the current data suggest the latter is more likely come and go who were they 30 years ago and just like how the other 450 companies may seem right now as dragging down the portfolio just as easily a handful of them can emerge as the new guaranteed no possible yes   jack bogle is simply saying low cost indexing is one of the better strategies for the average person given the data but nowhere is it guaranteed that in this lifetime e.g. next 30 years will provide the best outcome berkshire on the other hand are in the business of chasing maximum outcomes mid or short term returns it 's two different concepts that should n't be mixed together in my opinion

first of all the only thing they can do to force you to pay is sue you if they do n't sue you then they ca n't force you to do anything all they have right now is just a written agreement you signed promising to pay that by itself does n't have legal power to take money from you the worst they can do without suing you is put negative information on your credit report which has probably already happened anyway if they sue you within the statute of limitations they will almost certainly win and get a judgment against you because you did agree to pay with that judgment the court can force you to reveal your income and asset information and they can take the judgment to do things like seize money from your bank accounts and/or garnish your wages and the judgment does not go away however if you have no money in the bank and/or income they ca n't take any money from you because you have none they ca n't take more from you than you have in other words if you have no money or income and wo n't have money or income soon the judgment they can get by suing you and winning is n't worth the paper it 's on since serving you and suing you takes money and effort they will make a calculation on whether it is worth suing you based on the amount of debt and what amount of money they think they can get from you based on what they know about you this is the reason why you may not be sued at all if they calculate that it is not worth it and also why they may offer you a settlement for a lesser amount because is saves the cost of suing and the risk that they wo n't be able to get you to pay the amount you mentioned several thousand dollars may be small enough for it to be not worth it another thing is the statute of limitations i mentioned earlier which varies by state and is several years long if they sue you after the statute of limitations passes then you can raise the statute of limitations and get the lawsuit dismissed so basically after this amount of time passes you are pretty much free from this debt note that the statute of limitations resets if you acknowledge the debt which includes paying any amount on the debt or agreeing that you owe them this debt so if the collection agency ever offers you benefits if you just sign a promissory note or just pay a token amount do n't fall for the trap they are trying to reset the statute of limitations even though it 's true that you owe them the debt never let them hear you acknowledging it unless it 's part of a final settlement finally if they get a judgment against you and you do n't want them to have the ability to take your money indefinitely in the future until the debt is satisfied there may be the option of bankruptcy however a few thousand dollars may not be worth the cost and negative consequences of bankruptcy since as a young man you should be able to earn that amount quickly whenever you start working

there are certain allowable reasons to withdraw money from a 401k.   the desire to free your money from a bad plan is not one of them    a rollover is a special type of withdrawal that is only available after one leaves their current employer   so as long as you stay with your current company you can not rollover   exception if you are over age   59.5 one option is to talk to hr see if they can get a expansion of offerings   you might have some suggestions for mutual funds that you would like to see   the smaller the company the more likely you will have success here   that being said there is some research to support having few choices   too many choices people it 's quite popular to have target funds   that is funds that target a certain retirement year   being that i will be 50 in 2016 i should invest in either a 2030 or fund   these are a collection of funds that rebalances the investment as they age   the closer one gets to retirement the more goes into bonds and less into stocks    however i think such rebalancing is not as smart as the experts say   imho is almost always better off heavily invested in equity funds   so this becomes a second option   invest in a target fund that is meant for younger people   in my case i would put into a 2060 or even target as joetaxpayer pointed out even in a plan that has high fees and poor choices one is often better off contributing up to the match   then one would go outside and contribute to an individual roth or ira income restrictions may apply then back into the 401 k until the desired amount is invested    you could always move on to a different employer and ask some really good questions about their 401k.   which leads me back to talking with hr   with the current technology shortage making a few tweaks to the 401 k is a very cheap way to make their employees happy if you can score a 1099 contracting gig you can do a sep which allows up to a whopping 53 k per year   no match but with typically higher pay sometimes overtime and a high contribution limit you can easily make up for it

if i were in your shoes i 'd probably take the vanguard total market fund with admiral shares then worry about further diversification when there is more in the account many times when you diversify in to multiple funds you end up with a lot of specific security overlap   a lot of the big s&p 500 constituents will be in all of them etc   so while the 10 or so basis points difference in expense ratio does n't seem like enough of a reason not to spread in to multiple funds once you split up the money between large mid small cap funds and growth value dividend funds you 'll probably have a collection of holdings that looks substantially similar to a total market fund anyway unless you 're looking for international or some specific industry segment exposure and all of the money is going to equities anyway an inexpensive total market fund makes a lot of sense

over time gold has mainly a hedge against inflation based on its scarcity value that is unless finds some killer app for it that would also make it a good investment the usual ones electronic medicine dental do n't really do the trick it should be noted that gold performs its inflation hedge function over a long period of time say $ 50-$100 years   over shorter periods of time it will spike for other reasons the latest classic example was in 1979 80 and the main reason in my opinion was the iranian hostage crisis inflation was secondary this was a political risk situation but one that was not an attack on 52 u.s. no less was an attack on the u.s. dollar but gold got so pricey that it lost its inflation hedge function for some two decades until about 2000 inflation has not been a notable factor in 2011 but political risk has been witness egypt libya and potentially syria and other countries put another way gold is less of an investment that a hedge and not just against inflation

many web sites and articles warn against buying former rental cars    because people renting these cars often them rental cars are typically driven by people over 25 these are typically people with some financial means air travel credit card additionally rental cars are subject to frequent inspection and likely to be on tighter maintenance schedules than many owners would keep so while some people may drive a rental harder than they would their own car it 's not typical and not likely to result in some hidden damage that makes a rental less desirable all else being equal on the used car market does the fact that they sell the car mean during this time suggest that they know the car 's cost of further maintenance or other costs will be higher or is there another reason they sell at this time which has a calculated advantage to them but which is less than idea statistically for me the purchaser rental companies buy at incredible volumes as such some manufacturers have programs where they will buy back used cars from the rental company at a set price and/or time other incentives are guaranteed depreciation wherein the manufacturer will make up the difference if the used vehicle does n't sell for a set percentage of it 's purchase price after a set amount of time outside of these incentive programs rental companies also get substantial volume discounts and they typically are buying base models which hold value better than their higher trim counterparts according to kbb market analyst so the conventional wisdom about depreciation does n't really apply the timing of their sales is primarily based on their purchasing arrangements and their desire to keep an up to date fleet not on projected maintenance repair costs the best you can do with any used car purchase is to test drive get a pre purchase inspection and review whatever history is available

the fundamental concept of the time value of money is that money now is worth more than the same amount of money later because of what you can do with money between now and later if i gave you a choice between $ 1000 right now and $ 1000 in six months if you had any sense whatsoever you would ask for the money now that 's because in the six months you could use the thousand dollars in ways that would improve your net worth between now and six months from now paying down debt making investments in your home or business saving for retirement by investing in interest bearing instruments like stocks bonds mutual funds etc there 's absolutely no advantage and every disadvantage to waiting 6 months to receive the same amount of money that you could get now however if i gave you a choice between $ 1000 now and $ 1100 in six months that might be a harder question you will get more money later so the question becomes how much can you improve your net worth in six months given $ 1000 now if it 's more than $ 100 you still want the money now but if nothing you can do will make more than $ 100 or if there is a high element of risk to what you can do that will make $ 100 that might in fact cause you to lose money then you might take the increased guaranteed money later there are two fundamental formulas used to calculate the time value of money the future value and the present value formulas they 're basically the same formula to solve for different values the future value formula answers the question how much money will i have if i invest a certain amount now at a given rate of return for a specified time the formula is fv = pv where fv is the future value how much you 'll have later pv is the present value how much you 'll have now r is the periodic rate of return the percentage that your money will grow in each unit period of time say a month or a year and n is the number of unit periods of time in the overall time span now you asked what compounding is the theory is very simple if you put an amount of money the principal into an investment that pays you a rate of return interest and do n't touch the account in effect reinvesting the interest you earn in the account back into the same account then after the first period during which interest is calculated and paid you 'll earn interest on not just the original principal but the amount of interest already earned this allows your future value to grow faster than if you were paid simple interest where interest is only ever paid on the principal for instance if you withdrew the amount of interest you earned each time it was paid that 's accounted for in the future value formula using the term if you 're earning 8 a year on your investment then after 1 year you 'll have 108 of your original investment then after two years you 'll have = instead of just 116 which you 'd get with simple interest that advantage to compounding does n't sound like much of an advantage but stay tuned after ten years you 'll have instead of 180 of your original investment after 20 you 'll have instead of 260 and after 30 your money will have grown by over 1000 as opposed to a measly 340 you 'd get with simple interest the present value formula is based on the same fundamental formula but it 's solved for the pv term and assumes you 'll know the fv amount the present value formula answers questions like how much money would i have to invest now in order to have x dollars at a specific future time that formula is pv = fv where all the terms mean the same thing except that r in this form is typically called the discount rate because its purpose here is to lower discount a future amount of money to show what it 's worth to you now now the discount rate or yield rate used in these calculations is n't always the actual yield rate that the investment promises or has been shown to have over time investors will calculate the discount rate for a stock or other investment based on the risks they see in the company 's financial numbers or in the market as a whole the models used by professional investors to quantify risk are rather complex the people who come up with them for the big investment banks are called quants and the typical quant graduates with an advanced math degree and is hired out of college with a six figure salary but it 's typically enough for the average investor to understand that there is an inherent risk in any investment and the longer the time period the higher the chance that something bad will happen that reduces the return on your investment this is why the 30-year treasury note carries a higher interest rate than the 10-year t note which carries higher interest than the 6-month 1-year and 5-year t bills in most cases you as an individual investor or even an institutional investor like a hedge fund manager for an investment bank can not control the rate of return on an investment the actual yield is determined by the market as a whole in the form of people buying and selling the investments at a price that coupled with the investment 's payouts determines the yield the risk return numbers are instead used to make a buy don't buy decision on a particular investment if the amount of risk you foresee in an investment would require you to be earning 10 to justify it but in fact the investment only pays 6 then do n't buy it if however you 'd be willing to accept 4 on the same investment given your perceived level of risk then you should buy

my two cents i am a pension actuary and see the performance of funds on a daily basis is it normal to see down years yes absolutely it 's a function of the directional bias of how the portfolio is invested in the case of a 401(k that almost always mean a positive directional bias being long now in your case i see two issues the amount of drawdown over one year it is atypical to have a 14 loss in a little over a year given the market conditions this means that you nearly experienced the entire drawdown of the sp500 which your portfolio is highly correlated to and you have no protection from the downside the use of so called target date funds their very implication makes no sense essentially they try to generate a particular return over the elapsed time until retirement the issue is that the market is by all statistical accounts random with positive drift it can be expected to move up in the long term this positive drift is due to the fact that people should be paid to take on risk so if you need the money 20 years from now what 's the big deal well the issue is that no one and i repeat no one knows when the market will experience long down moves so you happily experience positive drift for 20 years and your money grows to a decent size then right before you retire the market 20%+ of your investments will you recoup these damages most likely yes but will that be in the timeframe you need the market does n't care if you need money or not so here is my advice if you are comfortable taking control of your money see if you can roll your money into an ira some 401(k plans will permit this or if you contribute less that the 401(k contribution limit you make want to just contribute to an ira be mindful of the annual limits in this case you can set up a self directed account here you will have the flexibility to diversify and take action as necessary and by diversify i do n't mean that buy lots of different stuff garbage i mean focus on uncorrelated assets you can get by on a handful of etfs spy tlt qqq ect these all have liquid options available once you build a base you can lower basis by writing covered calls against these positions this is allowed in almost all ira accounts in my opinion and i see this far too often your potential and drive to take control of your assets is far superior than the so called professionals or advisors they will 99 of the time stick you in a target date fund and hope that they make their basis points on your money and retire before you do not saying everyone is unethical but its hard to care about your money more than you will

during the actual decline there 's very little money to be made and a lot to lose when housing prices tank everybody loses the banks are exposed to higher risk of mortgage defaults insurers start having to pay out more for gas leaks claiming over leveraged homes     realtors starve because their commissions go down even as foreclosures put more homes on the market and people faced with financial uncertainty will stay put in their current homes instead of moving elsewhere and and contractors go broke because nobody wants to spend cash on a new home or major reno that looks like a losing investment there can be some bright spots smaller hardware stores will make money as people do relatively small diy projects to improve the condition of their current home the larger stores get this business too but it tends to be more than offset by the loss of contractor business far more lucrative and something the and true values do n't really get in on of course the grave robbers do well gold buyers pawn shops repo firms these guys eat well when other people are defaulting on loans or have to sell their stuff for fast cash most of these businesses are not publicly traded one thing that was seen was increased revenues at discount retailers like wal mart dollar general etc when things are bad people in the middle class who had avoided these stores for image or morality reasons learn to swallow their pride and buy discount store brands for half the price of national brand names that lessens the blow felt by the discount retailers as overall consumer spending decreases the pie shrinks but the discount retailers get a bigger slice of the mandatory spending on food clothing etc and the higher level retailers get it in the shorts when the pie starts to grow again as consumer spending picks back up the discount retailers retain their percentage for a while as the fickle middle class can afford to buy more from the discount retailer but ca n't yet afford to take their business back to the shopping mall stores this produces a flatter offset price graph for discount retailers through the business cycle they do n't lose as early or as much as everyone else in a major downturn and they turn it around sooner while everyone else may still be on the way down but as everything gets better for everyone on the upswing it 's less great for the discount guys as they start losing customers and their dollars to competitors with better stuff even as the ones they keep spend more this does n't generally manifest as a true negative correlation but it can be a good hedge the number one money making investment in a tanking economy is gold when things go down the crapper everyone wants gold so if you see the train wreck coming far enough in advance you can make a big move to gold and really make some money off that investment for instance when the first about arm adjustments and mass defaults reached the public consciousness in gold bullion jumped from about $ 400 to over $ 700 in a nine month period it cooled off again in 06 07 but only to about $ and then in late 07 it steadily climbed to peak at $ even if you got in late an investment of $ 1000 in july 07 in bulk gold would have netted you $ 650 in one year that 's a 65 apy then the economy hit bottom and a lot of investors gold for investments they thought would pull back out of their holes quickly for just a little while in 08 gold was down to $ 700 again then came all the government reports unemployment not home prices still declining a lot of banks still hiding just how bad their position was if you had seen that it was going to be bad bad bad like a lot of now billionaire hedge fund investors did a $ 1000 investment in gold in july 05 and then cashing out at the tops of the peaks and buying back in at the major would be worth almost $ 4000 today that 's a 400 return over 7 years or an annual average yield of 57 there simply has n't been anything like that in the last 7 years

how i understand it is supply demand affect price of stock    negatively positively respectively correct volume is the amount of buying selling activity in these stocks more    volume = more fluctuation right sort of   higher volume means higher liquidity   that is a stock that is traded more is easier to trade   it does n't necessarily mean more fluctuation and in the real world it often means that these are well understood stocks with a high amount of analyst coverage   this tends towards these stocks not being as volatile as smaller stocks with less liquidity company revenue and profit will help an investor predict company    growth that is one factor in a stock price   there are certain stocks that you would buy without them making a profit because their future revenue looks potentially explosive   however these stocks are very risky and are bubble prone if you 're starting out in the share market it 's generally a good idea to invest in index funds i am not a broker my advice should not be taken as financial advice   these funds aggregate risk by holding a lot of different companies   also statistics have shown that over time buying and holding index funds long term tends to dramatically outperform other investment strategies particularly for people with low amounts of capital

it 's not unusual undesirable if everyone prepaid their mortgage banks would not like this but we 're in no danger of that also the amount you are pre paying is not so significant as to make them pay special attention in many cases when a borrower pre pays they will not continue to do so over the life of the loan since it 's so easy to stop at any time and the extra payments are voluntary depending on who originated the it might be sold even more often than in your case it 's no longer commonplace for a bank to hold a mortgage to maturity now that banks and other institutions have separated the origination of the loan from its servicing it 's likely that your mortgage was bundled with others through a process called securitization and will be bought sold based on the bank 's need for or to balance out the maturity of its assets and liabilities whether they need more cash now versus later or based on the types of ways your bank has decided that it wants to make money versus farming out other types of business to others what would substantially change the value of your mortgage to a bank is if it were performing ie you are paying on time but then became non performing ie you fall behind in your payments it 's also possible that if you have a very small mortgage or principal balance that there is very little risk to the bank and little difference between the present and future values of your loan but banks do n't typically make these types of transactions based on the characteristics of an individual loan

it really confuses me how businesses and politicians fail to see how much of a problem this is even beyond issues is social inequality an economy in which the middle class is earning less is an economy with less growth potential    when a company is squeezing employee wages on par with other businesses the end result is a smaller pie for them to carve out the look at their immediate bottom line in which the weight if wages has gone down but fail to see that they have weakened the market for broad based community serving markets at least and so are shrinking demand    even if you assume that only 80 of those $ 93 billion are for low and middle class wages that is still $ 74 billion less demand    for decades we 've heard that the middle class is what fuels the economy yet the fact that the wages if the middle class are waning are seen as trivial and nothing to worry about

publication covers this in a fairly specific manner page 11 section are you covered by an employer plan specifies the form w-2 you receive from your employer has a box    used to indicate whether you were covered for the year    the retirement plan box should be checked if you were    covered so by default if that 's checked you 're covered   590 does go into more detail though assuming you 're covered under a defined contribution plan a 401k for example defined contribution plan generally you are covered    by a defined contribution plan for a tax year if amounts are    contributed or allocated to your account for the plan year    that ends with or within that tax year   tax year tax year your tax year is the annual accounting period    you use to keep records and report income and expenses    on your income tax return for almost all people the tax    year is the calendar year further they cover issues related to an employee leaving dec. 31 very specifically a special rule applies to certain plans in which it is not    possible to determine if an amount will be contributed to    your account for a given plan year if for a plan year no    amounts have been allocated to your account that are attributable    to employer contributions employee contributions    or by the last day of the plan year and    contributions are discretionary for the plan year you are    not covered for the tax year in which the plan year ends if    after the plan year ends the employer makes a contribution    for that plan year you are covered for the tax year in    which the contribution is made example example mickey was covered by a profit sharing plan    and left the company on december 31 2014 the plan    year runs from july 1 to june 30 under the terms of the    plan employer contributions do not have to be made but    if they are made they are contributed to the plan before    the due date for filing the company 's tax return such contributions    are allocated as of the last day of the plan year    and allocations are made to the accounts of individuals    who have any service during the plan year as of june 30    2015 no contributions were made that were allocated to    the june 30 2015 plan year and no had been    allocated within the plan year in addition as of that date    the company was not obligated to make a contribution for    such plan year and it was impossible to determine    whether or not a contribution would be made for the plan    year on december 31 2015 the company decided to    contribute to the plan for the plan year ending june 30    2015 that contribution was made on february 15 2016    mickey is an active participant in the plan for his 2016 tax    year but not for his 2015 tax year mickey is in a similar but different circumstance and it 's clear from the irs 's treatment of his circumstance that you would be in the same boat just a year less off but be aware given mickey 's situation that it 's theoretically possible for them to make another contribution next year as mickey had depending on when their plan year etc ends so from the irs 's point of view everything you said the company did is correct   they paid you in january contributed to your 401k as a result of that paycheck and thus you were officially considered covered for 2015

from my experience and friends experiences i can say that there are advantages and disadvantages for paying off your mortgage quickly basically it depends on these factors the type of the mortgage its interest rate your financial stability your skills in making investments and other outside factors such as inflation liquidity cost etc paying it off means you save on interest ratings you decrease investment risks and your investment rates are taxable disadvantages are that you can not use this money for investing you can not use this money for tax deductions and that in a state of inflation not paying it off in advance could save you a lot of money   however i always recommend to read some more on websites that deal with mortgages and speak with the mortgage expert in your bank just acquire enough information to make a good assessment an interesting article on this topic the advantages and disadvantages of paying off your mortgage

i can say that i got x dollars from an account like income benefits but where do i credit that money to expenses groceries yes does n't feel right since i never actually spent that money on food   you did did n't you you got food i 'm guessing there 's an established convention for this already   doubt it established conventions in accounting are for businesses and more specifically public companies so you can find a gaap or guidelines on how to book benefits hint salary expense but it is not something you may find useful in your own household accounting do what is most convenient for you since it is a double booking system you need to have an account on the other side expenses groceries does n't feel right add expenses groceries benefits or expenses benefits or whatever when you do your expense and cash flow reports you can exclude both the income and the expense benefits accounts if you track them separately so that they do n't affect your tracking of the real expenses

your question is as you have n't provided enough information i.e. if those shares cost $ 1000 and you have $ 50000 or any number above $ 1000 of cash available in the account then you ca n't possibly free ride i think your understanding of the free ride rule is incorrect basically what this rule is stating is that you have to have the cash when the trade is placed in order to settle the trade otherwise you are taking on margin which you ca n't do in a cash account so at order entry you have to have the cash to cover the purchase so it 's able to be settled if you do no problem and you can sell that stock before trade settlement there is no law that says you have to hold it past trade settlement however you can not spend the same dollar more than once before it settles   this site does a good job explaining this more with examples

to add to what other have stated i recently just decided to purchase a home over renting some more and i 'll throw in some of my thoughts about my decision to buy i closed a couple of weeks ago note that i live in texas and that i 'm not knowledgeable in real estate other than what i learned from my experiences in the area when i am located it depends on the market and location you have to compare what renting will get you for the money vs what buying will get you for me buying seemed like a better deal overall when just comparing monthly payments this is including insurance and taxes you will need to stay at a house that you buy for at least 5 7 years you first couple years of payments will go almost entirely towards interest it takes a while to build up equity if you can pay more towards a mortgage do it you need to have money in the bank already to close the minimum down payment at least in my area is 3.5 for an fha loan if you put 20 down you do n't need to pay mortgage insurance which is essentially throwing money away you will also have add in closing costs i ended up purchasing a new construction my monthly payment went up from $ 1200 to $ 1600 after taxes insurance etc but the house is bigger newer more energy efficient much closer to my work in a more expensive area and in a market that is expected to go up in value i had all of my closing costs except for the deposit taken care of by the lender and builder so all of my closing costs i paid out of pocket went to the deposit equity or the bank if i decide to move and need to sell then i will get a lot losing some to selling costs and interest of the money i have put in to the house back out of it when i do sell and i have the option to put that money towards another house to sum it all up i 'm not paying a difference in monthly costs because i bought a house i had my closing costs taking care of and just had to pay the deposit which goes to equity i will have to do maintenance myself but i do n't mind fixing what i can fix and i have a builder 's warranties on most things in the house   to really get a good idea of whether you should rent or buy you need to talk to a realtor and compare actual costs it will be more expensive in the short term but should save you money in the long term

i think you 're thinking that in debt does n't just mean owes a debt but somehow means owes more debt in total than the assets that condition owing money without offsetting assets is having a negative net worth if you have a mortgage then you have a debt and you are in debt you may have a positive net worth if you have equity in the house and your car and such like and have cash in the bank you may have a negative net worth if you owe more than you own but either way you are technically in debt knowing that it 's not surprising that 75 of americans are in debt it 's surprising that 25 are not they have no credit card no car loan no mortgage no line of credit no student loans is it because they 've paid all that off or because they are deadly poor and own nothing and ca n't be lent anything you ca n't just say it 's bad to have debt it 's bad to have too much debt to have a negative net worth to be in the habit of borrowing to finance a lifestyle you ca n't actually afford and so on but it 's perfectly normal to have a debt or two that 's how our system mostly works

the rule that i know is six months of income stored in readily accessible savings e.g. a savings or money market account    others have argued that it should be six months of expenses which is of course easier to achieve   i would recommend against that partially because it is easier to achieve   the other issue is that people are more prone to underestimate their expenses than their income   finally if you base it on your current expenses then budget for savings and have money left over you often increase your expenses   sometimes obviously e.g. a new car and sometimes not e.g. more restaurants or clubs   income increases are rarer and easier to see    either way you can make that six months shorter or longer   six months is both feasible and capable of handling difficult emergencies   six years would n't be feasible   one month would n't get you through a major emergency    examples of emergencies    your savings can be in any of multiple forms   for example someone was talking about buying real estate and renting it   that 's a form of savings but it can be difficult to do withdrawals   stocks and bonds are better but what if your emergency happens when the market is down   part of how emergency funds operate is that they are readily accessible    another issue is that a main goal of savings is to cover retirement   so people put them in tax privileged retirement accounts   the downside of that is that the money is not then available for emergencies without paying penalties   you get benefits from retirement accounts but that 's in exchange for limitations    it 's much easier to spend money than to save it   there are many options and the world makes it easy to do   emergency funds make people really think about that portion of savings   and thinking about saving before spending helps avoid situations where you savings    let 's pretend that retirement accounts do n't exist perhaps they do n't in your country   your savings is some mix of stocks and bonds   you have a mortgaged house   you 've budgeted enough into stocks and bonds to cover retirement   now you have a major emergency    as i understand your proposal you would then take that money out of the stocks and bonds for retirement   but then you no longer have enough for retirement   going forward you will have to scrimp to get back on track    an emergency fund says that you should do that early   because if you 're used to spending any level of money cutting that is painful   but if you 've only ever spent a certain level not increasing it is much easier   the longer you delay optional expenses the less important they seem    beforehand also helps avoid the situation where the emergency happens at the end of your career   it 's one thing to scrimp for fifteen years at fifty   what 's your plan if you would have an emergency at sixty five   or later   then you 're reducing your living standard at retirement    now maybe you save more than necessary   it 's not unknown   but it 's not typical either   it is far more common to encounter someone who is n't saving enough than too much

this might sound harsh but the first thing i would suggest is to stop making excuses   i was n't able to continue due to pressure from college and family the college i went to was horrible employers can very easily hire foreign work force for    very cheap for example as a citizen if i work $ 10 an hour they can    get someone from outside to work for $ 5 per hour there 's no guarantee that the project will succeed i can not really work and at the same time develop software on my free    time   despite my failures in the past i was not the main person that 's    responsible for those failures even if all of this is true it 's not helping you move forward and it seems to be getting in the way of creating a good action plan and motivating yourself to succeed if you believe based on past experiences that you are doomed to fail then you are indeed doomed to fail you need to take a step back and re evaluate your current circumstances and what you can do to reach your goals you have a couple of things working in your favor here it 's great that you are debt free that already puts you ahead of a lot of your peers   you have the option of living with your parents presumably for no rent or at least much lower rent than you would have to pay if you move out this is worth literally thousands of $ for every year you stay now onto your questions 1 should i quit regular programming for a normal job because i never programming so i can move out of my parents home are you being paid for this regular programming if so are you being paid more than minimum wage if not it 's perfectly acceptable to consider alternative ways to spend your time and generate income however this does n't have to be at the expense of living with your parents have you thought about getting a new or second job while still living with them if you absolutely must move out of your parent 's home consider renting a room in a house with other people to keep the rent costs to a minimum that way even if your main job is low paying you should be able to put aside some money each month for future endeavors   2 should i monetize programming and gamble with the future what does this mean are you thinking you 'll write a mobile app and sell thousands of copies for each that would indeed be a big gamble but maybe that 's not what you meant so you 'll need to clarify 3 would it be wise to essentially quit programming for the sake of a minimum wage job i 'm not sure how this is different from question 1 so i 'll reiterate what i said there moving out is going to be expensive you can still do it but you 're asking on a personal finance site where the focus is usually how to minimize living costs and maximize income without knowing more about where you live employment opportunities cost of living the default recommendation is usually to save money by staying in your parents house tldr do n't focus on anyone else they are not preventing you from getting the job you want look at your own skills and qualifications not just programming consider all of your abilities what are you good at who might need those skills what is the cost of reaching those people commute time moving nearer what is the reward if the reward exceeds the cost start approaching those people show them what you can do

i can think of the following situations in which one could see a trade occur between the visible best bid offer 1 on a public exchange people have posted hidden limit orders with either bid prices above the best visible bid or offers below the best visible offer and incoming orders have executed against this hidden 2 some orders may have been matched in dark pools which offer mid point matching where buy and sell orders are matched using the mid point of the best available publicly posted bid and offer as the reference price and which executed trades are then reported to the public markets or 3 some broker has traded off exchange directly with a client and is now reporting the trade to the public as is often required now how exactly any of the above situations indicates that a trend is about to come to an end i do not know 1 exchanges often match orders on a price visibility time basis whereby the orders are by price better prices get to trade first then by visibility visible orders get to trade first then by time first come first serve

all of these frameworks markowitz mean cara etc   sit inside a more general framework which is that returns are good and risk lack of certainty in the returns is bad and there 's a tradeoff between the two encoded as some kind of risk aversion number   you can measure lack of certainty in returns by vol weighted sum of higher moments but even sector region concentration   similarly do i want more returns or log returns or returns in the context of this tradeoff   you do n't need any formal notion of utility at that point and i do n't know what formal ideas of utility beyond i want more returns and less risk really buys you the sharpe ratio only really gets its meaning because you 've got some formal asset pricing notion of utility    in my view the moment that you 're putting constraints on the portfolio e.g. long only max weights do n't deviate too much from the benchmark really you 're operating in this more general framework anyway and you 're not in utility land anymore

yikes not always is this the case for example you purchased a new car with an interest rate of 5 even higher why pay that much interest throughout the loan sometimes trading in the vehicle at a lower rate will get you a lower or sometimes the same payment even with an upgraded newer safer technology design the trade off when going from new to new the car may depreciate faster than what you would save from the interest savings on a new loan sometimes the tactics used to get you back to the dealership could be a little harsh but if you do your research long before you inquire you may come out on the winning end look at what you 're paying in interest and consider it a re finance of your car but taking advantage of the manufacturer 's low apr special to off set the costs

you are right on track with your idea of setting up a separate account for invoiced income create a new account with the type other asset and call it receivables or something similar every time you invoice a client enter a credit to this account with the amount of the invoice once the client pays and you deposit a check enter a transfer from the receivables account to the bank account edit i overlooked that you wish to account for not yet invoiced income i think that 's a bad idea it will become confusing and will give you the false sense that your financial condition is better than it really is there are plenty of stories about businesses that have stellar sales but fail because of lack of cash flow the business bills become due before it gets paid by its own customers

if you want to see a more academic version of this look up weighted average cost of capital wacc    it 's a formula that tells you how much it costs for a company to raise $ 1 of capital whether it be through issuing bonds or stocks    one thing you learn is that there are times that if you take on loans even if you do n't need it you can raise shareholder value and therefore the total company the thought process is as it states in the article above that a company can issue debt for cheaper than issue shares and it will have extra cash which it can use to get a better return than its net effective interest rate    i tried to give an example but i only ended up what it says in the article anyhow look up wacc and you 'll understand the fundamentals

you do n't start out buying a shopping mall you have to work up to it   you can start with any amount and work up to a larger amount for me i saved 30 of my investing in stocks for 8 years   it was tough to live on less but i had a goal to buy passive income   i put down this money to buy 3 houses putting 35 down and maintaining enough cash to make 5 years of payments   i rented out the houses making a cap of 15   the cap is the net payment per year cost of the property where the net accounts for taxes and repairs   i did not spend any of the profits but i did start saving less salary   after 5 years of appreciation mortgage payments and rental profit i sold one house to get a loan for a convenience store   buildings go on the market all the time it takes 14 years to directly recoup an investment at a 7 cap which is the average for a commercial property sale   many people cash out for this reason it 's slow but steady growth though the earnings on property appreciation is a nice bonus   owning real estate is a long term game after a long time of earning you can reinvest but it comes with the risk of bad or no tenants you can start both slower and smaller just make sure you 're picking up assets not liabilities   like investing in cars is generally bad unless you are sure it will appreciate

when you are investing for 40 years you will have taxable events before retirement   you 'll need to pay tax along the way which will eat away at your gains for example in your taxable account any dividends and capital gain distributions will need taxes paid each year   in your 401(k or ira these are not taxable until retirement in addition what happens if you want to change investments before retirement   in your taxable account taxes on the capital gains will be due at that time but in a retirement account you can change investments anytime you like without having to pay taxes early finally when you do pull money out of your 401(k at retirement it will be taxed at whatever your tax rate is at retirement   after you retire your income will probably be lower than when you were working so your tax rate might be less

in the case of mutual funds net asset value nav is the price used to buy and sell shares nav is just the value of the underlying assets which are in turn valued by their underlying holdings and future earnings so if a fund hands out a billion dollars it stands to reason their market cap is a billion dollars less shareholder 's net worth is equal in either scenario but after the dividend is paid they are more liquid for people who need investment income to live on dividends are a cheap way to hold stocks and get regular payments versus having to sell part of your portfolio every month   but for people who want to hold their investment in the market for a long long time dividends only increase the rate at which you have to buy for mutual funds this is n't a problem you buy the funds and tell them to reinvest for free so because of that it 's a prohibited practice to sell dividends to clients

a lower price is likely to be slightly more attractive to sellers than paying an equivalent amount in closing costs the seller is going to be paying the commission on the higher sale price and will net slightly less money it is common in my experience to ask for closing costs   the generic answer for your questions about how it is spent depends on the bank and type of loan in general you will not be able to walk away with the cash if closing costs are less than the concession but they can be applied to funding escrow and points transfer fees etc there is the potential to lose the concession if there are n't sufficient closing costs i am fairly certain that there is n't any tax differences between the two in the us

this person could buy another car at any moment without any money problems so i do n't really see any point in insuring especially with such a ridiculously high price compared to the extremely low risk convenience   if you self insure then an accident means that you have to make arrangements to get the car fixed evaluated etc   if you buy insurance your insurer would prefer to do all that   they argue with the mechanic over prices the lawyer over liability etc    and of course rich people need more liability insurance than other people not less   so part of that $ 1400 is probably money that your friend would have to pay regardless

these sort of issues in structuring your personal finances relative to expenses can get complicated quickly as your example demonstrates   i would recommend a solution that reduces duplication as much as and depending on what information you 're interested in tracking you could set it up in very different ways one solution would be to create virtual sub accounts of your assets and to record the source of money rather than the destination   thus when you do an expense report you can limit on the his or hers asset accounts and see only the expenses which pertain to those accounts likewise for liabilities credit cards if on the other hand you 're more interested in a running sum of rather than create me and spouse accounts at every leaf of the expense tree it would make much more sense to create top level accounts for expenses his etc and expenses hers etc   using this model you could create only the sub expense accounts that apply for each of your spending with matching account structures for common accounts

a share is more than something that yields dividends it is part ownership of the company and all of its assets if the company were to be liquidated immediately the shareholders would get a proportion of the net value assets liabilities of the company because they own it if a firm is doing well then its assets are increasing i.e. more cash assets from profits therefore the value of the underlying company has risen and the intrinsic value of the shares has also increased the price will not reflect the current value of the firms assets and liabilities because it will also include the net present value of expected future flows working out the expected future flows is a science on par with and reading chicken so do n't expect to work out why a company is trading at a price so much higher than current assets liabilities or so much lower in companies that are expected to fail this speculation is in addition to price speculation that you mention in the question

if you know you will have a big bill like braces and you fully expect to hit the deductible then it can make sense the deductible can trip some people up because if they put too much into the limited purpose fsa and do n't hit the deductible for the regular insurance policy they ca n't get to all the money in the fsa because you have the ability to spend the potential money in the fsa before all the money has been contributed it can allow you to make that payment for the braces in january i did this the first year we had the hsa i knew i needed to pay a dental bill early in the year but the hsa would only have a few hundred dollars at that time so i used the limited purpose fsa to be able to make that payment this could also work if you spent a lot of money in the previous year because you have the ability to adjust how much money goes into the hsa each each pay period this idea does keep the option open to fully fund the hsa if your finances improve regarding the deductible   the law limits what you can use the limited purpose fsa for dental and vision only there is an exception if you hit the deductible for the high deductible insurance policy then you can use the funds in the limited purpose fsa for any medical reason   when i did this a few years ago i needed to send extensive paperwork to the company holding the funds before they would release the funds for dental once i sent them proof that i had met the deductible then any medical expense after that date could use the fsa with minimal paperwork if you fully fund the fsa beyond the cost of the braces and then have a light year medical expense wise you might not be able to spend all money in the fsa by the deadline regarding state taxes   i saw no difference in my states virginia treatment of the funds the state taxable income number was exactly the same as the federal taxable income number it did not treat the money in the fsa differently than the money in the hsa

this is incentive financing simply put the car company is n't in the business of making money by buying government bonds they 're in the business of making money by selling cars if you are qualified from a credit standpoint and want to buy a $ 20k car on any given sunday you 'll typically be offered a loan of between 6 and 9 let 's say this loan is for three years and you can offer $ 4000 down payment and/or trade the required monthly payment on the remaining $ 16k at the high end of 9 is $ which over 3 years means you 'll pay $ in interest now that may sound like a good chunk of change and for the ordinary individual it is possibly enough that you decide not to buy today now let 's say all other things being equal that the company is offering 0.9 incentive financing same price same down payment same loan term your payments over 3 years decrease to $ and over the same loan term you would only pay $ in interest you save over $ in interest over three years which for you is again a decent chunk of change theoretically the car company 's losing that same $ in interest by offering this deal and depending on how it 's getting the money it lends you most financial companies are middlemen getting money from bond buying investors who expect a rate of return that could be a real loss and not just opportunity cost but that incentive got you to walk in their door and not their competitor 's it helped convince you to buy the $ 20,000 car the gross margin on that car price minus direct costs is typically 20 for the dealer plus another 20 for the manufacturer so by giving up the $ 2,000 on the financing side the dealer and manufacturer just earned themselves 4 times that much on top of that by buying that car you 're committing to buy the parts for the car a side business with even higher margins of which the car company gets a pretty big chunk you may even be required to use dealer service while the car 's under warranty in order to keep the warranty valid another when you get right down to it the loss from the incentive financing is drowned in the gross profits they make from selling the car to you now in reality it 's a fine balance the percentages i mentioned are gross margins earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization sales general and administrative costs basically just revenue minus direct cost of goods sold add in all these side costs and you get a net margin of only about 3.5 of revenue so your $ 20k car purchase may only make the car company 's stakeholders $ 700 on the sale plus slightly higher net margins on parts and service over the life of the car because incentive financing is typically only offered through the company 's own financing subsidiary the loss is n't in the form of a cost paid but simply a revenue not realized but it can still move a car company from net positive to net negative earnings if the program is too successful this is why not everyone does it and not all at the same time if you 're selling enough cars without it why give away money   typically these incentives are offered for two reasons to clear out old cars or excess inventory or to maintain ground against a competitor 's stronger sales numbers keeping cars on a lot ready to sell is expensive and so is not having your brand driving around on the street turning heads and their name on the minds of potential customers

whether you can establish an hsa has nothing to do with your employment status or your retirement plan it has to do with the type of medical insurance you have   the insurance company should be able to tell you if your plan is hsa compatible to be hsa compatible a plan must have a high deductible in 2014 $ 1250 for an individual plan or $ 2500 for a family plan it must not cover any expenses before the deductible that is you can not have any first dollar coverage for doctor 's visits prescription drug coverage etc there are some exceptions for services considered preventive care there are also limits on the out of pocket max i think that 's it but the insurance company should know if their plans qualify or not if you have a plan that is hsa compatible but also have another plan that is not hsa compatible then you do n't qualify and all that said if you are covered under your husband 's medical insurance and your husband already has an hsa why do you want to open a second one there 's no gain there is a family limit on contributions to an hsa $ in 2014 you do n't get double the limit by each opening your own hsa if you have two hsa 's the combined total of your contributions to both accounts must be within the limit if you have some administrative reason for wanting to keep separate accounts yes you can open your own and in that case you and your husband are each allowed to contribute half the limit or you can agree to some other division   i suppose you might want to have an account in your own name so that you control it especially if you and your husband have different ideas about managing finances though how to resolve such problems would be an entirely different question personally i do n't think the solution is to get into power struggles over who controls what but whatever maybe there 's some advantage to having assets in your own name if you and your husband were to divorce probably not though i think a divorce court pretty much ignores whose name assets are in when dividing up property   see irs publication 969 for lots and lots of details

instead of giving part of their profits back as dividends management puts it back into the company so the company can grow and produce higher profits when these companies do well there is high demand for them as in the long term higher profits equates to a higher share price so if a company invests in itself to grow its profits higher and higher one of the main reasons investors will buy the shares is in the expectation of future capital gains

you may be missing how countries like canada may have oil be more of the gdp than countries like the us in canada the lower oil prices may mean more of an economic slowdown with oil companies laying off staff canceling projects and some companies probably going under as some provinces like alberta are highly dependent on oil prices to drive most of the economy in contrast the us is n't quite as rich in energy sources and thus may not have the same issues would be my guess context matters here if the rate change helps everybody does n't that include the oil producing companies i 'd like to think so using basic logic what if the main reason for lowering rates was the economic fallout of the decrease in oil prices consider that the there would be the question of why do this now that has to be answered and the only main change is lower oil prices on a macroeconomic level

diversification is a risk mitigation strategy when you invest in equities you generally get a higher rate of return than a fixed income investment but you have risks a single company 's market value can decline for all sorts of reasons including factors outside of the control of management diversification lets you spread risk and concentrate on sectors that you feel offer the best value investing outside of your currency zone allows you to diversify more but also introduces currency risks which require a whole other level of understanding today investing in emerging markets is very popular for us investors because these economies are booming and us monetary policy has been weakening the dollar for some time a major bank failure in china or a flip to a strong dollar policy could literally implode those investments overnight at the end of the day invest in what you understand know the factors that can lower your investment value

are there any advantages to layaway there are two main advantages first when you pay the initial deposit the seller reserves the item for you at a given price this is helpful with unique products like a high end custom made watch if there is only one of those watches in the entire world then it 's nice to know that the seller wo n't sell it to anyone else while you 're getting together the remaining funds and the price you 're paying is locked in second layaway agreements often allow for a payment plan this is helpful for people who have a hard time saving up money for many it 's easier to make smaller monthly payments than a large one time payment of course the cost of layaway is that you 're $ 30,000 short for up to 6 months this money could be generating a significant amount of interest during a half year period you 'll need to make sure that reserving the item and locking in the price are worth this cost

i think your numbers are a little skewed towards urban areas   also i do n't think he was praising it but rather saying that it 's possible   in many rural areas it 's possible for a family to live off a year   this amount is very possible in a two earner family where both are making minimum wage   it 's not glamorous or particularly great but possible     for example there 's many places where i live rural iowa where rent is 200 a month or less   you can find used cars for 500 and most people around here are handy enough to make a 500 dollar car run from point a to b.   groceries are cheap here and what 's more many people buy food directly off the farm which is even cheaper   utilities run about 80 100 a month less if you have a well and     again it 's not a pretty lifestyle and does n't leave room for any rainy days but at the same time how is an employee 's lifestyle outside of work wal mart 's concern as long as they show up and do their work

no   1   everyone should cultivate the ability to see the ridiculous in themselves and in their situation   2   when you properly verify information the original source no longer matters   3   there is no media i feel i can trust right now so i might as well indulge in media i enjoy   i just need to verify information before i act on it

you are claiming that this idea is liberal   gt; the national government has a role in centrally planning restrictions on freedom   are you suggesting anarchy as s viable political economic system i doubt it given that everyone except anarchists see a role for the national and other levels of government to pass various laws    secondly how do you see the mic having anything to do with the government restricting freedoms

just an add on that i would argue cdo 's were created much earlier in the late 1960 's by newly created ginnie mae and fannie mae and eventually freddie mac in some of the original mortgage bundling programs   there were no private label mbs 's at the time but the practice had already started well before the 80 's   not trying to be a dick but i think it 's historically significant   edit to maybe double back a bit i know that they were passing through mortgages but i 'm actually not sure how the securitization actually worked if they were technically

the danger to your savings depends on how much sovereign debt your bank is holding   if the government defaults then the bank if it is holding a lot of sovereign debt could be short funds and not able to meet its obligations i believe default is the best option for the euro long term but it will be painful in the short term   yes historically governments have shut down banks to prevent people from withdrawing their money in times of crisis   see argentina circa 2001 or us during great depression   the government prevented people from withdrawing their money and people could do nothing while their money rapidly lost value see the emergency banking act where title i section 4 authorizes the us make it illegal for a bank to do business during a national emergency per section 2 without the approval of the president   fdr declared a banking holiday four days before the act was approved by congress   this documentary on the crisis in argentina follows a woman as she tries to withdraw her savings from her bank but the government has prevented her from withdrawing her money if the printing press is chosen to avoid default then this will allow banks and governments to meet their obligations   this however comes at the cost of a seriously debased euro i.e. higher prices   the euro could then soon become a hot potato as everyone tries to get rid of them before the ecb prints more   the us dollar could meet the same fate what can you do to avert these risks   yes you could exchange into another currency   unfortunately the printing presses of most of the major central banks today are in   this may preserve your savings temporarily i would purchase some gold or silver coins and keep them in your possession   this you from the banking system and gold and silver have value anywhere you go   the coins are also portable in case things really start to get interesting   attempt to purchase the coins with cash so there is no record of the purchase   this may not be possible

i do n't know much about individually or much about deutsche bank 's equity research division i was just trying to point out that the source of this information is a corporation that does not have stock in the debate between amazon walmart and the trucking companies and is a company that does n't really have an interest in this debate as a whole because deutsche bank is n't involved in the us consumer products market the us shipping market or the us trucking market it is secondhand knowledge at best and secondhand knowledge from a totally disinterested party at that

would they let you buy your own office 365 subscription   it 's actually not that expensive and imo it 's worth it   as a possible alternative depending on how tech savvy you are you could install sql express for free which now even includes ssrs   it 's not excel but i 've found that once you get past a certain level of complexity in excel you 're basically trying to emulate the functionality of sql with a real reporting tool talking to it   might as well take that leap if they 're forcing you to change anyway and get the massively more powerful platform that comes with it   make no mistake i love all things google and i 'm no microsoft fanboy but excel is the killer app of the modern office environment   there 's a good reason we 've seen countless free alternatives pop up and fade away over the years
