no gnucash does n't specifically provide a partner cash basis report function however gnucash reports are fairly easy to write if the data was readily available in your accounts it should n't be too hard to create a cash basis report the account setup is so flexible you might actually be able to create accounts for each partner and using standard dual entry accounting always debit and credit these accounts so the actual cash basis of each partner is shown and updated with every transaction i used gnucash for many years to manage my personal finances and those of my business sole proprietorship it really for data integrity i never lost data customer management decent ui for managing multiple clients and business partners and customer invoice generation they look pretty i found the user interface ugly and cumbersome gnucash does n't integrate cleanly with banks in the us it 's possible to import data but the process is very clunky and error prone apparently you can make bank transactions right from gnucash if you live in europe another very important limitation of gnucash to be aware of only one user at a time period if this is important to you do n't use gnucash to really use gnucash effectively you probably have to be an actual accountant i studied dual entry accounting a bit while using gnucash dual entry accounting in gnucash is a pain in the butt accurately recording certain types of transactions like stock buys sells requires fiddling with complicated split transactions i agree with hire a pro

you will need to set up accounts in your chart of accounts for each of the partners these are equity accounts where you can track your contributions share of the profits and losses and distributions you 're going to have to go back into the beginning years to get this right i 'm not sure what you mean by a built in function all the accounting software i 'm familiar with requires data entry of some kind you need to post your contributions and distributions to the correct accounts and close properly at year end you were indeed legally considered a partnership as soon as you started a for profit business venture together it 's a bug in the legal system that a written partnership agreement is not necessarily required you can form a partnership unknowingly btw a partnership actually is pretty far off from a sole proprietorship legally and the change from one person to two is major it 's the change from two to three or four or more that 's incremental i know you said you did n't want to consult a professional but i have to say that i think it 's worth the money to get your books set up by someone who has experience and can show you how to do it and get a separate bank account for the partnership if you have n't done so already and check with your state to see if there are any requirements regarding partnerships hope this helps irs circular 230 notice please note that any tax advice contained in this communication is not intended to be used and can not be used by anyone to avoid penalties that may be imposed under federal tax law

in the united states regulation of broker dealer credit is dictated by regulation t that for a non margin account 100 of a trade must be funded finra has supplemented that regulation with an rider rule rule which reads no member shall permit a customer other than a broker dealer or a designated      account to make a practice directly or indirectly of effecting transactions in a cash      account where the cost of securities purchased is met by the sale of the same securities      no member shall permit a customer to make a practice of selling securities with them in a      cash account which are to be received against payment from another broker dealer where      such securities were purchased and are not yet paid for a member transferring an      account which is subject to a regulation t 90-day freeze to another member firm shall      inform the receiving member of such 90-day freeze it is only funds from sold equities that are prohibited from being used to purchase securities this means that an equity in one 's account that is settled can be sold and can be purchased only with settled funds   once the amount required to purchase is in excess of the amount of settled funds no more purchases can be made so an equity sold by an account with settled funds can be repurchased immediately with the settled funds so long as the settled funds can fund the purchase margin a closed position is not considered a long or short since it is an account with one loan of security and one asset of security and one cash loan and one cash liability with the excess or deficit equity equal to any profit or loss respectively thus to the market only to the creditworthiness of the clearing settling chain only open positions are considered longs or shorts a long being a possession of a security and a short being a liability because they are exposed to the market since unsettled funds are not considered longs or shorts they are not by previous trades thus only the reg t rules apply to new and current positions cash vs margin a cash account can not purchase with unsettled funds   a margin account can   this means that a margin account could theoretically do an infinite amount of trades using unsettled funds   a cash account 's daily purchases are restricted to the amount of settled funds so once those are exhausted no more purchases can be made the opposite is true for cash accounts as well   unsettled securities can not be sold either in summation unsettled assets can not be traded in a cash account

how is that possible the mutual fund does n't pay taxes and passes along the tax bill to shareholders via distributions would be the short answer your basis likely changed as now you have bought more shares but i gained absolutely nothing from my dividend so how is it    taxable the fund has either realized capital gains dividends interest or some other form of income that it has to pass along to shareholders as the fund does n't pay taxes itself did i get screwed the first year because i bought into the fund too    late in the year perhaps if you do n't notice that your cost basis has changed here so that you 'll have lower taxes when you sell your shares   is anyone familiar with what causes this kind of situation of    receiving a taxable dividend that does n't actually increase the    account balance yes i am rather familiar with this the point to understand is that the fund does n't pay taxes itself but passes this along the shareholders that hold funds in tax advantaged accounts like 401ks and iras still get the distribution but are shielded from paying taxes on those gains at that point at time is it because i bought too late in the year   no it is because you did n't know the fund would have a distribution of that size that year some funds can have negative returns yet still have a capital gains distribution if the fund experiences enough redemptions that the fund had to sell appreciated shares in a security this is part of the risk in having stock funds in taxable accounts or is it because the fund had a negative return that year   no it is because you do n't understand how mutual funds and taxes work along with what distribution schedule the fund had do i wait until after the distribution date this year to buy i 'd likely consider it for taxable accounts yes however if you are buying in a tax advantaged account then there is n't that same issue

a market maker is someone that is contractually bound by the exchange to provide both bid and ask prices for a given volume e.g. 5000 shares a single market maker usually covers many stocks and a single stock is usually covered by many market makers the nyse has specialists that are market makers that also performed a few other roles in the management of trading for a stock and usually a single issue on the nyse is covered by only one market maker   market makers are often middlemen between brokers ignoring stuff like dark pools and the fact that brokers will often trade stocks internally among their own clients before going to the exchange   historically the market makers gave up buy sell discretion in exchange for being the go to guys for anyone wanting to trade in that stock when you told your broker to buy a stock for you he did n't hook you up with another retail investor he went to the market maker market makers would also sometimes find investors willing to step in when more liquidity was needed for a security they were like other floor traders they hung out on the exchange floors and interacted with traders to buy and sell stocks traders came to them when they wanted to buy one of the specialist 's issues there was no public order book just ticker tape and a quote it was up to the market maker to maintain that order book   since they are effectively forbidden from being one sided traders in a security their profit comes from the bid ask spread being the counter party to almost every trade they 'd make profit from always selling above where they were buying except when the price moved quickly the downside to this arrangement the spread goes to the market maker is just stating that the profit implicit in the spread gets consumed by the market maker with the switch to ecns the role of the market maker has changed for example forex trading firms tend to act as market makers to their customers on ecns the invisible anonymous guy at the other end of most trades is often a market maker still performing his traditional role yet brokers can interact directly with each other now rather than relying on the market maker 's book with modern online investing and public order books retail investors might even be trading directly with each other market makers are still out there in part they perform a service sold by an exchange to the companies that choose to be listed on that exchange that service has changed to helping volatility during normal high volatility periods such as at open and close

i think you 're looking at the picture in an odd way when each of you made your initial investments and determined what portions you owned that gave the company capital that they could use to finance its operations in return you are entitled to the future profits of the company in proportion to your ownership any future investment by either of you is at your own discretion your company now faces a situation where it would like to pursue a potentially lucrative opportunity but needs more capital than it has to do so so you need to raise more capital that capital can come from one or both of you or from an outsider since that investment would be discretionary what the investor gets is a negotiation the company negotiates with the investor how much equity in the form of new shares to award in exchange for the new investment or whatever other compensation you decide on if not equity

yes it is true the us based companies have to meet the requirements placed on them by the us government the agency with all these reports is the security and exchange commission they run the edgar system to hold all those required reports the sec ’s edgar database provides free public access to corporate    information allowing you to quickly research a company ’s financial    information and operations by reviewing registration statements    and periodic reports filed on forms 10-k and you    also can find information about recent corporate events reported on    form but that a company does not have to disclose to investors edgar also provides access to comment and response letters relating to    disclosure filings made after august 1 2004 and reviewed by either    the division of corporation finance or the division of investment    management on may 22 2006 the staffs of the divisions of    corporation finance and investment management began to use the edgar    system to issue notifications of effectiveness for securities act    registration statements and post effective amendments other than    those that become effective automatically by law these notifications    will be posted to the edgar system the morning after a filing is    determined to be effective as pointed out by grade eh bacon other countries may require different types of information to be reported to the public in particular financial statements to find the financial statements released for a particular company you can go to the appropriate stock exchange or often simply the company 's corporate website

during the day market and limit orders are submitted at any time by market participants and there is a bid and an ask that move around over time   trades occur whenever a market order is submitted or a limit order is submitted that at a price that matches or exceeds an existing limit order   if you submit a market order it may consume all best price limit orders and you can get multiple prices changing the bid or ask at the same time   all that stuff happens during the trading day only what happens at the end of the day is different   a bunch of orders that were submitted during the day but marked as on close are aggregated with any outstanding limit orders to create a single closing price according to the algorithm established by the exchange   each exchange may handle the details of this closing event differently   for example the nasdaq 's closing cross or the nyse 's closing auction the close is the most liquid time of the day so investors who are trading large amounts and not interested in intraday swings will often submit a market on close or limit on close order   this minimizes their chance of affecting the price or crossing a big spread   it 's actually most relevant for smaller stocks which may have too little volume during the day to make big trades but have plenty at the close   in short the volume you see is due to these on close orders the spike in volume most likely has no special information about what will happen overnight or the next day   it 's probably just a normal part of the market for illiquid stocks

in addition to tax related benefits one answer may be that it helps them avoid being inundated with requests to support other foundations most charities have access to public records that indicate potential donors based on income and demographic they can use that info to solicit for donations hey nfl player you have lots of money and we have cute starving that really need your help here 's a blurb from foundation source about some of the benefits to starting your own foundation   get an immediate tax deduction but give later you get the tax deduction when the foundation is funded then make your charitable    gifts over time leave a lasting legacy foundations set up in perpetuity can your name far beyond your lifetime because gifts are made    from an endowment that generates investment revenue the total gifts    made by the foundation can far surpass the actual funding be taken more seriously as a philanthropist a foundation imparts a that causes people to take your philanthropy more seriously    due to the structured organized approach you employ for your giving sidestep unsolicited requests when you focus your foundation on specific giving areas your mission statement can be used to politely    turn down off target funding requests and focus your philanthropy whereas individual donors often spread their giving among as many causes as possible the formalized    structure of a foundation often encourages donors to narrow their    focus to specific causes build a better family as family members take on philanthropic research present their findings to the board participate in the    decision making process and track results they hone skills that will    serve them for years to come tax deductible grants to individuals in need a private foundation allows you to provide emergency assistance directly to individuals    using dollars for which you ’ve already received a tax deduction run charitable programs without setting up a separate nonprofit direct charitable activities are irs approved programs that permit    foundations to directly fund and carry out their own projects pay charitable expenses all legitimate and reasonable expenses incurred in carrying out the foundation ’s charitable mission can be    paid by the foundation and will count toward the annual minimum    distribution requirement provide loans instead of grants when used to support a charitable purpose private foundations can employ loans loan guarantees and    even equity investments which are paid back potentially with    interest so you can recycle your philanthropic capital for other    charitable causes there 's a similar list here on the website for an attorney that specializes in philanthropy and non profits i wo n't copy paste that list as it 's similar but i wanted to provide an additional source confirming the above benefits this link contains some disadvantages as well

alright i will go through bullet point by bullet point and try to best figure out what you will be doing in layman 's terms please bear in mind that i do not work for a hedge fund but rather a much larger entity so a lot of the work you will be doing is pre populated   = in this role the individual will be the main point of contact for the client on all things related to understanding their trading profit amp loss and how their valuations have been sourced in addition the product controller will work with internal partner areas to ensure all required processes have been performed to verify the valuation accuracy of the client ’s portfolio   from my understanding you will act as the middle man between the client and the analyst as such here is how a real interaction may go client x calls you answer hello 's office how can i assist you client x asks hey i was curious what my capital gains were on my fb purchase ok let me pull up your account just a moment it seems as though your current capital are $ 30,000 lol on your fb purchase   client x hmm well do i have any significant loses that i may be able to sell off to off set the tax on the capital gains why yes you do it seems aapl has taken a mighty tumble would you like to sell a position to assist you in offsetting client x why that would be great thanks for your help the conversation could go on and that is a pretty deep conversation for the level you are going in but i have had conversations like these before the second part of the bullet just means that you will be checking and the grunt work of the analyst and in some places actually performing the grunt work the work will most likely be along the lines of finding returns for different time periods popular desired time periods are inception ytd 1yr etc remember all of these time periods are not good stand alone they must be compared to a relevant benchmark for instance you would not want to compare the barclays intermediate ag to an equity portfolio the most common benchmark for an equity portfolio is going to be the s&amp;p 500 but you have to look at where the portfolio is focused if it is a you may want to look more towards something like the ishares s&amp;p smallcap 600 value index in the end always remember that any number you come up with is always relative to a benchmark a plain return number is useless   skills = knowledge of cash and derivative products across various markets knowledge of pricing and valuation knowledge of profit and loss reporting and related attribution analysis   pretty much they just want to make sure that if a client asks about a forward future contract as well as any swap option that you understand what they are this bullet points i know what i am doing even though nobody knows what is going on in the economy be up on your current events have a personal conjecture about what you feel is going to happen moving forward but do not convey it if you know that the unemployment was the main driver behind today ’s poor market then you will be good for the day because that will suffice for any call in that relates to why is the market down one of my favorite quotes about the current economy is as follows anyone around here who is n't confused about what ’s going on does n't understand as scary as it is that is the honest truth nobody knows what is about to happen and if anyone tells you they do they are lying and you need to run away quickly i am assuming you know how to calculate profit and loss i do n’t really know of a special way to twist the numbers around   duties = managing the daily p&amp;l process for one or more client trading desks o daily review of quality control checks o working with trading on p&amp;l differences inquiries o working with offshore product control team india on qc process o delivering a final daily and month end p&amp;l statement to the client understanding and explaining the key drivers behind the p&amp;l movements preparing managing monthly or more frequently as required price verification process and associated reporting updating and maintaining pricing policy for each financial type that is included in the consultant ’s p&amp;l reporting ad hoc projects to meet and enhance client   all this means is that you will be sending out the due diligence to the client and you will ensure you are using the proper closing price and include any deposits withdrawals during the month into your calculation the main point is knowing the reasons the price moved throughout the day month keep up on current events and make sure that you understand a vast knowledge of economic data   for what your day to day activity may be i can walk you through it let ’s say you get in at 8 am you will get in at 8 read economic data recent news articles until about 10 from there you will update client a f p l worksheet until about noon you will eat a quick lunch until about and continue on the grind of e m until about 4 from 4 5 you will reread what happened at the end of the day and an overall economic activity report for the day you may stay until 8 or 9 if you are in a banking hub nyc but a lot of the older guys will leave at this time this is your time to shine stay as late as you can and pump out as much work as you can   as for your interview they may ask you what will be a good play for the next 6 months to a year you should respond with common themes in the market the most common theme is the dividend growth play a ton of people are not predicting large amount of growth for the next 5 10 years i believe i read something earlier that jpm lowered their growth forecasts by about 30 recently so dividends is the play dividend payers are generally well established companies blue chip that have a strong in their respective industry sector there are a ton of funds out everywhere to follow this trend you could throw out a few funds for brownie points i ’ll give you some and are pretty common i hope this helps and let me know if anything was n’t clear wrote it pretty quickly i am off to have a drink or two or three i ’ll check this in the morning though

the easiest way to get started on a budget is just to track where you spend your money if you have set bills each month i would make a category for each of those to make sure you have enough to pay you can try and split up the remaining income into categories but the easiest way to start is just to track your spending for a month or two this gives you a birds eye view of what is actually realistic start with that total as your preliminary budget and then adjust as you go along to meet other financial goals we use for tracking our income

yes automatic rate increases are typical in my experience and i think it 's very greedy when it 's based on nothing except that your lease is up for renewal which is the situation you are describing yes you should negotiate i 've had success going to the apartment manager and having this conversation   make these points conclude i am not open to a rate increase though i will sign a renewal at the same rate i am paying now this conversation makes me very uncomfortable but i try not to show it i was able to negotiate a lease renewal at the same rate this way in a large complex in sacramento ca   if you are talking to a manager and not an owner they will probably have to delay responding until they can check with the owner the key really is that they want to keep units rented especially when units are staying empty empty units are lost income for the owner it is the other empty units that are staying empty that are the huge point in your favor

for personal investing and highly risky securities wasting assets which is exactly what options are it is better to think in terms of sunk costs do n't chase this trade trying to make your money back you should minimize your loss unwind the position now while there is still some remaining value in those call options and take a short term loss or you could try this   let 's say you own an exchange traded call option on a listed stock very general case i do n't know how much time remains before the option 's expiration date be that as it may i could suggest this to effect a recovery   you 'll be long the call and short the stock this is called a delta hedge as you would be delta trading the stock delta refers to short term price volatility   in other words you 'll short a single large block of the stock then buy shares in small increments whenever the market drops slightly on an intra day basis when the market price of the stock rises incrementally you 'll sell a few shares back and forth in response to short term market price moves while maintaining a static hedge ratio as your original call option gets closer to maturity roll it over into the next available contract either one month or preferably three month time to expiration if you do n't want to or ca n't borrow the underlying stock to short you could do a synthetic short a synthetic short is a combination of a long put and a short call whose pay off replicates the short stock payoff   i personally would never purchase an unhedged option or warrant but since that is what you own right now you have two choices get out or dig in deeper with the realization that you are doing a lot of work just to trade your way back to a net zero   while you can make a profit using this sort of strategy i 'm not certain if that is within the scope of the website

the short answer is yes you probably can take the deduction for a home office because the space is used exclusively and you are working there for the convenience of your employer if you do n't have a desk at your employers office the long answer is that it may not be worth it to take the home office deduction as an employee you 're deduction is subject to a 2 agi floor you can only deduct a percentage of your rent or the depreciation on your home a quick and dirty example if you make $ 75k year rent a 1200 sqft 2 bedroom apartment for $ 1000/month and use one bedroom 120 sqft regularly and exclusively for your employer you can deduct 10 of the $ 12000 $ 1000 12 months assumes your situation did n't change in rent or $ 1200 however because you are an employee you are subject to the 2 agi floor so you can deduct $ salary 2 floor = so in order to deduct the first dollar you need an additional $ 300 worth of deductible expenses   depending on your situation it may or may not be worth it to take the home office deduction even if you qualify for it

like pointed out fundamentally you need to decide if the money invested elsewhere will grow faster than the interest you are paying on the loan in india the safe returns from fixed deposits is around 8 9 currently factoring taxes the real rate of return would be around 6 7 this is less than what you are paying towards interest the ppf gives around 9 with tax break if there are no other options and tax free interest the real return can be as high as 12 14 there is a limit on how much you can invest in ppf however this looks higher than your average interest the stock markets in long term 7 years averages give you around 15 returns but are not predictable year to year so the suggest from is valid you would need to see what are the high rate of interest loans and if they accept early repayment you should complete it asap if there are loans that are less than average say in the range of 7 8 you can keep it and pay as per schedule

gt it was interesting to read the data regarding student loans and the type of impact it has had to borrowers the fed did not necessarily signal the economy is in trouble but a great deal of households do n't have adequate savings to sustain against a moderate financial shock   one of the impacts of the student loans or one they did n't seem to mention is that there are fewer households being formed than there normally would be given the population demographics young people are not only staying in school longer and piling up more student debt just from that in addition to the higher tuition aspect but when they get out fewer of them are establishing their own homes with all that that entails in terms of spending and/or they are spending a lot less on those things than past cohorts have and of course higher rental amp utility and other costs along with flat wages salaries have n't helped that part of the equation either

direct roll overs trustee to trustee transfers are typically initiated by the receiving institution therefore you need to work with vanguard they will have a form in which you provide them with your fidelity account info and they will then contact fidelity and initiate the transfer   do not take the option of being sent a check made out to you by fidelity an indirect rollover there are too many ways to up and get hit with penalties if you are the middleman in the process i believe in most if not all cases the irs now requires a 20 withholding on indirect 401k rollovers this is because too many times people would initiate a roll over but not complete it either at all or within the allowed 60 day window and then come tax time be unable to pay the tax and penalty on the distribution the tricky part of that withholding is that you still have to deposit that amount into the new account otherwise it becomes a distribution subject to tax and penalties and that means coming up with the money from other accounts so in summary talk to vanguard and set up an institution to institution transfer they souls make this very easy as they want your money and do not do any kind of rollover where you come into personal possession of the money   if the check is made out to vanguard but sent to you to to vanguard that should not be an issue as that is still a trustee to trustee transfer   fidelity may have a minor account closer fee that will be deducted from the value of the account before it is sent

i like this part   gt;because insurance companies are required to take all applicants healthy people especially the young would be wise to pay the penalty rather than buy the insurance this makes the pool of insured individuals and more costly on average and their premiums will higher with higher premiums more people will choose to pay the penalty and a downward spiral will unfold   which is the exact opposite of reality   if you have more people in an insurance pool premium costs go down which is the whole point of the individual mandate   it 's like they 're trying to scare people to not buy health insurance and waste it on a fine instead   real nice

yes there is an inverse relationship but that 's how it 's meant to work   debt creates money banks do lend out customers savings for return interest as the bank can make a profit rather than the cash just sitting there the process of lending pumps money into the economy that would n't be there otherwise so it creates money the banks will either have a cash deficit or surplus at end of each day and either need to borrow from other banks to balance their books or if in surplus lend to other banks to make interest because that 's more profitable than holding the cash surplus the overnight cash rate then determines interest rates we pay     high private debt occurs when lots of people are investing amp buying things so there is stimulation and growth in the economy a lot more tax is being paid in these periods so government debt is lower because they are getting lots of tax money also to stimulate the economy into this growth period the government usually sells off large cash bonds lowering their debt to release cash into the economy the more cash available the less banks have to borrow to cover deficits on overnight cash market and the lower interest rates will be lower interest rates = more borrowing and higher private debt    the government ca n't let growth get out of control as they do n't want high inflation so they do the opposite to slow down growth i.e buy up cash bonds and take money out of economy causing higher interest rates and less borrowing = more debt for government less for private

gt they will turn to commodities and energy the only things in the past decade besides entrepreneurial investments which have increased in value to society   there 's a strong argument to be made that entrepreneurial investments are the only ones that should increase in value   tulip mania of any sort does n't add value   all other sources of returns holding risk constant are constantly trying to get cheaper financing through financial engineering or a greater supply of capital due to the magic of compound interest   that 's why you can get a mortgage at 6 instead of 16 like in the old days

i think most financial planners or advisors would allocate zero to a gold only fund that 's probably the mainstream view metals investments have a lot of issues more here what would be the signs of a bubble in silver also consider that metals and commodities despite a recent drop are on a big run up and lots of random people are saying they 're the thing to get in on usually this is a sign that you might want to wait a bit or at least buy gradually   the more mainstream way to go might be a commodities fund or all asset fund some funds you could look at just examples not recommendations might include several pimco funds including their commodity real return and all asset hussman strategic total return diversified commodities index etfs stuff like that has a lot of the theoretical benefits of gold but is n't as dependent on gold specifically another idea for you might be international bonds or stocks if you feel us currency in particular is at risk oh and reits often come up as an inflation resistant asset class i personally use diversified funds rather than gold specifically fwiw mostly for the same reason i 'd buy a fund instead of individual stocks is probably about right to put into this kind of stuff depending on your overall portfolio and goals pure commodities should probably be less than funds with some bonds stocks or reits because in principle commodities only track inflation over time they do n't make money the only way you make money on them is rebalancing out of them some when there 's a run up and back in when they 're down so a portfolio with mostly commodities would suck long term some people feel gold 's virtue is rather than being a piece of paper in an apocalypse ish scenario but if making that argument i think you need physical gold in your basement not an etf   plus i 'd argue for guns ammo and food over gold in that scenario

during the actual decline there 's very little money to be made and a lot to lose when housing prices tank everybody loses the banks are exposed to higher risk of mortgage defaults insurers start having to pay out more for gas leaks claiming over leveraged homes     realtors starve because their commissions go down even as foreclosures put more homes on the market and people faced with financial uncertainty will stay put in their current homes instead of moving elsewhere and and contractors go broke because nobody wants to spend cash on a new home or major reno that looks like a losing investment there can be some bright spots smaller hardware stores will make money as people do relatively small diy projects to improve the condition of their current home the larger stores get this business too but it tends to be more than offset by the loss of contractor business far more lucrative and something the and true values do n't really get in on of course the grave robbers do well gold buyers pawn shops repo firms these guys eat well when other people are defaulting on loans or have to sell their stuff for fast cash most of these businesses are not publicly traded one thing that was seen was increased revenues at discount retailers like wal mart dollar general etc when things are bad people in the middle class who had avoided these stores for image or morality reasons learn to swallow their pride and buy discount store brands for half the price of national brand names that lessens the blow felt by the discount retailers as overall consumer spending decreases the pie shrinks but the discount retailers get a bigger slice of the mandatory spending on food clothing etc and the higher level retailers get it in the shorts when the pie starts to grow again as consumer spending picks back up the discount retailers retain their percentage for a while as the fickle middle class can afford to buy more from the discount retailer but ca n't yet afford to take their business back to the shopping mall stores this produces a flatter offset price graph for discount retailers through the business cycle they do n't lose as early or as much as everyone else in a major downturn and they turn it around sooner while everyone else may still be on the way down but as everything gets better for everyone on the upswing it 's less great for the discount guys as they start losing customers and their dollars to competitors with better stuff even as the ones they keep spend more this does n't generally manifest as a true negative correlation but it can be a good hedge the number one money making investment in a tanking economy is gold when things go down the crapper everyone wants gold so if you see the train wreck coming far enough in advance you can make a big move to gold and really make some money off that investment for instance when the first about arm adjustments and mass defaults reached the public consciousness in gold bullion jumped from about $ 400 to over $ 700 in a nine month period it cooled off again in 06 07 but only to about $ and then in late 07 it steadily climbed to peak at $ even if you got in late an investment of $ 1000 in july 07 in bulk gold would have netted you $ 650 in one year that 's a 65 apy then the economy hit bottom and a lot of investors gold for investments they thought would pull back out of their holes quickly for just a little while in 08 gold was down to $ 700 again then came all the government reports unemployment not home prices still declining a lot of banks still hiding just how bad their position was if you had seen that it was going to be bad bad bad like a lot of now billionaire hedge fund investors did a $ 1000 investment in gold in july 05 and then cashing out at the tops of the peaks and buying back in at the major would be worth almost $ 4000 today that 's a 400 return over 7 years or an annual average yield of 57 there simply has n't been anything like that in the last 7 years

the paragraph talks about dividends given by mutual funds say a fund has nav of $ 10 as the value of the underlying security grows the value of the fund would also grow lets say it becomes $ 12 in 2 months now if the mutual fund decides to pay out a dividend of $ 1 to all unit holder then post the distribution of dividend the value of the fund would become to $ 11 thus if you are say investing on and know that dividends of $ 1 would be paid on the divided distribution date is published typically weeks in advance if you are hoping to make $ 1 in 5 days that is not going to happen on you would get $ 1 but the value of the fund would now be $ 11 from the earlier $ 12 this may not be wise as in some countries you would ending up paying tax on $ 1 even in shares the concept is similar however the price may get corrected immediately and one may not actually see it going down by $ 1 due to market dynamics

while i agree with the overarching narrative regarding the car industry self driving cars and how people will use transportation in the future i deeply disagree with his timeframe and reject that his clearly large city centric thinking will effect all parts of the country and all parts of the world    there is no way this happens as quickly as he says it will for the following reasons    on his claim that electric cars will be all anyone will buy 1 we lack the road or electrical grid infrastructure to support tens of millions of electric vehicles throughout the us this will take far more than just 5 10 years especially in the more rural parts of the country   2 we lack the production capacity to create the batteries for 17 million of yearly sales of automobiles for the few years between 2021 2025 when everyone is presumably just buying only electric self driving cars   3 the used market for combustion engine cars will tank so strongly that it will actually create demand for people to buy combustion cars as the costs will now outweigh the savings of buying a new car with lower running costs thus pushing his timeline out into the future by several years   4 cars even electric cars are much more complicated durable expensive and prone to damage and accidents than most software and disposable consumer electronics he cites in his examples of course nokia went from 50 of the market to 5 over one product cycle people completely replaced their phones every 2 3 years back then wireless carriers built a system where even if your phone worked you had little to no reason not to lock in another contract and get the next best phone of course people would dump their nokia bricks for an iphone it was the next best thing cars have a much longer life cycle and inefficient older models will be around for decades in some cases because they will be a sunk cost for those who bought them    on his claim that no one will own a car anymore and everyone will ride share   1 how does one decide to take a road trip somewhere what about people who travel for a living or as an integral part of doing their job   2 i personally think a ride sharing transportation network represents a limiting of freedom though i can see why people might make the opposite point people identify with owning their own cars keeping their own belongings in them having them for use whenever they so need or desire people who do n't live in dense urban i.e a huge group of americans and especially a huge group of americans who are older have money and are set in their ways are n't going to see this as nearly as attractive as someone who lives in new york or san might and those people hardly buy cars anyway   3 people are fucking stubborn it 's going to take a lot for people to decide to change up such an integral part of their daily lives this will not happen over a 3 4 year cycle   4 where is the infrastructure to park charge and perform maintenance on all these autonomous vehicles we will need more cars available during rush hour than at 3 pm or 3 am for that matter where do the cars go then   5 this simply wo n't work quickly in countries outside the very top of the first world they wo n't have the infrastructure or capital to invest to bring it up to speed fast enough to derail oil demand as quickly as he claims   5 this theory implies a central government that is in complete control to implement rules in support of autonomous cars i believe most of this will be done at the state and municipality level at first with some cities hopping on board and others banning the practice   6 this theory also implies that the technology will be flawless the first completely computer aided pedestrian disaster or multi car pile up will undoubtedly cause massive backlash regardless of the statistics showing general reduction in accidents and might clog this entire concept up in bureaucracy for decades as the government forces stricter and stricter safety and quality requirements on the software    i 'm not saying his view is n't the long run eventually for mobility in the us and the world in general but applying personal electronic technology cycle rules to large scale durable goods that work in real space instead of cyber space represents a whole different set of challenges and could easily take 25 50 years to really pull off over that time oil markets will right size themselves and the automotive manufacturers will consolidate and cater their product to meet demand service the fleet    tl dr this will take much longer to accomplish than he infrastructure takes time to build cars are a different technology than consumer electronics people are stubborn

one advantage of paying down your primary residence is that you can refinance it later for 10 15 years when the balance is low refinancing a rental is much harder and interest rates are often higher for investors this also assumes that you can refinance for a lower rate in the nearest future the question is really which would you rather sell if you suddenly need the money i have rental properties and i 'd rather move myself than sell the investments because they are income generating unlike my own home so in your case i 'd pay off primary residence especially since the interest is already higher on it would be a harder decision if it was lower

there is one massive catch in this which i found out when i went to nationwide to ask for a loan i 've got a credit card which they kept increasing my credit limit it 's now at something ridiculous nearly £ 10,000 but they keep increasing it i never use that card when i went to nationwide though they said they could n't give me a loan because i had £ 10,000 credit already and if i reduced this credit this would affect my credit rating and they could potentially give me a loan i then realised what had done   i have two cards with this bank one with really low interest and the other with really high interest and a high credit limit even though the other card has a zero balance loan companies still see it as money i could potentially go and spend it does n't matter to them that i 've not spent any money on that card in about 12 months to them it 's the fact that they could give me a loan and then i could go and spend another £ 10,000 on that card as you can see extremely risky    of course this means that what are doing is giving me such a high credit knowing full well that i 'm not going to use it but it also prevents their competitors from offering me a loan even at a lower rate because i 've already got too much credit available so yes there is a catch to giving you a high credit limit on your cards and it 's to prevent you from either leaving that bank or getting a lower interest rate loan out to clear the debt

i believe you may be missing the point here it they do n't really verify this that before bofa took over the loan the homeowners were not using an escrow account i know this is possible because i had the option of using one or not when i bought my house so it seems that once bofa took over they automatically created an escrow account and when the normal payments the homeowners were making did n't cover the total monthly balance they took it out of the payment specifically for the mortgage    so according to this story its not sensational bullshit this would be the bank creating an issue that is according to the facts that are presented in the article which may not be the whole story   spelling amp grammar

sorry my response was supposed to be to the above comment not yours my main point was that in africa where there was already a large population did not require bringing in people which you would need to incentivize to move to hence offering the free carrot of property rights to settlers of na to extract resources instead the british and other european powers just used the local populace to extract the resources the main reason the us and canada are well off is that property rights were established very early on and this encouraged people to invest and produce more because the higher production accrued to the producer and the producer would have legal recourse should a negative externality be put upon them by someone else obviously there were other reasons as well but property rights are huge this is true globally now in encouraging people to grow their assets part of the reason africa is still so screwed up is that many of their institutions and governments are too corrupt to protect their citizens property rights thereby discouraging investment and production

i agree with you for the most part but banks need some way of comparing the relative risk of various loan applicants forcing them to use over is really failing to see the forest for the trees    equifax is not the problem here   the fact that that entire industry is allowed to exist without our explicit permission is the problem

that 's not especially high income and while i ca n't speak for canadians   most of us south of the border just pay the tax there are tax retirement savings plans and charitable donations are often offset by a tax credit and there are some tax incentives for mortgages and so on but generally the right answer is to just accept that the income tax money was never yours to begin with

i used to get the same shit working in unlike my my team leader or the office manager i knew our product from the wheels up which means when i bumped in to a customer who knew their stuff we would talk properly one particular call a guy made it quite clear he did n't want anything early on so i asked him what he was using and it was an unbelievably obscure model with an even more obscure fork attachment so knowing the details i made a flippant comment about the and the turning circle and he responded which lead to a long drawn out conversation i eventually arranged a meeting with one of our sales reps which lead to a sale all because we talked properly nobody there could have nailed the call like i did but what thanks did i get my first strike because of the length of the call

that does n't make it the perfect medium for theft the system makes it okay to make non controversial items because its not like someone is going to put in the effort to track you for that    yet if you are buying something illicit a large part of the blockchain can already be analyzed to see where stuff is coming from and they can start work from there    for example let 's say you buy off local bitcoin well even if the fbi does n't know your address or who it belongs to they monitor the site and know that the funds came from a certain account they know this because that certain someone bought coins from a regulated company    its not the perfect medium for theft at all do you actually research bitcoin or are you just looking for any reason not to like it its really much more complex grand than most make it out to be

  adding to h answer about damage limitation online purchases could include phone tablet app purchases which could be an issue if you have children or you are a victim of fraud first link from googling kid racks up almost $ 6,000 on world in app purchases adding to c. answer i think credit cards perhaps can make it more difficult to budget if you are more lazy have limited savings   these might happen more long term if you do n't keep track of your spending i.e. if your credit limit matches your monthly income and if you pay off your card each month i think it is harder to overspend as you do n't have more credit available than you can afford to spend however this is countered by that a slightly higher credit limit may help to avoid fees from exceeding your credit card limit i think due to that some not all purchases are instantly banked i.e. the shop might send all of its monies to its bank at the end of the day or something like this so you can just keep spending not realising you have exceeding your credit limit and get hit by fees

let 's look at some numbers   these are just example rates that i found online   you can substitute your own quotes and compare yourself   i 'm not going to name the company but these advertised rates are all from one nationally known company for a 25-year old female if you went with the whole life option you would be paying $ per year   the policy builds a cash value the amount this grows can vary greatly and you 'll need to look at the fine print to see how it will grow but let 's pretend that after 30 years the cash value of the policy is $ 50,000 a reasonable guess in my opinion   let 's look at what this means you can cash out your policy but at that point you 'll stop paying payments and your heirs wo n't get your $ 100,000 death benefit   you can borrow against it but you 'll have to pay it back   you could use it to pay your premium in which case you 'll stop paying payments   however keep in mind that if you do pass away you lose the cash value you 've built up your beneficiaries only get the $ 100,000 death benefit now let 's look at the term insurance option   we 'll go with the 30-year term   it will only cost you $ per year and the death benefit is more than double the whole life coverage   if you were to take the difference between the two premiums $ 58 per month and invest it in a mutual fund growing at 8 per year you would have $ in your account after 30 years   this money is yours or your heirs whether or not you pass away before your term is up   after the 30 years is up your insurance is over but you are now almost all the way up to the death benefit of the whole life policy anyway in my opinion term life insurance is better than whole life for just about everybody i do n't want to be morbid here but the earlier someone dies the more benefit they get with term insurance vs whole life   if someone does have reason to believe that his life expectancy is shorter than average term insurance makes even more sense as he is more likely to get the death benefit for much less money in premiums than he would in whole life

there are very strict regulations that requires the assets which a fund buys on behalf of its investors to be kept completely separate from the fund 's own assets which it uses to pay its expenses except for the published fees funds are typically audited regularly to ensure this is the case so the only way in which a default of the fund could cause a loss of money would be if the fund managers broke the regulations and committed various crimes i 've never heard of this actually happening to a normal mutual fund there is of course also a default risk when a fund buys bonds or other non equity securities and this may sometimes be non obvious for example some etfs which are nominally based on a stock index do n't actually buy stocks instead they buy or sell options on those stocks which involves a counterparty risk the etf may or may not have rules that limit the exposure to any one counterparty

since you only own half of the house you would most likely need the cooperation of whoever owns the other half in order to use it as collateral for a loan but if you can do that there 's no reason you could n't do what you 're talking about   the complication is that if you default on the loan the bank is n't going to seize half of the house   they 'll repossess the entire house sell it and take what they 're owed out of the proceeds leaving you and whoever owns the other 50 to fight over the even if the owner of the other half is family they may be hesitant to risk losing the house if you do n't pay your mortgage so this could be a conversation

the market maker will always compare the highest bid and the lowest ask a trade will happen if the highest bid is at least as high as the lowest ask adding one share or a million shares at a higher asking price here $ 210 instead of $ 200 will not have any effect at all nobody will buy the share   adding a bid for one share or a million shares at a higher bid price will trigger a sale if you bid $ 210 for one share you will pay $ 210 for one of the shares that were offered at $ 200 if you have $ 210 million in cash and add a bid for 1,000,000 aapl at $ 210 you will pay $ 210 for all shares with an ask of $ then $ then $ until you either bought all shares with an ask up to $ 210 or until you bought a million shares   with aapl you probably bid the price up to $ 201 with a million shares so you made lots of people very happy while losing about 10 million dollars so let 's say this is a much smaller company   you have driven the share price up to $ 210 but there is nobody else bidding above $ 200 so nobody is going to buy your shares until some people think there is something going on and enter higher bids but then some people will take advantage of this and ask lower than your $ 210 and there will be more people trying to make cash by selling their shares at a good price than people tricked into bidding over $ 200 so it is most likely that you lose out   this completely ignores legality attempting to do this would be market manipulation and in many countries illegal i do n't know if losing money in the process would protect you from criminal charges

the barclay 's 20 + year treasury bond inception date was july 21 2002 you are n't going to find treasury bond information going back to 1900 because treasury bills have only been issued since 1929 the u.s. department of the treasury will give you data back to 1990 there 's a good article in the globe and mail which covers why you may want to buy bonds as part of your portfolio the key is diversification historically stocks have done better than bonds long term but when stocks fall bonds tend to though do not always go up if you are investing for 30 years the risk of putting money into bonds is that you will not make as much money as if you had put the money into stocks historically in the us or canada you 'd have seen positive returns just not as high as investing in the stock market there are many investment strategies i live in canada and personally favour the one described in the canadian couch potato a passive index investment strategy where i invest my money in canadian u.s. and international equity stock market mutual funds and also in a canadian bond fund there are of course plenty of people who will tell you to take a radically different strategy with your investments

it 's a matter of opinion as a general rule my advice is to take charge of your own investments sending money to someone else to have them invest it though it is a common practice seems unwise to me this particular fund seems especially risky to me because there is no known portfolio normally real estate investment trusts reits have a specific portfolio of known properties or at least a property strategy that you know going in simply handing money over to someone else with no known properties or specific strategy is buying a pig in a poke

signing bonuses are probably the most variable of all as there is a general understanding that more personal factors are taken into account as a result hr is n't under a huge obligation to explain away the differences in comparison for salary there 's the wide expectation that same job = same pay since there 's so variable but also fairly rare budget is n't a main concern for many hr departments and they certainly wo n't have a finely grained budget breakdown this year we 'll pay $ for $ 50000 for relocation payments $ 100,000 for pension transfers $ for stock option losses it 's generally tossed on one big heap cost of hiring so what can you ask for that 's really a market question what 's your value to the company how much of that is already reflected in salary and other benefits the main downside to signing bonuses is that a company wo n't know how long you 'd stay your value to the company is probably your monthly work therefore they can not amortize that bonus over a fixed amount of months what if you leave after 3 months for that reason a conditional signing bonus is a reasonable offer from your side e.g. ask for one month salary conditional on you staying for 24 months and otherwise you 'll repay them from your last salary

it is my understanding that there are no penalties for withdrawals and you can withdraw as much as you want as often as you want including more than once in the same calendar year   of course the money must be in cash in the tfsa which may require you to sell something   that sale may have fees associated with it and possibly penalties for early withdrawal etc there is still huge confusion over this because there are penalties for over contributions in the calendar year   you contribution limit is still $ regardless of how much you may have withdrawn in that same calendar year so if you withdraw $ 10 k in 2013 you can still only contribute $ 5,500 in 2013   in 2014 you can contribute $ 5,500 plus you can also contribute an additional $ 10 k for the 2013 withdrawal of $ 10k.   think of it like 2 separate limits one for current year and one a running total of all past withdrawals

when the inflation rate increases this tends to push up interest rates because of supply and demand if the interest rate is less than the inflation rate then putting your money in the bank means that you are losing value every day that it is there so there 's an incentive to withdraw your money and spend it now if say i 'm planning to buy a car and my savings are declining in real value then if i buy a car today i can get a better car than if i wait until tomorrow when interest rates are high compared to inflation the reverse is true my savings are increasing in value so the longer i leave my money in the bank the more it 's worth if i wait until tomorrow to buy a car i can get a better car than i would be able to buy today also people find alternative places to keep their savings if a savings account will result in me losing value every day my money is there then maybe i 'll put the money in the stock market or buy gold or whatever so for the banks to continue to get enough money to make loans they have to increase the interest rates they pay to lure customers back to the bank there is no reason per se for rising interest rates to consumers to directly cause an increase in the inflation rate inflation is caused by the money supply growing faster than the amount of goods and services produced interest rates are a cost if interest rates go up people will borrow less money and spend it on other things but that has no direct effect on the total money supply except you may note i put a bunch of in that paragraph in the united states the federal reserve loans money to banks it creates this money out of thin air so when the interest that the federal reserve charges to the banks is low the banks will borrow more from the feds as this money is created on the spot this adds to the money supply and thus contributes to inflation so if interest rates to consumers are low this encourages people to borrow more money from the banks which encourages the banks to borrow more from the feds which increases the money supply which increases inflation i do n't know much about how it works in other countries but i think it 's similar in most nations

it depends on what you 're talking about if this is for your retirement accounts like iras then absolutely not in your retirement accounts you should be broadly diversified not just between stocks but also other markets like bonds target retirement funds and solid conservative or moderate allocation funds are the best quick and dirty recommendation for those accounts since it 's for the long haul you want to be managing risk not chasing returns returns will happen over the 40 or so years they have to grow   now if you 're talking about a taxable stock account and you 've gotten past pf questions like am i saving enough for retirement and have i paid off my debt then the question becomes a little more murky   first yes you should be diversified the bulk of how a stock 's movement will be in keeping with how its sector moves so even a really great stock can get if its sector is going down diversification between several sectors will help balance that   however you will have some advantage in this sector knowing which products are good which products everybody in the industry is excited about is a huge advantage over other investors it 'll help you pick the ones that go up more when the sector goes up and down less when the sector goes down that over time and investments really adds up just remember that a good company and a good stock investment are not the same thing a great company can have a sky high valuation and if you buy it at that price you can sit there and watch your investment sink even as the company is growing and doing great things have patience know which companies are good and which are bad and wait for the price to come to you   one final note it also depends on what spot you are in if you 're a young guy looking looking to invest his first few thousand in the market then go for it on the other hand if you 're older and we 're talking about a couple hundred grand you 've got saved up then it 's a whole different ball of wax it that spot you 're back to managing risk and need to build a solid portfolio at a measured pace

assuming by your username that you are dutch and this concerns invoices under dutch law there are a couple of ways to go about it first of all we do n't have small claims court the way the us does that would make life a lot easier but we do n't    you can go all legal on him and go through court procedures the first step would probably be the wiki though there are some limitations to what you can do there you do n't need to have a lawyer at the but chances of fucking up are high if you do n't have experience or some experienced help it 's also likely to eat up more of your time than it 's worth and even if you get a favorable judgement there 's still the matter of collecting    the second option which nearly all companies in the netherlands use is to turn it over to an collections agency for either a fee or a percentage they 'll go after the usually tacking that fee onto the money owed so it should n't cost you too much the downside is that again they 're not always successful if the non paying person is either extraordinarily already in a lot of debt or if you 're looking at him her it going bankrupt or being in debt counseling which in some cases comes with legal protections    the third way if it 's a viable debt but you 're willing to take a loss in exchange for money now is to sell off the debt to a factoring agency they 'll assess it and pay out the open invoice to you minus costs and/or a percentage depending on how they view their odds of collecting on it it 's then their debt and they 'll go after the original debtor without you ever needing to bother with it again    it 's a tough position to be in i 've had to write off some invoices over time some only a some in the range when a major customer of mine went tits up and i just happened to have an interesting conversation yesterday with someone who 's more into the commercial side of my line of work i learned that some relatively big name potential clients are looking more and more like a debt ridden empty shell   so they went on the list of companies to keep a sharp eye on in case i do business with them    in future cases keep on top of payment start reminding as soon as they miss their pay by date as the first documented step towards taking action against them and if it 's a common problem try looking at factoring companies or insurance against non payment it will cost you some margin but increase your security

so you are off to a really good start   congratulations on being debt free and having a nice income being an it contractor can be financially rewarding but also have some risks to it much like investing   with your disposable income i would not shy away from investing in further training through sites like or to improve weak skills   they are not terribly expensive for a person in your situation   if you were loaded down with debt and payments the story would be different having an emergency fund will help you be a good it contractor as it adds stability to your life   i would keep   £ 10 k or so in a boring savings account   think of it not as an investment but as insurance against life 's woes   having such a fund allows you to go after a high paying job you might fail at or invest with impunity    i would encourage you to take an intermediary step   moving out on your own   i would encourage renting before buying even if it is just a room in someone else 's home   i would try to be out of the house in less than 3 months   being on your own helps you mature in ways that can only be accomplished by being on your own   it will also reduce the culture shock of buying your own home or entering into an adult relationship i would put a minimum of £ 300/month in growth stock mutual funds   keeping this around 15 of your income is a good metric   if available you may want to put this in tax favored retirement accounts   sorry but i am woefully ignorant of uk retirement savings   this becomes your retire at 60 fund   starting now you can retire well before 68   for now stick to an index fund and once it gets to 25 k you may want to look to diversify for the rest of your disposable income i 'd invest in something safe and secure   the amount of your disposable income will change presumably as you will have additional expenses for rent and food   this will become your buy a house fund   this is something that should be safe and secure   something like a bond fund money market dividend producing stocks or preferred stocks    i am currently doing something like this and have 50 in a savings account 25 in a blue chip index fund and 25 in a preferred stock fund   this way you have some decent stability of principle while also having some ability to grow    once you have that built up to about 12 k and you feel comfortable you can start shopping for a house   you may want to be at the high end of your area so you should try and save at least 10 or you may want to be really weird and save the whole thing and buy your house for cash   if you are still single you may want to rent a room or two so your home can generate income    here in the us there can be other ways to generate income from your property   one example is a home that has a separate area and room to park a boat   a boat owner will pay some decent money to have a place to park their boat and there is very little impact to the owner   be creative and perhaps find a way where a potential property could also produce income good luck check back in with progress and further questions edit   after some reading isa seem like a really good deal

equation m x 12 + = worst case scenario cost where m equals the monthly cost and is the maximum out of pocket amount   so if a plan costs $ 500 a month and the maximum out of pocket amount is $ 12,000 which in a worst case scenario you would pay it 's almost always over the deductible $ 500 x 12 + 12,000 = $ 18,000 most people look at the deductible but be aware this is incorrect in a worst case   the last one maximum out of pocket really hurts most people because they overlook it deductible vs. out of pocket maximum the difference between your deductible and an out of pocket maximum is    subtle but important the out of pocket maximum is typically higher    than your deductible to account for things like co pays and    co insurance for example if you hit your deductible of $ 2,500 but    continue to go for office visits with a $ 25 co pay you ’ll still have    to pay that co pay until you ’ve spent your out of pocket maximum at    which time your insurance would take over and cover everything new in    2016 embedded out of pocket maximums one change in 2016 is that even    with an aggregate deductible one person can not pay more than the    individual out of pocket maximum within a family plan even if the    aggregate deductible is more than the individual out of pocket    maximum which is $ for 2016 for instance even if the overall    aggregate deductible was $ 10,000 a single person in that family plan    could not incur more than $ in out of pocket expenses in 2017    the out of pocket maximum will increase to $ after they hit    that number insurance covers everything for that person even as the    rest of the family is still subject to the deductible from your question thanks not sure i totally follow you my question is essentially    say a typical large employer x gives you healthcare as a benefit on    top of your salary in fact how much does that cost corporation x    each year ie meaning in the us about how much does that typically    cost a corporation x each year that 's a good question because they may qualify for tax advantages by offering to a number of employees and there may be other benefits if they encourage certain tests like blood work and they waive the monthly fee   more than likely using the above equation may be the maximum that they 'll pay each year per employee and it might be less depending on the tax qualifications   you can read this answer of the question and it appears they are paying within the range of these premiums listed above this

because it is a roth ira not traditional you never pay penalties for withdrawing any amount up to your total contributions amount this is because you are funding it with after tax money but it sounds like your roth had $ 11 k in it and you zeroed it out if you were less than 59.5 years old at the time you made the withdrawal then if you did not return anything to the account then you would pay tax on the 6 k as income this year at your normal tax rate plus an additional 10 penalty on that 6 k $ 600 the 5 k in contributions is not taxable now since it 's been more than 60 days since you withdrew the money you can not put the 6 k in earnings back in without paying the penalty however you can still contribute $ 5500 per year or $ 6500 if you 're over 50 so you can put back $ 5500 and then you would only have to pay tax + 10 on the $ 500 difference update i would recommend talking to an accountant the fact that you intended to buy a house might provide a mechanism for getting the money back in if you wish if this was your first house or you have not owned a home in the last 2 years then you would be considered a first time homebuyer and there is a special exception allowing you to remove 10 k without penalty if you end up not purchasing the home you have 120 days to contribute those funds back in treated as a thank you littleadv for the link to this as for the final 1 k overage i believe you can count that towards your $ contribution when you put the entire amount back lastly after digging into this you have hit so many edge cases with your scenario 6 k in earnings being between 5500 for under 50 and 6500 for over 50 it 's been 70 days which is between the 60 day normal cutoff and the 120 day extended cutoff for home purchase falling through and 11 k total being just over the 10 k cutoff for the same that i 'm starting to wonder if this is some sort of contrived case for an accounting exam

earnings per share is the company profit or loss divided by the number of outstanding shares the number should always be compared to the share price so for instance if the eps is $ 1 and the share price is $ 10 the eps is 10 of the share price this means that if the company keeps up this earning you should expect to make 10 yearly on your investment long term the stock price may fluctuate but if the company keeps on making money you will eventually do so too as investor if the eps is low it means that the market expects the earnings to rise in the future either because the company has a low profit margin that can be vastly improved or because the business is expected to grow especially the last case may be a risky investment as you will lose money if the company does n't grow fast enough even if it does make a healthy profit note that the listed eps like most key figures is based on the last financial statement recent developments could mean that better or worse is generally expected also note that the earnings of some companies will fluctuate wildly for instance companies that produce movies or video games will tend to have a huge income for a quarter or two following a new release but may be in the negative in some periods this is fine as long as they turn a profit long term but you will have to look at data for a longer period in order to determine this

yes but the rates at which they 're borrowing make all the difference   japan 's central bank is borrowing at about 2 percent on a 30 year bond and greece is borrowing at 18 percent japan would thus be paying 4.6 of gdp on debt service for government borrowing while greece would thus be paying 27 assuming that all current bonds could be converted to current rates    markets rates bonds government bonds stats money long html    further as many other commenters have noted japan retains the ability to print money and thus inflate their debt away while greece relies on the european central bank which would not the entire eurozone to help out greece 's government   as a comparison the us is currently paying 1.3 of its gdp on government debt service    my calculations are amateur please correct me if i 'm wrong   as dean baker blogs blog the interest burden of the debt   it is important to remember that most of the people in washington debates on economic policy do not know much economics they tend not to be very good at arithmetic either that is why they were blindsided by the collapse of the $ 8 trillion housing bubble that wrecked the economy   as we get endless about the crushing debt burden it is worth touching base with reality on occasion in that spirit brings you the latest data and projections on the ratio of the federal government 's interest payments to gdp courtesy of the congressional budget office cbo   interest to gdp ratio is currently at a crushing 1.3 percent near the post world war ii low however this figure the burden somewhat last year the federal reserve board refunded almost $ 80 billion to the treasury this was interest earned on government bonds and other assets it now holds that leaves a net interest burden of 0.8 percent of gdp by far the lowest of the post world war ii era   tl;dr what matters is not total size of debt alone but also borrowing costs and ability to inflate the debt away japan is paying very little on its large debt greece is paying a lot    tl;dr tl;dr i 'd like to borrow a few trillion dollars at 2 too

you will almost certainly be able to sell 10,000 shares at once the question is a matter of price if you sell at market then you may get a lower price for each batch of the stock sold one person buys 50 another buys 200 another buys 1000 etc at varying prices will you be able to execute a single order to sell them all at the same price at the same time nobody can say and it 's not really a function of the company size the exchange has what 's called open interest which roughly correlates to how many people have active orders in at a given price this number is constantly changing alongside the bid and ask particularly for active stocks so let 's say you have 10,000 shares and you want to sell them for $ 100 each what you need is at least 10,000 in open interest at $ 100 bid to execute by contrast let 's say you issue a limit order at $ 100 for 10,000 shares your ask will stay outstanding at that price and you 'll be filled at that price if there are enough buyers i you have a limit sell order at $ 100 for 10,000 shares the strike price of the stock can not go to $ 100.01 until all of your sell orders are filled

and specifically regarding prices of housing what factors drive prices in that regard i mean the houses are roughly the same but almost 3 times as expensive rent like so many things is tied to supply and demand on the demand side rent is tied to income people tend to buy as much house as they can afford given that mortgage interest is deductible and public schools financed through property tax performs better in valuable neighborhoods raise the minimum wage and economists expect rents to go up accordingly when employers and pensions offer cola adjustments it feeds into a price loop during the past ten years there was also some animal spirits irrational behavior present people feared that if they did n't buy now home prices would outpace their growth in income so even though it did n't make sense at the time they bought because it would make even less sense later if you assume prices only go up there 's also the whole california has nicer weather angle to explain why people move to sf or la on the supply side it 's all about housing stock in your old town you could find vacant lots or farmland in less than 5 minute 's drive from anywhere there 's far less room for growth in say the sf bay area or nyc there 's also building codes that restrict the growth in housing stock i 'm told co is one such place you would think that high prices would discourage people from moving or working there but between the university and the defense contractors they seem to have an iron grip on the market have you ever seen a cartoon where a character gets a huge bill at a restaurant and their eyes shoot out of their eye and they faint yeah that 's how i felt looking at some of the places around here remember restaurants have to cover the same rent problem you do and they have higher minimum wages and taxes etc moreover food has to be imported from miles away to feed the city likely even from out of state in california there 's also food regulations that in effect raise the prices if people are footing those higher bills i would n't be surprised if they 're racking up debt in the process and dodging the collectors calling about their lexus or taking out home equity loans to cover their lifestyle

i would have to disagree with the other responders in technical analysis of stock charts various short and long term moving averages are used to give an indication of the trend of the stock in the short and long term as compared to the current price i would prefer to use the term moving average ma rather than average as the ma is recalculated every day or at appropriate frequencies for your data on the period you are using i would also expand on the term moving average there are two that are commonly used going back to the question of the value of this number for example if the current price is above the 200 day and also above the 30 day then the stock is broadly trending upwards conversely if current price is below the 200 day and also below the 30 day then the stock is broadly trending downwards these numbers are chosen on the basis of the market you are trading in the volatility and other factors for another example of how a number of moving averages are used together please have a read of 's multiple moving average though this does not use moving averages as large as 200 days

the original question was aimed at early payment on a student loan at 6 let 's look at some numbers   note the actual numbers were much lower i 've increased the debt to a level that 's more typical as well as more likely to keep the borrower worried and up at night   on a $ 50 k loan we see 2 potential payoffs a 6 year accelerated payoff which requires $ extra per month and the original payoff with a payment of $ next i show the 6 year balance on the original loan terms $ which we would need to exceed in the 401(k to consider we made the right choice   the last section reflects the 401(k balance with different rates of return i purposely offer a wide range of returns even if we had another lost decade averaging the 401(k balance is more than 50 higher than the current loan debt at a more reasonable 6 average it 's double note the $ deposit should really be adjusted adding 33 if one is in the 25 bracket or 17.6 if 15 bracket that opens the can of worms at withdrawal but let me add i coerced my sister to deposit to the match while married and a divorced and disabled her withdrawals are penalty free and $ 10 k is tax free due to std deduction and exemption note the chart and text above have been edited at the request of a member comment   what about an 18 credit card glad you asked   the same $ 50 k debt it 's tough to imagine a worse situation you budgeted and can afford $ because that 's the number for a 10 year payoff your spouse says she can grab a extra shift and add $ to the plan because that the number to get to a 6 year payoff   the balance after 6 years if we stick to the 10 year plan $ the 401(k balances at varying rates of return again appear above a bit less dramatic as that 18 is tough but even at a negative return the 401(k is still ahead you are welcome to run the numbers adjust deposits for your tax rate and same for withdrawals you 'll see -1 is still about break even   to be fair there are a number of variables debt owed original time for loan to be paid rate of loan rate of return assumed on the 401(k amount of potential extra payment and the 2 tax rates going in coming out combine a horrific loan rate the 18 with a longer payback 15 + years and you can a scenario where in fact even the matched funds have trouble keeping up i 'm not judging but i believe it 's fair to say that if one ca n't find a budget that allows them to pay their 18 debt over a 10 year period they need more help that we can offer here i 'm only offering the math that shows the power of the matched deposit    from a comment below the one warning i 'd offer is regarding vesting the matched funds may not be yours immediately companies are allowed to have a vesting schedule which means your right to this money may be tiered at say from year 2 6 for example it 's a good idea to check how your plan handles this on further reflection the comments of david need to be understood at zero return the matched money will lag the 18 payment after 4 years the reason my chart does n't reflect that is the match from the deposits younger than 4 years is still making up for that potential loss i 'd maintain my advice to grab the match regardless as there are other factors involved the more likely return of the tax differential should one lose their job and the hope that one would get their act together and pay the debt off faster

it 's whatever you decide taking money out of an s corp via distribution is n't a taxable event practically speaking yes you should make sure you have enough money to afford the distribution after paying your expenses lest you have to put money back a few days later in to pay the phone bill you might not want to distribute every penny of profit the moment you book it either keeping some money in the business checking account is probably a good idea if you have consistent cash flow you could distribute monthly or quarterly profits 30 or 60 days in arrears for example and then still have cash on hand for operations your net profit is reflected on the schedule k for inclusion on your personal tax return as an s corp the profit is passed through to the shareholders and is taxable whether or not you actually distributed the money you owe taxes on the profit reported on the schedule k not the amounts distributed you really should get a tax accountant long term you 'll save money by having your books set up correctly from the start rather than have to go back and fix any mistakes go to a chamber of commerce meeting or ask a colleague trusted vendor or customer for a recommendation

i think it may be best to take everything you 're asking line by line once you buy stocks on x day of the month the chances of stocks never actually going above and beyond your point of value on the chart are close to none this is not true companies can go out of business or take a major hit and never recover   take volkswagen for example in 2015 due to a scandal they were involved in their stocks went downhill now their stocks are starting to rise again the investors goal is not to wait as long as necessary to make a profit on every stock purchase but to make the largest profit possible in the shortest time possible sometimes this means selling a stock before it recovers if it ever does i think the problem with most buyers is that they desire the most gain they can possibly have however that is very risky this can be true every investor needs to gauge the risk they 're willing to take and high gain investments are riskier   therefore it 's better to be winning small medium amounts of money of the time than any amount of money < ~25 safer investments do tend to yield more consistent returns but this does n't mean that every investor should aim for low yield investments again this is driven by the investor 's risk tolerance to conclude profitable companies stock tends to increase over time and less aggressive investments are safer but it is possible to lose from any stock investment

i am surprised no one has mentioned the two biggest things in my opinion   or i should say the two biggest things to me   first 1099 have to file quarterly self employment taxes   i do not know for certain but i have heard that often times you will end up paying more this way then even a w-2 employees   second an llc allows you to deduct business expenses off the top prior to determining what you pay in taxes as pass through income   with 1099 you pay the same taxes regardless of your business expenses unless they are specifically allowed as a 1099 contractor which most are not i believe   so what you should really do is figure out the expense you incur as a result of doing your business and check with an accountant to see if those expenses would be deductible in an llc and if it offsets a decent amount of your income to see if it would be worth it   but i have read a lot of books and listened to a lot of interviews about wealthy people and most deal in companies not contracts   most would open a new business and add clients rather than dealing in 1099 contracts   just my two cents good luck and much prosperity

advantage of cash you can spend the money without having to pay any fees or taxes to get it out disadvantage when inflation is greater than zero which it has been for many decades your cash is continually losing value advantages of an ira roth or classic your money will usually grow as the investments return a profit you get special tax benefits disadvantages there 's risk you may lose money there are tax penalties for withdrawing the money before retirement in general you should only put money in an ira if you expect to leave it there until you retire or at least for a long time whole life is a combination of a life insurance policy and an investment advantages combines insurance and investment into one convenient monthly payment disadvantages the investment portion typically has lower returns than you could get elsewhere if you have no need for life insurance if you 're not supporting anyone or you 're they could get along without you or you do n't like them and do n't care what happens to them when you 're gone or whatever then there 's no point buying life insurance whole or term you 're paying for a product that you do n't need it 's pretty common advice to tell people that instead of buying a whole life policy they should buy a term policy with the same coverage and then invest the difference in the premium for example if you were considering getting a $ 100,000 whole life policy that costs $ 50 per month just making up numbers of course it depends on your age health etc and you see you could get a $ 100,000 term life policy for $ 30 per month you will almost certainly do better in the long run to buy the $ 30 term policy and put the other $ 20 into investments the catch to this plan is that there are usually transaction costs to investing even a discount broker like ameritrade or scott trade charges around $ 10 per transaction so if you tried to invest $ 20 each month you 'd lose half of it to transaction fees which means that in practice you 'd have to save that money up until you had at least a few hundred and at that point many people find other things always seem to come up to spend the money on so that while they start out with every intention of investing this money they do n't

you have some good points but get this it will certainly come a point of time where say 80 of the working population can provide 100 of the goods services everyone needs then this will get to 70 60 this can result in two things either huge unemployment problem or overproduction and all that comes with it spoilage lower prices cost cutting i.e. again unemployment it may not be soon but i think it 's inevitable the problem with that is so far employment is a great way to redistribute wealth a fair way let 's say which is the actual problem at hand jobs would n't matter if we had another efficient mechanism to do that in fact it would be better if humans did n't have to work at all and focus on leisure science art w e but we do n't have such a mechanism unfortunately and as the need for a labor force shrinks things are going to get ugly even than now since the supply of labor will grow with human population the price of labor inevitably will go down which means even more transfer of wealth from middle lower class to the capital owners

its based on demand and supply and what bank think the future rates would be today banks in india have a liquidity crunch as the repo rates by reserve bank of india central bank are high bank want to encourage more people to deposit money and hence are offering higher rates banks also believe that once the inflation is under control the central bank would ease the repo rates this is likely to happen in a years time hence banks one year down want to lower the fixed deposit rates so essentially they would be at loss if they give higher rates for longer periods so they are offering the highest rates for a period of year which motivates more people to invest for a year even if they want to stay invested for long

if they had told me that i owe them $ 10,000 from 3 years ago i    would n't have anything to fight back why first thing you have to do is ask for a proof have you received treatment have you signed the bill when you were done this should include all the information about what you got and how much you agreed to pay do they have that to show to you with your signature on it if they do n't you owe nothing if they do you can match your bank credit card insurance records those are kept for 7 years at least and see what has been paid already can a doctor 's office do that they can do whatever they want the right question is whether a doctor 's office is allowed to do that check your local laws states regulate the medical profession is there a statute of limitation i 'm just guessing that forces them    to notify me in a certain time frame statute of limitations limits their ability to sue you successfully they can always sue you but if the statute of limitations has passed the court will throw the suite away provided you bring this defense up on time of course without a judgement they can not force you to pay them they can only ask nicely as the law quoted by mrchrister mandates they can trash your credit report and send the bill to collections though but if the statute of limitations has passed i doubt they 'd do that especially if its their fault i 'm not a lawyer and you should consult with a lawyer licensed in your jurisdiction for definitive answers and legal advice

inflation is basically this   over time prices go up i will now address the 3 points you have listed suppose over a period of 10 years prices have doubled   now suppose 10 years ago i earned $ 100 and bought a nice pair of shoes   now today because prices have doubled i would have to earn $ 200 in order to afford the same pair of shoes   thus if i want to compare my earnings this year to 10 years ago i will need to adjust for the price of goods going up   that is i could say that my $ 100 earnings 10 years ago is the same as having earned $ 200 today or alternatively i could say that my earnings of $ 200 today is equivalent to having earned $ 100 10 years ago this is a difficult question because a car is a depreciating asset which means the real value of the car will go down in value over time let us suppose that inflation does n't exist and the car you bought for $ 100 today will depreciate to $ 90 after 1 year a 10 depreciation but because inflation does exist and all prices will be 0.5 higher in 1 years time we can calculate the true selling price of the car 1 in year as follows 0.5 of $ 90 = 0.005 90 = $ 0.45 therefore the car will be $ 90 + $ 0.45 = $ in 1 years time if inflation is low then the repayments do not get much easier to pay back over time because wages have not risen by as much   similarly the value of your underlying asset will not increase in value by as much however as compensation the interest rates on loans are usually lower when inflation is lower therefore generally it is better to get a loan in times of high inflation rather than low inflation however it really depends on how the much the interest rates are relative to the inflation rate

long story short 8 turned out to be the tipping point because it was the average subordination level of the a rated tranches of the subprime mbs bonds     the reason this was the magic number is because of the way bonds were placed during the period   basically no end user wanted to take on the risk of buying below a rated paper so instead of being sold directly these bbb rated and below bonds were re packaged into cdos and off   again the higher rated paper was sold off to whomever while the bbb and below stuff got and repackaged into other cdos or further levering up the initial subprime bonds     now back to the magic 8 number remember how i said that 8 was the subordination level for the a rated subprime paper the other way of saying that is once defaults reached 8 the bbb and below tranches of the the mbs were completely wiped out   since the cdos were largely made up of these bbb and below mbs once they started getting written down so did the cdos   when the lower rated cdo tranches started to go because they were also repackaged in the same way it just continued the negative feedback loop and before long even the   aa and aaa rated paper was seeing massive losses     as more and more supposedly safe paper started to get wiped out highly leveraged cds contracts started coming due causing aig which had written contracts on over $ 500 billion in assets to get downgraded by the rating agencies putting it on the brink of going under   because basically every major bank had exposure to aig had they gone under the other banks would have all had to write down those contracts at the same time essentially causing the entire financial system to collapse

from your explanation the sole trader option is more appropriate and certainly easier to manage   there are many differences but the pertinent and most important ones are as follows the main difference in your case would be tax and administration   as a sole trader you would need to do a tax return once a year and if you earned less than £ you would n't have to pay any uk tax assuming you have no other income and are a standard tax payer   the current tax allowance is £ although this can change submitting your own tax return is relatively although you may want to consult an accountant   it is generally easier to run as sole trader versus a limited company ie less paperwork and if you go down the limited company route the company would be liable to pay corporation tax on any profits and this process is more complicated and you would probably need an accountant to do that for you which is likely to cost a few hundred pounds every year   you can do it yourself but the process is not as simple as doing your own income tax return also as a sole trader you can do what you like with any income you can spend it and treat it as your own wages   you ca n't do that if you set up a limited company as the income is owned by the company and so you would need to in effect pay yourself a wage from the company   in other words it 's more complex than if you are a sole trader the main advantage to a limited company is that it is easier to sell the business if you want to at a later date   there is nothing stopping you setting up a limited company later on after a sole trader if you want to   they can also be more tax efficient but this would not be relevant to your case if you are earning relatively small sums if your income increases then you may want to reconsider you can see more information here   i have been both a sole trader and also set up my own limited company

you can if the market is open in a normal trading phase no auction phase works and there is an existing bid or offer on the product you want to trade at the time the market learns of your order keep in mind there are 2 prices bid and offer if the current bid and current offer were the same it would immediately result in a trade and thus the bid and offer are no longer the same market makers are paid given lower fees in order to maintain buy and sell prices called quotes at most times these conditions are usually all true but commonly fail for these reasons most markets have an order type of market order that says buy sell at any price there are still sanity checks put in place on the price with the exact rules for valid prices depending on the stock so unless it 's a penny stock you wo n't suddenly pay ten times a stock 's value the amount you can buy sell is limited by the quantity that exists on the bid and offer if there is a bid or offer the quantity is always at least 1

because in the case for if you wanted to placed a limit buy order at top of the bid list you would place it at 101 and get filled straight away if placing a limit buy order at the top of 91 for you would not get filled but just be placed at the top of the list you might get filled at a lower price if an ask comes in matching your bid however you might never get filled in regards to market orders with the being more liquid if your market order is larger than the orders at 101 then the remainder of your order should still get filled at only a slightly higher price in regards to market orders with the being less liquid it is likely that only part of your order gets filled and any remained either does n't get filled or gets filled at a much higher price

to protect yourself from an increase in interest rates get a fixed rate loan the loan terms interest rate number of payments monthly payments will be fixed for the loan of course if rate for the rest of the market drops during the period of the loan you may be able to refinance the loan but if you ca n't refinance or wo n't refinance the drop in rates for the rest of the market does n't help you if you want to be able to have your rate float you can get a variable rate loan of course it can float up or it can float down so you take that risk because of that risk adjustable rate loans start at a lower rate if the market interest rate drops far enough many people will refinance into a fixed rate loan at a lower rate than they could have gotten at the start for adjustable rate loans the lender during the application process details how the rate is determined it is pegged to be x% above some national or international interest rate that they do n't have any control over if that base rate moves then your loan rate may move they also specify how often it will adjust and the maximum it can adjust between each adjustments and over the entire life of the loan   that rate that starts initially lower than the fixed rate loan is the that many people have to pick an adjustable rate loan some do it because they believe they will payoff the loan before the rates get too high or they will see enough increase in income so they can afford the higher monthly payment if rates rise if they are wrong about these things they may find themselves in trouble the terms of the adjustable rate loan still have to follow the terms of the contract the lender ca n't change the offset or the source used to used to set interest rate

yes you can trade your properties go to the county recorder 's office to find out the exact procedure deeds generally have specific language to use and you must describe the property accurately in the deed if you want to do the transfer yourself you will need to make sure you have the language correct also you might want to do a title search to make sure that there are no claims against the property your brother is trading you such as by a lender who might have loaned money to him with the property as collateral 3 yes the normal way in the us is quitclaim deeds 4 a quitclaim deed only lists the money or other consideration that changes hands 5 since it is a trade for equal value there are no taxes 6 no normally a lawyer is only needed if you are dealing with a stranger and the transaction is complex as long as you follow the procedures of the clerk 's office correctly there should be no need for a lawyer in fact a lawyer might be undesirable because they could slow things down also since this is a non standard trade a lawyer actually has a higher chance of screwing something up because they will not give it long thought the way you would also they will use and mail instead of actually going to the office another source of error which you can avoid by doing the process correctly ie visiting the office lawyers do n't like getting out of their chairs and this causes them to make a lot of mistakes

yes the de beers group of companies is a diamond cartel that had complete control of the diamond market for most of the 20th century they still control a sizable portion of the market and their effort at marketing particularly with the slogan a diamond is forever has done much to inflate the market for diamonds in our society the intrinsic value of diamonds is much lower than the market prices currently reflect but with the caveat that there is a rarity factor which does drive up the price of larger diamonds the larger the diamond the more likely it is to have flaws so when it comes to diamonds that are 5 or greater you are not as likely to see a new supply of diamonds disrupt the prices of those larger stones some other ways that high end jewelers and suppliers are differentiating themselves is by patenting a specific cut that they design this is another barrier to entry that works to create some artificial price inflation one common example is the cut sometimes referred to as the cut diamonds can also be manufactured the same carbon structure can be grown in a lab these stones have the same carbon structure as natural diamonds but without the flaws and visible impurities most manufactured diamonds are used but processes have improved sufficiently to allow for quality synthetic diamonds they sell at a decent discount so that might be an option to consider if you want a substitute in the years to come you can expect prices for synthetic diamonds to continue to decrease which will probably put some further downward pressure on jewelers prices

i 'm absolutely a in economics and i wish to understand how things work around finance this is a pretty loaded question to understand finance you need the basics of economics in almost every economics school in the country you first study microeconomics and then economics so we 'll start with micro one of if not the most popular books is principles of microeconomics by this book covers the fundamentals of micro econ opportunity supply demand consumer choice production costs basic game theory and allocation of resources in a clear and effective manner it 's designed for the novice and very easy to read    like 's other book principles of macroeconomics is also top notch there is some overlap in key areas i.e. opportunity cost supply demand curves elasticity taxation because they are fundamental to economics and the overlap will always be there but from there the book goes into key macro concepts like gdp cpi employment monetary and fiscal policy and inflation an excellent intro primer indeed    now that you have the fundamentals down it 's time to learn about finance the best resource in my opinion is financial markets by robert shiller on open yale courses i 've personally taken prof shiller 's class last semester and the man is brilliant the lectures cover every single aspect of finance and can turn the complete novice into a fairly experienced finance student the first lecture also covers all the math required so you do n't get lost at any point be warned however that the course is very deep we used fabozzi 's textbook foundations of financial markets and institutions which is over 600 pages deep and we were required to know essentially all of it watch the videos and follow the readings and you 'll be a finance soon financial markets on open yale   and that 's your to what you want there are other economics books and it 's true that the first few chapters of both books are largely the same but that 's because any economics course always covers the basics first if you want to look at other books krugman has written some good books as well be sure to read reviews because some books are meant for year econ students so you do n't want to get a too advanced book at the novice level we 're interested in understanding the basic concepts so we can master fabozzi as for finance books fabozzi teaches you all the fundamentals of financial markets so you 've got a powerful foundation from there you can expand to more niche books such as books on investing or on monetary policy or whatever you want best of luck

on contrary of what mike scott suggested i think in case of euro doom it 's a lot safer if your savings were changed into another currency in advance beware that bringing your money into an euro core country like finland austria germany it 's useful if you think those banks are safer but totally useless to avoid the conversion of your saving from euro into your national currency in case of euro crash only the central bank will decide what happens to all the euro deposited wherever single banks even if they are deutsche bank or bnp or ing can not decide what to do on their own ecb european central bank might decide to convert euro into local currencies based on the account 's owner nationality therefor if you are greek and you moved your saving in a german bank the ecb might decide that your euro are converted into new even if they sit in a german bank account the thing is that if you ask to a finland bank in case of euro crash would you convert my euro into new they sure would answer no we ca n't which is true they can not because it 's only the ecb europe central bank the one that decides how an ordered euro crash has to be and the ecb might decide as i explained you above other central banks swiss fed etc would only follow the decisions of the ecb moreover in case of euro doom it 's highly probable that the euro currency looses a tremendous value compared to other currencies the loss would be huge in case the euro crash happens in a way i.e. a strong country like germany and their banks decides to get out and they start printing their own money w/o listening to the ecb anymore so even if your saving are in euro in germany they would loose so much value compared to other currencies that you will forever not to have converted them into another currency when you had the time to do it couple of advises 1 if you want to change you savings into another currency you do n't need to bring them into another bank country like us you could simply buy us shares bonds at your local bank shares bonds of a us company us gov will always be worth their value in dollars no matter in what new pathetic currency your account will be converted 2 but is there a drawback in converting my saving into another currency i.e. buying dollars in the form of us treasury bonds unfortunately yes the drawback is that in case this euro drama comes finally to an happy ending and germans decide to open their wallets for the time to save the currency the euro might suddenly increase its value compared to other currencies therefor if you changed your saving into another currency you might loose money i.e. us dollars looses value against the euro

i think it would be a wise move on the part of the 3d printing small businesses if contingency plans were put in place plan on alternate locations with backup printers or better yet print offsite in several locations and employ to transport the parts to the final customer a mechanism is much harder to squash and if a business starts by using satellite printers in the first place it 's much easier to bring previously unused resources online in the event of a disruption better yet subcontract the printing to individuals around your area that have the capabilities giving them a steady stream of income in return for a reduced rate i anticipate demand for this sort of service will pick up as both variety of materials and performance characteristics of output products improves this will last until 3d printing is so ubiquitous that and hp are selling units as cheaply as you buy printers now by that time smart printing services will have figured out alternative ways to stay in business instead of fighting to stay on top just like the older business models they

first of all bear in mind that there 's no such thing as a risk free investment if you keep your money in the bank you 'll struggle to get a return that keeps up with inflation the same is true for other safe investments like government bonds gold and silver are essentially completely speculative investments over the years their price tends to vary quite wildly so unless you really understand how those markets work you should steer well clear they 're certainly not low risk repeatedly buying a property to sell in a couple of years time is almost certainly a bad idea you 'll end up paying substantial transaction fees each time that would wipe out a lot of the possible profit and of course there 's always the risk that prices would go down not up buying a property to keep and preferably live in might be a decent option once you have a good deposit saved up it 's very hard to say where prices will go in future on the one hand london prices are very high by historical standards but on the other hand supply is likely to remain severely constrained for years to come i tend to think of a house as something that i need one of for the rest of my life and so in one sense not owning a house to live in is a gamble that house prices and rents wo n't go up substantially if you own a house you 're insulated from changes in rent etc and even if prices crash at least you still have somewhere to live however that argument only works really well if you expect to keep living in the same area under most circumstances house prices might crash in your area but not elsewhere

i was not able to find any authority for the opinion you suggest wash sale rules should imho apply according to the regulations you attribute the newly purchased shares to the oldest sold shares for the purposes of the calculation of the disallowed loss and cost basis c where the amount of stock or securities acquired within the period is less than the amount of stock or securities sold or    otherwise disposed of then the particular shares of stock or    securities the loss from the sale or other disposition of which is not    deductible shall be those with which the stock or securities acquired    are matched in accordance with the following rule the stock or    securities acquired will be matched in accordance with the order of    their acquisition beginning with the earliest acquisition with an    equal number of the shares of stock or securities sold or otherwise    disposed of you can resort to the claim that you have not in fact entered into the contract within 30 days but when you gave the instructions to reinvest dividends i do n't know if such a claim will hold but to me it sounds reasonable this is similar to the rules re short sales in g there in this case wash sale rules will not apply unless you instructed to reinvest dividends within the 30 days prior to the sale but i 'd ask a tax professional if such a claim would hold talk to a ea cpa licensed in your state

you do n't have to hire a tax consultant there is a number of companies who sell software or web based that helps you do it by asking for all relevant data interview style these typically cost between 15 and 25 eur i 'm not sure whether any of them are available in english but if you can read german well you should be ok is in english but to be honest it looks a bit dodgy to me now for your questions are there some tricky fields lines that after filling in my taxes will be counted higher this is rare at least for employees you nearly always get something back are there some tricky fields lines that after filling in my taxes could be counted lower not in general marriage is mentioned below and otherwise it 's all about individual deductibles ah one important factor if you have investment income and have not filed a with your bank you can get some of the taxes by filling out the form with data you got in the from your bank are there some flat rates that i could get advantage from absolutely as an employee the biggest factor is the of i think currently 1000 eur for general work related expenses which will be accepted without proof if your expenses are higher than that and you file individual expenses there are flat rates for work related moving and for commuting distance is it better to give a tax return together with my wife who was only a girlfriend in 2013 living with me in one household or to give it separately it 's not possible to do a joint tax filing for the time before your marriage what you should consider is to apply for a different tax class from now on if one of you earns significantly more than the other when separately do i have to fill her information in my tax return or can i just pretend there is nobody else in my apartment as far as taxes are concerned unmarried roommates are treated completely separately with one exception only one of you can deduct service charges included in your rent you have to get a from your landlord and service charges i.e. janitor etc should be marked separately but this may not be worth bothering with usually it results in a tax return of maybe 15 eur is there any guide in english that could be of help with filling in the tax return form i could n't find anything that looked really useful in a short search

bonds might not be simple but in general there are only a few variables that need to be understood bid coupon interest rate maturity and yield   bond tables clearly lay those out and if you 're talking about government bonds a lot of things like do n't apply although default is still a concern this might be overly simplistic but i view etf 's primarily as an easy way to bring somewhat esoteric instruments like grain futures into the easily available markets of nasdaq and the nyse that they got enhanced with leveraged funds and the such is interesting but perhaps not the original intent of the instrument   complicating your situation a bit more is the fee that gets tacked onto the etf even vanguard government bond funds hang out north of 0.1 that 's not huge but it 's not particularly appealing either considering that unlike rounding up live cattle futures it 's not that much work to buy us government bonds so the expense might not seem worth it to someone who 's comfortable purchasing the securities directly   i 'd be interested to see someone else 's view on this but in general i 'd say that if you know what you want and know how to buy it the government bond etf becomes a lot less relevant as the liquidity offered including the actual ease of transacting seem to to be the biggest factors in favor from investopedia 's description the bond etf is an exciting new addition to the bond market offering    an excellent alternative to self directed investors who looking for    ease of trading and increased price transparency want to practice    indexing or active bond trading however bond etfs are suitable for    particular strategies if for instance you are looking to create a    specific income stream bond etfs may not be for you be sure to    compare your alternatives before investing

the previous answers make valid points regarding the risks and why you ca n't reasonably compare trading for profit loss to a roll of the die this answer looks at the math instead your assumption i have an equal probability to make a profit or a loss is incorrect for the reasons stated in other answers however the answer to your question can i also assume that probabilistically speaking a trader can not do worst than random is yes but only because the question is flawed consequently it 's throwing people in all directions with their answers but quite simply in a truly random environment the worst case scenario no matter how improbable is that you lose over and over again until you have nothing left this can happen in sequential rolls of the dice and in trading securities bonds whatever you could guess wrong for every roll of the die and all of your stock picks could become worthless both outcomes result in $ 0 assuming you do not gamble with credit tell me which $ 0 is worse given the infinite number of plays that random implies the chance of losing your entire bankroll exists in both scenarios and that is enough by itself to make neither option worse than the other of course the opposite is also true you could only pick winners with an unlimited upside potential but again that could happen with either dice rolls or stock picks it 's just highly improbable my chances can not be worse than random and if my trading system has an edge that is greater than the percentage of the transaction that is transaction cost then i am probabilistically likely to make a profit nope this is where it all falls apart just because your chances of losing it all are similarly improbable does not make you more likely to win with one method or the other regression to the mean when given infinite truly random outcomes makes it impossible to have an edge also probabilistically is n't a word but probably is

i 've read this claim many times in the news banks are making less profit from the lending business when interest rates are historically low the issue with most loans is they can be satisfied at any time   when you have falling interest rates it means most of the banks loans are refinanced from nice high rates to current market low interest rates which can significantly reduce the expected return on past loans   the bank gets the money back when it wants it the least because it can only re lend the money at the current market lower interest rates   when interest rates are increasing refinance and early repayment activity reduces significantly it 's important to look at the loan from the point of view of the bank a bank must first issue out the entire principal amount   on a 60 month loan the lender has not received payments sufficient to satisfy the principal until around or month depending on the interest rate   if the bank receives payment of the outstanding amount on month 30 the expected return on that loan is reduced significantly consider a $ 10,000 60 month loan at 5 apr   the bank is expected to receive $ in total for interest income of $   if the loan is repaid on month 30 the total interest is about $ 972   that 's a 26 reduction of expected interest income and the money received can only be re lent for yet a lower interest rate add to this the tricky accounting of holding a loan which is really a discounted bond which is an asset on the books and profitability of lending while interest rates are falling gets really funky and this does n't even examine default risk cost

sorry i disagree they buy government bonds currently held by private banks who hold them for account holders this increased demand for government bonds means that the yield on them decreases this means the government can then borrow at a lower rate providing the qe is n't offset by a fall in private demand for bonds as they may be seen as in terms of the risk taken private investors will then turn to other investments offering a greater return this will then increase the capital stock available and expand output thus increasing employment

we 've had everything in one pot almost from day one of marriage the key ingredients to making that arrangement work is to communicate about the money and realize that you 're in it together   everything one person does affects the other separating finances the affecting one another part and makes it a little clearer perhaps but i can also see it creating a sense of entitlement this is my money   there should be a place for individual discretionary spending of course but i 'm not sure that off that money is the best way to do it it 's less likely to be viable if there 's one main in the house   in our house this is me   if we separated the finances like this it would amount to giving my wife an allowance   since she works harder at home than i do at work most of the time she keeps the house does meals and shopping raises and schools our daughter etc but just does n't get paid for it it would border on insult to her to treat the finances this way

two companies i worked for in the dc area also did wageworks the commuting money could be used for the subway bus and commuter rail a separate pot of money was used for parking   we had to estimate the amount of money that would be used the next month we had to decide by mid june how much we would spend in july the money was automatically added to the metro fare card on the first business day of the month when i first started they put the money on a special debit credit card that could only be used at commuter system it would be rejected at the department store if parking could n't be paid using a special card there was a way to claim the money with or without receipts if the company like the us government does for their employees paid the commuting expenses any excess funds at the end of the month were pulled back from the card they were just starting to do this in 2012 for employee pre tax funds they were supposed to add it to your next paycheck any excess at the end of the month there was also a way to use post tax funds from your paycheck so that all your commuting expenses could be on one card of course any post tax funds would be left on the card there was no real way for them to audit this because the system would never know if you were going to work or going to the dentist i ended up using two cards one for work and one for non work usage

in such a situation is it really safe to give financial info to a person who does not encrypt it encryption only helps to an extent i.e. during transmission of data or during brute force makes it more difficult to get the real data however you concern is more of staff using this data which encryption will not help much as they would be able to and see the data in what ways could it be misused this depends on the type of data the financial data can be used to hack into your accounts if other bits of info are known i.e. most of the times on telephone requests say putting card on hold requesting balance on account etc only your address mother name last few transaction details are asked some critical requests need more id proofs so generally not of concern the other misuse would be selling this to marketing companies so that you can be bombarded with sales pitch for anything and everything the pan and other id documents are becoming more prone to mis use i.e. give a copy of pan to open fraudulent accounts etc a good practise would be to mark every copy of id proof you give with the purpose as to why its given and a date this would make the id proof stale to an extent if she is not going to encrypt it should i ask her to delete all my old data and then create a new profile for my communication with her the new profile not being my name but a fake name the regulations would not allow her to create fake accounts and may lead to issues and as such any recognised financial advisor would not allow this to be done quite a few countries have regulations for financial advisor 's that need to be to

be very careful about buying property because it has been going up quickly in recent years   there are some fundamental factors that limit the amount real estate can appreciate over time   in a nutshell the general real estate market growth is supported by the entry level property market   that is when values are appreciating people can sell and use the capital gains to buy more valuable property   this drives up the prices in higher value properties whose owners can use that to purchase more expensive properties and so on and so forth at some point in a rising market the entry level properties start to become hard for entry level buyers to afford   the machine of rising prices throughout the market starts grinding to a halt   this price level can be calculated by looking at average incomes in an area   at some percentage of income people can not buy into the market without crazy loans and if those become popular watch out because things can get really ugly   if you want an example just look back to the us in 2007 2009 and the nearly apocalyptic financial crisis that as with most investing you want to buy low and sell high   buying into a hot market is generally not very profitable   buying when the market is abnormally low tends to be a more effective strategy

i 'm no expert on this but i would say that if you own the business entirely yourself there is nothing terribly wrong with using it for your own purposes as you would any other asset that you own   what is wrong is not keeping accurate records that distinguish between your money and the business 's   as you say this is wrong strategically but it can also be dangerous legally because if you mix your money and the business 's money and do n't keep track you could find for instance that you 've failed to pay the taxes you were supposed to there is also a concern that might not fall under what people refer to as ethics but more good corporate citizenship   basically people tend not to like companies that just shovel all their gains into the owners pockets   this is especially true if there are ways the money could be used to improve the business   in other words if you 're able to live high on the hog with the profits while paying all your employees a pittance the public may not look favorably on your business

the crude estimate of missing jobs rises to about   you think 75k jobs is a blip   and that is out of a employment elasticity   as people continue to ask for higher minimum wage by law that elasticity will undoubtedly increase   there is no question about it   i mean sure those who keep their jobs are better off no one doubts that but there will surely be more unemployment     edit sorry i took so long to respond had to do some other things and i wanted to make sure i gave the article you sent a good read

could clearly afford to pay them more they could double the salary of all their sales staff and you 'd barely even notice on apple 's bottom line   30,000 us employees working in stores double their salary and that 's $ 750 million per year vs some $ 25 million profits on the year they 'd be losing about 3 of their profits by doubling salesman wages in the us not a huge amount but certainly more than barely even notice

for a long time i thought that all the nice things that i live with i could only have because other people somewhere in the world went with less that i had a nice life only because through magical economy and forced servitude someone else had a bad life then i heard the parable of specialization   there are 3 people alice is a farmer bob is a farmer and charlie is a candlestick maker every person needs to eat 1 potato and 1 egg every day to live there is no money   alice has always had a knack for making eggs and trained herself to become even better bob has a nice field with soil and so is quite good at making potatoes alice spends her morning making 2 eggs and her afternoon making 1 potato while bob uses his morning to make 1 egg and his afternoon to make 2 potatoes   in the evening alice brings her 1 extra egg to charlie trades it for a 1-hour candle goes back home to eat her 1 egg and 1 potato and read her book for an hour before going to bed bob does the same thing except he trades his 1 extra potato for a 1-hour candle charlie can make 1 1-hour candle in the morning and 1 1-hour candle in the afternoon he eats the 1 egg and 1 potato he got and goes to bed   one day alice and bob meet at their fence and talk about the books they 're reading and how they can only read for 1 hour each night and how much food they each produce then they get an idea and agree on a new plan   now alice spends her morning making 2 eggs and her afternoon making 2 eggs for a total of 4 eggs every day bob starts making potatoes only and makes 4 every day at the end of the day alice gives bob 1 egg in exchange for 1 potato alice then brings her 2 extra eggs to charlie and bob brings his extra 2 potatoes charlie now starts getting 2 eggs and 2 potatoes every day so he gets a lovely wife daniel from the next county over and trains her to make 1-hour candles she 's just as good as charlie and makes 2 per day   so now alice gets 2 1-hour candles for her 2 extra eggs and reads for 2 hours every night before bed she 's happy bob also gets 2 1-hour candles for his 2 extra potatoes and reads for 2 hours before bed he 's also happy charlie uses the 2 eggs and 2 potatoes he gets to feed himself and daniel every day and charlie and daniel play in bed every night charlie and daniel are happy   and so because of specialization we start with 3 unhappy people and end with 4 happy people and 0 unhappy people good lives can be gotten without making other people suffer

if your concern is scams we should be talking about counterparties not bitcoin itself unless you think the protocol itself is a scam which imo it most certainly is not   you 're conflating the trustworthiness of counterparties with the trustworthiness of the underlying protocol which imo is not a very good model to operate by   you 'll understand the situation better of you look at them independently   bitcoin is n't trying to be a credit agency or the better business bureau it 's just trying to be digital money   do n't expect it to protect you from scams any more than cash will   that 's not its job and does not affect its trustworthiness as money

i think it 's advisable to exercise a fair amount of caution when posting information about yourself online with the advances in data aggregation efforts information that would have been considered sufficiently in years past might no longer be sufficient to protect you from bad actors online for example depending on which state and even which county you live in the county recorder 's office may allow anyone with internet access to freely search property records by your name if they know approximately where you live from the ip address that you use to post to a blog which could be if criminals compromised the blogging site and your they might be able to find your exact address if you own your home if you have considerable wealth it could open you to targeted attacks from organized criminals

agree with it is rare larger cap examples include nokia and holdings   if cash exceeds market cap that means total debt is greater than ev the value of the operating assets if the debt is partially repaid matures the equity is ok but if management is crap and the cash is spent at an below the interest rate on the debt now you have a situation where the net debt exceeds the value of the operating assets the credit quality suffers debt trades down you need to in order to avoid bankruptcy   the above assumes debt is greater than cash situations where cash exceeds market cap and debt is less than cash i.e. a negative ev are exceedingly rare in larger companies and are either a a wonderfully attractive mispricing or b market views management as so awful that the cash will get burnt up by the business and the value of that cash will be destroyed

this seems like a huge advantage for a roth to the point where i ca n't    figure out why anyone would choose a traditional you are missing something called the time value of money this is the concept that a certain amount of money now has the same value as a bigger amount of money later basically you would n't be willing to give up an amount of money now and get the same amount of money later you need to get a larger amount later to be willing to exchange it for a certain amount now so that larger amount later has the same value to you than that smaller amount now this is the idea behind interest and investment returns when you make an investment and it earns interest or gains over a period of time in effect that final amount of money principal + interest has the same value as the principal when you started because that final amount was grown from the original principal so whether you are taxed on the principal in the beginning as in roth ira or on the principal + interest at the end as in traditional ira you are still taxed on the same value of money and if the tax rates are the same between now and in the future then you pay the same value in taxes in both cases roth would only be better than traditional if the tax rates are lower now than when you take it out and traditional would only be better than roth if the tax rates are higher now than when you take it out let 's consider a simple example to demonstrate that the two are equivalent if the tax rates assuming a flat tax because tax brackets introduce other complications are the same now and when you take it out in both cases you start with $ 1000 pre tax wages you invest it for 10 years in a place with guaranteed 5 returns per year adn then take it out there are no penalties for withdrawal and there is a flat 25 tax now and in the future note that you are left with the same amount of money in both cases this arises from the of multiplication note that roth ira has a higher effective limit than traditional ira because the nominal limit is the same for both but roth is post tax so if you contribute to near the limit where traditional can no longer match the value that roth can contribute then the comparison no longer applies the $ 1000 in this example is below the limit for both

stock returns can not be evaluated on its own you need to take into account inflation and the return of other investment vehicles over the long run you want to earn more than your peers ie inflation or lose less than them stock lets you buy into the profits of a company managed by others so the fundamental question is do those company managers make better decision than average person of course there are times when they make awful decisions eg just before dotcom bubble and sometimes the best decision is to close the business but overall those people are much better educated have higher iq more etc and so over long time and across all the companies this is correct and hence the stock market premium

the pmi rate is calculated at the time your mortgage is underwritten to be terminated at the point where you have 20 equity in your home   it is calculated based off of default risks based on your current equity value at the time of the loan   so if you got your mortgage before the banking crisis those risk charts have changed dramatically and not in your favor so lets say you have a 100k home which you put 10k down so you have a mortgage of 90k   since you have accumulated an additional 5k equity so payoff value is now 85k   if you refinance your mortgage and the home values in your area have dropped 15 you now are borrowing 100 of the value of your home   so you have higher risk from being at 100 as opposed to 90   and the pmi is for the 20 of equity you do not have that the bank can not expect to recover   so when you originally bought the house your pmi pay out was 10k   at 85 k value and 100 borrowed the pmi payout will be closer to 18k   while you may still be able to sell your home for the original value when they do the refinance calculations they use what your area has   if that is the case you maybe be able get an actual appraisal to use but that will come out of your pocket disclaimer these are of how the whole complex process works if you call the banker they can explain exactly why show you the numbers and help you understand your specific circumstances

when you say apartment i take it you mean condo as you 're talking about buying right or no a condo is generally cheaper to buy than a house of equal size and but they you have to pay condo fees forever so you 're paying less up front but you have an ongoing expense with a condo the condo association normally does exterior maintenance so it 's not your problem find out exactly what 's your responsibility and what 's theirs but you typically do n't have to worry about maintaining the parking areas you have less if any grass to mow you do n't have to deal with roof or outside walls etc of course you 're paying for all this through your condo fees there are two advantages to getting a shorter term loan because you owe the money for less time each percentage point of interest is less total cash 1 time 15 years versus 1 times 30 years or whatever also you can usually get a lower rate on a shorter term loan because there 's less risk to the bank they only have to worry about where interest rates might go for 15 years instead of 30 years so even if you know that you will sell the house and pay off the loan in 10 years you 'll usually pay less with a 15 year loan than a 30 year loan because of the lower rate the catch to a shorter term loan is that the monthly payments are higher if you ca n't afford the monthly payment then any advantages are just hypothetical typically if you have less than a 20 down payment you have to pay mortgage insurance so if you can manage 20 down do it it saves you a bundle every extra dollar of down payment is that much less that you 're paying in interest you want to keep an emergency fund so i would n't put every spare dime i had into a down payment if i could avoid it but you want the biggest down payment you can manage well one can debate whether its better to use spare cash to invest in the stock market or some other investment rather than paying down the mortgage whole different question i do nt think its a good idea to make any principal payments as i would probably loose them when i would want to sell the house and pay off the mortgage i 'm not sure what you 're thinking there any extra principle payments that you make you 'll get back when you sell the house i mean suppose you buy a house for $ 100,000 over the time you own it you pay $ 30,000 in principle between regular payments and any extra payments and then you sell it for $ 120,000 so out of that $ 120,000 you 'll have to pay off the $ 70,000 balance remaining on the loan leaving $ 50,000 to pay other expenses and whatever is left goes in your pocket scenario 2 you buy the house for $ 100,000 pay $ 40,000 in principle and sell for $ 120,000 so now you subtract $ 60,000 from the $ 120,000 leaving $ 60,000 you put in an extra $ 10,000 but you get it back when you sell whether you make or lose money on the house whatever extra principle you put in you 'll get back at sale time in terms of less money that will have to go to pay the remaining principle on the mortgage

other people have pointed this out but there are a few considerations in whether you should do a roth or traditional ira such as one of the major arguments for using a traditional ira is that you can at least in theory afford to contribute more money initially than you 'd be able to afford if you were using a roth ira while this is in theory true i 'm not at all convinced that using a traditional ira will actually cause people to contribute more to it realistically how many people will actually contribute say $ 500 more to their ira because they knew that their contribution for this year will save them $ 500 to know if this is the case consider the last time that you actually invested some of your tax refund in your retirement account i have n't seen any actual statistics on this but i 'm guessing that very few people do this please see other people 's answers for details on the mathematics behind that the second argument for contributing to a traditional ira is if you expect your future income tax rate to be lower than your current tax rate for some reason e.g. due to a change in government policy e.g. replacing income taxes with value added tax or something like that the fact that you 're doing the contribution relatively close to when you 're planning on withdrawing it etc please see this question for more discussion about this keep in mind that while a traditional ira saves you tax money this year a roth ira saves you money when you withdraw it so it 's not really a question of paying taxes on $ 5000 now or $ 5000 later it 's a question of paying taxes on $ 5000 now vs. for example $ 50,000 later or however much the money 's grown by the time you withdraw it maybe the traditional ira is still worth it though if there are changes to tax policy or you end up with a lot more money in your traditional ira due to being able to contribute more

no something does n't seem right here   there would be virtually no time value to the option 10 minutes before market close on the expiration day what option is it and what is the expiration edit it appears you were looking only at the ask price it was $ however the bid price was only $ 1.35 and the last transaction was $ 1.40 so the true value is right about $ 1.35 to $ 1.40 at this second   this is a pitfall that tends to occur when you trade options with almost no volume for instance the open interest in that option is only 1 contract assuming that is yours so the bid and the ask can often be very far apart as they are only being generated by computer traders or the result of outdated irrelevant human orders

you have made a good start because you are looking at your options because you know that if you do nothing you will have a big tax bill in april 2017 you want to make sure that you avoid the underpayment penalty one way to avoid it is to make estimated payments but even if you do that you could still make a mistake and overpay or underpay i think the easiest way to handle it is to reach the safe harbor if your withholding from your regular jobs and any estimated taxes you pay in 2016 equal or exceed your total taxes for 2015 then even if you owe a lot in april 2017 you can avoid the underpayment penalty if you agi is over 150 k you have to make sure your withholding is 110 of your 2015 taxes then set aside what you think you will owe in your bank account until you have to pay your taxes in april 2017 you only have to adjust your withholding to make the safe harbor you can make sure easily enough once your file this years taxes you only have to make sure that you reach the 100 or 110 threshold from irs pub 17 who must pay estimated tax if you owe additional tax for 2015 you may have to pay estimated tax    for 2016 you can use the following general rule as a guide during the year to    see if you will have enough withholding or if you should increase    your withholding or make estimated tax payments   general rule     in    most cases you must pay estimated tax for 2016 if both of the    following apply you expect to owe at least $ 1,000 in tax for 2016 after subtracting your withholding and refundable credits you expect your withholding plus your refundable credits to be less than the smaller of a. 90 of the tax to be shown on your 2016 tax return or b. 100 of the tax shown on your 2015 tax return but see special rules for farmers fishermen and higher income taxpayers later    your 2015 tax return must cover all 12 months reminders estimated tax safe harbor for higher income taxpayers if your 2015    adjusted gross income was more than $ 150,000 $ 75,000 if you are    married filing a separate return you must pay the smaller of 90 of    your expected tax for 2016 or 110 of the tax shown on your 2015    return to avoid an estimated tax penalty

generally you have 60 days to return funds    if you 've been away money in to a roth ira and an emergency strikes you pull out contributions sufficient to tackle the emergency while leaving at least the earnings in there   you 've never paid taxes on these earnings and the earnings will continue to grow tax free    if you 've been away money in a vanilla taxable account and an emergency strikes you pull out whatever amount to tackle the emergency   you 've been paying taxes on the earnings all along but there 's no paperwork you ca n't replace the money in the roth ira outside the 60 day limit except for some specific same year rules that you should iron out with your custodian but you also have n't lost anything   either way in the event of an emergency the funds are removed from an account but in one case you have n't been paying taxes on gains if you want to go the route of a roth ira wrapper for your emergency fund you should n't be touching the funds for small events tires for your car and the like   if your goal is to juice the tax free nature of the roth ira wrapper for as long as you can then the money for retirement if you never experienced an emergency with the understanding that you may have to gut the account in an emergency that 's fine   if you expect money to routinely come in and out of the account a roth ira is a horrible vehicle

my answer is specific to the us because you mentioned the federal reserve but a similar system is in place in most countries do interest rates increase based on what the market is doing or do they solely increase based on what the federal reserve sets them at there are actually two rates in question here the wikipedia article on the federal funds rate has a nice description that i 'll summarize here the interest rate that 's usually referred to is the federal funds rate and it 's the rate at which banks can lend money to each other through the federal reserve the nominal federal funds rate this is a target set by the board of governors of the federal reserve at each meeting of the federal open market committee fomc when you hear in the media that the fed is changing interest rates this is almost always what they 're referring to the actual federal funds rate through the trading desk of the new york federal reserve the fomc conducts open market operations to enforce the federal funds rate thus leading to the actual rate which is the rate determined by market forces as a result of the fed 's operations open market operations involve buying and selling short term securities in order to influence the rate as an example the current nominal federal funds rate is 0 in economic parlance this is known as the zero lower bound while the actual rate is approximately 25 basis points or 0.25 why is it assumed that interest rates are going to increase when the federal reserve ends qe3 i do n't understand why interest rates are going to increase in the united states quantitative easing is actually a little different from the usual open market operations the fed conducts open market operations usually involve the buying and selling of short term treasury securities in qe however especially the latest and ongoing round qe3 the fed has been purchasing longer term treasury securities and mortgage backed securities mbs by purchasing mbs the fed is trying to reduce the overall risk of the commercial housing debt market furthermore the demand created by these purchases drives up prices on the debt which drives down interest rates in the commercial housing market to clarify the debt market i 'm referring to is the market for mortgage backed securities and other debt derivatives cdo 's for instance i 'll use mbs as an example the actual mortgages are sold to companies that securitize them by pooling them and issuing securities based on the value of the pool this process may happen numerous times since derivatives can be created based on the value of the mbs themselves which in turn are based on housing debt in other words mbs are n't exactly the same thing as housing debt but they 're based on housing debt it 's these packaged securities the fed is purchasing not the mortgages themselves   once the fed draws down qe3 however this demand will probably decrease as the fed its balance sheet over several years and demand decreases throughout the market prices will fall and interest rates in the commercial housing market will fall ideally the fed will wait until the economy is healthy enough to absorb the unloading of these securities   just to be clear the interest rates that qe3 are targeting are different from the interest rates you usually hear about it 's possible for the fed to unwind qe3 while still keeping the interest rate i.e. the federal funds rate near zero although this is considered unlikely also the fed can target long term vs. short term interest rates as well which is once again slightly different from what i talked about above this was the goal of the operation twist program in 2011 and in the 1960 's gave a great description of the program in this answer but basically the fed purchased long term securities and sold short term securities with the goal of twisting the yield curve to lower long term interest rates relative to short term rates the goal is to encourage people and businesses to take on long term debt e.g. mortgages capital investments etc my main question that i 'm trying to understand is why interest rates are what they are is it more of an arbitrary number set by central banks or is it due to market activity hopefully i addressed much of this above but i 'll give a quick summary there are many interest rates in numerous different financial markets the rate most commonly talked about is the nominal federal funds rate that i mentioned above although it 's a target set by the board of governors it 's not arbitrary there 's a reason the federal reserve hires hundreds of research economists no central bank arbitrarily sets the interest rate it 's determined as part of an effort to reach certain economic benchmarks for the foreseeable future whatever those may be   in the us current fed policy maintains that the federal funds rate should be approximately zero until the economy the unemployment and inflation benchmarks set forth by the rule named after charles the president of the federal reserve bank of chicago who pushed for the rule the effective federal funds rate as well as other rates the fed has targeted like interest rates on commercial housing debt long term rates on treasury securities etc are market driven the fed may enter the market but the same forces of supply and demand are still at work although the fed 's actions are controversial the effects of their actions are still bound by market forces so the policies and their effects are anything but arbitrary

paying up in full before the statement is posted does not seem a good idea i feel you should keep some small amount to be posted as a statement balance and pay that in full each month if you keep your statements as always 0 will give creditors an impression that you have cards and you do n't utilize them so they ca nt really gauge how you preform being debt whether you are able to manage your debt well etc i always keep < 100 dollar in every credit card i have to be posted a statement balance i have > 100k credit line over 3 cards so if i take air ticket to se asia runs into 3000 $ for my family i pay a day before statement generates and keep 100 for statement to be posted pay 100 the next day or as auto debit this way you have some utilization + lower credit card outstanding at any point make your utilization right in single digits

the problem is that short term trends are really unpredictable   there is nobody who can accurately predict where a fund or even moreso a single stock or bond is going to move in a few hours or days or even months the long term trends of the entire market however are more or less predictable   there is a definite upward bias when you look at time scales of 5 10 20 years and more   individual stocks and bonds may crash and different sectors perform differently from year to year but the market as a whole has historically always risen over long time scales of course past performance never guarantees future performance   it is possible that everything could crash and never come back but history shows that this would be incredibly unlikely   which is the entire basis for strategies based on buying and holding and periodically rebalancing a portfolio containing funds that cover all market sectors now regarding your 401(k you know your time horizon   the laws wo n't let you withdraw money without penalty until you reach retirement age this might be 40 years depending on your current age   so we 're definitely talking long term   you should n't care about where the market goes over a few months if you wo n't be using the money until 20 years from now the most important thing for a 401(k is to choose funds from those available to you that will be as diverse as possible   the actual allocation strategy is something you will need to work out with a financial advisor since it will be different for every person   once you come up with an appropriate allocation strategy you will want to buy according to those ratios with every paycheck and rebalance your funds to those ratios whenever they start to drift away   and review the ratios with your advisor every few years to keep them aligned with large scale trends and changes in your life

you are at the point that many millions of people are at and where i used to be you have no idea where your money is going you just spend spend spend until there 's nothing left and/or you borrow more to keep going   there are general rules of thumb on how much house and car you can afford but there is a great deal of personal variation housing and utility costs vary greatly from location to location city dwellers can use public transit instead of buying and maintaining a car how much other debt do you have that you need to pay off do you have expenses that are not common e.g. medical bills a more personal approach would be to figure out your own budget the first step is creating a written budget figure out how much you can spend in total i.e. your take home pay and the start allocating that money to expenses until you run out i started by looking backwards   look back at how much you spent on each category each month list them in order of priority e.g. food health housing utilities transportation entertainment everything else if the money runs out you either stop spending or reduce spending in another category e.g. can you cook a few extra meals at home instead of going out can you take lunch to work instead of a drive through the amount you have left over now indicates how much more house and car you can afford once you get to a point where you can budget comfortably then you can start looking at saving for retirement and other long term goals this worked for me and highlighted some areas where i overspent because i had good categorized records ironically because i used credit cards which i mostly stopped once i created a budget if you do n't have good records then you have to estimate   how much do you think you spend on food gas etc each month   then set aside that much and once it 's gone do n't spend anymore   now obviously you 're not going to stop eating but the idea is to plan ahead and realize i have only $ 20 left to spend on food this month maybe i should n't go to the movies it takes lots of practice and you wo n't get it right very often if you have enough left over you can set aside some as a cushion in case you do go over your budget but if you want true financial discipline you should start by reducing other categories first this is not easy by any means it will take of practice and trial and error to get to a point that you 're comfortable with the lifestyle that you can afford    so in the end there are only two variables in your equation income and outflow   do you want more house either spend less on other things or increase your income

in general lump sum investing will tend to outperform dollar cost averaging because markets tend to increase in value so investing more money earlier will generally be a better strategy   the advantage of dollar cost averaging is that it protects you in times when markets are overvalued or prior to market corrections    as an extreme example if you done a lump sum investment in late 2008 and then suffered through the subsequent market crash it may have taken you 2 3 years to get back to even   if you began a dollar cost averaging investment plan in late 2008 it may have only taken you a 6 months to get back to even dollar cost averaging can also help to reduce the urge to time the market which for most investors is definitely a good thing

private equity is simply some type of an investment company which is owned in a way not accessible to the public ie warren buffet runs berkshire which is an investment company which itself is traded on the new york stock exchange this means that anyone can buy shares in the company and own a small fraction of it if warren buffet owned all the shares of berkshire it would be a private equity company note that equity refers to the ownership of the company itself a private investment company may simply buy bonds which are a form of debt in which case they would not be technically considered a private equity company a hedge fund is a very broad term which i do n't believe has significant meaning technically it means something along the lines of an investment fund either public or private which attempts to hedge the risks of its portfolio by carefully considering what type of investments it purchased this refers back to the meaning of hedge ie hedging your bets in my opinion hedge fund is not meaningfully different from investment fund or other similar terms it is just the most popular way to refer to this type of industry at the present time   you can see the trend of using the term investment fund vs hedge fund using this link note that the high point of the use of hedge fund occurred on october 2008 right at the peak of the global financial crisis the term a certain image of high finance wall street types that may exploit various situations such as tax legislation or secret information for their own gain without a clear definition however it is a term without much meaning if you do a similar comparison between hedge fund and private equity you can see that the two correlate very closely i believe the term private equity is similarly misused to generally refer to investment bankers however in that case private equity has a more clear definition on its own merits

my understanding is that to make the $ 18,000 elective deferral in this case you need to pay yourself at least $ 18,000   there will be some tax on that for social security and medicare so you 'll actually need to pay yourself a bit more to cover that too the employer contribution is limited to 25 of your total compensation   the $ 18,000 above counts but if you want to max out on the employer side you 'll need to pay yourself $ 140,000 salary since 25 of $ 140,000 is the $ 35,000 that you want to put into the 401k from the employer side there are some examples from the irs here that may help i know that you 're not a one participant plan but some of the examples may help anyway since they are not all specific to one participant plans

you 're interpreting this correctly furthermore if your total tax liability is less than $ 1000 you can not pay estimates at all just pay at the tax day see this safe harbor rule in the irs publication 17 general rule     in most cases you must pay estimated tax for 2016 if    both of the following apply you expect to owe at least $ 1,000 in tax for 2016 after subtracting your withholding and refundable credits you expect your withholding plus your refundable credits to be less than the smaller of 90 of the tax to be shown on your 2016 tax return or 100 of the tax shown on your 2015 tax return but see special rules for farmers fishermen and higher income taxpayers later    your 2015 tax return must cover all 12 months

you will maximize your expected wealth by investing all the money you intend to invest as soon as you have it available do n't let the of dollar cost averaging induce you to allocate more much money to a savings account than is optimal   if you want the positive expected return of the market do n't put your money in a savings account   that 's especially true now when you are certainly earning a negative real interest rate on your savings account dollar cost averaging and putting all your money in at the beginning would have the same expected return except that if you put all your money in earlier it spends more time in the market so your expected return is higher   your volatility is also higher because your savings account would have very low volatility but your preference for investment tells me that you view the expected return and volatility tradeoff of the stock market as acceptable if you need something to help you feel less stress about investing right away think of it as dollar cost averaging on a yearly basis instead of monthly   further you take take comfort in knowing that you have allocated your wealth as you can instead of letting it away in real terms in a bank account

be sure to consider the difference between roth 401 k and standard 401k. the roth 401 k is taxed as income then put into your account so the money you put into the roth 401 k is taxed as income for the current year however any interest you accumulate over the years is not taxed when you withdraw the money   so to break it down you may also want to look into self directed 401 k which can be either standard or roth check if your employer supports this type of account but if you 're self employed or 1099 it may be a good option

the math works out so that the 401k is still a better deal in the long term over a taxable account because of the tax deferred growth let 's assume you invest in an s&p 500 index fund in either a taxable investment account or a 401k and the difference in fees is .5 i used an online calculator and a hypothetical 1k year investment over 30 years with 4.5 tax deferred growth vs 5 taxable and a 25 tax bracket after 30 years the tax deferred 401k account will have $ and the taxable account will have $ the math is n't perfect i 'm sure i 'm missing some with dividends capital gains distributions and that you 'll then pay income tax on the 401k upon retirement as you drawn down but it still seems pretty clear that the 401k will win in the long run especially if you invest more than the 1k year used in my example but yeah expenses on an index fund is robbery can you bring that to the attention of the hr department maybe they 'll want to look for a lower fee provider and it 's in their best interest too if they also participate

okay they 're faster than most other computers they either have a dedicated fiber line or are physically closer   but anyways they flood the nyse with tons of orders to slow it down so they see another broker 's order in the line up and delete the bogus orders they can then make the purchase faster than the other guy the other guy now has to pay a higher strike price than he initially thought the bid would be    so let 's say apple 's quote is 1.00   they send one order for apple   one for ibm   one for yahoo   one for nbc comcast   they see another guy wants apple so they cancel the orders for ibm yahoo and nbc comcast and leave the apple one to complete the apple one goes through and then they automatically resell it to the guy looking to buy apple at a price of   tldr   they flood a bunch of orders at a bunch of different prices quantities they cancel before it goes through unless they see someone else wants it if that person wants it they do n't cancel   edit i do n't even know if all or any of those stocks are listed on the nyse in today 's world it does n't make a difference anymore however replace nyse with any exchange and the stock with any ticker symbol   edit 2 they could also manipulate cross listing listing the same stock on two different exchanges those prices are mostly uniform but of course higher volume on one could mean a higher price on one before they stabilize so if you can move fast you can buy the stock at the lower price and sell it on the exchange with the higher price

the cash is not penalty free if you take up loans from the policy to pay for retirement growth essentially stops and the interest will eat away policy value over time so instead of gaining 7 8 per year and taking withdrawals you would be taking loans and losing whatever the interest rate is   dividends are just the profits made from the company which is why its tax free its considered a return of premium you are just overpaying for the policy by its dividend rate    whole life is a great vehicle for some situations but it always comes after a 401k or other retirement savings whole life does nt even begin to make sense imo until you are making a few hundred thousand a year and need it for a business buy sell agreement or legacy money to leave children grandchildren   it does nt scale well to lower incomes

i believe you 're looking for some sort of formula that will determine how changes in savings investing and spending will affect economic growth   if such a formula existed and worked then central planning would work since a couple of people could pull some levers to encourage more savings or more investing or more spending depending on what was needed at that particular time   unfortunately no magic formula exists and so no person has enough knowledge to determine what the proper amount of savings investing or spending should be at a given time i found this resource particular helpful in describing the interactions between savings consumption and investing

it 's clearly a risk but is it any different than investing in your own business yes it is different   if you own a business you determine the path of the business   you determine how much risk the business takes   you can put in extra effort to try to make the business work   you can choose to liquidate to preserve your capital    if you invest without ownership perhaps the founder retains a 50 plus one share stake then whomever controls the business controls all those things   so you have all the risks of owning the business in terms of things going wrong without the control to make things go right   this makes investing in someone else 's business inherently riskier    another problem that can occur is that you could find out that the business is fraudulent   or the business can become fraudulent   neither of those are risks if you are the business owner   you wo n't defraud yourself    angel investing that is to say investing in someone else 's startup is inherently risky   this is why it is difficult to find investors even though some startups go on to become wealthy google youtube facebook twitter etc   most startups fail   they offer the possibility of great returns because it 's really hard to determine which ones will fail and which will succeed   otherwise the business would just take out the same loan that jane 's getting and leave jane out of it

here 's how i think about money there are only 3 categories contexts buckets that my earned money falls into savings is my emergency fund i keep 6 months of total expenses expenses are anything in the consumption bucket you can be as detailed as you want with this area but i tend to leave a fudge factor in other words if i estimate that i spend approximately $ 3,000 a month in consumption dollars then i 'll save $ 3,500 times 6 in the bank this money needs to be liquid some people use a heloc other people use their roth contributions in any case you need to put this money some place you can get access to it in case you go from accumulation income exceed expenses to mode expenses exceed income this money is distinct from consumption which i will cover in paragraph three investments are stocks bonds income producing real estate small businesses etc these dollars require a strategy the strategy can include some form of asset allocation but more importantly a timeline these are the dollars that are working for you each dollar placed here will multiply over time once you put a dollar here it should n't be taken out unless there is some sort of catastrophe that your savings ca n't handle or your timeline has been achieved notice that rental real estate is included so liquidating stocks to purchase rental real estate is not considered removing investment dollars just reallocating based on your asset allocation this bucket includes 401k 's iras all tax sheltered accounts non sheltered brokerage accounts and rental real estate in general your primary residence is not included in this bucket some people include the equity of their primary residence in the investment column but it can complicate the equation and i prefer to leave it out the consumption bucket is the most important bucket and the one you spend the most time with it requires a budget this includes your $ 5 magazine and your $ 200 bottle of wine anything in this bucket is gone you can recover a portion of it by selling it on ebay for $ 3 these are earned dollars but the original $ 5 is still considered spent the reason your thought process in this area is distinct from the other two the decisions made in this area will have the biggest impact on your personal finances warren buffett was famous for on haircuts because they are worth thousands of dollars down the road if they are invested instead remember this is a zero sum game so every $ 1 not consumed is placed in one of the other buckets once your savings bucket is full every dollar not consumed is sent to investments remember to include everything that does not fit in the other two buckets most people forget their car insurance life insurance tax bill at the end of the year accountant bill etc in conclusion there are three buckets savings which serve as your emergency bucket this money should not be touched unless you switch from accumulation to investments which are your dollars that are working for you over time they require a strategy and a timeline consumption which are your monthly expenses these dollars keep you alive and contribute to your enjoyment this is a short explanation of my use of money it can get as complicated and detailed as you want it to be but as long as you tag your dollars correctly you 'll be okay imho hth

i have a different perspective i believe the move to roth may be beneficial to a select few but not most people i coined the phrase as i believe that 's what 's happening a relatively uninformed move based on fear and not enough analysis   let 's look at a retiree today a couple has a $ standard deduction and 2 exemptions worth $ each this is $ they can withdraw tax free it would take pretax savings of $ k to support this withdrawal at   the 10 bracket is the next $ of taxable income or another $ k in assets to produce this annual withdrawal last for today the 15 bracket is the next $ which would require $ m to produce   the punchline today 's retiree couple can have over $ 2.1 m in pretax money this includes pension value if any of course and still be in the 15 bracket   if you ca n't deposit to a roth you are in the 28 bracket now or higher are you on track to have over $ 2 m in today 's dollars at retirement   one point that few mention is there are not just the two today 's tax rate vs retirement tax rate every year offers a situation where your income may drop a job loss a spouse staying home with a new child a disability a year back at school   these are the years that you might convert to roth just enough to fill your bracket back to your average prior rate e.g. convert to a taxable income of exactly $ and pay a marginal rate of 25   i 'll be the first to congratulate those who tell me they have a defined benefit pension that will replace their income to such a level that with their investments they are retiring at a higher income level than while working roth is the answer for them   roth is great for the 80 yr old woman i help 10 years ago i observed her marginal rate to be 15 and we convert just enough to put her at the top of that bracket this year $ 34,000 in taxable income this helps slow down the effect of her rmds required minimum distributions continuing to rise and potentially put her in the 25 bracket   so to be clear i 'm not anti roth i 'm just in favor of a thorough analysis and avoiding the roth for everyone mentality   edit i was asked by a financial writer kay bell to write on this very topic and appear on her site in a guest post roth iras and your retirement income it goes into greater detail than i could offer here tell kay joe sent you

you should be worried you have made the mistake of entering an investment on the recommendation of family friend the last think you should do is make another mistake of just leaving it and hoping it will go up again your stock has dropped from its high of $ that means it has to go up over 60 just to reach the high of $ you are correct this may never happen or if it does it could take a long long time to get up to its previous highs what is the company doing to turn its fortunes around take a look at some other examples airways   this stock reached a high of around $ 6 in late 2007 after a nice uptrend over a year and a half it then dropped drastically at the start of the gfc and has since kept falling and is now priced at just $ 1.15 reported its first ever loss earlier this year but its problems were evident much earlier aapl apple inc.   aapl reach a high of just over $ 700 in september 2013 then dropped to around $ 400 and has recovered a bit to about $ 525 still 25 below its highs and looks to be at the start of another downtrend how long will it take aapl to get back to $ 700 more than 33 from its current price ten network holdings limited   ten reached a high of $ in late 2004 after a nice uptrend during 2004 it then started a steep journey downwards and is still going down it is now priced at just $ 0.25 a whopping 94 below its high it will have to increase by 1600 just to reach its high of $ which i think will never happen can a stock come back from a drastic downtrend yes it can it does n't always happen but a company can turn around and can reach and even surpass it previous highs the question is how and when will this happen how long will you keep your capital tied up in a stock that is going nowhere and has every chance of going further down the most important thing with any investment is to protect your current capital if you lose all your capital you can not make any new investments until you build up more capital that is why it is so important to have a risk management strategy and decide what is your get out point if things go against you before you get into any new investment have a stop loss i would get out of your investment before you lose more capital if you had set a stop loss at 20 off the stock 's last highs you would have gotten out at about $ 28 higher than the current share price of $ if you do further analysis on this company and find that it is improving its prospects and the stock price breaks up through its current ranging band then you can always buy back in however do you still want to be in the stock if it breaks the range band on the downside in this case who knows how low it can continue to go this is my opinion as others would have theirs and what i would do in your current situation with this stock

the answer seems to depend on where you live   perhaps you already found this but the summary from the irs is the insurance laws in some states do not allow a corporation to purchase group health insurance when the corporation only has one employee therefore if the shareholder was the sole corporate employee the shareholder had to purchase his health insurance in his own name the irs issued notice 2008 1 which ruled that under certain situations the shareholder would be allowed an above the line deduction even if the health insurance policy was purchased in the name of the shareholder notice 2008 1 provided four examples including three examples in which the shareholder purchased the health insurance and one in which the s corporation purchased the health insurance notice 2008 1 states that if the shareholder purchased the health insurance in his own name and paid for it with his own funds the shareholder would not be allowed an above the line deduction on the other hand if the shareholder purchased the health insurance in his own name but the s corporation either directly paid for the health insurance or reimbursed the shareholder for the health insurance and also included the premium payment in the shareholder ’s w-2 the shareholder would be allowed an above the line deduction the bottom line is that in order for a shareholder to claim an above the line deduction the health insurance premiums must ultimately be paid by the s corporation and must be reported as taxable compensation in the shareholder ’s w-2 i understand this to mean that you can only get the deduction in your case having purchased it in your own name if your state does not allow your s corp to purchase a group health plan because you only have one employee i do n't know specifically if illinois fits that description or not   in addition there are rules about reporting health insurance premiums for taxes for s corp share members that you should also check   personally i think that it 's complicated enough that advice from a cpa or other tax advisor specific to your situation would be worth the cost
