get a lawyer to put this in contract form with everything spelled out explicitly what is fair is what the two of you agree upon my own suggestion divide the property into things which are yours his and shared then have each of you be responsible for all your costs plus half the shared costs but get all the benefits of your half that would mean that if he rents out his half all the rental income is his if you decide to live in your half all the savings of not paying rent are yours   each of you pays your half of mortgage insurance and other shared costs repairs to shared infrastructure should be done by someone both of you trust if you agree the work is needed and he does it rather than your hiring someone you owe him the appropriate percentage of the costs the two of you will need to agree on whether you owe him for that percentage of his time as well make sure you agree on some mechanism for one person offering to buy the other out or to sell their half to the other party or potentially to someone else entirely personally i would try to do that at opportunity to avoid some of the ways this can go wrong see past comments about the hazards of guaranteeing a loan this works or does n't work similarly does that address your question

definitely get a lawyer to write up all the details of the partnership in a formal agreement if your ex does not want to do this that is a bad sign you both need to be clear about expectations and responsibilities in this partnership and define an exit strategy in the case one of you wants out this is the most fair to both parties generally what is common is that property is split cleanly when the relationship ends i would strongly recommend you both work towards a clean split with no joint property ownership how this looks depends on your unique situation to address your questions 2 and 3 you have two roles here tenant and owner   as a 50 owner you are running a business with a partner   that business will have assets home income expenses and profit you basically need to run this partnership as a simple business   all the rent income your rent and the other tenant 's should go into a separate account the mortgage and all other housing expenses are then paid from only this account any excess is then profit that may be split 50/50 all expenses should be agreed upon by both of you either by contract or by direct communication you should see a financial professional to make sure accounting and taxes are set up properly under this system your ex could do work on the house and be paid from the business income however they are responsible to you to provide an estimate and scope of work just like any other contractor if you as a joint owner agree to his price he then could be paid out of the business income this reduces the business cash flow for the year accordingly you can probably see how this can get very complicated very fast there is really no right or wrong answer on what both of you decide is fair and best for the sake of simplicity and the least chance of a disaster the usual and recommended action is to cleanly split all property good luck

somewhat   the balance sheet will include liabilities which as michael points out would tell you the totals for the debt which would often be loans or bonds depending on one 's preferred terminology   however if the company 's loan was shorter than the length of the quarter then it may not necessarily be reported is something to point out as the data is accurate for a specific point in time only my suggestion is that if you have a particular company that you want to review that you take a look at the sec filing in full which would have a better breakdown of everything in terms of assets liabilities etc than the a summary page   would be where you could find a link to the 10-q that has a better breakdown though it does appear that apple does n't have any bonds outstanding   there are some companies that may have little debt due to being so profitable in their areas of business

all things being equal a defined benefit pension is far better than an ira or a 401(k   think about it this way let 's say you can have a guaranteed $ 100 a month or the chance at $ 100 a month   which is better    now obviously your tolerance for risk is the difference but this is the beauty of a defined benefit plan your employer is picking up the risk   assuming that the pool of investments is about the same which unless if their funds are tremendously under performing they are the question is who takes the risk you or them especially if you are moving into a new position having a defined benefit plan is like having a risk free asset in your portfolio   it increases your safety   the only reason to roll this over into a 401(k or ira is if your expected value risk payout is better   a worked example if half the time you would earn more than $ 100 and half the time less then you could imagine the two as being equally good only if you really love risk would you take that chance   in reality only half the investments out there will beat the average and as such you actually have less than a 50/50 shot of beating a db unless if there are really low returns to it   more likely i suspect you are over estimating your ability to get a higher return

fixed rate mortgage is supposed to give you security you are not going to get the best possible rate but it is safe and predictable your argument is the same as complaining that you are paying for home insurance and your home has n't burnt down   switching to a variable rate mortgage right now seems a bad idea because there is some expectations that rates are going up if you can overpay that is probably what you should do unless you can invest with better return after tax than your mortgage interest it does n't just shorten the time of your mortgage every time you overpay £ 500 your mortgage principal is down by £ 500 and you pay interest on £ 500 less   and if the interest rate goes up over the next five years as you seem to hope that just means you will pay higher interest when your mortgage needs renewing   you ca n't hope to always make the optimal decision you made a decision with very low risk as with any decision you do n't know what 's in the future a decision that is low risk if the risk could lead to fatal results is not unwise you could have picked a variable rate mortgage and could be paying twice as much interest today

let 's say i have $ 10,000 and i invest said monies in mutual fund    at $ 100/share effectively giving me 100 shares now let 's    assume at the end of the year i have a 5 return my $ 10,000 is now    $ 10,500 at what point does my investment benefit from compounded interest    monthly quarter yearly does it even benefit daily would be my answer as your investment unless you are selling shares or not re investing distributions is getting the following day 's change that impacts the overall return consider how if your fund went up 2 one day and then 2 another day from that $ 10,000 initial investment the first gain brings it up to $ and then the second makes it $ where the extra $ 2 is from the compounding the key though is that these are generally small movements that have to be multiplied together note also that if your fund goes up and down you may end up down overall given how the returns compound consider that your $ 10,000 goes up 10 to $ 11,000 and then down 10 to result in $ 9,900 as the return for up x% and down x% is which in this case is 1 as 10 of 10 is 1 the key is how long do you keep all the money in there so that the next day is applied to that amount rather than resetting back to the initial investment

i do n't think so in your case unless the account generates so much interest income that it became reportable i do n't know the exact limit but i think it 's in the hundreds if not thousands of dollars you might get a 1099 form if it generates over $ 10 of interest income but you do n't have to file taxes if your overall income is too low anyways the us does not typically tax assets only income there are some states florida is the only one i can think of that has odd tax treatment of intangible assets but i doubt that would apply in your case if this were a large enough amount usually over $ 10,000 it might trigger some reporting requirements possibly by your home country

i guess other than tradition and inflation probably because the merchants want them    in the us what currently costs $ 2.00 used to cost $ 0.10    so 75 years ago those individual cents made a pretty bid difference   inflation causes prices to go up but does n't get us to just change our currencies patterns in your example you are assuming that in an average day the rounding errors you are willing to accept happen a couple of times   2 or 3 cents here and there mean nothing to you   however to the merchant doing hundreds or thousands of transactions per day those few cents up and down mean quite a bit in terms of profit to an individual looking at a time frame more than a single day because who only participates in economies for a single day there are potentially millions of transactions in a lifetime mean potentially giving away millions of dollars because they did n't want to wait and as for the comment that people working each 3 cents every 10 seconds i would assume at least some of the time when they are waiting for rounding errors they are not at work getting paid   that concept is assuming that somebody is always willing to pay them for their time regardless of where that person is in the world i have no facts and wild assumptions but surely that ca n't be true for even a majority of workers finally you should be happy if you happy to have an income high enough that you do n't care about individual cents   but there are those business people who see opportunity in folks like you and profit greatly from it   i personally worry very much about who has my money gov't gets paid to the penny and i expect returns to the penny   a super polite service employee who a lot serving me a beer is getting all the rounding errors i have

you should check with your broker i asked my broker a similar question just 2 weeks ago with their market orders they will be filled within 3 points from the current market bid ask if there is any remaining it will be placed as a limit order at 3 points away from the bid ask price for example if the current ask is 100 $ 1.00 followed by 500 $ 1.01 300 $ 1.02 and 100 $ 1.03 if you were to place a buy market order for 1000 shares you would get 100 filled at $ 1.00 500 filled at $ 1.01 300 filled at $ 1.02 and 100 filled at $ 1.03   if on the other hand you were to place a buy market order for 2000 shares you would get 100 filled at $ 1.00 500 filled at $ 1.01 300 filled at $ 1.02 and 100 filled at $ 1.03 with the remaining 1000 of your order being placed as a limit order at $ 1.03 again check with your broker as they may be different in how they treat their market orders

i 'm not sure i understand your question but i 'll try to answer what i think you 're asking i think you 're asking this a us bank receives a wire transfer from a chinese bank how does the    us bank ensure there 's any money in fact arriving before crediting the    destination account well the way wire transfers work is that the us bank would debit the account with that us bank so the us bank in fact transfers the money between two internal accounts debit to the chinese bank 's account with that us bank and credit the destination customer account if the chinese bank does n't have an account with the destination us bank a third party intermediary is used that both banks have accounts with such third party will charge an additional fee hence sometimes the wire transfer fees are slightly higher than you initially know when sending the money the third party would debit from the transfer amount regular iban ach transfers work through regulatory channels that ensure integrity and essentially use a regulatory bank as that third party but because they 're done in batches and not on line they 're much cheaper and the accounting is for the whole batch and not each transfer separately but batch processing means it will take a day or two of processing while wire transfer takes hours at most

you will tend to find as options get closer to expiry within 2 months of expiry they tend to be traded more also the closer they are to being in the money they more they are traded so there tends to be more demand for these options than long dated ones that are far out of the money when there is this higher demand there is less need for a market maker to step in to assure liquidity thus there should be no effect on the underlying stock price due to the high demand for options i would say that market makers would mainly get involved in providing liquidity for options way out of the money and with long periods until expiry 6 + months where there is little demand to start with and open interest is usually quite low

a market crash wo n't affect your cash held with your broker however if the broker defaults goes bankrupt you may lose some or all of that cash if you read the customer agreement that you signed when opening the account it 's very likely that there 's a clause that stipulates that under certain circumstances the broker has the right to use your cash and/or your positions without notice if the broker default you may not be able to recover the assets they 've been using as an example look at clause 14 of the interactive brokers us customer agreement this is a fairly standard clause depending on your jurisdiction you may have a partial or full legal protection against such an event e.g. the sipc protection for us based brokers which would apply to you if your broker is ib llc even if you are not a us resident citizen

if you 're trying to hedge the ups and downs of your local residential real estate market a reit fund holding commercial properties across the country is not the ideal match here 's a comparison of an index tracking single family home prices in one region los angeles and vnq another popular reit fund   there 's some correlation but there 's clearly different magnitudes and sometimes different directions with a national home price index the correlation is only 68 and it would be lower for individual cities you could still use it for hedging but there 's significant tracker error risk to be considered unfortunately i 'm not familiar with any investment that would be a better match for individual residential markets so if you decide to use this i 'd also adjust the level of exposure to get a closer result e.g. using approx 50 vnq and 50 cash results in a closer result after 2 years compared to national single family home price changes than either 0 vnq and 100 cash or 100 vnq and 0 cash

in 2010 the restore online shoppers confidence act was passed which prohibited certain activities most of which had to do with online sites sharing your cc info with third parties   however the final part of the act deals with negative option marketing which is basically what you 're describing we will charge you unless you say no it requires three components to allow a negative option if you did not explicitly enroll in automatic payment and made the initial purchase online or made your most recent purchase online i suspect then it sounds like this was a violation of this act   on the other hand the act is n't terribly careful about defining terms and is really quite vague in a lot of places so it 's possible they would argue they are not using a negative option scheme but instead simply charging your bill similar to how your phone company might use autopay if it was not online then this probably does n't apply   instead the ftc 's rule on negative option with regard to sale of goods applies   title 16 part covers this this law is much less limiting as to what the marketer can do

i ca n't address the psychology of trust involved in your question but here are some common sense guidelines for dealing with your issue make sure you know who you are talking to   call the company you need to speak to via a publicly available phone number an email or something you got in a letter might be from a different source   if you use a website you should be sure you are on the correct website keep careful records   make good notes of each phone call and keep all emails and letters forever note the time name and/or id of the person you spoke to and numbers called in addition to keeping notes on what actions should be done   keep your transmission receipts and shipping tracking numbers too if you are nervous ask them why they want the info   the fraud department should be able to explain it to you   for example they probably want your social because that is how your credit report is identified   if they are going to fix a credit report they will need a social   it is doubtful they would have a good explanation why they need your mother 's name ask for secure transmission or confirm they have it   postal mail is n't so secure but i 'll go out on a limb and say most fax machines today are not really fax machines but software that deals in pdfs   at some point you will have to realize you will have to transmit something   no method is perfect but you can limit your exposure help them do their jobs   if you are understandably nervous consider their motivations corporate profit   but that could very well mean not running afoul of the law and with any luck treating customers the best way they know to earn business   if you the fraud department how can they help you if the id theft was serious enough document your issue for future law enforcement so you getting pulled over for speeding does n't result in you going to jail for whatever crime the other person did   perhaps the fraud department you are dealing with can assist there finally while you work with fraud departments to clear up your name and account work on the other end to limit future damage   freeze your credit   see if you bank or credit card have monitoring   use creditkarma.com or a similar if you can not find a free service   please do n't ever pay for credit monitoring

during the settlement period the buyer transfers payment to the seller and the seller transfers ownership to the buyer this is really a from the days when so much of stock trading was done by individual human traders and computers were still not a huge part of the operation   back then paper tickets for trades exchanged hands and the time period was actually 5 days so 3 days is an improvement    a settlement period was necessary for everyone to figure out their trades and do what was necessary to make the settlements happen so it was not always a quick process mainly because of smaller trading firms that did n't have technology to help them along nowadays technology makes settlements easy and they usually occur at the end of the trading day   the trading firms sum up their trades figure out who they owe and send lump sum settlements to the counterparties to their trades   if anything the period may just be used now to let parties verify trades before settling i hope this helps good luck

stock market indexes are generally based on market capitalization which is not the same as gdp   gdp includes the value of all goods and services produced in a country this includes a large amount of small scale production which may not be reflected in stock market   thus the ratio between countries may not be the same as the ratio of their total market capitalization   for instance us gdp is approximately 3.8 times as much as japan 's see here but us total market cap is about 5.5 as much as japan 's see here the discrepancy can be even more severe when comparing developed economies like the us to developing or less developed economies in which there is less participation in large scale financial systems like stock markets   for instance us gdp is roughly 10 times that of brazil but us total market cap is roughly 36 times that of brazil   switzerland has a total market cap nearly double that of brazil despite its total gdp being less than half of brazil 's   since the all world index includes all investable economies it will include many economies whose share of market cap is disproportionately lower than their share of gdp in addition according to the fact sheet you linked to that index tracks only and mid cap stocks   this will further skew the weighting to developed economies and to the us in particular since the us has a disproportionate share of the largest companies obviously one would need to take a more detailed look at all the weights to determine if these factors account precisely for the level of discrepancy you see in this particular index   but hopefully that explanation gives an idea of why the us might be weighted more heavily in a stock index than it is in raw gdp

note that to keep an investor from lowering their tax bill is not an explanation well yes it is in fact   it is the only explanation the rule plainly exists to prevent someone from realizing a loss when their economic situation remains unchanged before after a sale now you might say but i have suffered a loss even if it is unrealized but would you want to pay tax on unrealized gains the tax system still caters to reducing the tax impact of investments particularly capital investments part and parcel with the system of taxing gains only when realized is that you can recognize losses only when realized are there other ways to artificially reduce taxable income yes but the goal of a good tax system should be to reduce those opportunities whether you agree that it is fair for the government to prevent this tax saving opportunity when others exist is another question but that is why the rule exists

there are two in investing active management and passive management passive management is based on the idea you ca n't beat the market passive investors believe in the efficient markets hypothesis the market all information about an asset so price is equal to underlying value another idea in this field is that there 's a minimum risk associated with any given return you ca n't increase your expected return without assuming more risk to see it graphically    as expected return goes up so does risk if we stat with a portfolio of 100 bonds then remove 30 bonds and add 30 stocks we 'll have a portfolio that 's 70 stocks turns out that this makes expected return increase and lower risk because of diversification markowitz showed that you could reduce the overall portfolio risk by adding a riskier but uncorrelated asset basically if your entire portfolio is us stocks then you 'll lose money whenever us stocks fall but if you have half us stocks quarter us bonds and quarter european stocks then even if the us market tanks half your portfolio will be unaffected theoretically adding different types of uncorrelated assets can reduce risk and increase returns   let 's tie this all together we should get a variety of stocks to reduce our risk and we ca n't beat the market by security selection ideally we ought to buy nearly every stock in the market so that   so what 's our solution why the exchange traded fund etf of course an etf is basically a bunch of stocks that trade as a single ticker symbol for example consider the spdr s&p 500 spy you can purchase a unit of spy and it will move up down proportional to the s&p 500 this gives us diversification among stocks to prevent any significant downside while limiting our upside how do we diversify across asset classes luckily we can purchase etf 's for almost anything gold etf 's commodities us bond etf 's domestic bonds international stock etfs intl bonds etfs etc so we can buy etf 's to give us exposure to various asset classes thus diversifying among asset classes and within each asset class determining what of our portfolio to put in any given asset class is known as asset allocation and some people say up to 90 of portfolio returns can be determined by asset allocation   that pretty much sums up passive management the idea is to buy etfs across asset classes and just leave them you can readjust your portfolio holdings periodically but otherwise there is no rapid trading now the other umbrella is active management the idea is that you can generate superior returns by stock selection active investors reject the idea of efficient markets   a classic and time proven strategy is value investing after the collapse of bank stocks greatly fell but all the other stocks fell with them some stocks worth $ 100 were selling for $ 50 value investors quickly snapped up these stocks because they had a margin of safety even if the stock did n't go back to 100 it could go up to $ 80 or $ 90 eventually and investors profit the main ideas in value investing are have a big margin of safety look at a company 's fundamentals earnings book value etc and see if it promises adequate return coke has tremendous earnings and it 's a great company but it 's so large that you 're never going to make 20 profits on it annually because it just ca n't grow that fast another field of active investing is technical analysis as opposed to the fundamental analysis of value investing technical analysis involves looking at charts for patterns and looking at stock history to determine future paths things like resistance points and trend lines also play a role technical analysts believe that stocks are just ticker symbols and that you can use guidelines to predict where they 're headed   another type of active investing is day trading this basically involves buying and selling stocks every hour or every minute or just at a rapid pace day traders do n't hold onto investments for very long and are always trying to predict the market in the short term and take advantage of it many individual investors are also day traders   the other question is how do you choose a strategy the short answer is pick whatever works for you the long answer is day trading and technical analysis is a lot of luck if there are consistent systems for trading then people are keeping them secret because there is no book that you can read and become a consistent trader high frequency trading hft is an area where people basically mint money but it s more technology and less actual investing and would not be categorized as day trading   benjamin graham once said in the short run the market is a voting machine but in the long run it is a weighing machine value investing will work because there 's evidence for it throughout history but you need a certain temperament for it and most people do n't have that furthermore it takes a lot of time to adequately study stocks and people with day jobs ca n't devote that kind of time so there you have it this is my opinion and by no means definitive but i hope you have a starting point to continue your study i included the theory in the beginning because

they have forever to collect a balance from you   furthermore they can add whatever penalties and fees they wish to increase that balance   worst of all they do n't have to remind you or send you bills or any other notification   you owed it when you left the office   there very well could be local laws that require notifications but that is n't really the issue here that dentist has every right to deny you service until you settle the account   forever the statute of limitations on collecting that debt via court which covers the rules on how long they have to collect the debt   owing the money is one thing but the rules and tools that you creditor has to collect the debt are another   you are probably worried about them suing you but if you do n't pay the debt or settle in some way that dentist can refuse to provide services to you even if they write off the debt ways you can be punished by your dentist for not paying the bill are depending on your jurisdiction and/or type of debt they typically only report it on your credit if they are reporting at all for 7 years   even if you pay and settle the account it will still be reported on your credit report for 7 years   the difference is how it is reported   they can report that is a super reliable person who always pays debts on time   they can say is a who pays but takes a while to pay   or they can say is a bad person to provide services before collecting money because do n't pay bills other people considering lending you money are going to read these opinions and decide accordingly if they want to deal with you or not and they can say that for 7 years   the idea of credit reporting is that you settle up as soon as possible and get your credit report to reflect the truth one popular way to collect a debt to is to sue you for it   there each state has a different time period on how long a creditor has to sue you for a debt if you pay part of the debt that will often reset the clock on the statute of limitations so be sure any partial or negotiated settlements state very clearly in writing that payment is considered payment in full on the debt   then you keep that record forever there are other interesting points in the fair debt collection practices act   see debt collectors calling know your rights   they can only contact you in certain ways they must respond to you in certain ways and they have limits on what they can say who they can say it to and when they can say it   there are protections from mean or vicious bill collectors but that does n't sound like who you are dealing with   i do n't know that the fdcpa is a tool you need to use in this case you should negotiate your debt and try your best to settle up   from your post both parties dropped the ball and both parties should give a little   you should pay no or minor late fees and the doctor should report your credit positively when you do so   if you both made honest mistakes they both parties should acknowledge that and be fair and not defensive this is not legal advice   but you owe the debt so you should settle up   i do n't think it is fair for you to not pay because they did n't mail you a paper   however i also do not think it is fair for the doctor to run up fees and not remind you of the bill finally you did n't bring up insurance or many other details   those details can change the answer

excess cash = cash equivalents + long term investments current liabilities the problem this calculation of excess cash is that long term investments can be illiquid things like real estate another flaw is that it gives no credit for current assets like receivables which can be used to offset current liabilities the first thing i 'd do is net out current assets and current liabilities then add cash back in   excess cash = current assets current liabilities + cash equivalents it would be nice if gaap would require long term investments to be broken out as a liquid long term investments stocks bonds b illiquid long term investments real estate private equity etc

you do n't actually have to make four equal payments on us federal taxes you can pay different amounts each quarter   to avoid penalties you must have paid enough at the end of each quarter   if you pay too much in an early quarter the surplus counts towards the amount due in later quarters   if you have paid too little as of the end of a quarter that deficit counts against you for interest and penalties until it is made up in later quarters or at year end settlement how much is enough   there are a number of ways of figuring it   you can see the list of exceptions to the penalty in the irs documentation   using unequal payments may require more complicated calculation methods to avoid or reduce penalties at year end   if you have the stomach for it you may want to study the annualized income installment method to see how uneven income might affect the penalty

from a federal tax point of view withdrawals from 529 plans are treated as taxable unless they are used on qualified expenses the part of a distribution representing the amount paid or contributed    to a qtp does not have to be included in income this is a return of    the investment in the plan the designated beneficiary generally does not have to include in    income any earnings distributed from a qtp if the total distribution    is less than or equal to adjusted qualified education expenses    defined under figuring the taxable portion of a distribution    later to determine if total distributions for the year are more or less than    the amount of qualified education expenses you must compare the total    of all qtp distributions for the tax year to the adjusted qualified    education expenses you 'll have to include them in your income and pay normal income tax on them and also in most cases pay an extra 10 penalty generally if you receive a taxable distribution you also must pay a    10 additional tax on the amount included in income you 'd have to check on the situation from a state perspective but i 'd imagine it 's quite similar the basic point is that non qualified distributions are treated as earnings

no there 's no personal responsibility per se if you set up a corporation but if you do n't have a track record a creditor will likely insist that you personally guarantee the debts of the corporation beyond that personal responsibility would be the result of a piercing of the corporate veil which is something the courts are unlikely to do unless there is of fraud or the like there are also some statutory provisions that can lead to personal liability of a corporation 's directors e.g. unpaid wages but i do n't think that 's really what this thread is getting at

the balance sheet for a bank is the list of assets and liabilities that the bank directly is responsible for   this would be things like loans the bank issues and accounts with the bank banks can make both balance sheet loans meaning a loan that says on the balance sheet one the bank gains the profits from but holds the risks for also   they can also make off balance sheet loans meaning they securitize the loan sell it off such as the mortgage backed securities most major banks i.e. chase citibank etc could be called balance sheet banks because at least some portion of their lending comes from their balance sheet   not 100 by any means they participate in the security swaps extensively just like everyone does but they do at least some normal boring lending just as you would explain a bank to a five year old   bank takes in deposits from account holders loans that money out to people who want to buy homes or start businesses however some particularly smaller firms do n't work this way they do n't take responsibility for the money or the loans   they instead manage assets or some similar term i think of it like the difference between wal mart and a consignment store   wal mart buys things from its distributors and sells them taking the risk of the item not selling and the reward of the profit from selling to itself   on the other hand a consignment store takes on neither it takes a flat fee to host your items in its store but takes no risk you own the items nor the majority of the profit in this case financial group is not a bank per se they do n't have accounts they manage funds instead   note the following statement on their services page for example financial group holds no risk positions and no unwanted inventory of securities which preserves the integrity of our capital and assures our clients that we will be able to obtain bids and offers for them regardless of adverse market conditions they 're not taking your money and then making their own investments they 're advising you how to invest your money or they 're helping do it for you but it 's your money going out and your risk and reward

you are right that even if you do not receive a 1099-misc you still need to report all income to the irs   report the $ 40 on schedule c or schedule c ez   since your net profit was less than $ 400 you do not need to file schedule se   from the irs web site self employment income it is a common misconception that if a taxpayer does not receive a form 1099-misc or if the income is under $ 600 per payer the income is not taxable there is no minimum amount that a taxpayer may exclude from gross income all income earned through the taxpayer ’s business as an independent contractor or from informal side jobs is self employment income which is fully taxable and must be reported on form 1040 use form 1040 schedule c profit or loss from business or form 1040 schedule c ez net profit from business sole proprietorship to report income and expenses taxpayers will also need to prepare form 1040 schedule se for self employment taxes if the net profit exceeds $ 400 for a year do not report this income on form 1040 line 21 as other income independent contractors must report all income as taxable even if it is less than $ 600 even if the client does not issue a form 1099-misc the income whatever the amount is still reportable by the taxpayer

of course which is why you need to have a scoring function utility function for the filters i.e. are you going to value it by rate of accuracy by a metric where wins = + 2 losses = -1 such that it uses a criteria like that to decide whether or not a filter adds value some even use a compound effect i.e. wins = where w is the consecutive wins   a metric like the above would capture the trade off between predictive power and profit also some traders watch their max dd very carefully so they may be very risk averse

your question is listed as how to invest 100k not how would i find someone without a hidden agenda so i 'll answer that it depends i believe the best choices available are essentially as follows if you are looking to pay for your childrens college it might be nice just to put the money in a roth ira and have that done right off the bat if you disciplined enough to keep the money invested in some type of stock indexed fund that might be good the stock market has often outperformed almost every other form of investment over the very long haul but if you could see yourself tapping it for things then you might not want this another option is to put the money against your house if that does n't pay it off refinance the remaining portion into a lower rate for less years obviously this knocks down a huge portion of the interest duh and gives you a nice cash flow you can use for investing also the money you 've put into a primary residence is pretty safe i believe in some cases safe even from bankruptcy but as you 've noted being underwater on the home you are essentially throwing that money away in some way or fashion and really all in all houses are terrible investments you never really get your money out of your primary home unless you downsize the money is essentially saved without an equity line this is a good choice if you 're not disciplined your choice depends on of course you can do any combination of these things and as dave ramsey is apt to remind his and you ought to have your emergency fund set before you do any of these things

ignoring any ethical considerations of defaulting on a mortgage obligation if your credit score fell future costs of borrowing would be greater if you could borrow money at all the true financial cost of these penalties would depend on your own intentions and circumstances the value of a credit score can not be quantified in any absolute sense because of these circumstances which will vary from person to person suppose a decision would result in your score falling from 700 to 600 as a result a future car loan would cost something like 2 more in interest per year let 's also suppose you would not be able to find a bank to give you money to buy a new home   the difficulties caused by this situation would depend on the person some people have no intention of taking out another mortgage or buying another car and to them a lowered credit score might make no difference to others it would be desirable to avoid these penalties the value of credit score would be equal to how much you would be willing to pay in the present to avoid these future penalties   if you intend to borrow money in the near future and somehow know how much more interest you will pay as a result of your lower score then you could approximate the value of the credit drop by summing all of the additional interest costs discounted into the present something a little like this year 's additional cost in interest 1 + your personal opportunity cost of funds ^ years in the future this extra interest will be paid   see time value of money explanation can you explain time value of money and compound interest and provide examples of each it could also be the case that you miss out on valuable financial opportunities as a result which could be added to the present value of the credit score drop   for example if the drop made you totally unable to purchase an investment property that would net you $ 10,000 in cash flows which would yield cash flows immediately the value of that investment would have been $ 10,000 1 + your personal opportunity cost of funds since you would not be able to make that investment in this example as a result of the decreased score the present value of the investment would be an opportunity cost of the lower score there are other hard to quantify costs of low credit to consider as well ranging from housing to employment to bragging rights   hopefully this has helped

i do n't recommend roth for those in the 25 bracket if you are in the 25 bracket now i 'd suggest you go pretax and as you are planning to be in a lower bracket in a few years use that bracket to convert depositing today at 25 to convert at 15 in a few years puts you that much ahead   i understand the allure of a roth heavy strategy and the fuzzy crystal ball for what the tax code will look like does n't help that said a retiree today who is a few years too young for social security will see an exemption + std deduction of $ 10,000 and a 15 bracket ending at $ so $ total with a total tax bill of $ a retiree should target $ k pretax to stay flexible and not miss these low brackets in the future

when you say that the problem is high supply but no demand you are actually correct here 's why   the phrase borrow spend less save more is n't an absolute law it 's more of a cautionary tale obviously spending is an integral part of an economy it accounts for at least 50 of every transaction but the is getting at something other than people to not spend the point of the saying is that interest rates should reflect savings rates    what it comes down to is the how the law of supply and demand applies to the relationship between savings and interest rates consider this thought experiment in a world where everybody saves 50 of their income what would happen to interest rates banks would have a glut of savings relative to the population assuming demand remains constant interest rates would go down the price of borrowing goes down as the supply of money to be borrowed increases thus a corollary of the law of supply and demand is that as savings increase interest rates tend to go down    so as savings increase the economic environment encourages capital improvements businesses can borrow at lower rates and increase long term productive capacity this is what the federal reserve has attempted to do by lowering the fed funds rate to near zero and by operation twist increase economic activity through low borrowing costs    so what 's the problem when interest rates are artificially low there are no savings to support the production later in time a company that borrows at a 1 rate created by the feds can build a factory to make widgets but it will have a hard time selling that widget to a population with a negative net worth however if the 1 rate is natural then the company should be fine the savings of the population should support the production from his widget factory    for about 30 years we have experienced a credit boom in this country that was not created by excess savings this trend could n't continue forever look around you at the end of the day an economy is simply a group of people getting together to buy and sell stuff and services right now there is a lot of debt and little cash who will be doing the buying

do not give them any money until you have a signed contract that releases your liability completely it 's imperative that this contract be drafted correctly the contract needs proper consideration money in exchange for release of liability among other things in other words talk to a lawyer if you want to go this route if you just cut them a check there 's nothing stopping them from taking your money and making an insurance claim anyway or taking your money and then suing for or some other fake injury   the best way is just to go through insurance it might cost a bit more but you 're covered in case they sue

and to answer your other questions about fees there are a number of sites that compare brokers fees google broker fee comparison i like the motley fool although there are a lot of others however do n't go just by the comparison sites because they can be out of date and usually just have the basic fees once you find a broker that you like go to that broker 's site and get all the fees as of now you ca n't sell the shares that are in your charles schwab account using some other broker however you can possibly now definitely eventually see below transfer the shares to another broker and then sell them there but be aware that charles schwab might charge you a fee to transfer the shares out which will probably be larger than the fee they 'll charge you to sell the shares unless you 're selling them a few at a time for example i have a charles schwab account through my previous employer and it 's $ 9.99 commission to sell shares but $ 50 to transfer them out note that your fees might be different even though we 're both at charles schwab because employers can negotiate individual deals there should be somewhere on the site that has a fee schedule but if you ca n't find it send them a message or call them one final thing to be aware of shares you get from an employer often have restrictions on sale or transfer or negative tax consequences on sale or transfer that shares just bought on the open market would n't so make sure you investigate that before doing anything with the shares

the catch is that you 're doing a form of leveraged investing in other words you 're gambling on the stock market using money that you 've borrowed while it 's not as dangerous as say getting money from a loan shark to play blackjack in vegas there is always the chance that markets can collapse and your investment 's value will drop rapidly the amount of risk really depends on what specific investments you choose and how diversified they are if you buy only canadian stocks then you 're at risk of losing a lot if something happened to our economy but if your canadian equities only amount to 3.6 of your total which is canada 's share of the world market and you 're holding stocks in many different countries then the diversification will reduce your overall risk   the reason i mention that is because many people using the smith maneuver are only buying canadian high yield dividend stocks so that they can use the dividends to accelerate the smith maneuver process use the dividends to pay down the mortgage then borrow more and invest it they prefer canadian equities because of preferential tax treatment of the dividend income in non registered accounts but if something happened to those canadian companies they stand to lose much of the investment value and suddenly they have the extra debt the amount borrowed from a heloc or from a re mortgage without enough value in the investments to offset it this could mean that they will not be able to pay off the mortgage by the time they retire

when using the stochastic indicator your basic aim is to buy go long when the stochastic becomes oversold goes below 20 and then the k line crosses above the d line at a market low and to sell go short when the stochastic becomes overbought goes above 80 and then the k line crosses below the d line at a market high other indicators or candlestick can also be used to further confirm the trade below is a chart of a trade i recently took on using the slow stochastic in combination with support and resistance levels as well as a candlestick pattern   when i conducted my stock search on the evening of 28th july 2015 was one of the results from the search that i particularly liked the slow stochastic had just made a crossover in the oversold area just as the price was bouncing off its recent lows at the support line but what i really like about this opportunity was that there was also a bullish reversal candle a hammer at this short term market bottom the high for the day was $ so i placed a stop buy order to buy the stock tomorrow if the price opened or moved above this high of today so i would only buy if the stock hit or moved above $ during the next days trading so if the stock opened and stayed below the previous day 's high i would not buy the stock and my order would be canceled at the end of the day this is very important because it stops you from getting into trades that do n't go in the direction you want if this happens then you could check the chart again after market close to see if it is still worthwhile to place a new order for the next day on the 29th july 2015 the stock did open higher at $ which is where my order got executed and closed at $ so i ended up buying slightly above my target price but it did move higher on the day so a successful entry overall i had placed my initial stop loss at $ just below the low of the previous day of $ if the trade had gone against me in the following days the most i would have lost was 1 of my total account capital my target for this trade was $ just below the resistance line near $ 10 which would represent a 5 gain against my total account capital or approx gain on the trade so my win to loss ratio was as you can see from the chart the next day gapped up at the open and prices continued moving up strongly during the day the next day was a slightly negative day and then a few days later on the 5th august 2015 my target price of $ was reached with a high of $ for that day so my order was closed for a total profit of on the face value of the trade however as i bought on margin using cfds my actual profit on the initial margin i had invested was my total time in the trade was 7 days and i spent about an hour in the evening doing my searches and placing my orders then less than 10 minutes managing the trade each evening after market close the stock did go up a bit further after my profit target was reached but the day after that the price started to fall as the price hit the resistance line and the slow stochastic did a crossover in the overbought area overall this was a very ideal trade and i was very happy with it not all my trades reach my profit targets and i may get stopped out at a smaller profit or i might make a small loss as i move my stops up as the price moves up the key to successful trading over the long term is to keep you losses small and let your profits run with my longer term trend trading i do n't have profit targets and let my profits run until i get stopped out but with my shorter term trading i do use a profit target usually 5 or 6 times the size of my initial stop if you have an average win to average loss ratio of or higher and have a success rate of 50 winners you will make money over the long term

america 's economy is a war based economy you need to understand that and chew on it and admit it to yourself we are not some happy happy charlie and the chocolate fucking factory economy we profit from war human misery and of course really really bad banking practices and exporting inflation as the retarded indians are going to find out soon not the red ones we gave amp small to the ones that think they are our friends and we are going to build f-16s in their land of open and cow piss consumption   now everything was really great and we were about to get our hands on some really cheap iraqi oil but the fucking taliban we trained and armed to fight the russians decided they wanted to fight us when we attacked them   problem was we did n't need m1 and f-35s and nuclear subs to fight them   and then the bloody would n't quit and it turned out we did n't need and f-35s and nuclear subs to fight them   in fact we did n't have anything that made it cost effective to fight a guy with a rocket and a pick up truck and our economy started to fail and we landed up in a depression which we called a recession but it was a depression and that s why our central bank is still trying to get rid of that shit they sold to raise us $ 2.4 trillion dollars for the iraq war really bad investment that   well a russia was like a god send we could restart the cold war and start making and f-35s and subs again and have a worthy we would have to scare the shit out of the american people to divert the money to the military but that would get factories cracking again and corporate lending going again and nato would just have to buy our shit up   turns out it was n't a god send the were busy the boys and the 's selling palestinian spare parts and the rest of the lot getting confused about the gender and the russians were actually dead serious scared the shit out of ukraine and annex crimea .and we could n't do shit    north korea .the fuckers got nuclear missiles and a freaking hydrogen bomb i mean shit .we were just play acting to get the economy booming again and this guy had to start blowing shit up   and iran they are sure to go next and then the whole middle east   we gave the israelis f-35s even though they can barely fly .that junk has just taken so long to develop they ai n't never going to figure the code out and make it work   the god damned missile shield is only good enough for fire and   these guys are icbms and now everybody knows our missile shield is really good to look at but does n't do much did you see the japanese for cover    and the chinese damn you just ca n't guess what is happening behind those eyes .they can crash our economy like a fly yet the sit there and we talk shit day after day after day and the just smile and say some diplomatic shit they are playing the long game for sure and we have no clue what the fuck it is   i guess we are going to have to pick a fight with canada soon everybody else is so edgy and starts wanting to shoot back at us how the fuck is one supposed to run an economy when the keep threatening to bomb us   at least there is a wall between the chinese and us sure who built it have been the mexicans get the bill definitely not paying for it

i was thinking more of a limit on the total of patents something fairly small like maybe 10,000 total patents are allowed to be valid at any given moment in time so that patent applications from multiple sources have to be somehow compared with each other to decide which would provide more societal benefit by being allowed patent status   if you want to take the government mostly out of the picture then maybe use an auction format when a valid patent slot becomes available due to a previously granted patent expiring or being invalidated due to court challenge then anyone who wants their idea to get patent rights submits their application to an auction for that slot   then the people who want to own the patent rights to any of those submitted ideas will bid for them whoever pays the top bid will get the patent rights for the concepts in the specific application they were targeting   this will force the people who are doing the bidding to basically do the due diligence on each patent application instead of depending on the patent since they will not want to pay a lot of money to get the patent rights for an idea only to have that patent 's value be destroyed by being declared invalid in court   if you want to encourage small inventors to throw their hat into the ring then set things up so that the money from the winning bid goes to the inventor who submitted the original application this way you get the best of both worlds the inventor gets compensated handsomely in most cases for their good idea and the idea being patented gets into the hands of someone with enough resources to exploit the idea in a broad scale

recycled toner cartridges spill excess toner all over the of printers causing higher maintenance costs and shorter life spans for other consumable components such as the the reason this occurs is that the drum assembly has a conductive coating on it that wears out after the cartridge 's service life once that coating is weakened or removed it can no longer keep excess toner from spilling out i 'd say a good 95 of recycled are just drill and fill so the old drum remains unchanged   even changing the drum does n't work all the time hp uses a special coating on their drums which is n't replicated when an aftermarket drum is used

what would be the consequences if they do realize their error some day    in the far future you 've informed them of the error and they 've informed you that nevertheless the points are yours and you should use them so you have a couple of issues have you made what your jurisdiction considers a reasonable effort to correct the mistake and did the customer service rep actually have the authority to make such a large goodwill gesture as letting you keep all the points the first is your legal responsibility otherwise you 're stealing and you need to know specifically for your jurisdiction whether a phone call is sufficient i ca n't tell you that maybe you should send them a letter maybe you should wait until you 've had written confirmation from them maybe you 're ok as you are you might be able to get free advice from some body that helps with consumer issues here in the uk you could ask citizen 's advice the second is beyond your ability to know for sure but it 's not dishonest to work on the basis that what the company 's proper representative tells you is true with the usual caveats that i 'm not qualified to give legal advice once told you 've been clearly told that it 's an intentional gift i do n't see any way you could be held to have done anything fraudulent if you then go about enjoying it the worst case far future problem i would expect is that someone decides the gift was never legitimately made in the first place in other words the company made two separate errors first crediting the card and then telling you the erroneous points stand in that case you might have to pay them back whatever you 've spent on the card beyond the points you 're entitled to to avoid this you 'd need to establish what constitutes a binding gift in your jurisdiction so that you can say no the point balance was not erroneous and here 's the legal reason why and pay them nothing you might also need to consider any tax implications in receiving such a large gift and of course before paying tax on it if that 's necessary you 'd probably want to bug them for confirmation in writing that it really is yours if that written confirmation is n't forthcoming then so be it they 've the gift and i doubt you 're inclined to take them to court demanding that they stand by the words of their rep use them and play stupid it 's not my duty to check their math right   that 's potentially fraud or theft if you lie you did notice and even worse they have proof you noticed since you made the call so never say you did n't notice if you had n't called them yet then you 've been given something in error and your jurisdiction will have an opinion on what your responsibilities are so if you had n't already called them i would strongly suggest that you should call them or write to them about it to give them the opportunity to correct the error or at least seek assurance that in your jurisdiction all errors in the customer 's favour are final otherwise you 're in the position of them accidentally handing you their wallet without realising and you deciding to keep it without telling them my guess is that 's unlikely to be a legally binding gift and might legally be theft or fraud on your part

choosing between an emergency fund and investing aside there is no reason to use a systematic investment plan when you have a lump sum ready to invest here are the three possible futures and the effects on each strategy obviously if you are investing in the market you expect it to go up over time so using an sip will work against you in that case   if the market does go down you 'd be better off but historically the market has gone up more than it 's gone down so there 's no practical reason to keep money in your pockets   you can always rebalance change investments do whatever after you 've invested so at worst you may have some transaction fees but that should n't be a huge issue

when your dream car is not just 200 times your disposable income but in fact 200 times your whole monthly salary then there is no way for you to afford it right now any attempt to finance through a loan would put you into a debt trap you wo n't ever dig yourself out   and if there are any car dealerships in your country which claim otherwise run away fast jon oliver from last week tonight made a video about business practices of car dealerships in the united states which sell cars on loans to people who ca n't afford them a while ago as usual when a deal seems too good to be true it generally is n't true at all after a few months the victims customers usually end up with no car but lots of outstanding debt they pay off for years so how do you tell if you can afford a car or not a new car usually lives for about 10 20 years so when you want to calculate the monthly cost of owning a new car divide the price by 120 but that 's just the price for buying the vehicle not for actually driving it cars cost additional money each month for gas repairs insurance taxes etc these costs depend a lot on your usage pattern and location so i can not provide you with any numbers for that if you have less disposable income per month as in money you currently have left at the end of each month than monthly cost of purchase plus expected monthly running costs you can not afford the car possible alternatives

i have a different perspective i believe the move to roth may be beneficial to a select few but not most people i coined the phrase as i believe that 's what 's happening a relatively uninformed move based on fear and not enough analysis   let 's look at a retiree today a couple has a $ standard deduction and 2 exemptions worth $ each this is $ they can withdraw tax free it would take pretax savings of $ k to support this withdrawal at   the 10 bracket is the next $ of taxable income or another $ k in assets to produce this annual withdrawal last for today the 15 bracket is the next $ which would require $ m to produce   the punchline today 's retiree couple can have over $ 2.1 m in pretax money this includes pension value if any of course and still be in the 15 bracket   if you ca n't deposit to a roth you are in the 28 bracket now or higher are you on track to have over $ 2 m in today 's dollars at retirement   one point that few mention is there are not just the two today 's tax rate vs retirement tax rate every year offers a situation where your income may drop a job loss a spouse staying home with a new child a disability a year back at school   these are the years that you might convert to roth just enough to fill your bracket back to your average prior rate e.g. convert to a taxable income of exactly $ and pay a marginal rate of 25   i 'll be the first to congratulate those who tell me they have a defined benefit pension that will replace their income to such a level that with their investments they are retiring at a higher income level than while working roth is the answer for them   roth is great for the 80 yr old woman i help 10 years ago i observed her marginal rate to be 15 and we convert just enough to put her at the top of that bracket this year $ 34,000 in taxable income this helps slow down the effect of her rmds required minimum distributions continuing to rise and potentially put her in the 25 bracket   so to be clear i 'm not anti roth i 'm just in favor of a thorough analysis and avoiding the roth for everyone mentality   edit i was asked by a financial writer kay bell to write on this very topic and appear on her site in a guest post roth iras and your retirement income it goes into greater detail than i could offer here tell kay joe sent you

how long you need to keep tax records will depend on jurisdiction in general if you discard records in a period of time less than your tax authority recommends it may create audit problems down the road ie if you make a deduction supported by business expense receipts and you discard those receipts next year then you wo n't be able to defend the deduction if your tax authority audits you in 3 years generally how long you keep records would depend on a how much time your tax authority has to audit you and b how long after you file your return you are allowed to make your own amendments in your case us based the irs has straight forward documentation about how long it expects you to keep records period of limitations that apply to income tax returns keep records for 3 years if situations 4 5 and 6 below do not apply to you keep records for 3 years from the date you filed your original return or 2 years from the date you paid the tax whichever is later if you file a claim for credit or refund after you file your return keep records for 7 years if you file a claim for a loss from worthless securities or bad debt deduction keep records for 6 years if you do not report income that you should report and it is more than 25 of the gross income shown on your return keep records indefinitely if you do not file a return keep records indefinitely if you file a fraudulent return keep employment tax records for at least 4 years after the date that the tax becomes due or is paid whichever is later note that the above are the minimum periods to keep records for your own purposes you may want to keep them for longer periods than that for example you may be in a position to discover that you would like to a prior tax return because you forgot to claim a tax credit that was available to you if you would have been eligible to in that period but no longer have documentation you are out of luck

it 's just possible that if you have your home appraised probable cost a few hundred $ and the value is sufficiently higher than what the mortgage company is owed that they will let this slide since they are covered many banks at least allow secured lines of credit against the equity in your home and allow the amount of the loan to increase if as the value of the property goes up and your equity increases however i 'd run this by the mortgage company before investing in the appraisal since they may not be as flexible this way as the banks i 've dealt with and in any case it 's a gamble unless you are certain of the value of your property

yes your business needs to be in the business of making money in order for you to deduct the expenses associated with it i suppose in theory this could mean that if you take in $ 10,000 and spend $ 30,000 every year you not only do n't get a net deduction of $ 20,000 your loss but you have to pay tax on $ 10,000 your revenue however this is super just only deduct $ of your expenses small profit for all the gory details including how they consider whether you have an expectation of profits see this expectation of profit rule appears to apply to things like i sell home items or home decorating advice and therefore need to take several multi week trips to exotic vacation destinations every year and deduct them as business expenses if you 're doing or in your home and selling on etsy you do n't particularly have any expenses it 's hard to imagine a scenario where you consistently sell for less than the cost of materials and then end up dinged on paying tax on revenue

if you are considering this to be an entry for your business this is how you would handle it you said you were making a balance sheet for monthly expenses so on the balance sheet you would be debiting cash for the income statement side you would be crediting owner 's equity to balance the equation assets = liabilities + owner 's equity so if you deposited $ 100 to your account the equation would be affected thus $ 100 in assets debit to cash account = 0 liabilities $ 100 credit to owner 's equity it is correctly stated above from the bank 's perspective that they would be crediting you account with $ 100 and any outflow from the bank account would be debiting your account

gt and moreover there is no way that sculley would have known about sony 's patent application until after it was issued which i believe was in circa 1970 by which time sculley would have been 30 + years old   why would he have had to have known about sony 's patent application he explicitly stated he did n't know about it until after it was awarded   gt and if you go with the other version of this story that it was n't a trinitron but rather the original color tv idea well then it becomes even less plausible   huh it was neither it was a color crt design that bore a striking to what became the trinitron display and certainly could have been considered prior art for some of the relevant patents   gt pretty much like the rest of sculley 's claims regarding his technology ideas and inventions it 's all bullshit that was come up with during after his time at apple in order to make him look sound like someone other than a colored sugar water marketing guy   the point is n't that sculley was some genius inventor he was n't some master visionary who could predict the future he sure was n't going to build an apple ii in his garage he clearly was n't any of those things then again neither was steve jobs what sculley did have though a talent and an interest in technology and certainly understood it far more thoroughly than some caramel colored sugar water marketing guy let 's assume for a moment his tv design was complete crap and unoriginal how many kids his age do you think were even coming up with crappy unoriginal tv designs and how many of those went on to become marketing guys   he could reason and understand about technology its potential and its impact in a way that a lot of ceo 's at the time could n't that ability to hear all the technical ideas and i 'd really love to see the part where he claimed credit for these inventions because i sure have n't noticed that from any of apple 's ceo 's before even jobs in development by a multitude of others and a realistic model of how the market would all come together with enough certainty to act on it is exactly what most ceo 's suck at   if you want to talk about bs let 's talk about the notion that the only ceo apple had that understood technology was steve jobs

the only way for a mutual fund to default is if it inflated the nav i.e. it reports that its investments worth more than they really are then in case of a run on the fund it may end up defaulting since it wo n't have the money to redeem shares at the nav it published when does it happen when the fund is mismanaged or is a scam this happened for example to the fund madoff was managing this is generally a sign of a ponzi scheme or embezzlement how can you ensure the funds you invest in are not affected by this you 'll have to read the fund reports check the independent auditors reports and check for clues generally this is the job of the sec that 's what they do as regulators but for smaller funds and private i.e. not public investment companies sec may not be posing too much regulations

the two biggest issues that impact your question i would say are diversification and fees if you have $ 10,000 to invest and only invest it in two securities then a 20 drop in one security can have you lose 10 of your initial investment which i would consider a very high risk scenario if you have $ 10,000 to invest and invest it in 20 securities then a 20 drop in one security would only cause you to lose 1 of your initial investment so far this is looking better from a diversification point of view but then the issue of fees comes in if you paid $ 10 per trade to buy those 20 securities you already spent 2 of your initial investment in fees not to mention you will pay at least another $ 200 to get out of all those positions no right answer but those are the two factors i always try to balance

you are not missing something basic   putting money in the bank will cost you in terms of purchasing power   the same thing has been true in the us and other places for a long time now   the real interest rate is negative there is too much aggregate wealth being saved compared to the number of profitable lending opportunities   that means any truly risk free investment will not make as much money as you will lose to inflation    if the real interest rate appears to be positive in your home country it means one of the following is happening capital controls or other barriers are preventing foreigners from investing in your home country keeping the interest rate there artificially high expected inflation is not being measured very accurately in your home country inflation is variable and unpredictable in your home country so investors are demanding high interest rates to compensate for inflation risk   in other words bank accounts are not risk free in your home country if you find any securities that are beating inflation you can bet they are taking on risk   investing in risky securities is fine but just understand that it 's not a substitute for a risk free bank account   part of every interest rate is compensation for the time value of money and the rest is compensation for risk   at present the global time value of money is negative

payment such as square do not normally withhold tax it is up to you to pay the appropriate tax at tax time that having been said square does report your payments to the irs on a form 1099-k if your payments are large enough according to square you 'll get a 1099-k from them if your total payments for the year add up to $ 20,000 and more than 200 transactions   whether or not they report on a 1099-k you are required to pay the appropriate taxes on your income   so now the question becomes do i have to pay income tax on the proceeds from my garage sale and the answer to that question is usually not when you sell something that you previously purchased if you sell it for more than you paid for it you have a capital gain and need to pay tax on that however generally you sell things in a garage sale at a loss meaning that there is no tax due   if you make more than $ 20,000 at your garage sale and the irs gets a 1099-k the irs might be curious as to how you did that with no capital gain so if you sell any big ticket items a for example you should keep a record of what you paid for it so you can show the loss to the irs in the event of an audit

paying off your mortgage early being good is a myth   it is great for the chronic to have their mortgage paid off so when they rack up credit card bills and get behind well they still a place to stay but for those who are more logical with their money paying off your mortgage early in current conditions makes no sense   you can get a 30 year loan well below 4   discounting taxes for your average family you would have a rate floating below 3    so reasons that paying off your mortgage should be almost last given current low long term interest rates the first thing you should do is take care of any high interest debt   i would say that anything more than 7 8 including all credit card debt should be focus 1 putting money into your retirement savings is 1   you will earn way more than 3 over the long run   you can earn a higher return in the market   even with a very conservative portfolio you can clear 5 6 which will still clear more than 3 after taxes for those who say you ca n't be sure about the market well if the market did bad for 30 years in a row no one will have money and the house will also be worthless if a disaster happens to your house and you own it your money is gone   in many cases you would be able to declare bankruptcy and let the bank take the property as is    there are just too many examples but if you are paying off your house early you lose the flexible liquid money that you now have tied up in the house now the reasons for paying down your mortgage are really easy too you do n't trust your spending habits you want to move up in houses and you want to make sure that you have at least 20 down on future house to skip pmi

running for profit business does n't pressure those involved to make the best product it pressures them to make the best profit   making the best profit pressures those involved to produce the cheapest product that the market wo n't reject marked at the highest price the market wo n't reject   private companies have the freedom to avoid or limit the effect of that pressure if they choose and sacrifice some profit for quality and improved customer satisfaction though many still choose profit   public companies who are eventually to shareholders who sole goal is profitability are much less likely to avoid the pressures to increase profits at all costs   particularly in the age of day traders and ceo merry go round long term planning is very difficult when short term profitability is on the line   a company that made one widget a year for $ 1 and sold that widget for $ 10 billion would be a very successful company from the profit standpoint and would likely have an excellent share price if the business model looked secure for the next year or two   competition helps alleviate this and pushes for better products and lower prices by upping the bar of what the market will reject over time increase the available alternatives and the features quality price scale shifts   the importance of having a level playing field anti monopoly laws and ensure that new players can come onto the scene is fundamental to capitalism working otherwise those who hold monopoly positions will prevent competition from emerging and charge as much as is possible for the cheapest product people will still buy   this is of particular issue when not buying the product is a threat to one 's life or safety medical care emergency services food etc

almost any kind of tax will cause market distortions if market distortions discourage activities which would have produced wealth society will lose out not only on the money which was taken by the tax but also on the wealth which could have been but was n't produced if those setting tax policy seek to maximize the amount of revenue that is made available for each dollar that the tax costs society taxing money which is being used to produce more wealth will go against that goal   further most of the things that companies do with their money to produce wealth end up generating taxable income for someone   if a company deducts from its taxes the money it pays to an employee who then has to pay taxes on that money the government ends up collecting about the same taxes as it would collect if the company did n't hire the employee and thus did n't take the deduction the effects of taxes on markets should be one of the most important factors considered when setting tax policy if one tax would cost society $ 1.05 for every dollar raised and another would cost society $ 5.00 for every dollar raised a wise policy would favor the first over the second   unfortunately politics often dominates over economic rationality

ror for options you bought is fairly easy current value initial cost gives you the actual return if you want the rate of return you need to annualize that number you divide the return you got above by the number of days the investment was in place and then multiply that number by the number of days in a year 365 if you 're using calendar days about 255 if you 're using trading days ror for options you sold is much more complex the problem is that ror is basically calculating the size of your return relative to the capital it tied up to earn it    that 's simple when you bought something the capital tied up is the money you put up    it 's more complex on a position like a short option where the specific transaction in question generates cash when it 's put on     the correct way to deal with this is to a bundle your strategy options stock and collateral into one ror where appropriate and b include any needed collateral to support the short option in the calculation so if you sell a cash secured put where you have to post the money that you 'd need to take delivery of the shares if they were put to you the initial cost is the total amount you 'd need to put the trade on    in this case it 's the cash amount less the premium you collected for selling the put   that 's just one example     but the approach holds more broadly   if you 're using covered calls your original cost is the cost of the stock less the premium generated by the sale of the call

you have not specified what country you are in that radically changes everything in case you are in canada there 's a great blog that covers bankruptcy and student loans at loan fundamentally in order to discharge government backed student loans you must have ceased to be a student for at least seven years prior to filing even then though the government can object in which case you will still have to repay some or all of the loan more generally given that the collection agency appears to be operating in bad faith you 'll want to ensure that they send you written documentation of any offer they are extending you if they refuse to do this you should assume that they are n't actually offering you anything at all and you will have to pay back the full amount plus interest and penalties note that in many countries if you settle the debt that is pay anything less than the full amount plus interest and penalties this will be a black mark on your credit report in this case if you repaid the full $ 16,000 and they the extra $ 4,000 they would most likely still add a note to your credit report indicating that you did not pay the full amount that you owed and this will negatively impact your credit rating even beyond your late payments

simply you should put your money into whatever has the higher interest rate savings or repayment of debt let 's say at the beginning of month a you put $ 1000 into each account in the case of the savings at the end of month a you will have $ $ 1000 + 1000 x 2 annual interest 12 in the case of a loan at the end of month a you will have $ $ plus 6.8 interest for one month is on $ the new value is   the difference between these is $ 5.7 1.6 = therefore using your money to repay your loan nets you a return about 3.5 times greater

it is my opinion that part of having a successful long term relationship is being committed to the other person 's success and well being this commitment is a form of investment in and of itself the returns are typically non monetary so it 's important to understand what money actually is money is a token people exchange for favors if i go to a deli and ask for a sandwich i give them tokens for the favor of having received a sandwich the people at the deli then exchange those tokens for other favors and that 's the entire economy people doing favors for other people in exchange for tokens that represent more favors sometimes being invested in your spouse is giving them a back rub when they 've had a hard day the investment pays off when you have a hard day and they give you a back rub sometimes being invested in your spouse is taking them to a for a professional massage the investment pays off when they get two tickets to that thing you love at the small scale it 's easy to mostly ignore minor monetary discrepancies at the large scale which i think £ 50k is plenty large enough given your listed net worth it becomes harder to tell if the opportunity cost will be worth making that investment it pretty much comes down to will the quality of life improvements from that investment be better than the quality of life improvements you receive from investing that money elsewhere as far as answering your actual question of how should i proceed there is n't a one size fits all answer to this it comes down to decisions you have to make such as in theory it 's easy to say that everyone should be able to trust their spouse but in practice there are a lot of people who are very bad at handling money it can be worthwhile in some instances to keep your spouse at an arms length from your finances for their own good such as if your spouse has a gambling addiction with all of that said it sounds like you 're living in a £ 1.5 m house rent free how much of an opportunity cost is that to your wife has she been freely investing in your well being with no explicit expectation of being repaid this can be your chance to provide a return on her investment if it were me i 'd make the investment in my spouse and consider it rent while enjoying the improvements to my quality of life that come with it

so let 's take a mortgage loan that allows prepayment without penalty say i have a 30 year mortgage and i have paid it for 15 years by the 16th year almost all the interest on the 30 year loan has been paid to the bank this is incorrect thinking   on a 30 year loan at year 15 about 2/3 's of the total interest to be paid has been paid and the principal is about 1/3 lower than the original loan amount   you may want to play with some amortization calculators that are freely available to see this in action    if you were to pay off the balance at that point you would avoid paying the remaining 1/3 of interest    consider a 100 k 30 year mortgage at 4.5 in month two the payment breaks down with $ 132 going to principal and $ going to interest   if in month one you had an extra $ 132 and directed it to principal you would save $ in interest   that is a great roi and why it is wonderful to get out of debt as soon as possible    the trouble with this is of course is that most people can barely afford the mortgage payment when it is new so lets look at the same situation in year 15 here $ would go to principal and $ 235 to interest   so you would have to come up with more money to save less interest   it is still a great roi but less dramatic    if you understand the magic of compounding interest then you can understand loans   it is just compounding interest in reverse   it works against you

i 've investigated this and banks are willing to offer a deal similar to what you ask you would take out a securities backed loan which provides you with the down payment on the property for the remainder you take out a regular mortgage   jaganalyst wonders why banks would accept this simple because there 's money to be made both on the securities backed loan and the mortgage both parts of the deal are financially sound from the banks perspective now the 20 number is perhaps a bit low having 20 of the value in shares means you 'd be able to get a loan for 50 of that so only a 10 downpayment

both states will want to tax you your tax home is where you maintain a domicile are registered to vote etc and you will probably want to keep this as ma since you state that ma is your permanent residence and you are staying in a rented place in pa but be careful about voter registration that is one of the items that can be used to determine your state of residence   ok so if you and your spouse are ma residents   you should file jointly as residents in ma and as nonresidents in pa do the calculations on the nonresident return first and then the calculations on the resident   return typically on a nonresident tax return the calculations are effectively the following report all your income usually agi from the federal return   call this $ x. compute the pa state tax due on $ x.   note that you follow the rules for nonresidents in doing this not the calculations used by pa residents call the amount of tax you computed as $ y. what part of the total income $ x is attributable to pa sources if this amount is $ z then you owe pa $ y times z x on the resident return in ma you will likely get some credit for the taxes paid to pa and this will reduce your ma tax burden usually the maximum credit is limited to the lesser of actual tax paid to pa and what you would have had to pay ma for the same income as far as withholding is concerned your employer in pa will withhold pa taxes as if you are a pa resident but you can adjust the amount via the pa equivalent of irs form w4 so as to account for any additional   tax that might be due because you will be filing as a nonresident   else you can pay estimated taxes via the pa equivalent of irs form 1040es similarly your wife can adjust her withholding to account for the ma taxes that you will owe on the joint income or you can pay estimated taxes to ma too note that it is unlikely that your employer in pennsylvania will withhold   massachusetts taxes and send them to massachusetts for you e.g. if it is a ma and pa store but there may be special deals available if   your employer does business in both states i.e. is a ma and pa store

you did n't buy it your mother did you can try to cancel it if it was purchased in your name if your mother purchased it she would have to cancel it either way the company has done it 's part by carrying you until that cancellation and you have no grounds for demanding a refund for time already covered if your mother was spending your money that is something you need to take up with her unless you want to bring charges against her for theft fraud if she was spending her own money then you may want to talk to a lawyer about getting her declared incompetent so someone else can control her spending but the money paid is probably gone it is n't the insurance company 's fault that you did n't want it does n't and if you do n't bring charges you ca n't complain about their having accepted stolen money even if you do bring charges and win it is n't clear you can get a refund if you really want to pursue any of this your next step is to talk to a lawyer

the answer likely depends a bit on which state you are in but this should be true for most states   i do n't know anything about pennsylvania specifically unfortunately the affordable care act created the shop marketplace which allows small businesses to effectively form larger groups for group coverage purposes   shop stands for small business health options program and requires only one common law employee on payroll this would effectively allow you to offer group coverage without having a group   talk to your tax accountant for more details as this is still very new and not necessarily well understood there are some other options all of which i would highly suggest talking to a tax accountant about as well   health reimbursement accounts allow the employer to set aside pre tax funds for the employee to use for approved medical expenses they 're often managed by a benefits company say wageworks etc   that would allow your employee to potentially pick a higher deductible health plan which offers poorer coverage on the individual marketplace with after tax dollars and then supplement with your there are also the concept of employer payment plans where the employer reimburses the employee for their insurance premiums but those are not compatible with the aca for the most part although there seems to be a lot of disagreement as to whether it 's possible to have something effectively the same work see for example this page versus this for example

it depends on the volatility of the underlying stock but for normal levels of volatility the real value of that option is probably $ 3.50 rough estimates of the value of the option depending on volatility levels bottom line unless this is a super volatile stock it is trading at $ 3.50 for a reason more generally it is extremely rare to find obvious arbitrage opportunities in the market

my sister who is in her mid twenties and not the most financially responsible kept telling me that the bank was doing weird shit    i looked at her statements and noticed something else wells fargo does she has a checking account that has a ten or fifteen dollar monthly fee   if her account ever got near that number or in the negative that is when that fee would be charged so basically instead of charging that fee at the same time every month they would wait till that charge would cause an overdraft which would spark a $ 35 dollar fee     yes i also proved that they are still reordering i told her to save all her receipts for one month her account was at $ 50 she made a five dollar food purchase and several other small purchases and then had to pay a small bill that took her over via the receipts it was easy to see that all the other small purchases were done two to three days ahead of the one that actually over drafted her which cost her almost $ 200 in overdraft fees   she is actually not that bad with money she works 40 hours a week but she just does not make enough to live on and this kind of practice puts her in a hole over and over again

if you know you will have a big bill like braces and you fully expect to hit the deductible then it can make sense the deductible can trip some people up because if they put too much into the limited purpose fsa and do n't hit the deductible for the regular insurance policy they ca n't get to all the money in the fsa because you have the ability to spend the potential money in the fsa before all the money has been contributed it can allow you to make that payment for the braces in january i did this the first year we had the hsa i knew i needed to pay a dental bill early in the year but the hsa would only have a few hundred dollars at that time so i used the limited purpose fsa to be able to make that payment this could also work if you spent a lot of money in the previous year because you have the ability to adjust how much money goes into the hsa each each pay period this idea does keep the option open to fully fund the hsa if your finances improve regarding the deductible   the law limits what you can use the limited purpose fsa for dental and vision only there is an exception if you hit the deductible for the high deductible insurance policy then you can use the funds in the limited purpose fsa for any medical reason   when i did this a few years ago i needed to send extensive paperwork to the company holding the funds before they would release the funds for dental once i sent them proof that i had met the deductible then any medical expense after that date could use the fsa with minimal paperwork if you fully fund the fsa beyond the cost of the braces and then have a light year medical expense wise you might not be able to spend all money in the fsa by the deadline regarding state taxes   i saw no difference in my states virginia treatment of the funds the state taxable income number was exactly the same as the federal taxable income number it did not treat the money in the fsa differently than the money in the hsa

i do n't think there 's anything to worry about   does n't really care who 's paying as long as the loan is being paid as agreed   of course you 're helping your dad 's credit history and not your own but i doubt would give back money just because it came from your bank account a business may claim a payment was n't made against the loan but you 'd have the records that you did in fact pay keep those bank statements   in theory they could sue you in practice you 'd send them the proof and they 'd investigate and find the misplaced money   that does happen sometimes the wrong account is credited   if it did end up in court again you 'd win because you have proof you sent payments   even if you put the wrong loan account number to pay to you 'd have proof you in fact sent the money    if you 're talking about something like a loan shark they can do whatever they like   they wo n't sue you though because again you 'd have proof   that 's why they 'd use violence   but probably a loan shark would n't falsely claim you did n't pay if you did as word would get out and the loan shark would lose business   and again as long as they get what 's agreed to they do n't care how they get it or who they get it from

one reason for this is that many people do n't simply allow their houses to rot and decay if you 're talking about a house built in 1980 and left vacant and for 35 years it probably will be in pretty poor shape   but a homeowner generally wants to preserve their house and maintain it in good condition so they invest in things like new roofs siding gutters windows paint new furnaces hot water heaters air conditioners etc all this stuff costs money and for tax purposes can often be factored into the cost basis of the house when it is sold but it maintains the value of the property a small hole in the roof may be fairly cheap to fix but if left it could eventually cause much of the building to rot making the structure near worthless if a car into your living room you do n't generally leave it there most people repair the damage   it 's not uncommon in some areas to have 100 year old houses or 300 + year old houses in some countries that were built well in the first place and have been well maintained in the interim   people also renovate their homes ripping out outdated construction and appliances and sometimes building new additions decks etc this also serves to make the property more attractive and increases its value

gt less capital tax = less pressure on the wealthy entrepreneurs since you keep bigger portion of your net income the interest to bring back business should increase = capital inflow back to the us   imo this statement makes a whole lot of assumptions that are untrue   1 the wealthy create jobs   i believe the opposite is true   i think if you want more companies jobs you should offer universal healthcare so low to middle class folks can risk leaving an established company to start on their own   2 more money to the rich means more investment in the economy my experience shows the rich will use the money to grow their own wealth not everyone 's i remember a recent bloomberg article where businessmen said they would use repatriated money for buyouts competition and growing a company 's hold on the market   3 take home money is used for investment   it is n't companies do the large investments not individuals   consider amazon looking at growing their distribution channels or apple with their iphone evolution   if you make it more profitable for corporate profits to go to compensation you leave less money for investment   4 companies struggle in the us due to this is a flat out myth cost of taxes for business in the us is one of the lowest for rich educated countries and that is before the tax kickbacks a la foxconn or loopholes   5 and the imo the us has been fed the lie that the best thing for the citizens of the country is aligned with the best things for the country 's companies the opposite is the case

i 'm not positive my answer is complete but from information on my broker 's website the following fees apply to a us option trade which i assume you 're concerned with given fee in dollars and the mention of the options clearing corporation they have more detail for other countries see for north america   use the sub menu near the top of the page to pick europe or asia the brokerage charged commission for this broker is as low as $ 0.25 per contract with a $ 1.00 minimum   though i 've been charged less than $ 1 to an options position as well as less than $ 1 to btc an options position so not sure about that minimum regarding what i read as your overall underlying question why are option fees so high in my research this broker has one of the cheapest commission rates on options i 've ever seen   when i participate in certain discussions i 'm routinely told that these fees are unbelievable and that $ $ or even $ are considered low fees    i 've heard this so much and discussed commissions with enough people who 've refused to switch brokers that i conclude there just is n't enough competition to drive prices lower   if most people wo n't switch brokers to go from $ to $ 1 per trade there simply is n't a reason to lower rates

if someone owns a house that is not paid off can someone buy it by taking another mortgage yes but i 'm not sure why you think the buyer would need to take another mortgage to buy it if someone sells their home for x dollars then the buyer needs x dollars to buy the house how they get that money use cash take out a mortgage is up to them during the closing process a portion of the funds generated from the sale are diverted to pay off the seller 's loan and any leftover funds after closing are pocketed by the seller what kind of offer would be most sensible i assume that in this case the current owner of the house would want to make a profit the amount that the house is sold for is determined by the market value of their home not by the size of the mortgage they have left to pay off you make the same offer whether they own their home or have a mortgage

many years ago i worked on software that had to print the date payee and amounts on pre printed checks   other than the micr line which had a particular placement with respect to the bottom edge and required a particular font in a particular point size most aspects of the check layout and format were up to the particular check provider then there was a desire to start using optical character recognition to further automate check handling   a standard came out that most checks i see now seem to follow   the standard dictated the exact dollar sign to be printed to the left of the amount box   this was used by the ocr to locate the amount   there were specific tolerances for where you could print write the amount relative to that dollar sign   there were also some requirements for the box containing the amount to have some clearance from the noisy backgrounds pre printed on many checks   but what font you used inside the amount box was as far as i could tell   after all customers could always hand write the amount interestingly the part of the check where you spell out the amount is known as the legal amount   if the amount in and the amount in words do n't match the spelled version takes precedence legally   the theory being that it 's easier to doctor the to change the apparent value of the check than it is to change the words   i always found it ironic that the layout standard to enable ocr standard was focused on reading the rather than the legal amount   ocr has come a long way since then so i would n't be surprised if nowadays both amounts are read even on hand written checks a little search shows that current voluntary standards are put out by the group

because this is money se and you 're connecting it to offspring i 'd think about a discussion with them to get their agreements from my perspective anything my wife and i have will go to offspring in the end as such everything borrowed and not repaid simply reduces the estate by that much among multiple offspring such reductions should be against the borrower rather than spreading it out that should be accounted for in whatever will is created this would be the discussion point it might also be discussed how or even if any interest should accrue for unpaid amounts if for example a 1 apr is agreed upon for unpaid loans then the final amount is taken off of the borrower 's inheritance existing outstanding loans might or might not be useful examples for sample calculations if desired or needed if nothing else they might serve as reminders that loans were not forgotten by having such a discussion you can show that you are trying to plan for a fair distribution of your estate perhaps thereby any concern about charging interest to offspring for repaid loans at the same time you 're handing over some financial responsibility giving them a power of personal choice which seems to be a part of what you 're concerned about once such a discussion is started it 's possible that any question of interest will resolve itself naturally the discussion almost necessarily must include all offspring at once one will find it harder to negotiate from a standpoint of pure self interest without objection from another think beforehand about what will be said and about what responses might come think things through as much as you can

it definitely depends on the exchange you are trading on i 'm not familiar with scottrade but a standard practice is to fulfill limit orders in the order they are placed    most of the time you would n't see stocks trade significantly under your bid price but since penny stocks are very volatile it 's more likely their price could drop quickly past your bid and then return above it while only fulfilling a portion of the orders placed example 1 penny stock priced at $ 0.12 2 others place limit orders to buy at $ 0.10 3 you place limit order to buy at $ 0.10 4 stock price drops to $ 0.07 and some orders are filled anything $ 0.07 or higher based on a first come first served basis 5 due to the increase in purchases of the penny stock the price rises above $ 0.10 before your order is filled edit adding additional clarification from comment section a second example if the price drops from $ 0.12 to $ 0.07 then orders for all prices from $ 0.07 and above will start to be filled from the oldest order first that might mean that the oldest order was a limit buy order for 100 shares at $ 0.09 and since that is above the current ask price it will be filled first the next order might be for 800 shares at $ 0.07 it 's possible for a subset of these to be filled let 's say 400 before the share 's price increases from the increased demand then if the price goes above $ 0.10 your bid will not be filled during that time

i 'd be very surprised but feel free to prove me wrong if he advised people to pay in physical cash he probably means to not take out debt   in the world of m&amp;a the term cash is used a bit differently you can fund a deal with cash stock or a combination of both however there are different sources of cash you can have funds in your bank account or you can go borrow funds in the debt market   so what this means for this deal is that amzn shareholders will not be giving up any equity for the acquisition they will either use cash that is in their bank accounts or go to the debt markets raise debt and use the proceeds to pay wfm shareholders   no one shows up with physical cash in either case it 's wired over to the people who will then distribute the money to the shareholders

if the fee is paid directly from the account then unfortunately no you can not deduct it it 's probably too late now but in the future you can ask the financial institution if they will allow you to write them a separate check to cover the fees if they allow that then you can preserve your tax free account balance and potentially deduct the fees too more details here update as discussed in the comments below a strict interpretation of the irs description of deductible investment expenses may not include expenses for a roth ira even if they are paid outside of the account however there seems to be conflicting interpretations of this irs rule so i would advise speaking to an accountant or the irs directly for clarification but even if you determine you can not deduct the fees paying for them outside of the roth is still a good idea because it enables you to maintain a higher balance in your tax advantaged account

there are many different kinds of sec filings with different purposes   broadly speaking what they have in common is that they are the ways that companies publicly disclose information that they are legally required to disclose   the page that you listed gives brief descriptions of many types but if you click through to the articles on individual types of filings you can get more info one of the most commonly discussed filings is the 10-k which is as wikipedia says a comprehensive summary of a company 's financial performance   this includes info like earnings and executive pay one example of a form that some people believe has potential utility for investors is form 4 which is a disclosure of insider trading   people with a privileged stake in a company executives directors and major shareholders can not legally buy or sell shares without disclosing it by filing a form 4   some people think that you can make use of this information in the sense that if for instance the ceo of google buys a bunch of twitter stock they may have some reason for thinking it will go up so maybe you should buy it too   whether such inferences are accurate and whether you can garner a practical benefit from them i.e. whether you can manage to buy before everyone else notices and drives the price up is debatable my personal opinion would be that for an average retail investor sec filings is unlikely to be useful   the reason is that an average retail investor should n't be investing in individual companies at all but rather in mutual funds or etfs which typically provide comparable returns with far less risk   sec filings are made by individual companies so it does n't generally help you to read them unless you 're going to take action related to an individual company   it does n't generally make sense to take action related to an individual company if you do n't have the time and energy to read a large number of sec filings to decide which company to take action on   if you have the time and energy to read a large number of sec filings you 're probably not an average retail investor   if you are a wheeler dealer who plays in the big leagues you might benefit from reading sec filings   however if you are n't already reading sec filings you 're probably not a wheeler dealer who plays in the big leagues that said if you 're a currently average investor with big dreams it could be to read a few filings to explore what you might do with them   you could for instance allocate a play money fund of a few thousand dollars and try your hand at following insider trades or the like   if you make some money great if not oh well   realistically though there are so many people who make a living reading sec filings and acting on them every day that you have little chance of finding a diamond in the rough unless you also make a living by doing it every day it 's sort of like asking should i read boating monthly to improve my sailing skills   if you 're asking because you want to rent a cat and go for a pleasure cruise now and then sure it ca n't hurt   if you 're asking because you want to enter the america 's cup you can still read boating monthly but it wo n't in itself meaningfully increase your chances of winning the america 's cup

the simple answer for the so called rule of x would be found by in your case update   if you want an approximation closer to the nominal rule of 72 value use this equation that incorporates a better approximation for the natural log the rule of 72 fits this for an interest rate of for a growth multiple of 2 the rule of 72 comes from by the natural as such the 2 is the multiple of growth the rate r here is not in percent so to change to percent say r you have to multiply by 100 the number 72 is often used because it is easier to divide evenly than and is a better fit approximation for the natural log and common interest rates   if you need more you can find all this on wikipedia

you should also consider what the cost of the put is especially if the strike price is set at the current price vs the average price delta of the security during the period between when you buy the put and the expiration date   also note the prices for puts on stocks with a lot of price volatility there are a good number of situations where you may come out behind if the stock stays the same price you are out the premium you paid for the put if the stock price rises less than the premium you are out the difference between the two if the stock price falls less than the premium you are out the difference between the two in order to be in the money when writing a protective put the stock has to either rise more than the premium you paid for the put and you must sell or hold and write off the expense of the put or the stock price has to fall below the strike price to a level lower   than the premium you paid and you must sell via the exercising the option and you 've protected yourself from a loss presuming you were going to sell and not hold and see if the stock recovers   and since selling is required in both cases if you 've held the stock less than a year then pay on any profits at short term rates taxed as regular income and if the price went down you ca n't claim any loss unless strike price was below your buy price and would still need to pay if you had a net gain and you likely ca n't deduct the price you paid for the put

something very similar to this was extremely popular in the uk in the late 1980s   the practice has completely vanished since the early 2000s   reading up on the uk endowment mortgage scandals will probably give you an excellent insight into whether you should attempt your plan endowment mortgages were provided by banks and at their peak were probably the most popular mortgage form   the basic idea was that you only pay the interest on your mortgage and invest a small amount each month into a low fee endowment policy   many endowment policies were simply index tracking and the idea being that by the end of your mortgage you would have built up a portfolio sufficient to pay off your mortgage and may well have extra left over in the late 1990s the combination of falling housing market and poor stock performance meant that many people were left with both the endowment less than their mortgage and their house in negative equity

most articles on investing recommend that investors that are just starting out to invest in index stock or bonds funds   this is the easiest way to get rolling and limit risk by investing in bonds and stocks and not either one of the asset classes alone    when you start to look deeper into investing there are so many options small cap large cap technical analysis fundamental analysis option strategies and on and on   this can end up being a full time job or chewing into a lot of personal time   it is a great challenge to learn various investment strategies frankly for the average person that works full time it is a huge effort   i would recommend also reading the intelligent asset allocator to get a wider perspective on how asset allocation can help grow a portfolio and reduce risk   this book covers a simple process

at its simplest level it 's an application of basic statistics probability suppose you have n independent and identically distributed assets with the return on asset i which has mean m and variance same for all assets you can easily weaken these assumptions but i make them to simplify the   square brackets show a numerical example with if you invest in one of these assets you expect to get a return of m 8 with standard deviation s 2 so you expect with probability 95 approx to get a return between and   between 4 and 12 now suppose you split your money equally among the n assets   your return is now r = your expected return is   = = m = m    8 the variance of your return is   = var        = = n =     so the standard deviation is = = s = now with 95 probability we get a return between and between and   this interval is smaller than when we invested in the single asset so in effect with this portfolio we are achieving the same return m 8 but with lower variance risk instead of 2   this is the result of diversification      you can assume the assets are not independent and most book of this topic do indeed do that in that case the calculation is modified because the variance of the portfolio now depends on the correlation between returns as does the reduction in variance caused by the diversification   if assets are negatively correlated the result of the diversification will be more reduction in risk and vice versa    you can also assume the assets are not identically distributed and the above analysis does not change too much    you might look for some references on capm capital asset pricing model or portfolio theory but broadly these are based on what i have described above finding the portfolio with minimum variance for a given return by investing proportionally in treasury bonds and risky assets

i am going to break rank slightly with the consensus so far   here 's the deal it probably does help your credit slightly to pay it multiple times per month if it is n't a hassle but the bump is likely to be minimal and very temporary   here 's why a key component of your score is your credit usage ratio that is the ratio of how much of your credit limits you are using you want to keep this number down as low as possible now here is where it gets tricky although you have a grace period to pay off your card with no interest the credit card companies do n't generally report the balance as of the due date they either report the high balance or an average balance over the month that is it is based on how much you use not how much balance you carry over each month it is n't very intuitive but that 's just how it is so technically keeping that balance lower over the course of the month will probably help you but the credit usage ratio is generally a rolling average over the last x months so the effect will wear off quickly so it is probably not worth doing unless you know you are going to apply for a loan in the next 6 months and need a temporary small bump another consideration is that paying early provides no real financial benefit in terms of finance charges but you are giving up liquidity which does have some value     1 you probably could get at least a little interest for keeping the money in your account a few more weeks 2 if you have a major financial emergency e.g. broken down car you might appreciate the fact that you kept your options open to carry that balance over a month

i 'm not a financial expert but saying that paying a $ 1 dividend will reduce the value of the stock by $ 1 sounds like awfully simple minded reasoning to me it appears to be based on the assumption that the price of a stock is equal to the value of the assets of a company divided by the total number of shares but that simply is n't true you do n't even need to do any in depth analysis to prove it just look at share prices over a few days you should easily be able to find stocks whose price varied wildly if say a company becomes the target of a federal investigation the share price will plummet the day the announcement is made did the company 's assets really disappear that day no what 's happened is that the company 's long term prospects are now in doubt or a company announces a promising new product the share price shoots up they may not have sold a single unit of the new product yet they have n't made a dollar but their future prospects now look improved many factors go into determining a stock price sure total assets is a factor but more important is anticipated future earning i think a very simple case could be made that if a stock never paid any dividends and if everyone knew it would never pay any dividends that stock is worthless the stock will never produce any profit to the owner so why should you be willing to pay anything for it one could say the value could go up and you could sell at a profit but on what basis would the value go up why would investors be willing to pay larger and larger amounts of money for an asset that produces zero income update i think i understand the source of the confusion now so let me add to my answer suppose that a company 's stock is selling for say $ 10 and to simplify the discussion let 's suppose that there is absolutely nothing affecting the value of that stock except an expected dividend the company plans to pay a dividend on a specific date of $ 1 per share this dividend is announced well in advance everyone knows that it will be paid and everyone is extremely that in fact the company really will pay it they wo n't run out of money or any such then in a pure market we would expect that as the date of that dividend approaches the price of the stock would rise until the day before the dividend is paid it is $ 11 then the day after the dividend is paid the price would fall back to $ 10 why because the person who owns the stock on the dividend day will get that $ 1 so if you bought the stock the day before the dividend the next day you would immediately receive $ 1 if without the dividend the stock is worth $ 10 then the day before the dividend the stock is worth $ 11 because you know that the next day you will get a $ 1 refund if you buy the stock the day after the dividend is paid you will not get the $ 1 it will go to the person who had the stock yesterday so the value of the stock falls back to the normal $ 10 so if you look at the value of a stock immediately after a dividend is paid yes it will be less than it was the day before by an amount equal to the dividend plus or minus all the other things that affect the value of a stock which in many cases would totally mask this effect but this does not mean that the dividend is worthless just the opposite the reason the stock price fell was precisely because the dividend has value but it only has value to the person who gets it it does me no good that you get a $ 1 dividend i want me to get the money so if i buy the stock after the dividend was paid i missed my chance so sure in the very short term a stock loses value after paying a dividend but this does not mean that dividends in general reduce the value of a stock just the opposite the price fell because it had gone up in anticipation of the dividend and is now returning to the normal level without the dividend the price would never have gone up in the first place imagine you had a company with negligible assets for example an accounting firm that rents office space so it does n't own a building its only tangible assets are some office supplies and the like so if the company liquidates it would be worth pretty much zero everybody knows that if liquidated the company would be worth zero further suppose that everyone somehow knows that this company will never ever again pay a dividend maybe federal regulators are shutting the company down because it 's products were declared hazardous or the company was built around one genius who just died etc what is the stock worth zero it is an investment that you know has a zero return why would anyone be willing to pay anything for it it 's no answer to say that you might buy the stock in the hope that the price of the stock will go up and you can sell at a profit even with no dividends why would anyone else pay anything for this stock well unless their stock certificates are pretty and people like to collect them or something like that otherwise you 're supposing that people would knowingly buy into a pyramid scheme of course in real life there are usually uncertainties if a company is dying some people may believe rightly or wrongly that there is still hope of it etc do n't confuse the value of the assets of a company with the value of its stock they are related of course all else being equal a company with a billion dollars in assets will have a higher market capitalization than a company with ten dollars in assets but you ca n't calculate the price of a company 's stock by adding up the value of all its assets subtracting liabilities and dividing by the number of shares that 's just not how it works long term the value of any stock is not the value of the assets but the net present value of the total future expected dividends subject to all sorts of

prime sucks because it 's all weird storage issues pulling it down amazon fresh though seems okay that 's the one where they go into sprouts or other stores and do the shopping for you so selection is better   fresh i believe is what will be incorporating whole foods as an option   what interests me the most is price differences between using the fresh just going to the store if it 's like $ 5 10 more for online shopping with exactly the same goods i might consider it after all i save gas and time but more than that for a small trip doubtful

between 1 and 2 g is actually pretty decent for a high school student   your best bet in my opinion is to wait the next small stock market crash and then invest in an index fund a fund that tracks the sp500 or the 2000 would be a good choice by stock market crash i 'm talking about a 20 to 30 drop from the highest point the stock market is at an all time high but nobody knows if it 's going to keep going   i would avoid penny stocks at least until you can read their annual report and understand most of what they 're claiming especially the cash flow statement from the few that i 've looked at penny stock companies just keep issuing stock to raise money for their money loosing operations   i 'd also avoid individual stocks for now you can setup a practice account somewhere online and try trading your classmates probably brag about how much they 've made but they wo n't tell you how much they lost   you are not your money by not doing anything with it your classmates are gambling with it they might as well go to a casino   echoing what others have said investing in yourself is your best option at this point try to get into the best school that you can anything that gives you an edge over other people in terms of experience or education is good so try to get some leadership and team experience and some online classes in a field that interests you

it makes sense if the npv is positive but what rate should you use at determining the npv a textbook might say market rate and by definition the market rate to use in bond calculations like yours will mean that your npv will be zero   how can this be well it 's a bit of a circular definition you take less capital to earn a higher return the value of your capital spread over the period of the bond 's maturity is the net difference but the money in your pocket from selling the bond and not purchasing also has value banks and traders do this exact swap every day many many times the rate at which you can execute this swap is what defines the market rate therefore by definition the npv will be zero now this does n't mean it 's a bad idea for you you can on your own accord decide the value you place on the capital versus the yield and make the decision do you expect rates to rise or fall do you expect higher or lower inflation in reality you can form whatever opinion you like for your own circumstance but the market is the net aggregation of opinion you only get to decide whether or not you agree with the market

the investments he 's chosen are well diversified   you can argue the   details but it 's a low fee low risk plan that 's simple to implement which makes it better than what of people do   starting saving early is also a great idea   now for the bad news   $ 1 mm is not enough to retire on   it ca n't generate $ 80k year without significant risk and even if it could those investment gains would be taxable   the general rule of thumb is that you should have 25x your annual expenses saved when you retire a bit more if you want to retire early at 50   do n't forget that inflation means $ 1 mm in 24 years will not have the same purchasing power it does today

if you are in a position to have information that will impact the shares of a stock or index fund and you use that information for either personal gain or to mitigate the losses that you would have felt then it is insider trading   even if in the end your quiet period passes with little or no movement of the stocks in question   it is the attempt to benefit from or the appearance of the attempt to benefit from inside information that creates the crime   this is the reason for the quiet periods to attempt to shield the majority of the companies employees from the appearance of as well as any actual with an index you are running a double edged sword because anything that is likely to cause apple to drop 10 is likely to give a bump to motorola google and its competitors   so you could end up in jail for insider trading and lose your shirt on a poor decision to short a tech   etf on knowledge that will cause apple to take a hit   it is certainly going to be harder to find the trade but the sec is good at looking around for activity that is inconsistent with normal trading patterns of individuals in a position to have knowledge with the type of market impact you are talking about

this question is different because you are asking for actual advice vs. a more academic what if scenario the answer that i 'll give will be different and similar to another recent question on a similar vein basically if you 're living in a european country that 's effectively in default and in need of a bailout the range of things that can happen is difficult to predict the fate of countries like ireland and greece whatever the scenario will be economic and social upheaval but this is n't the end of the world either it 's happened before and will happen again as an individual you need to start investing in a manner appropriate for your level of wealth things to think about i 'd suggest reading a free nation deep in debt the financial roots of democracy

first of all whatever you do don't pay   credit reporting agencies operate on aged records and paying it now will most certainly not improve your score   for example let 's say that you had an unpaid debt that was reported as a charge off to the credit bureaus   after say six months the negative effect on your score is reduced   it is reduced even further after a year or two and after two years the negative effect on your score is negligible now say you were to pay the debt after the two years   this would refresh the record and show as a paid charge off   sure now it shows as paid but it also shows the date of the record as being today which increases the effect on your credit drastically   in other words you would have just shot yourself in the foot big time as others have noted the best option is to dispute the item   if for some reason it is n't removed you are allowed to submit an to the item explaining your side of the story   anyone pulling your credit record would see this note which can help you in some instances   in any case these scam artists do n't deserve your money finally you should check who is the local and report this agent to them   she could lose her license for such a practice

details as usual will depend on local culture and jurisdiction but in most jurisdictions there is generally no obligation for you to actively return something money parcel whatever you received in error usually it 's enough to notify the sender actually it might be a dangerous mistake to return it yourself what if you send it to the wrong account so you probably have done all you had to and can close your account without further delay however until the time specified by statute of limitations or similar concept in your jurisdiction has passed usually a few years the company could ask you to return the money if they do ask be prepared to return it so do not spend it my recommendation would be then lean back and wait

assuming the stock was worth more at the time she gave it to you than when she bought it the cost basis would be the amount that she bought it for you would then pay tax on the increase in value from that time   generally it 's better to inherit assets than receive them as gifts since the cost basis of inherited assets is raised to the value at the time of the death of the one leaving the inheritance you will probably need to find some record of the original amount paid so you can determine the right cost basis

regarding auto insurance you have to look at the different parts in the united most states do require a level of specific coverage for all drivers that is to make sure that if you are at fault there is money available to pay the victims that payment may be for damage to their car or other property but it also covers medical costs many policies also cover you if the other driver does n't have insurance the policy that covers the loss of the vehicle is required if you have a loan or are leasing the car somebody else owns it while there is a loan so they can and do require you to pay to protect the vehicle   if there i no loan you do n't have to have that portion of a policy other parts such as towing assistance and rental cars replacement may be required by the insurance standards for your state or might be almost impossible to drop because all insurance companies include it to stay competitive with their competition   dropping the non required parts of the coverage is acceptable when you do n't have a loan some people do drop it to save money but that does mean you are self insuring if you can afford to self insure a new car great the interesting thing is that some people have more than enough assets to self the non required part of auto insurance but then they realize that they do need to up their umbrella liability insurance this is to protect them from somebody deciding that their resources make them a tempting target when they are involved in a collision

two principles in comparing different scenarios   1 keep the two scenarios as equal as possible in amount and timing of payments   and 2 find the financial comparison at one particular point so your car loan $ 10,000 for 35 months at 8 compounded monthly means you 're paying $ suppose you make the switch and keep on paying the same mortgage and $ for the 35 months see 1 above those extra payments continued for 35 months at your mortgage rate of will pay off a mortgage of $ which will more than pay off the $ 10,000 you added to the mortgage   in other words making the switch will benefit you to the tune of as of the day of the switch   you could ask the mortgage company to give you the $ 10,000 and the $ and all your payments and amortization would stay the same see 2 above of course this is pretty much what joe taxpayer said

uber relies on a 3rd party service which is basically only slightly better than a google search it 's a big sticking point because many cities conduct better more thorough background checks with their taxi drivers but uber does n't want that because it can sometimes takes months and thus cut into profit   not to mention even when uber was starting out surge prices easily made it cost 2 3x more than taxis during peak times a lot of cities already solved this problem with taxis by forcing them to charge flat rates a regulation that uber simply ignored   uber is basically one step forward the app two steps back

i love reddit but it is an extremely outdated business model modern social media platforms like youtube and instagram go out of their way to encourage user generated content and entrepreneurship their algorithms notice what you 've been watching in my case and push me similar albeit lesser known content like or every frame a painting    contrast that to reddit where on most subreddits original content is outlawed linking to a blog a video a podcast a website an app etc is labeled self promotion and results in a ban so without original content this is what you get memes la times articles cat videos and noob questions    i was recently told by a that original content was unnecessary because of all the great content put out by corporations i m suspicious if this is nt the notion more mods have and it 's an extremely outdated notion user generated niche content is clearly the way the internet is trending and reddit will likely never adjust

unless you are getting the loan from a loan shark it is the most common case that each payment is applied to the interest accrued to date and the rest is applied towards reducing the principal   so assuming that means 26 equally spaced payments during the year the interest accrued at the end of the first fortnight is $ x = $ and so the principal is reduced by $ $ = $ for the next payment the principal still owing at the beginning of that fortnight will be $ = $ and the interest accrued will be $ x = $ and so slightly more of the principal will be reduced than the $ of the previous payment   lather rinse repeat until the loan is paid off which should occur at the end of 17.5 years or after biweekly payments if the loan rate changes during this time since you say that this is a variable rate loan the numbers quoted above will change too and no it is not the case that just 5.75 of the $ 2300 is interest and the rest comes off the principle sic interest is computed on the principal amount still owed $ for starters and then decreasing not the loan payment amount edit   after playing around with a spreadsheet a bit i found that if   payments are made every two weeks 14 days apart rather than 26 equally spaced payments in one year as i used above interest accrues at the rate of 5.75 x for the 14 days rather than at the rate of for the time between payments as i used above each 14 days $ is paid as the biweekly mortgage payment instead of the $ stated by the op then payments slightly less than 17.5 calendar years when leap years are taken into account will pay off the loan   in fact that payment should be reduced by 65 cents   in view of rounding of fractional cents and the like i doubt that it would be possible to have the last equal payment reduce the balance to exactly 0

just curious what qualifies this as a hedge fund   is it structured as an llc   are they charging apple fees   are they shorting or using derivatives or leverage to manage risk or amplify returns   are they employing sophisticated investment strategies   are they managing funds for outside investors   sounds to me like a standard cash management and tax avoidance operation of a very large corporation that somebody is calling a hedge fund to claim it is the world 's largest   i 'm sure most major corporations are running something similar to this and nobody calls them hedge funds

food to your door is a problem nobody is asking to solve    food delivery has limited success for luxury or novelty food items e.g. fruit baskets steaks coffee snack food etc but for general eating family eating it 's not an everyday food shopping need    i can already buy rice cereal pasta etc on amazon and their prices are usually higher than what i can buy locally    and that comparison is name brand products   the price difference is laughable when it comes to store brands   remember when amazon diaper products were supposed to put and out of business    oh yeah   look where that got them

there 's nothing much you can do here and i do n't think you 'll succeed in placing blame on the lawyers in order for ssa to have the tax withheld from your benefits you need to submit form here are the details on how to get it and what to do with it this form is voluntarily submitted i.e. no one will ask for it you have to actively send it out on your own as to repayment of the ltd benefits since they were not taxable there 's no change in the taxable income on your behalf what you got was n't taxed so what you gave back does n't provide any tax benefit as to why ssa benefits are taxable and ltd benefits are not this is because ssa is pre tax and ltd premiums were in your case apparently post tax however the ltd benefits management company does n't care or may be even know about this and they do everything they can to reduce their own liability to you if you 're entitled to ssa benefits it reduces their liability that 's why they insisted on your claim with ssa as to the ssa dragging their feet they want to reduce their taxpayers essentially liability as well however once they decided in your favor you received what was rightfully yours including back pay ssa benefits are taxable in the year received so you got a lump sum taxable as a lump sum sorry but that 's the way it is this is an example where post tax ltd premiums do n't actually pay off

the value of getting into the landlord business or any other business depends on circumstances at the time how much will it cost you to buy the property how much can you reasonably expect to collect in rent how easy or difficult is it to find a tenant etc i owned a rental property for about ten years and i lost a bundle of money on it things people often do n't consider when calculating likely rental income are there will be times when you have no tenant someone moves out and you do n't always find a new tenant right away maintenance there 's always something that the tenant expects you to fix tenants are n't likely to take as good a care of the property as someone who owned it would and while a homeowner might fix little things himself like a broken light switch or the tenant expects the landlord to fix such things if you live nearby and have the time and ability to do minor maintenance this may be no big deal if you have to call a professional this can get very expensive very quickly like for example i once had a tenant complain that the water heater was n't working i called a plumber he found that the knob on the water heater was set to low so he turned it up he charged me i think it was $ 200 i ca n't really complain about the charge he had to drive to the property figure out that that was all the problem was turn the knob and then verify that that really solved the problem tenants do n't always pay the rent on time or at all i had several tenants who apparently saw the rent as something optional to be paid if they had money left over that they could n't think of anything better to do with you may get bad tenants who destroy the place i had one tenant who did $ 10,000 worth of damage that include six inches deep of trash all over the house that had to be cleared out rotting food all over on walls holes in the walls and many things broken i thought it was disgusting just to have to go in to clean it up i ca n't imagine living like that but whatever depending on the laws in your area it may be very difficult to kick out a bad tenant in my case i had to evict two tenants and it took about three months each time to go through the legal process on the slip side the big advantage to owning real estate is that once you pay it off you own it and can continue to collect rent and as most currencies in the world are subject to inflation the rent you can charge will normally go up while your mortgage payments are constant

the other answers are good i would just like to add certain points taking this question together with the previous ones you have asked here how can a person measure how much to spend on food car bills or rent    from his salary is there a formula to keep in check basically it may well be that your best option would be to move to a smaller apartment or worse location to bring down rent possibly forget about your own study in the worst case sell the car and use public transportation eat as many meals as possible at home bring boxed lunch from home to work if this applies etc whatever makes a saving and sense to you regarding food this is the point where it is usually possible to save a very significant amount if you are prepared to make food at home unless you are already doing it look around for articles such as living on 20 pounds a week or so maybe they will give you ideas you can use eg how to eat on 10 pounds a week shopping list and recipes where you are shopping is crucial here as similar items can differ in price significantly between different chains if the electricity bill is significant and you are at home a lot you could try to bring it down by changing all bulbs in your home to led ones unless it has already been done yes they can cost 2 3 more than eg ones but they use 5 10x less electricity forget credit cards if possible use debit cards so you know the money you spend does not get you into more debt one question you asked here was about exchange rates if you work with different currencies a lot there are several companies such as revolut or which offer accounts with debit cards that use near fx rates in my i could save around 10 15 on currency conversion eur gbp using revolut compared to my local bank rate for example i find myself looking at my account every single day and get    and sad because almost whenever the money pay comes in i freak out    that after everything there is nothing for us to enjoy or save well yes that is nearly the definition of too much debt the point about going to the extremes of reducing expenses i outlined above is that the more you can reduce your expenses while struggling with debt the faster you 'll get out of it it might be hard to adapt but it will be better if you can calculate how long it will take to get you back on feet and know that eg in 6 months i can start to think of savings and carefully upgrading my lifestyle back   in turn the smaller the reduction of expenses the more prolonged the process you might be looking at 2 3 years of insecure constantly frustrating risking more debt lifestyle instead of 6 months of severely reduced one alternatively if things go too bleak you might consider declaring bankrupcy although i am not sure how feasible it is in the uk

in the case of bank failures you are protected by fdic insurance   at the time i wrote this you are insured up to $ 250,000   in my lifetime it has been as high as $ 1,000,000 and as low as $ 100,000   i attached a link which is updated by fdic in the case of fraud it depends if you read this story and are horrified i was too you know that the banking system is not as safe as the other answers imply in february 2005 joe lopez a businessman from florida filed a suit    against bank of america after unknown hackers stole $ 90,000 from his    bank of america account the money had been transferred to an investigation showed that mr. lopez ’s computer was infected with a    malicious program backdoor which records every    and sends this information to malicious users via the internet this    is how the hackers got hold of joe lopez ’s user name and password    since mr. lopez often used the internet to manage his bank of america    account however the court did not rule in favor of the plaintiff saying that    mr. lopez had neglected to take basic precautions when managing his    bank account on the internet a signature for the malicious code that    was found on his system had been added to nearly all antivirus product    databases back in 2003 ouch    but let 's think about the story for a second he had his money stolen because of online banking and he did n't have the latest antivirus software   how safe is banking if you do n't do online banking   in the case of this story it would have prevented but you 're still susceptible to someone stealing your card or account information   so in the bank 's defense how does a bank not know that someone did n't wire money to a friend which is a loss for good then get some of that money back from his friend while also getting money back from the bank which had to face the loss   yes it sucks but it 's not total madness as for disputing charges from personal experience it also depends   i do n't use cards whatsoever so i 've never had to worry but both of my parents have experienced banking fraud where a fake charge on their card was not reversed   neither of my parents are rich and ca n't afford lawyers so crying lawsuit is not an option for everyone   how often does this occur   i suspect it 's rare that banks do n't reverse the charges in fraudulent cases though you will still lose time for filing and possibly filling out paperwork   the way to prevent this as much as i hate to be the bearer of bad news there is no absolutely safe place to keep your money   even if you bought metals and buried them in the ground a with a metal detector might run across it one day   you can take steps to protect yourself but there is no absolute guarantee that these will work out account closures i added this today because i saw this question and have only seen heard about this three times   provided that you get the cashier 's check back safely you should be okay but why was this person 's account closed and look at how much funds he had   from his question in the two years i banked with boa i never had an overdraft or any    negative marks on my account so the only thing that would stick out    was a check that i deposited for $ that my mom left me after she    passed naturally people are n't going to like some of my answers especially this but imagine you 're in an immediate need for cash and you experience this issue   what can you do   let 's say that rent is on the line and it 's $ 25 for every day that you 're late   other steps to protect yourself some banks allow you to use a keyword or phrase   if you 're careful with how you do this and are clever it will reduce the risk that someone steals your money

you might want to head on over to and ask the same question    however from a personal finance perspective this kind of drama is somewhat common when someone is deceased and financial expectations are not met by the heirs   it sounds like the daughter was expecting a lot more in inheritance than was actually received   there was probably an of dad 's net worth and an of the cost of his care toward the end of his life its best not to participate in this drama and i feel that you are correct that the daughter does not have a right to see the bank account statements prior to dad 's passage   the question is also if she has a right to see it now here in the us a joint account can be setup so the ownership transfers to other account up death of an owner   so in this case your mother would own the account   if the account is setup as such then the estate has no right to that money   you may want to check with the bank for some free advice   what is the classification of the account now that dad has passed   when a person grants someone else the power of attorney they have the ability to act as if they were that person   most of the time are limited in scope so if i give a person the poa to register a car in my name they can not apply for a credit card in my name legally   in this case however the poa was probably general so pretty much your mom could do whatever she pleased so if your mom took good care of the dad and bought herself some nice jewelry that is perfectly allowable with a general poa i strongly doubt this daughter has any rights to the past records and may not even have the rights to the joint bank account currently

respectfully i am of the opinion that you are mixing issues   paying a mortgage off early vs investing is a question that 's been well discussed at money se if you project a higher tax adjusted return on the investments than your current mortgage rate invest else pay the mortgage down   if the rent covers the mortgage you can maintain the investing it does n't matter for this discussion if the rent produces a profit so long as all expenses are covered   renting aside in the us now my mortgage is 3.5 2.6 after taxes so long as i expect a return well above this level long term i 'll stay investing and let the mortgage die its slow death another decade or so   i 'm sorry i can offer a formula it 's less about the same or more the mortgage is fixed right but the market return is unknown

i do not know anything about retail investing in india since i am in the us however there are a couple of general things to keep in mind about gold that should be largely independent of country first gold is not an investment aside from a few industrial uses it has no productive value it is at best a hedge against inflation since many people feel more comfortable with what they consider real money that is not subject to what seems to be arbitrary creation by central banks second buying tiny amounts of gold as coin or bullion from a retail dealer will always involve a fairly significant spread from the commodity spot price the spot price only applies to large transactions retail dealers have costs of doing business that necessitate these fees in order for them to make a profit you must also consider the costs of storing your gold in a way that mitigates the risk of theft the comment by is on this point it appeared while i was typing this answer you might find this planet money piece on the process costs and risks of buying gold bullion in the us if you feel that you must own gold as an inflation hedge and it is possible for residents of india you would be best off with some kind of gold fund that tracks the price of bullion

from the price of a bond is equal to the present value of its future cash flows as shown in the following formula   where by induction this is equivalent to or using more familiar formulae it is equivalent to the formula for the present value of an ordinary annuity to represent the coupon payments plus a term for the discounted value at maturity for example a 10 year semiannual bond with coupon payment 10 priced at with maturity value 1000 solving for r yields or semi annually 8.75 per annum the solution can be found by plotting or using a solver which many pocket calculators have   plot of p as a function of r with p = when r =    checking on investopedia

first the good news based on the time involved and the amount of potential profits you will not owe any tax on the sale of the house no matter which option you pick now the details when determining if there are any capital gains the irs cares about the difference between the sale price and the purchase price the amount of the loan the final balance of the loan or the lack of loan do n't factor into the calculation to complicate matters the government does factor into the equation any improvements you have made to the house like a new deck and the cost of buying and selling the house real estate agents if a single person has less than 250 k in capital gains and has used the house as their main residence for 2 of the the previous 5 years their tax is zero for a couple the tax free gain is $ 500k. for your situation since the sale price is less than $ 250 k the capital gains will also be less than $ 250k. you do have one potential area of concern if the house is worth significantly more than $ 150 k the government could claim that the difference between what you charged your parents and what you could have charged was a gift assuming that there are no other factors that you did n't include in the original question it would appear that you will not face any taxes regarding your two options neither will impact the taxes though draining your savings or investments could make it difficult to meet an emergency during the time between the sending of the $ 95 k to the mortgage company and the closing on the deal with your parents if the money came from retirement account it could have an even greater impact on your taxes and retirement situation

credit cards are often more fool proof against over drawing consider bill has solid cash flow but most of their money is in his high interest savings account earning interest an account that does n't have a card but is accessible via online banking bill keeps enough in the debit transactions account for regular spending much of which comes out automatically e.g. rent utilities some of which he spends as needed eg shopping lunch on top of the day to day money bill keeps an overhead amount so if something happens he does n't overdraw the account which would incur significant fees now bill sees that the giant tv he has been saving for is on sale half price and there is just one left it costs more than he would normally spend in a week much more but bill knows that his pay should have just gone in and his rent not yet come out plus the overhead he keep in the account so there is money in his debit account when he gets home he can open up online banking and transfer from his savings after all the tv is what he was saving for what bill forgets is that there was a public holiday last week in the state where payroll is operated and that his pay is going to go in a day late so now he might have over drawn the account buying the tv or maybe that was fine but paying the rent over draws the account now he has a overdraft fee probably on the order of $ 50 most banks at least where i am will happily allow you to overdraw you account giving you a loan at high interest and with an immediate overdraft fee they do this cos the fee is so high that they can tolerate the risk of the non assessed loan sometimes if you ask they do n't let you do it with your own eg buying the tv but they do let you do it on automated eg the rent on the other hand banks will not let you over draw a credit card they know exactly how much loan and risk they were going to take if bill had most of his transactions going on his credit card then it would have just bounced at the cash register and bill would have remembered what was going on and then transferred the money there are many ways you can accidentally overdraw your account particularly if it is a shared account

gt i do n't think anyone is blaming animal agriculture on its own for global warming issues at the same time its undeniable at this point to say animal agriculture is not a leading environmental problem even if it is just 14.5 of emissions the deforestation the ridiculous amounts of fresh water needed and the untreated sewage wastage    you have the same problem with soybeans science article it 's a problem with production that affects all agriculture   and when you look at plant sources of protein they have very similar water use as meat   kg us us nl nl dried us hemp nl soybean   from media downloads and media downloads looking at blue surface ground water and grey water needed to clear pollutants water use   gt also so your argument is that hey we 're producing enough food for everyone even though its an extremely inefficient way of producing calories so what s to worry about as much as we 'd like to think we have unlimited resources we do n't our is destroying the planet in addition to the environmental costs it simply does n't make sense to allocate the majority of our crops to feed and grow the billions of land animals when we could allocate those crops to foods that can feed people directly   the point is that we can double the earth population without running out of food and then we can add another 40 in the us by simply not throwing away the food then we can optimize land use and not all land is suitable for growing crops so we get more food by using it for meat   food production is simply not an issue   gt you may not like to admit it vegan and plant based when it comes to food are the equivalents of clean energy and animal based foods is akin oil and coal which is probably why vegan fast food is attracting the biggest investors it 's the future   an optimized scenario includes meat as not all land is suitable to farming and you have seafood and wildlife   at this point being vegan is more like being religious

you 're conflating the amount of money the american economy makes with the amount of debt the american government accrues the deficit is not 2.3 of tax receipts   really your story is about somebody who makes $ has their parent 's co signed on a mortgage for $ and spent $ last year they just put the extra $ 9 on their parents credit card and ignored all the times their parents have tried to sit down and talk about their spending habits over the years   the total american debt is $ 60 trillion which is 350 of gdp

if you look at a few facts you can quickly understand the boom in the 1980 's housing is the biggest driver of our economy because it drives consumption when people buy a house the spend money baby boomers delayed buying houses because of a decade long recession in the 1970 's because of a high price for oil oil price dropped from $ 100 to $ 10 per barrel taxes were cut for everybody baby boomers went on a seven year housing binge did corporate tax cuts help sure were they the primary reason for the growth not even close if anything they gave businesses a taste for how much they could save by cutting taxes and set loose the lobbying to cut taxes leading to huge federal deficits and debt

as joetaxpayer has commented the markets are littered with the of those who buy into the idea that markets submit readily to formal analysis    financial markets are amongst the most complex systems we know of   to borrow a concept from mathematics that of a chaotic system one might say that financial markets are a chaotic system comprised of a structure of chaotic for example the unpredictable behaviour of a single big market participant can have dramatic effects on overall market behaviour in my experience becoming a successful investor requires a considerable amount of time and commitment and has a steep learning curve   your actions in abandoning your graduate studies hint that you are perhaps lacking in commitment most people believe that they are special and that investing will be easy money   if you are currently entertaining such thoughts then you would be well advised to forget them immediately and prepare to show some humility tl dr it is currently considered that behavioural psychology is a valuable tool in understanding investors behaviour as well as overall market trends   also in the area of psychology confirmation bias is another aspect of trading that it is important to keep in mind   quantitative analysis is a mathematical tool that is currently used by hedge funds and the big investment banks however these methods require considerable resources and given the   performance of hedge funds in the last few years it does not appear to be worth the investment if you are serious in wanting to make the necessary commitments then here are a few ideas on where to start there are certain technical details that you will need to understand in order to quantify the risks you are taking beyond simple buying and holding financial instruments   for example how option strategies can be used limit your risk how margin requirements may force your hand in volatile markets how different markets impact on one another e.g. the relationship between bond markets and equity markets and a host of other issues   also to repeat it is important to understand how your own psychology can impact on your investment decisions

forex i will employ my skill for suspension of disbelief and answer with no visceral reaction to bitcoin itself the euro is not an investment it 's a currency people trade currencies in order to capture relative movements between pairs of currencies unlike stocks that have an underlying business and potential for growth or failure of course a currency trade is a zero sum game two people on opposite sides of a bet   bitcoin has no underlying asset either no stock no commodity it trades de facto like a currency and for purposes of objective classification it would be considered a currency and held similar to any forex position

gt at the same time you were comparing this program to courses taught by mit and harvard and the cfa designation gt    i was pointing out the method of instruction of these programs not equating this program to them    nor was i referencing the full time on campus real master 's degrees offered by mit or harvard as you seem to be   it being called a master 's is probably deceptive i 'll agree with you there it should be called a certificate perhaps but the us does not protect academic titles or control who can and who can not claim to issue a master 's degree blame that on politics

edit this answer is outdated and is no longer valid due to that all new existing accounts in jersey must be owned by a resident from or jersey due to anti tax dodging laws link open an offshore account in a bank in jersey is with it will cost you £ 70 a year but for that price you can get 3 accounts one in $ one in £ and one in € you can move money between the accounts without any cost and you can have a chip and pin card on both the euro and the £ accounts and there is no residency restrictions downsides the anti laundering checks are annoying do n't forget to tell the irs about every single cent you get in interest and religiously pay your tax on it the revenue service does n't like people with off shore accounts

a lot of this example is idealistic and the analysis stops right at the point the loan is issued     if you use generous interest rates you could just skirt by the bare minimum debt service coverage ratio for an asset backed loan if you found a lender to approve it   however he does n't address any of the issues of running a business that will be insolvent if expenses rise more than about ~2 above the monthly average in a given month those pesky period months equipment repairs heating cooling in winter summer etc or you have a similarly small in sales selling in january     most companies doing lbos have skin in it and a plan to make the company more valuable not run it exactly the way it is this allows them to either acquire more debt capital than just a percentage of the collateral and so they can finance capital projects to improve the business deal with fluctuations in cash flow and/or implement plans to increase the free cash flows above how it was running previously   this site 's advice is a bit like teaching someone the basics of how to take off in an airplane and then telling them they 're ready to fly
