take another job   from a personal finance perspective this is the wrong reason to dip into a retirement account   you will lose so much ground towards actually retiring   sure you wo n't be taxed but you will be missing so much opportunity where that money wo n't be working for your retirement the off topic answer to take to the start ups stackexchange site is   do n't quit your day job until your business plan is written out and you have an idea of where to get your startup capital

that 's up to you but i would n't play around with my retirement money if i was in your situation your earning potential during your retirement years will likely be at its do you really want to risk being forced to be a wal mart greeter when you are 80 also considering your earning potential now is probably at or near the peak your opportunity cost for each hour of your life is much higher now than it will be later so ultimately you 'd be working a little harder now or a lot harder later for less money

given you other question and your resulting marginal tax rate you may want to optimize where you hold each type of security   if you still plan to have a regular investment account it 's hard to beat the low tax rate of canadian dividends in a tfsa you wo n't pay tax on the dividend income and you wo n't get a dividend tax credit either   for some people in bc this actually costs them money as they have negative marginal dividend tax rates   for you it seems to be 6 contrast this with any other holding in your regular account interest at full marginal rates and cap gains at half that   dividends still win in a regular account

using us tax code given that your profits are less than 250 k given that you lived in that home over two years then yes the 150 k is tax free    that is your money in the us note   i wo n't get into all of the specifics but basically you need to live somewhere 2 years   you get 250 k per person up to 500k.   most enhancements count as money towards the home   so most all of your 12k should be discounted   however there is a lot of fine print in this and a lot of interpretation on what is normal upkeep and what is an enhancement

yes it is a very good idea to start your credit history early   it sounds like you have a good understanding of the appropriate use of credit as a substitute for cash rather than a supplement to income   as long as you keep your expenses under control and pay off your card each month i see no problems with the idea try to find a card with no annual fees a low interest rate if possible which will be difficult at your age and with some form of rewards such as cash back   look for a reputable issuing bank and keep the account open even after you get a new card down the road   your credit score is positively correlated with having an account open for a long time having a good credit usage to credit limit ratio and having accounts in good standing and paid on time

paying off your mortgage early being good is a myth   it is great for the chronic to have their mortgage paid off so when they rack up credit card bills and get behind well they still a place to stay but for those who are more logical with their money paying off your mortgage early in current conditions makes no sense   you can get a 30 year loan well below 4   discounting taxes for your average family you would have a rate floating below 3    so reasons that paying off your mortgage should be almost last given current low long term interest rates the first thing you should do is take care of any high interest debt   i would say that anything more than 7 8 including all credit card debt should be focus 1 putting money into your retirement savings is 1   you will earn way more than 3 over the long run   you can earn a higher return in the market   even with a very conservative portfolio you can clear 5 6 which will still clear more than 3 after taxes for those who say you ca n't be sure about the market well if the market did bad for 30 years in a row no one will have money and the house will also be worthless if a disaster happens to your house and you own it your money is gone   in many cases you would be able to declare bankruptcy and let the bank take the property as is    there are just too many examples but if you are paying off your house early you lose the flexible liquid money that you now have tied up in the house now the reasons for paying down your mortgage are really easy too you do n't trust your spending habits you want to move up in houses and you want to make sure that you have at least 20 down on future house to skip pmi

gt i 'm not sure how to answer that it 's all just speculation the competition is waiting for the first big mover to do just what tsla is going being the first mover then coming in and wiping the floor with them   it 's very funny that you call an analysis of the current state of the industry speculation and then go on to talk about something you think is going to happen which by the way has had six years to happen and has n't yet   also it 's as if you do n't think first mover advantage exists   six years is a long time to build up a lead especially in automotive where product cycles and development times are so long   gt;if you want to argue that all of the last 30 years of free markets and the value of specialization is wrong go ahead   honestly look up the words vertical integration before continuing the conversation   and the word panasonic as well   gt;they are committing massive capital to old technology that 's a loser play but it will help the industry as a whole and those that are going to come in with the next generation of batteries while tsla is stuck with massive capital in lithium ion   but wait i thought you said they were wrong because actual battery companies are n't involved   and that actual battery companies know better than them   but i guess the actual battery companies do n't actually know anything and they should listen to an idiot on the internet who has so far proven himself to be wrong about everything he 's said   gt;it seems panasonic is not as optimistic about the plant as you are   well again if you listened to the call which is a pretty basic first step to talking about the quarterly results which for some reason you insist on continuing to do despite being completely ignorant of them then you might not be saying such stupid things   panasonic you see is a rather conservative japanese company   this is even mentioned in your article when they talk about plasma displays   this is why they are always measured in their public statements because that 's what japanese companies do   but as specified in the call panasonic 's actions as a partner to tesla have always been excellent   and if you actually bothered to read your own article you would see that they 've committed to 2 billion cells and 200 300 million for the factory   you know an actual battery company   and if you actually bothered to read any other article you would see that that very same quote of yours was followed up with however tesla is a very important partner to us and discussions are continuing we need to look very carefully at auto demand and respond appropriately so of course that means taking a step by step approach to investment   also there have been rumors of talks with lg and samsung should panasonic not decide to partner   i 'm not sure i believe the rumors and also i think they 're unnecessary because panasonic will be a full partner in the gigafactory   they know that tesla has been a huge source of profit for them and their automotive supply i.e. tesla has been one of the best performing parts of their company for some time now   mark my words panasonic 's investment will end up being approximately $ 1 billion all told   you can come back in a few years and check if you like   gt;to keep the sucks putting up money   you mean like an actual battery company   the ones putting up the money   so since your point was so reliant on actual battery companies having expertise and specialization and so on does that mean you 're now dropping that point because you realized your bullshit would n't fly and moving on to another sort of bullshit until one of them sticks   because if you 'd like to fix your ignorance i can help you with that   but if you would n't as seems to be the case it seems somewhat like a waste of time to continue trying to explain basic concepts to you

as other responders said you can certainly roll over multiple 401(k into a single account an added benefit of such rollover besides the ease of tracking is that you can shop around for your rollover ira provider and find the one that gives you the specific mutual funds that you want to invest in the lowest expenses etc in short find the best fit to your priorities   there are also lemon 401(k plans and if you are in one of them get out   and rollover is the way out there is also one possibility to keep an eye on as it happens rarely but it does happen rolling a 401(k over into another 401(k   i 've done it once when i started a job at a company that had a great 401(k with a good selection of low cost mutual funds   i rolled the 401(k from one previous job in to this 401(k to take advantage of it   at the same time i kept a rollover ira combining the 401(k from all other jobs it had more investment options and provided some flexibility

what account you put it in depends on why you have those different accounts   first if you have them due to regulatory requirements then you of course must follow said regulations i doubt that 's the case here   otherwise you might be splitting based on how they trade etfs trade as stocks or you could be splitting based on how you build a portfolio out of them   when you build a non speculative stock portfolio you typically want to limit your holdings in a single stock to a fairly small portion of your portfolio say 3 to limit your exposure to bad stuff happening to a single company that does n't apply nearly a much to mutual funds especially index funds etfs are much more like mutual funds here   you can also of course create an etf account and put them there you also say you have a market index account what is that used for

in your journal entry debit the appropriate expense account office supplies etc and credit your equity account   the equity account should be called something like partner investments or something like that you can choose to enter these all separately on the specific dates listed or as one entry   some people choose to summarize the expenses they 've paid personally and only enter one entry per month or so to minimize data entry time and also because the end effect is the same of course the above is assuming you are considering these purchases to be investments in the company and not expecting the company to repay you   if you are expecting repayment you could enter a bill instead or credit an account like loan from shareholder rather than the equity account

all good points you 're right about my concern though i like to think of it as that rather than fear but that 's immaterial   i get the destructive destruction   externalities exist and should be honestly assessed but then the externalities of the interventions should also be considered such as an incentive to automate or other potentially more destructive technologies as you mentioned   i do n't think it 's unreasonable to think that ill considered regulation can create a feedback loop of interventions and responses that can severely distort a market   i wish public choice theory had a little more traction than it seems to not as a solution but as a framework for analysis   i suppose my perspective on regulation meant to level the playing field should do just that focus on the field not the score   i do n't think anyone has enough understanding to be able to say what the score should be only what they prefer it to be and i think you might appreciate the fallacy of that line of thinking   that 's an interesting example indeed   i can see the motivation from the company but what 's the burden on the municipal government   have they taken it upon themselves to collect these bikes from inappropriate places or something or is it just a general quality of life issue involving bikes obstructing movement   sounds like a classic tragedy of the commons but a lot less disruptive than others i know of    i 'll share one that you can go down the rabbit hole on if that sort of thing interests you   essentially there is a bay on the coast of mexico where there is a town called   due to some hurricane damage some time ago sea grass has been growing there and it has attracted green turtles to an area that one can simply walk into and swim with the turtles   now i 'm sure i do n't need to describe the various effects of of that situation and that 's exactly what 's happening   the problem is that the first 20 meters of is part of the commons so no privatization can be used to restrict access   add the conflicting interests of tourists tour providers hotels and the various levels of government all within the context of mexican politics and you can imagine the mess its created

there 's plenty of advice out there about how to set up a budget or track your expenses or pay yourself first this is all great advice but sometimes the hardest part is just getting in the right frugal mindset here 's a couple tricks on how i did it   put yourself through a budget fire drill if you 've never set a budget for yourself you do n't necessarily need to do that here just live as though you had lost your job and savings through some imaginary catastrophe and live on the bare minimum for at least a month treat every dollar as though you only had a few left clip coupons stop dining out eat rice and beans bike or car pool to work whatever means possible to cut costs if you 're really into it you can cancel your cable netflix wine of the month bills and see how much you really miss them this exercise will get you used to impulse buys and train you to live through an actual financial disaster there 's also a bit of a game element here in that you can shoot for a high score the difference between the monthly expenditures for your fire drill and the previous month    understand the power of compound interest sit down with excel and run some numbers for how your net worth will change long term if you saved more and paid down debt sooner it will give you some realistic sense of the power of compound interest in terms that relate to your specific situation start simple pick your top 10 recent non essential purchases and calculate how much that would be worth if you had invested that money in the stock market earning 8 over the next thirty years then visualize your present self up to your future self and stealing that much money right out of your own wallet   when i did that it really with me and made me think about how every dollar i spent on something non essential was a kick to the of poor old future me

once your sister and you make your first payments you 've paid $ and your sister has paid $ 1400 but your sister also owes rent order estimate for rent is that it 's equal to mortgage payment so that 's $ 2045 i assume that $ 2045 is actually your total payment not just your escrow payment unless i 'm misunderstanding what the term means $ 2045 is an absurdly high amount for a monthly escrow payment so your sister now has made a net capital contribution of negative $ 645 so you 're giving your sister a gift of $ each year and are the sole equity owner of the house there 's a $ gift tax exclusion and i think that both you and your husband can claim it separately so every year you could declare your sister to have $ added to her capital contribution or more if you 're willing to pay gift tax but as it stands if there are any losses from the property they will be borne exclusively by you therefore any profits should be enjoyed exclusively by you any other arrangement is you giving a gift to your sister if the price of the house were to shoot up to $ 1,000,000 after a year and you were to split the profits with your sister 50:50 and not pay a gift tax you would be violating tax law

the answer is that it depends on your bank and your creditor whomever you are paying most banks offer overdraft protection for a fee they will process the payment as if you had the money and your account will become overdrawn the next deposit you put in will be applied to the overdraft and once the account is zeroed funds will begin to become available the fees charged and whether a particular charge will go through depend on the bank a few banks will process a payment without a fee if it only happens occasionally some will hit you with a charge per debit in excess of the amount while others will charge you per day on which debit transactions were made while your account was overdrawn and still others will tack on a charge for leaving your account overdrawn for an extended period in almost all cases the for profit institutions banks will charge more than non profit institutions credit unions   watch out for banks that offer automatic overdraft transfer they 'll automatically transfer from another account including eek a credit card to cover a debit to an account with insufficient funds sounds great but the fee they charge is often close to the overdraft fee while without overdraft protection if the payment were simply denied at point of sale most banks have smartphone apps that allow for instantaneous transfer of funds for free i 've never heard of a partial payment you either have sufficient funds to cover the debit or you do n't if you do n't and you do n't have overdraft protection the bank will simply decline to pay the result of that situation depends on the exact circumstances if a utility check bounces they may try to run it again the next day or they may immediately cut your utilities and come after you for the balance at point of sale they simply wo n't give you the merchandise some places are really about pursuing hot check writers if the check does n't clear you have to pay in cash on the spot or they call the police as far as interest on debt it does n't work that way it 's a service fee otherwise it would be subject to some pretty hefty federal regulation however if you figure it as interest you 'd be amazed let 's say you bought lunch at a burger joint for $ 10 you did n't have enough in the account but it was close so the bank let it go and charged you $ 35 you have effectively inflated the cost of that meal to $ 45 a 350 instantaneous price increase or if you prefer 350 interest on that $ 10 i dunno about you but if i were paying $ 45 for one lunch it would n't be at a burger joint most banks simply will not process a check on an already overdrawn account overdraft service or otherwise they 'll hit you for the overdraft fee usually actually a fee for an nsf check and decline the payment so if you had $ 1 in your account and wrote a rent check for $ 1000 it 'd still bounce even with overdraft service

i agree 100   i am a search engine marketer with a large focus on adwords   i built my company which has $ of revenue a year in a little under 5 years using adwords as the backbone of my marketing     i have helped out lots of friends with small adwords campaigns   here are a couple examples   my dad is a high end furniture maker   he sold to for decades   they would mark his stuff up 100   so a table that he sold to them for $ 2000 they would sell for $ 4000   i got him a basic website done and started an adwords campaign which me about $ 100 a month   after a year he was no longer selling to   he was charging full retail for his work   that started 5 years ago   he was able to weather this financial crisis when other artists were closing up shop all because of adwords   i have a friend who is a fisherman   he would sell most of his fish to a wholesale buyer for a low price then take what he thought he could sell retail down to the to sell to locals   i got him a website with a call to action which said sign up to receive alerts when the fresh fish is coming in   i started an adwords campaign and ran it to only show ads to people near the   i spent about $ 10 a month   over the course of two years he built a customer list of over 200 people who get an email every time he is coming in and they call and place orders   now he knows how much he can sell retail and that 's a whole lot more than   he did before   both of these examples were game for these people and all done with minimal adwords expense   one thing you should do is do a google search from your house should be in the area your dad wants to service and search for plumber in your location   take a look at ads on the search engine results page   if you see lots of them for plumbers in your area then there will be competition and its a bit of a tougher road but totally doable   if you do n't see many ads then you are in luck and you will own it   i started with this book     it changed my life   once i because an adwords expert i felt i could do anything and i have n't been proven wrong   good luck   if you need any help let me know

outstanding principal balance is the amount you owe at any given time not including the amount of interest you need to pay as soon as possible the capitalized interest shown is consistent with an average of 13.5 months between when each dollar is borrowed and when the repayment period begins suppose you borrow the first half of the money on september 1 2017 and the second half of the money on february 1 2017 5 months later   at that point half the money has been accruing interest for 5 months   on january 1 2018 half the money accrued interest for 16 months and half the money accrued interest for 11 months   the lender now expects you to start repaying the loan with the first payment due at the end of january 2018 or the beginning of february 2018   if you make the minimum payments on time the lender expects you to make 120 monthly payments   the last monthly payment would be at the end of december or the beginning of january the lender or the website should provide details about the actual payment plan grace periods provisions for handling inability to pay due to unemployment and other terms in the united states most installment loans pretend that for purposes of calculating interest every month has 30 days even february and july   each month 1/12 of the annual percentage rate apr is charged as interest   if you do the compounding a 6.8 percent apr corresponds to 1 + 1 = percent annual percentage yield apy also the apr is understated   the 6.8 percent applies to the full balance including the loan fees even though the borrower only gets the amount minus the loan fees   the 6.8 percent rate is useful for doing calculations after the loan fees have been charged though   these calculations include the capitalized interest and the monthly payment amounts a true calculation of the apr would take the loan fees into account and give a higher number than 6.8 percent   but the corrected apr would not be useful for calculating the capitalized interest nor for calculating the monthly payment amounts

there are benefits in the melting of the arctic but the risks are much greater   now that summer is here the arctic is crowded with life are in its seas fish birds and whales are on them millions of are in their northern breeding grounds and the area is with scientists performing a new arctic between now and early september when the polar pack ice to its summer minimum they will over the daily sea ice reports of america ’s national snow and ice data centre its satellite data will show that the ice has shrunk far below the long term average this is no anomaly since the 1970s the sea ice has by around 12 each decade last year the summer minimum was m square km m square half the average for the 1960s the arctic ’s including those of ’s vast ice cap are the land is the area covered by snow in june is roughly a fifth less than in the 1960s the is shrinking alien plants birds fish and animals are creeping north atlantic and cod are coming up in arctic nets some arctic species will probably die out perhaps not since the 19th century clearance of america ’s forests has the world seen such a spectacular environmental change it is a stunning illustration of global warming the cause of the melt it also contains grave warnings of its dangers the world would be mad to ignore them less feedback please as our special report shows in detail the arctic is warming roughly twice as fast as the rest of the planet since the 1950s the lower atmosphere has warmed by a global average of 0.7 degrees ’s air has warmed by 1.5 degrees the main reason appears to be a warming effect triggered by global warming when snow or ice melt they are replaced by melt water pools land or sea as a result the arctic surface more solar heat this causes local warming therefore more melting which causes more warming and so on this positive feedback shows how even a small change to the earth ’s systems can trigger much greater ones   some scientists also see a tipping point another feared term in the in the accelerating of the sea ice the term describes the moment at which the planet shifts from one environmental state to another in this case from an arctic with summer sea ice to one without it by the end of this century perhaps much sooner there will probably be frequent summers with no sea ice at all arctic peoples have also noticed what is going on hunters are finding the sea ice too thin to bear their arctic governments are starting to see a in the melt the arctic is stocked with minerals that were largely inaccessible including an estimated 30 of reserves of natural gas and 13 of oil reserves a combination of high commodity prices proactive governments technological progress and melting ice will help bring these to market encouraged by arctic governments and dwindling reserves elsewhere oil companies are flocking north like migrating to explore the continental shelves of alaska canada norway and russia canada and russia also hope to develop their arctic shipping lanes which the melt is making accessible russia ’s northern sea route hugging the coast cuts the normal distance between europe and asia by more than a third it will help russia ’s arctic resources to asian markets and could one day be a wider boost to world trade these exciting developments carry risks however many fear for arctic cultures a canadian argues for her right to be cold others foresee conflict between arctic countries scrambling for the region ’s resources greens warn of environmental risks in developing them a big oil spill would be disastrous for fragile arctic the have gone such fears are reasonable but often exaggerated traditional arctic peoples have been changed far more by than they will be by melting ice none lives in an these days and everywhere except russia their rights have been recognised nor is conflict much of a worry the arctic is no most of it is and arctic countries have a commercial incentive to keep the peace last year russia and norway settled an old dispute over their maritime border soon they will open the border region to oil firms   watch our animation of the arctic ice shelf and the shipping routes it could unlock   the risks of pollution from water mining and oil are real yet the arctic is not unprotected it is by and large among the most regulated oil provinces its development will also be slower and more cautious than greens fear even with little sea ice the arctic will remain cold remote and therefore expensive to operate in the worry that needs to be taken most seriously is climate change itself the impact of the melting arctic may have a effect on the planet it is likely to disrupt circulation the mixing of warm tropical and cold polar waters of which the gulf stream is a part and will lead to the emission of masses of carbon dioxide and methane and thus further warming it is also raising sea levels the ice sheet has recently shed around 200 of ice a year a increase on a decade ago if the warming continues it could eventually raising the sea level by seven many of the world ’s biggest cities would be inundated long before that happened some scientists argue that the perils are so immediate that mankind should consider the atmosphere to avert them see article they may turn out to be right but there could be enormous risks involved a slower but safer approach would be to price greenhouse gas emissions preferably through a carbon tax which would encourage the adoption of cleaner technologies see article that shift would be costly but the costs of inaction are likely to be larger in the end the world is likely to get a grip on global warming the survival instinct demands it but it is likely to lose a lot of the unique arctic first that would be a terrible pity

first you should maintain a monthly expense and find out the burn rate there would be certain expenses that are annual but mandatory school fees insurance premium property taxes etc so the ideal emergency fund depending on your industry should be 3 month to 6 months plus your mandatory yearly payments more so if they come together for example most of my annual payments come out in may and i bank on the bonus payout in april to cater to this spike in expense so if i were to lose a job in march my emergency funds would be sufficient for routine expenses if i do n't provision for additional funds second you need to also figure out the reduced rate of monthly burn and ideally the emergency funds should be for 3 months of normal burn and 6 months of reduced burn

both models understand that the value of a company is the sum total of all cashflows in the future discounted back to the present they vary in their definition of cash the gordon growth model uses dividends as a proxy for cashflow under the assumption that this is the only true cash received by shareholders in theory counting cash is meaningless if there 's no eventual end game where the accumulated cash is up amongst the owners the gordon model is best used to value companies that have an established reliable dividend the company should be stable and the payout ratio high will underestimate the value of firms that consistently maintain a low payout ratio and instead accumulate cash there are multiple dcf models a firm valuation measures all cash available to both equity and debt holders a traditional equity valuation measures all cash that can be claimed by shareholders while the latter seems most intuitive and pertinent to a shareholder the former is very good at showing what a company can do regardless of their choice of capital structure a small add on to a firm valuation is the concept of eva or economic value add where the return on capital all capital both debt and equity is compared to the blended cost of capital the dcf model is more flexible optimistic than the gordon in its approach to cash the approach can be applied to many types of companies at every stage in their maturity even if they do n't pay a dividend a simplistic or single stage dcf is similar to the gordon the assumption is that the company is fully mature growing at a rate perhaps just slightly above inflation forever for younger companies a multi stage dcf can be employed where you forecast fairly confident numbers for the next 3 5 years then 3 5 years beyond that the forecast is less certain but assumed to be slowing growth and a generally maturing stabilizing company and then the steady state stage is tacked on to the end you 'll want to check out professor damodaran 's website he addresses all this and so much more and has a big pile of spreadsheets freely downloadable to get you started i also highly recommend his book investment valuation it 's the bible on the topic

i have a job and would like to buy equipment for producing music at home and it would be easier for me to pay for the equipment monthly i just want to address your contention that it would be easier to pay monthly with an interest calculation   lets say you get a credit card with a very reasonable rate of 12 and you buy $ 2,500 of equipment   a typical credit card minimum payment is interest charges + 1 of the principle you can see how this is going   you 've paid nearly $ 200 to clear about $ 100 off your principle   obviously paying the minimum payment will take forever to wipe out this debt   so you pay more or maybe you get 0 interest for a while and take advantage of that paying $ 100 per month against $ 2,500 at 12 per year will take 29 months and cost about $ 390 in interest   at $ 200 per month it 'll take 14 months and cost $ 184 in interest   also note you 'll probably get an interest rate closer to 16 or 17 it 's always easier to pay small amounts frequently than it is to pay a lot of money all at once that ease has a cost   if you 're buying the gear to start a little business or you already have a little business going and want to upgrade some gear great disciplined debt handling is a wonderful skill to have in business   if you want to start yourself in to a new hobby you should not do that with debt   if interest rates are low enough financing something can make sense   0.9 apr on a car sure 15 apr on a mixing board no   credit card interest rates are significant and really should not be with

no the stock market is not there for speculation on corporate   at its base it is there for investing in a business the point of the investment being of course to make money   a successful business earns money and that makes it valuable to its owners since that money can be distributed to them   shares of stock are pieces of business ownership and so are valuable    if you knew that the business would have profit of $ 10,000,000 every year and would distribute that to the owners of each of its 10,000,000 shares each year you would know to that each share would receive $ 1 each year   how much would such a share be worth to you   if you could instead put money in a bank and get 5 a year back to get $ 1 a year back you would have to put $ 20 into the bank   so maybe that share of stock is worth about $ 20 to you   if somebody offers to sell you such a share for $ 18 you might buy it for $ 23 maybe you pass up the offer but business is uncertain and how much profit the business will make is uncertain and will vary through time   so how much is a share of a real business worth   this is a much harder call and people use many different ways to come up with how much they should pay for a share   some people probably just think something like apple is a good company making money i 'll buy a share at whatever price it is being offered at right now   others look at every number available build models of the company and the economy and the risks all to estimate what a share might be worth more or less   there is no value for a share of a successful business so what effect does a company 's earnings have on the price of its stock   you can only say that for some of the people who might buy or sell shares higher earnings will all other thing being equal have them be willing to spend more to buy it or demand more when selling it   but how much more is not quantifiable but depends on each person 's approach to the problem   higher earnings would tend to raise the price of the stock   yet there are other factors such as people who had expected even higher earnings whose actions would tend to lower the price and people who are ok with the earnings now but suspect trouble for the business is appearing on the horizon whose actions would also tend to lower the price this is why people say that a stock 's price is determined by supply and demand

i do n't think you can really classify it as front running technically the only information that the alleged front runner in this case has over the followers is the knowledge of the trade itself knowledge of the trade may indeed be share price sensitive information for some high volume traders or those respected and with many followers but it 's not really like they ca n't know about it before everyone else parity is n't possible in this case if an company organisation i.e. the social trading platform say responsible for the details log of a trader to a following or individuals working for said company organisation were to act on the trading data before dissemination then they would be guilty of front running the alleged front runner may profit from the following of course but that 's only really occurring due to the publication of information that is share price sensitive and such information generally has to be published by law if it is by law so classified so it 's difficult to find too much fault there has to be a certain amount of consideration on the part of any trader as to who is more the fool the fool or the fool that follows them

to add to joetaxpayer 's answer the cost of providing term life insurance for one year increases with the age of the insured thus if you buy a 30-year term policy with level premiums the premium is the same for 30 years then during the earlier years you pay more than the cost to the insurance company for providing the benefit in later years you pay somewhat less than the cost of providing the insurance the excess premiums that the insurance company charged in earlier years and the earnings from investing that money covers the difference between the premium paid in later years and the true cost of providing the coverage   if after 20 years you decide that you no longer need the protection children have grown up and now have jobs etc and you cancel the policy you will have overpaid for the protection that you got the insurance company will not give you on the overpayment as an alternative you might want to consider a term life insurance policy in which the premiums increase each year or increase every 5 years and thus better approximate the actual cost to the insurance company one advantage is that you pay less in early life and pay more in later years when hopefully your income will have increased and you can afford to pay more thus you can get a policy with a larger face value 150 k for your wife and 400 k for yourself is really quite small with annual premium of $ 550 now and more in later years also if you decide to cancel the policy after 20 years you will not have overpaid for the level of coverage provided finally in addition to a policy with larger face value i recommend that you include the mortgage if any on your house in the amount that you decide is enough for your family to live on and to send the kids to college etc or get a separate term life insurance policy to cover the mortgage on your home many mortgage contracts have clauses to the effect that the entire principal owed becomes immediately due if either of the borrowers dies yes the widow or can get a replacement mortgage or prove to the lender that the monthly payments will continue as before or pay off the mortgage from that $ 150 k or $ 400 k which will leave a heck of a lot less for the family to survive on etc but in the middle of dealing with all the hassles created by a death in the family this is one headache that can be taken care of now   the advantage of including the mortgage amount in a single policy that will support the family when you are gone is that you get a bit of a break the sum of the annual premiums on ten policies for $ 100 k is more than the premiums for a single $ 1 m policy there is also the consideration that the principal owed on the mortgage declines over the years very slowly at first though and so there will be more money available for living expenses in later years alternatively consider a special term life insurance policy geared towards mortgage coverage the face value of this policy reduces each year to match the amount still due on the mortgage note that you may already have such a policy in place because the lender has insisted on you getting such a policy as a condition for issuing the loan in this case keep in mind that not only is the lender the   beneficiary of such a policy but if you bought the policy through the lender you are providing extra profit to the lender you can get a similar policy at lower premiums on the open market than the policy that your lender has so provided you   i bought mine from a source that caters to employees of nonprofit organizations and public sector employees your mileage may vary

most online high yield savings accounts are paying just above 1   that would be 1.05 for american express personal savings or 1.15 for currently depending on the length of the season you might want to work in some cd 's   six months cds can be had at 1.2 and 9 month at 1.25   so if you know you wo n't need some of your earnings for 9 months you could earn 1.25 on your money however i would proceed with caution on anything other than the high yield savings account   with your one friend having such a low emergency fund there is very little room for error   perhaps until that amount is built up into something significant it is just best to stick with the online savings of course one solution would be to find a way to create income during the off season   that will go a long way into helping one build wealth

does a good job of summarizing things   tracking the index yourself is expensive transaction costs and tedious number of transactions keeping up with the changes etc   one of the points of using an index fund is to reduce your workload   diversification is another point though that depends on the indexes that you decide to use   that said even with a relatively narrow index you diversify in that segment of the market a point i 'd like to add is that the management which occurs for an index fund is not exactly active   the decisions on which stocks to select are already made by the of the index   thus the only management that has to occur involves the trades required to mimic the index

the prime rate is the interest rate banks use amongst themselves to lend money to each other only it is used as the basis sometimes for what interest rate banks charge you   the prime rate is based loosely on the fed rate   there is a committee that meets regularly to set this and other industry interest rates i am not 100 positive the following is totally accurate the banks keep our deposits and pay us interest for doing so   they are paying us interest because they take yours mine and everybody elses deposits as a large lump sum and invest that money   sometimes as business loans sometimes as mortgages and sometimes as credit card the banks have a book of business that will be exactly how much credit they have extended to everybody   but they do not keep that amount of cash in the vaults only some smaller percentage of that large amount   when i use my credit card and they need to transfer money to amazon.com if they do n't happen to have enough cash that day they will just borrow from another bank that does and the interest rate they pay to do so is the prime rate   since they are paying interest on the money they borrow to pay the debt i charged because they told me my credit was worth so much they charge me a little bit more than that hence your credit card or mortgage 's apr being based on the prime rate i think that is what they do   if i am wrong leave a comment and i will update or the mods can

short answer if you bought the car as opposed to leasing it there is no one to turn it in to   the reality of cars and car loans is this the value of a car tends to fall rapidly the first couple of years then more slowly after that like it might lose $ 2000 the first year $ 1000 the second $ 500 the third etc what you owe on a loan falls slowly at first because a lot of your payment is going to interest but then as time goes on you pay off the loan faster and faster so you may pay off $ 1000 the first year $ 1100 the second etc i 'm just making up numbers depends on the value of the car and the term and interest rate of the loan but that 's the general idea combining these two things means that in the first few years after you buy a car if you had a small or no down payment you might well owe more on the car than it is worth that 's just how the numbers work out if you keep the car long enough eventually you hit a point where it is worth more than you owe keep it until you 've paid off the loan and you owe $ 0 but the car is still worth something exactly how much depending on its condition and other factors if you just use the car and pay off the loan i.e. if you do n't sell the car or refinance the loan or some such then this does n't matter very much you make your loan payments and you have use of the car what difference does the book value of the car at any given moment matter to you if the idea of owing more than the car is worth bothers you in principle then in the future you could make a larger down payment or make extra payments on the loan the first couple of years to knock the principle down faster that 's about the only things you can do well you could buy with cash so you owe zero and the car is always worth more than you owe but given that you are where you are if you just keep the car and keep driving it and keep paying the loan then you are exactly where you thought you would be when you bought the car right i mean the day you bought the car you presumably were n't thinking that at some future date you could refinance at a lower rate how would you know so i think the easy answer is do n't sweat it just enjoy the car and pay your bills

so let me get this straight anti tax warriors who argue from a right wing libertarian stance that financial liberty is the most important form of liberty want to hold the taxpayers hostage to force the bloated federal government to fund a wall on the southern border of the united states that comprises the territory of multiple state governments without allowing for those state governments and their citizens the liberty to decide for themselves nor advocating for private capitalist interests to fund the wall out of their own pockets via private land ownership along the border which is the hallmark of their entire economic theory

not that they 're necessarily lacking although i would n't be surprised if they are relative to the developed world i 'm not going to get into a country by country analysis as there are 40 + in africa and all with different laws but more that the governments institutions like the courts for example there are so corrupt and terrible at what they do that nobody respects them and therefore property rights exist in name only contrast that with the us and canada europe singapore hong kong etc where property rights have a bastion of strong institutions defending them and there is a large part of the difference look at zimbabwe where mugabe literally stole land from the white farmers and how they 're doing versus sa where the government generally respects property rights although the has had some huge issues recently and how relatively well sa is doing    better yet take it a step further out and look at what happened when nationalized the oil industry in it 's no surprise that foreign companies do n't want to invest there and investors do n't want to buy their debt leading to higher interest premiums when the government is literally stealing property from ppl entities via nationalization

note that many funds just track indexes in that case you essentially do n't have to worry about the fund manager making bad decisions in general the statistics are very clear that you want to avoid any actively managed fund there are many funds that are good all in one investments if you are in canada for example canadian couch potato recommends the tangerine investment funds the fees are a little high but if you do n't have a huge investment one of these funds would be a good choice and appropriate for 100 of your investment if you have a larger investment to the point that tangerine 's mer scares you a little you still may well look at a three or four fund or etf portfolio you may choose to use an actively managed fund even though you know there 's virtually no chance it 'll beat a fund that just tracks an index long term in that case i 'd recommend only a small portion of your portfolio to this fund many people suggest speculating with no more than 10 of your combined investment note that other people are more positive on actively managed funds

in the us it is perfectly legal to execute what you 've described however since you seem to be bullish on the stock why sell how do you know the price will continue downwards aside from the philosophical reasoning there can be significant downside to selling shares when you 're expecting to repurchase them in the near future i.e. you will lose your cost basis date which determines whether or not your trade is short term less than 1 year or long term this cost basis term will begin once you repurchase the shares if you are trying to tax harvest and match against some short term gains tax loss harvesting prior to long term treatment may be suitable otherwise your reasoning and reconsider the sale at all since you are bullish remember if you could pick where stock prices are headed in the short term with any degree of certainty you are literally one of a kind on this planet   in addition do remember that in a tax deferred account e.g. ira the term of your trade is typically meaningless but your philosophical reasoning for selling should still be examined

the right answer is use it but use it responsibly the point of the credit report is to prove to potential creditors that you are a responsible person who pays their bills on time if you do n't use the new credit card you ca n't prove that however of course there is a limit if you max out the card you have only proven that you are irresponsible with credit try to stay around 50 of your max limit more is but never go over 89 always pay your bills on time always not just this new credit card but all bills the best way to ruin your credit is not paying your bills even if you are having a dispute with a company pay the bill anyway to save your credit and then dispute the situation and try to get your money back prove to creditors that they can trust you and you 'll have an excellent credit score

the statement can be true but is n't a general rule crashes and recessions are two different things a crash is when the market rapidly something when prices are out of equilibrium whether it be stocks a commodity or even a service   when the internet was new nobody knew how to design webpages so web page designers were in huge demand and insane price premiums i literally had college classmates billing real companies $ for marginal web skills eventually the market up and that industry collapsed overnight another example of a crash from the supply point of view was the discovery of silver in the western us during the 19th century these discoveries increased the supply of the commodity to the point that silver coin eroded in value and devastated small family farms who mostly dealt in silver currency recessions are often linked to crashes but you do n't need a crash to have a recession basically during a recession trade and industrial activity drop the economy operates in cycles and the euphoria and over optimistic projections of a growing or booming economy lead to periods of reduced growth where the economy essentially itself capital is a if not the key element of the economic cycle it 's a catalyst that makes things happen debt is one form of capital it 's not good not bad generally cheap capital ie low interest rates bring economic growth why if i can borrow at 4 i can then perform some sort of economic activity bake bread make computers assemble cars etc that will earn myself 6 8 or 10 on the dollar when interest rates go up economic activity slows because the higher cost of credit increases the risk of losing money on an investment the downside of cheap capital is that risk taking gets too easy and you can run into situations like the $ 2 m ranch houses in california the downside of expensive tight capital is that it gets harder for businesses to operate and economic activity slows down the effects of either extreme cascade and snowball

it looks like with the sale of your current home you have enough liquidity to obtain credit on the best terms without tapping your wife 's ira the biggest factor to consider is the deduction on mortgage interest which reduces the effective interest on your mortgage significantly particularly as you jump into a higher tax bracket along these lines deferred retirement savings should have a higher priority than paying down the mortgage or your student loans student loans should probably be your biggest priority to pay down with the mortgage deduction a 4 rate becomes effectively a 3.4 rate if you are in the 15 bracket but as low as 2.6 effective rate if you are in the 35 bracket both of these are lower than the 3.5 rate that you can get on the student loans after refinancing   this also assumes you are n't hit with the amt this is probably worth the cost of a quick consultation with a tax professional to go over these options and how they affect your taxes

my understanding is that losses are first deductible against any capital gains you may have then against your regular income up to $ 3,000 per year   if you still have a loss after that the loss may be carried over to offset capital gains or income in subsequent years as you suspect a short term capital loss is deductible against short term capital gains and long term losses are deductible against long term gains   so taking the loss now might be beneficial from a tax perspective   i say might because there are a couple scenarios in which it either may not matter or actually be detrimental if you do n't have any short term capital gains this year but you have long term capital gains you would have to use the short term loss to offset the long term gain before you could apply it to ordinary income   so in that situation you lose out on the difference between the long term tax rate 15 and your ordinary income rate potentially higher if you keep the stock and sell it for a long term loss next year but you only have short term capital gains or no capital gains next year then you may use the long term loss to offset your short term gains first or your ordinary income    clear as mud the whole mess is outlined in irs publication 550 finally if you still think the stock is good but just want to take the tax loss you can sell the stock now to realize the loss then re buy it in 30 days   this is called tax loss harvesting   the 30 day delay is an irs requirement for being allowed to realize the loss

i think anyone who is seriously contemplating a real estate purchase needs to sit down and read some history in particular the accounts of the 1930 's and what happened to people who jumped into real estate in the midst of the depression     if you 're not aware by and large what happened is they lost their asses the property continues to fall in value and then they 're on the hooked for increasing taxes as local and state governments raise taxes in a desperate attempt to plug budget holes   and of course interest rates are headed nowhere but up   that will inversely impact your home 's value given that most people buy homes exactly like you 're thinking about them not how much the home is worth but rather how much payment can you afford as rates go up you can afford less   a contemporary piece which has lots of accounts of this over multiple years is the great depression a the great depression a diary   imho real estate is to be avoided until well after a bottom has been reached and that 's imho still some years away   someone coming out of college now should away as much money as possible live as cheaply as possible and stay far far away from thoughts of gee it sure would be a good idea to go drop half a million dollars on a house when i 'm making $   while you 're predicting raises and employment neither is safe to take for granted   indeed many folks thought that in the late 00 's and got absolutely destroyed financially as a result

that argument is an argument for investing generally not peer to peer lending per se and the argument as phrased thus you should invest your money at a peer to peer loan platform is a false dichotomy that said as soon as one is investing as opposed to just getting a small but guaranteed return then risk comes into play   in that sense any savings account is fundamentally different from any investment and in that reading the two should n't be compared as different approaches to investing   peer to peer lending as an investment could be compared with stock market investing for one

some aspect is legal some in grey area   please maintain proper documentation generally for amounts in question there is less scrutiny from income tax buying on behalf of your friends first there is a limit of 250,000 usd so fine on this point second is only licensed dealers can participate in fx in your case it can appear that you are acting as dealer   on getting money back this looks like gift and if it 's more than 50,000 in a year it is taxable of course if you establish that it was convenience then no issues so you need good amount of documentation plus if you are getting paid after few months tax can treat this as personal loan and arrive at deemed interest   edits there is no guideline as to what the income tax will ask you if there is a scrutiny one would need to have paper work a letter from friend requesting you to purchase things you would have to keep a record of items ordered and match it with credit card statement proof that the goods were delivered to his address proof of equivalent credit entry from your friend into your bank statement reason why your friend could not do this himself i.e. what is stopping him from getting a international debit credit card   so if you think you can convince that its convenience yes else taxes

rebalancing your portfolio does n't have to include selling   you could simply adjust your buying to keep your portfolio in balance   if you portfolio has shifted from 50 stocks and 50 bonds to 75 stocks and 25 bonds you can just only use new savings to buy bonds until you are back at 50 50 remember to take into account taxes if you are thinking of selling to rebalance in taxable accounts the goal of rebalancing is to keep your exposures the way that you want them   assuming that you had a good reason to have a portfolio of 50 stocks and 50 bonds you probably want to keep your portfolio similar in the future   if you end up with a portfolio of 75 stocks and 25 bonds due to stock market fluctuations the exposure and the risk return profile of your portfolio will have changed and it 's probably not something that you want you do n't want to rebalance just for the sake of rebalancing either   there can be costs to rebalancing taxes transaction fees etc and these are n't always worth the effort   that 's why you do n't need to rebalance every month or if your portfolio has shifted from 50/50 to i take a look at my portfolio once a year and adjust my automated investments so that by the end of the next year i 'm back to the ratio i want

if you are careful you do n't need to spend much more than the cruise price   the cruises i 've been on they biggest extra was soda and alcohol mainly wine with dinner   if you are fine drinking water or iced tea there is no need for that food extras like ice cream at the pool may be an extra charge as well the way it works is that your room key acts like a credit card and gets charged to your room   its easy to run up a big bill if you are n't paying attention so you may want to keep track of it as you go along   you can also go to the office at any time and find out your current account generally the cruise automatically charges a certain amount per day for tips for your room and dining room attendants   you are expected to tip for spa services another extra charge and shore excursion guides   shore excursions vary greatly depending on what you are doing   maybe $ 50-$100 per person for a bus tour to much more than that for things like diving or fishing   you can also either book tours yourself or just get off and wander around   it depends where you are going   many times the ships dock far away from anything you might want to see   there are generally taxis or to the tourist places but that is another charge   internet is generally charged by hour and quite expensive several dollars per hour   part of the attraction for me is completely so i generally do n't bother   on older ships you probably are limited to the internet lounge   some of the newer ships have wi fi in the state rooms as well the drinks on board are n't cheap but not outrageous either   probably similar to an upscale club   they also have a daily drink special which is cheaper   technically you are n't allowed to bring your own alcohol on board   if you buy something in a port you need to check it with them   this policy may vary by cruise line but has been true on the princess and costa cruises i 've been on   that said as long as you are low key they probably wo n't know or care

i 'll start with the bottom line below the line i 'll address the specific issues becoming a us tax resident is a very serious decision that has significant consequences for any non american with > $ 0 in assets when it involves cross border business interests it becomes even more significant especially if switzerland is involved the us has driven at least one iconic swiss financial institution out of business for us tax residents from the irs fincen so in a nutshell you need to learn and be afraid of the following and many more the best thing for you would be to find a good us tax adviser there are several large us tax firms in the uk handling the us expats there go to one of those and get a proper assessment of all your risks and get a proper advice you can get burnt really hard if you do n't prepare and plan properly now here 's that bottom line q will i have to submit the accounts for the swiss business even    though i m not on the payroll and the business makes hardly any    profit each year i can of course get our accounts each year but    they will be in swiss german that 's actually not a trivial question depending on the ownership structure and your legal status within the company all the company 's bank accounts may be reportable on fbar see link above you may also be required to file form q will i need to have this translated is there any format procedure    to this will it have to be translated by my swiss accountants and    if so which parts of the documentation need to be translated all us forms are in english if you 're required to provide supporting documentation during audit or if the form instructions require it with filing you 'll need to translate it and have the translation certified depending on what you need your accountant will guide you i was told that if i sell the business and property after i a    that i will be liable to 15 tax of the profit i 'd made   q is this correct no you will be liable to pay income tax the rate of the tax depends on the kind of property and the period you held it for it may be 15 it may be 39 depends on a lot of factors it may also be 0 in some cases i    also understand that any tax paid on selling in switzerland will be    deducted from the 15 may be may be not what you 're talking about is called foreign tax credit the rules for calculating the credit are not exactly trivial and from my personal experience you can most definitely end up being paying tax in both the us and switzerland without the ability to utilize the credit in full again talk to your tax adviser ahead of time to plan things in the most optimal way for you i will effectively have all the paperwork for this as we 'll need to    do the same in switzerland but again it will be in swiss german q would this be a problem if its presented in swiss german of course if you need to present it again most likely only in case of audit you 'll have to have a translation translating stuff is not a problem usually costs $ per page depending on complexity unless a lot of money involved i doubt you 'll need to translate more than balance sheet bank statement i know this is a very unique set of questions so if you can shed any    light on the matter it would be greatly appreciated not unique at all you 're not the first and not the last to to the us however you need to understand that the issue is very complex taxes are complex everywhere but especially so in the us i suggest you not do anything before talking to a us licensed cpa ea whose practice is to work with the eu uk expats to the us or us expats to the uk eu

most countries with income tax including the usa design their withholding system so that in straightforward cases tax is withheld from each month 's paycheck on an annualized basis tax for a month is calculated on the assumption that you will keep earning the same monthly amount for the rest of the year and the withholding is set so that the tax is spread evenly across the year another way of putting that is that in practice you only get the tax brackets allocated proportionately throughout the year so up till the end of august you 'll only have been assigned of the $ bracket and so on so if your income does n't change and your general tax affairs do n't change your paycheck also should n't change if your income is irregular or changes during the year then things can get more complicated as other answers have noted withholdings are calculated according to tables that normally just take into account that specific month 's income there are various possible changes to your tax affairs that might cause the withholdings to change for example there 'd be an impact from any change in your contributions to tax advantaged things like health insurance or retirement health or education savings you might also use form w-4 to change your withholdings yourself note that even with a regular income that does n't change through the year you might find yourself either owing money or being owed a refund when you file your taxes after the end of the year it 's worth making sure that your w-4 accurately records the allowances you are entitled to to minimize or eliminate this adjustment

a futures contract is based upon a particular delivery date   in the case of a stock index futures contract is a cash settled futures contract based upon the stock index value at a particular point in time i.e. this is when the final settlement is determined in your example the s&p 500 spx is a price return index that is it is not affected by dividends and therefore dividends are not incorporated into the index value   dividends will affect the price of the constituent stocks not necessarily by the same amount as the dividend so they do have influence on the stock index value   since the dividends are known ahead of time or at least can be estimated this has already been factored into the futures price by the market in terms of the impact of a dividend by aapl aapl is 3.6 of the index   apple pays out dividends 4 times a year currently paying out $ dividends   assuming the market is otherwise steady and aapl drops by $ due to the dividend and apple is priced at around $ 105 this would result in a drop in the index of or around 0.35 points interesting fact   there are some futures contracts that are based upon total return indexes such as the german dax and the above logic would need to be reversed

first check out some of the answers on this question oversimplify it for me the correct order of investing when you have determined that you are ready to invest for retirement there are two things you need to consider the investment and the account   these are separate items the investment is what makes your money grow the type of account provides tax advantages and restrictions   generally these can be considered separately for the most part you can do any type of investment in any account briefly here is an overview of some of the main options in your situation the roth ira is what i would recommend this grows tax free and if you need the funds for some reason you can get out what you put in without penalty you can invest up to $ 5500 in your roth ira each year in addition to the above reasons which are true for anybody a roth ira would be especially beneficial for you for three reasons for someone that is closer in age to retirement and in a higher tax bracket now a roth ira is less attractive than it is for you inside your roth ira there are lots of choices you can invest in stocks bonds mutual funds which are simply collections of stocks and bonds bank accounts precious metals and many other things discussing all of these investments in one answer is too broad but my recommendation is this if you are investing for retirement you should be investing in the stock market however picking individual stocks is too risky you need to be diversified in a lot of stocks stock mutual funds are a great way to invest in the stock market   there are lots of different types of stock mutual funds with different strategies and expenses associated with them managed funds actively buy and sell different stocks inside them but have high expenses to pay the managers index funds buy and hold a list of stocks and have very low expenses the conventional wisdom is that in general index funds perform better than managed funds when you take the expenses into account   i hope this overview and these recommendations were helpful if you have any specific questions about any of these types of accounts or investments feel free to ask another question

simplest way to answer this is that on margin one is using borrowed assets and thus there are strings that come with doing that thus if the amount of equity left gets too low the broker has a legal obligation to close the position which can be selling purchased shares or buying back borrowed shares depending on if this is a long or short position respectively investopedia has an example that they walk through as the call is where you are asked to either put in more money to the account or the position may be closed because the broker wants their money back what is maintenance margin a maintenance margin is the required    amount of securities an investor must hold in his account if he either    purchases shares on margin or if he sells shares short if an    investor 's margin balance falls below the set maintenance margin the    investor would then need to contribute additional funds to the account    or liquidate stocks in the account to bring the account back to the    initial margin requirement this request is known as a margin call as discussed previously the federal reserve board sets the initial    margin requirement currently at 50 the federal reserve board also    sets the maintenance margin the maintenance margin the amount of    equity an investor needs to hold in his account if he buys stock on    margin or sells shares short is 25 keep in mind however that this    25 level is the minimum level set brokerage firms can increase but    not decrease this level as they desire example determining when a margin call would occur assume that an    investor had purchased 500 shares of 's stock the shares were    trading at $ 50 when the transaction was executed the initial margin    requirement on the account was 70 and the maintenance margin is 30    assume no transaction costs determine the price at which the investor    will receive a margin call answer calculate the price as follows $ 50 1- = $ 1 0.30 a margin call would be received when the price of 's stock fell    below $ per share at that time the investor would either need    to deposit additional funds or liquidate shares to satisfy the initial    margin requirement most people do n't want margin calls but stocks may move in unexpected ways and this is where there are mechanisms to limit losses especially for the brokerage firm that wants to make as much money as possible cancel what trade no the broker will close the position if the requirement is n't kept basically think of this as a way for the broker to get their money back if necessary while following federal rules this would be selling in a long position or buying in a short sale situation the margin investor walks through an example where an e mail would be sent and if the requirement is n't met then the position gets exited as per the law

no it is not normal the normal process is that the money is transferred to your account with out issue   this would be an exception   that does not mean that there is anything to worry about   it could be that the transaction met some criteria that triggered closer examination or it could be that yours is just one randomly being reviewed   and it could just be that your husbands partner misunderstood or lied    step 1 would be contact the bank and find out what is going on and if there is any action you need to take   assuming that the bank confirms the status and the amount is significant enough i would probably give my lawyer a heads up of what is going on   if homeland security is involved there is a reasonable chance that you will need that representation anyway so getting the lawyer involved early might save you a headache in the end   the lawyer is probably the only person that will be able to get any answers for your anyway from comments my husband is a consultant that works for another company as a    consultant that company received a contract from a government south    of the us free trade approved that government first wired the    overall government contract to the company account in that originating    country then the funds were wired to the us counterpart company    then then consultants gets paid it sounds like the contract is not your normal business to business international contract   so normal goes out the window there   when you start getting foreign governments involved things get lets use the word interesting   if the contract involves anything with military or restricted technology applications even if they are not directly military then hsa wants to make sure that no one is circumventing export restrictions   with out knowing more specifics it is difficult to guess whether or not there is anything for your husband to worry about   the bottom line for him is that he does not have his money so he should keep that in mind when delivering services to the prime contractor

anything is negotiable   clearly in the current draft of the contract the company is n't going to calculate or withhold taxes on your behalf that is your responsibility but if you want to calculate taxes yourself and break out the fees you are receiving into several buckets on the invoice the company might agree they might have to run it past their legal department first i do n't see how that helps anything it just divides the single fee into two pieces with the same overall total as points out it appears that the company expects you to cover your expenses from within your charges thus it 's up to you to decide the appropriate fees to charge and you are assuming the risk that you have estimated your expenses incorrectly if you want the company to pay you a fee plus reimburse your expenses you will need to craft that into the contract it 's not clear what kind of expenses you need to be covered and sometimes companies will not agree to them for specific tax rule questions applicable to your locale you should consult your tax adviser

there is not necessarily a need to prevent what you describe turning insurance on before high risk situations they just need to calculate the premiums accordingly for example if an insurance needs to take for insuring your house against flood and a flood happens in average every 10 years if you just insure the two weeks in the ten years where heavy rain is predicted you might pay 500 $ for the two weeks the total is the same for the insurance they get 500 $ and you get insurance for the dangerous period in the contrary if a flooding unexpectedly happens outside your two weeks they are out from the home owners view 500 $ for two weeks when heavy rains and floods are expected and nothing otherwise sounds pretty good compared to 50 $ every year it is the same of course but psychology works that way

remember that in most news outlets journalists do not get to pick the titles of their articles   that 's up to the editor   so even though the article was primarily about etfs the reporter made the mistake of including some tangential references to mutual funds   the editor then saw that the article talked about etfs and mutual funds and knowing even less about the subject matter than the reporter but recognizing that more readers eyeballs would be attracted to a headline about mutual funds than to a headline about etfs went with the shocking headline about the former in any case as you already pointed out etfs need to know their value throughout the day as do the investors in that etf   even momentary outages of price sources can be disastrous although mutual funds do not generally make transactions throughout the day and fund investors are not typically interested in the fund 's nav more than once per day the fund managers do n't just sit around all day doing nothing and then press a couple buttons before the market closes   they do watch their nav very closely during the day and think very carefully about which buttons to press at the end of the day   if their source of stock price data goes offline then they 're impacted almost as severely as if less visibly than an etf asking yahoo for prices seems straightforward but 1 you get what you pay for and 2 these fund companies are built on massive automated that expect to receive their data from a certain source in a certain way at a certain time   and they pay a lot of money in order to be able to expect that   it would be quite difficult to just feed in manual data although in the end i suspect some of these companies did just that   either they fell back to a secondary data supplier or they manually constructed datasets for their programs to consume

first of all dilip 's answer explains well how the business deductions generally work for most big expenses you depreciate it however in some cases you need to capitalize it which is another accounting method when you capitalize your expense it becomes part of the basis of the product you 're creating since you 're an engineer this might be relevant for you talk to your tax adviser how exactly you deduct depreciate capitalize things and what expense goes which way depends greatly on the laws and jurisdictions even in the us different states have different laws and the irs and state laws do n't have to conform unfortunately for example the limitations on sec 179 deduction in 2010 2011 were 20 times higher on federal level than in the state of california this could have lead to cases where you fully deducted your expense on your federal tax return but need to continue and depreciate it on your state return or vice versa good tax adviser is crucial to avoid or manage these cases

you would appear to be a swing trader like myself i have been trading futures and futures options for 29 years and have both made and lost a lot of money in that time my trades last hours to days to at most a few weeks from my experience the most important skills are 1 money management keeping trade size small in relation to total capital i typically risk 2 3 of my capital on a trade so a loss is fairly immaterial 2 risk management limit your loss on every trade either by using stop orders options or a combination of these 2 3 emotional discipline be prepared to exit a position or reverse from long to short or short to long   on a moment 's notice the market does n't care where you entered or whether you make or lose money do n't let your or the news influence your decisions but follow the market 4 methodology discipline test your analysis trade entry method to ensure that it is objective and has a reasonably good probability of success then stick with it variation will inevitably lead to indecision or emotional reactions 5 flexibility consider trading anything which can make you a profit but ensure that there is a lot of liquidity i trade 30 different futures markets as well as various option writing strategies in these markets   feel free to reach out if you want to discuss further i have about 500 yes 500 trading e books as well on every trading subject you can think of

my original point to this post was that this asset bubble is playing out in slow motion just like others have in the past this of a recovery will bump along the bottom for years if history is a guide eg 1934    this is long term pain for the average middle class person underwater mortgages stagnating wages and here in dc overpriced houses completely out of line with median incomes    it 's been a recovery for the wealthiest in society but everyone else is sinking or water economic indicators are not a reflection of the average middle class persons struggle take a look at what said last week to a group of nobel winners    you are telling me that no one got a heloc on the speculative value of their house between 2000 2007

the most common usage of interest rate swaps is by corporates who issue bonds   most us investors e.g. insurance companies amp pensions want fixed rate bonds so that they know what their interest income will be for the life of the investment   many financial issuers prefer to have their liabilities be floating rate so that they will benefit if the fed keep interest rates at zero for a long time   so the financial issuer issues the fixed rate bond the insurance company buys it and the issuer converts the obligation to floating with an interest rate swap

what do you mean not coming back it seems to be coming back to 1990 prices but not fast enough i 'd love to see it come back to 1970 prices   i do n't understand it when people say that housing is not improving when prices go lower when gas is cheaper as far as my budget is concerned it 's improving when food is cheaper it 's also improving of course this is assuming it 's really cheaper and not some artifact of unhealthy war or simply costing fewer us dollars due to fiscal manipulation housing improves when prices go down because it improves my chances of being able to afford one   if lower prices are caused by demographics student debt and no jobs i say it ca n't come soon enough i want it

i have n't used transfer wise so ca n't speak to their price    regardless of what service you use what you should look for is whether the conversion price is greater than how much you think the currency 's price will move    example if your bank charges on any currency exchange you should ask yourself whether you think the pound or whatever currency will drop by within whatever time frame you 've set for yourself if not you 're better off keeping your money in that currency    i checked out their site and it does look like transferwise is pretty inexpensive around in transaction costs so again ask yourself whether you think the pound will drop by 1 in your time frame does n't seem like a lot but also consider that currencies typically fluctuate by just a few of a percentage per day    i know you 're probably looking for an answer like pound will drop sell it all but i do n't know enough about currencies to be giving advice there i would definitely pay attention to brexit negotiations though as that will be one of the biggest influences on both currencies for quite some time

just sticking to equities if you are investing directly in a share stock depending on various factors you may have picked up a winner or to your a loser say you just have rs 10,000/- to invest which stock would you buy    if you do n't know then it ’s better to buy a mutual fund now if you say you would buy a few of everything then even to purchase say rs worth of each stock in the nifty index 50 companies you would require at least an investment of when you are investing directly you always have to buy in whole numbers i.e. you ca n't buy 1/2 share or 1.6 share of some stock    the way mutual funds work is they take 10,000 from 250 people and invest in all the stocks there are fund managers who 's job is to pick good stocks however even they can not predict winners all the time normally a few of the picks become great winners most are average and a few are losers this means that overall your returns are average vs if you had picked the winning stock the essential difference between you investing on your own and via mutual funds are    it is good to begin with a mutual fund and once you start understanding the stocks better you can invest directly into the equities the same logic holds true for debt as well

all transactions within an ira are irrelevant as far as the taxation of the   distributions from the ira are concerned you can only take cash from an ira and a cash distribution from a traditional ira is taxable as ordinary income same as interest from a bank say without the advantage of any of the special tax rates for long term capital gains or qualified dividends even if that cash was generated within the ira from sales of stock etc in short just as with what is alleged to occur with respect to las vegas what happens within the ira stays within the ira note some ira custodians are willing to make a distribution of stock or mutual fund shares to you so that ownership of the 100 shares of ge say that you hold within your ira is transferred to you in your personal non ira brokerage account but as far as the irs is concerned your ira custodian sold the stock as the closing price on the day of the distribution gave you the cash and you promptly bought the 100 shares at the closing price in your personal brokerage account with the cash that you received from the ira it is just that your custodian saved the transaction fees involved in selling 100 shares of ge stock inside the ira and you saved the transaction fee for buying 100 shares of ge stock in your personal brokerage account your basis in the 100 shares of ge stock is the cash that you received as a distribution from the ira so that when you sell the shares at some future time your capital gains or losses will be with respect to this basis the capital gains that occurred within the ira when the shares were sold by your ira custodian remain within the ira and you do n't get to pay taxes on that at capital gains rates that being said i would like to add to what told you in his answer your mother passed away in 2011 and you are now 60 years old so 54 or 55 in 2011 it is likely that your mother was over 70.5 years old when she passed away and so she likely had started taking required minimum distributions from her ira before her death so you should have been taking rmds from the inherited ira starting with year 2012 the rmd for 2011 if not taken already by your mother before    she passed away should have been taken by her estate and distributed to her heirs in accordance with her will or if she died in accordance with state law and/or probate court there would    not have been any 10 penalty tax due on the rmds taken by you on the grounds that you were not 59.5 years old as yet that rule applies to owners your mom in this case and not to beneficiaries you in this case so have you taken the rmds for 2012 2016 or were you waiting to turn 59.5 before taking distributions in the mistaken belief that you would have to pay a 10 penalty for early   the penalty for not taking a rmd is 50 of the amount not distributed yes 50 if you did n't take rmds from the inherited ira for years 2012 2016 i recommend that you consult a cpa with expertise in tax law ask the cpa if he she is an enrolled agent with the irs enrolled agents have to pass an exam administered by the irs to show that they really understand tax law and are not just blowing smoke and can represent you in front of the irs in cases of audit etc

you 're mostly correct although i think you 're missing something essential about no arbitrage versus an arbitrage argument   black scholes makes an arbitrage argument which is that the value of an option should be the same as any portfolio that has identical cash flows and this is generally a sound argument   notice however that bs is ultimately an equilibrium model it tells you the correct price of an option if the assumptions of bs hold and does n't necessarily match observed market prices   a no arbitrage condition or model deliberately incorporates observed prices or yields or whatever into the model so that there can not be an arbitrage opportunity implied by the model   this comes up a lot in term structure of interest rate problems where equilibrium models like or cox ross wo n't perfectly reproduce the current observed term structure and so imply an arbitrage opportunity   no arbitrage models like hull white specifically match the model 's term structure to observed yields prices so that there is no arbitrage opportunity between the observed term structure and your model of it   it 's important to note that this will still allow for arbitrage involving bonds that are not part of the observed term structure   as for equivalent martingale measures you might think about it more generally   the process involves changing the probability distribution from the actual which is hard to use for pricing to a different one that 's easier to use but will result in the same prices this is nearly always a risk neutral probability   you can think of equivalent martingale   pricing as asking how would this security behave and be priced in a world that is completely risk neutral and then making an argument that the prices are in fact equivalent   edit grammar

gt upfront investment cost to create a contemporary business is challenging today and this is before a firm anticipation of the cost of labour declining in developed nations    yes today   but i think part of this future is where these costs come down due to advanced technology   look at 3d printing as an example   it 's new and expensive now but when these things are $ 99 at staples and capable of printing high quality plastic parts you essentially give every single person the ability to buy a cheap factory for his home   this helps greatly distribute and the means of production and possibly even get around copyright and with open source like   this is how i see the future in the world described in the video   cheap advanced technology that replaces human labor   when the cost of a labor robot is in the price range of 90 of the public you wo n't have to work   every human will have robots working on their behalf   i think the video warns of a future where these robots exist but they 're only owned by the rich   i think that 's the wrong prediction   that is n't how technology works   they even go over that in the video   how computers every year get cheaper and more powerful   same goes with 3d printing they get more powerful and cheaper by the day   same will go for labor robots   so it 's not that every person is going to have to operate their own small business though it will probably increase entrepreneurship which is a great thing it just means that each individual will have the means to produce without actually laboring

assuming that the will that the money to your son did not stipulate any restrictions or set up a trust to hold the money until your son turns 25 or something like that i do n't think you have much choice except to put the money in a utma account which of course can be invested in whatever   the trustee which could be you or you and your wife jointly decides   note not a ugma account since the money is not a gift you also do n't have any option except to turn the account over to your son when he turns eighteen the point is the investment can be in anything as long as the account is registered as a utma account   but do remember also that your son is entitled to sue you for breach of fiduciary duty if you do n't take good care of the money so that blowing it all in risky investments is also not a good idea if you are worried about taxes and your son 's income being taxed at your rate one way of deferring the issue is to buy us savings bonds the interest can be deferred from taxation until the bonds are redeemed edit added in response to joetaxpayer 's comments but a better strategy is to declare the accrued interest each year as unearned income of the child on the kiddie tax form that is part of your tax return and pay the tax if any that results to ease your mind or conscience think of the tax that you pay on your child 's behalf as a gift to your child in any case there will likely not be much tax due since the first $ 950 of unearned   income of a child is tax free and the next $ 950 taxed at 10 then when the bonds are cashed in the interest that accrued and was taxed in earlier years can be deducted   from the interest cash in price minus purchase price that you or your son will be told is the interest that the bonds earned of course if kiddie tax is not a concern and it should n't be given the amount available for investment an even better strategy is to set up the utma account(s in long term investments in low cost index funds or etfs as joetaxpayer suggests and pay the tax if any as it comes due

i 'm surprised people do n't bring this up more often if you add together not just our sovereign debt but public and private debt plus our contingent liabilities meaning fha student loans fannie mae freddie mac aig etc   that totals over $ 100 trillion dollars more than we could ever pay back meaning literally there is no amount of growth and taxes that could ever pay this money back cite my sources do a google search of james lecture it 's in the first few minutes   the reason you need to add all that together is because the economy ca n't grow if nobody has any money for investment etc there is n't much home equity left after the housing crisis retirement plans are n't holding as much etc there would n't be an easy way to grow this economy that 's why we have currency wars competitive devaluations to me we 're already over the cliff i do n't see us heading back but i 'm not saying that means we 're going to collapse just we 'll need to go back to some sort of standard where our currency is backed by something i.e. commodities or gold or something and there are going to be a lot of losses in the near term meaning i want out of dollars   combined with our lazy entitled generation do n't tell me creating some website where you can order artistic candy on a stick is going to save our economy we need to produce and innovate again to lower our trade deficit and so people actually bring their capital here and dwindling resources i 'd say it 's already game over the pieces just need to move into place

shares often come associated with a set of rights such as ability to vote in the outcome of the company some shares do not have this right however with your ability to vote in the outcome of the company you could help dictate that the company paid dividends at a point in time or many other varieties of outcomes also if there were any liquidity events due to demand of the shares this is typically at a much higher price than the shares are now when the company is private closely held

do n't put money in things that you do n't understand etfs wo n't kill you ignorance will the leveraged ultra long short etfs hold swaps that are essentially bets on the daily performance of the market there is no guarantee that they will perform as designed at all and they frequently do not iirc in most cases you should n't even be holding these things overnight there are n't any hidden fees but derivative risk can wipe out portions of the portfolio and since the main asset in an ultra long short etf are swaps you 're also subject to counterparty risk if the investment bank the fund made its bet with can not meet it 's obligation you 're   may lost alot of money you need to read the prospectus carefully the re strategy the fund seeks daily investment results before fees and expenses that correspond to twice the inverse of the daily performance of the index the fund does not seek to achieve its stated investment objective over a period of time greater than a single day the prospectus re risk because of daily rebalancing and the compounding of each day ’s return over time the return of the fund for periods longer than a single day will be the result of each day ’s returns compounded over the period which will very likely differ from twice the inverse of the return of the index over the same period a fund will lose money if the index performance is flat over time and it is possible that the fund will lose money over time even if the index ’s performance decreases as a result of daily rebalancing the index ’s volatility and the effects of compounding see principal risks if you want to hedge your investments over a longer period of time you should look at more traditional strategies like options if you do n't have the money to make an option strategy work you probably ca n't afford to speculate with leveraged etfs either

well the simple answer is that i reject the assumptions of demand side economics i do n't believe that the velocity of money matters because money is n't real it 's just a proxy for actual value which is derived from the subjective perception of people   the trouble with looking at data is that it 's all observational data not experimental so a substantial amount of judgement needs to be employed in interpreting causation and with economics being a politically charged discipline there 's significant risk of bias in making those judgements particularly if they are being made in an ideologically homogeneous setting such as much of present day academia   i look at economics from a lens rather than an one which is why i do n't take studies as seriously as some others do

your question is a complex one because knowledge of the investor 's beliefs about the market is required   for almost any quantitative portfolio one must have a good estimate of the expected return vector and covariance matrix of the assets in question   the expected return vector in particular is far from   no one agrees on it and there is no way to know who is right and who is wrong in a world satisfying the conditions of the capm you can bypass this problem because the main implication of the capm is that the market weights are optimal   in that case the answer to your question is that you should determine the market weights of the various assets and use those along with saving in a risk free account or borrowing depending on your risk tolerance   this portfolio has the added benefit that you do n't need to rebalance much the weights in your portfolio adjust at the same rate as the market weights any portfolio that has something besides this also includes some notion of expected return aside from capm fair pricing   the question for you then is whether you have such a notion   if you do you can mix your information with the market weights to come up with a portfolio   this is what the black method does for example get the expected return vector implied by market weights and the covariance matrix mix with your expected return vector then use mean variance optimization to come up with your final weights

3 reasons i can think of i once worked for a bank and when credit scoring for loans if you had been approved by different institutions you were given a better score so if you held a visa and mastercard as opposed to two visa cards your credit score would go higher more than 6 cards though looked suspicious and your score would take a big hit having more than card has helped me when getting special offers multiple times from some websites where it was limited to one per customer though most just used your address or email account if you owed $ 1000 in total which you ca n't pay off in one go it is better to have that split across two cards you would be paying interest on $ 500 on each card but when you have one card paid off the interest you would be paying on the other would be based on the original debt to that one card of $ 500 not $ 1000 i hope that makes sense

there 's no free lunch here are some positions that should be economically equivalent same risk and reward in a theoretically pure universe with no regulations or transaction costs you 're proposing to buy the call if you look at the equivalent stock plus protective put you can quickly see the catch the protective put is expensive that same expense is embedded in the call option see put call parity on wikipedia for more you could easily pay 10 a year or more for the protection which could easily eat up most of your returns if you consider that average returns on a stock index might be about 10 nominal not real another way to look at it is that buying the long call and selling a put which is a synthetic long position in the stock would give you the put premium so by not selling the put you should be worse off than owning the stock worse than the synthetic long by about the value of the put premium or yet another way to look at it is that you 're repeatedly paying time value on the long call option as you roll it in practical world instead of theory world i think you 'd probably get a noticeable hit to returns just from bid ask and commissions even without the cost of the protection options cost more a bit some practical complications of equivalency between different combinations of options and underlying are anyway roughly speaking any position without the downside risk is going to have an annual loss built in due to the cost of the protection occasionally the options market can do something weird due to supply demand or liquidity issues but mostly the parity relationships hold or hold closely enough that you ca n't profit once expenses are considered update one note i 'm talking about vanilla options as traded in the us here i guess there are some somewhat different products elsewhere i 'm not sure exactly which derivatives you mean all derivatives have a cost though or nobody would take the other side of the trade

stock b could be considered to be more risky because it seems to be more volatile sharp rises on large volume increases can easily be followed by sharp drops or by further rises in the start of a new uptrend   however if both a and b are trading on low volume in general they can both be more on the risky side due to having relatively low liquidity especially if you buy a large order compared to the average daily volume but just looking at the criteria you have included in your question is not enough to determine which stock is riskier than the other and you should look at this criteria in combination with other indicators and information about each stock to obtain a more complete picture

first there are mlm businesses that are legitimate and are not ponzi schemes i actually work with one i will not name it lest i give the impression of trying to sell here one thing i learned was how to respond when a prospect raises objections related to the actual scams which are abundant the answer being to point out and you mentioned this yourself that in an illegitimate scheme there is no actual product being offered the only thing money is ever spent on is the expectation of a future profit ask your friend would you buy the product this company sells at the price they ask if there were not a financial opportunity attached to it if not how can you expect anyone else to buy it from you there are only 3 ways he can respond to this question he can realize that you 're right and get out now he can change the subject to the concept of making money by climbing the ranks and earning off of a salesforce in which case it 's time to educate him on ponzi or he can claim to be able to sell something he does n't believe in in which case you should run fat far away if he does indicate that he would be a customer even without the chance to sell the product then offer him the chance to prove it by giving you one sales pitch on the condition that he is not allowed to breathe a word about joining the business do him the courtesy of listening with an open mind and decide for yourself whether you could ever be a customer if the possibility exists even if not today he has found one of the few legitimate mlm companies and you should not try to stop him if not you 'll have to determine whether it 's because the product just is n't for you or because it 's inherently worthless and whether you should encourage or discourage your friend going forward

yes asset inflation is still inflation    economy = consumption + investment + government net exports    so you increase the money supply to the wealthy what happens not in increase in consumption their basic needs are met so they invest it everyone invests their extra money what happens price goes up for stock and real estate while the yield on those investments goes down you have people buying really expensive assets with great leverage because their is no alternative so inflation has increased you are just to poor to notice it    we also live on a deflationary world production increases while demand remains constant so what happens price goes down and marginal companies go out of business leading to more consolidation lower prices due to greater market share more companies can not compete and the cycle continues    the only inflation comes from overseas where you have growing economies here we have almost no population or wage growth so that is deflationary

with reference to the uk structured deposits should not be confused with structured products   structured deposits are often quite simple deposit accounts you place your money into what is essentially a deposit account and are therefore guaranteed not to lose your capital as with any other deposit account the attraction is that you could earn more than you would in a normal deposit account often around double due to indirect exposure to the markets another benefit is that structured deposits can form part of your annual cash isa allowance so the returns can be tax free these products are popular with those who have savings which they are happy to deposit away for between 3 and 6 years and are looking for better rates of return than standard cash isas or savings accounts the main drawback is that you may not receive anything other than your original deposit that poses a minimal risk if your savings are earning less than 1 currently   see my article at for a more rounded overview of the structured deposits

fundamentally these are my opinions i am expressing even though i try to remain as factual as possible and have significantly modified my opinion over the years as a result of apparently factual information it 's still technically just opinion   gt my view is not so much that labour and finance capital returns need to be balanced although that is probably a great thing to aim for but that creation of wealth capital needs to be intrinsically linked with the creation of real value   by the way when i say capital it 's not generally just finance capital but all operational capital goods which includes factories and all means of production a certain amount of financing is needed to keep it operational and more is needed to increase the means of production to grow overall wealth   have you ever heard of the 's wiki basically you ca n't really push this ratio very far if consumer demand dries up then production will get cut back to meat demand overproduction of stuff they ca n't sell is not what they are in business for likewise is demand exceeds the capacity of production to keep up it pushes inflation which drives up cost to reduce demand so this ratio remains very nearly a constant even though this ratio was at historic highs in the 1970s and historic lows today   what happens when you artificially dry up labor returns through excessive supply side policies is that demand for production falls hence production is cut back to meet that demand this of course reduces employment and increases job competition which puts more downward on wages exacerbating the situation only once labor cost fall low enough it effectively subsidizes inefficient production methods which limits the falling wages at a reduced overall productivity note that this is under present circumstances not those of the 1970s this adaptive matching between production and demand insures that the ratio is never too far off of its historical averages even if productivity is driven well below its potential   more or less the same effect occurs for the opposite reason if capital return ratios are too low though with opposite effects on the inflation rate and such when consumer demand is high enough capital will pay whatever labor cost is required to meet that demand so long as it remains profitable enough i.e. they get a reasonable ratio of the market return consumer demand with sufficient capital profit margins is what drives full employment not the sheer volume of capital returns as present policies essentially assume yet you ca n't have a broad based consumer demand to drive employment without sufficient labor returns as those labor returns is what finances that demand needed to drive employment   so not only does labour and capital returns need to be balanced economics does not allow it to be unbalanced at least for long even if balancing requires the economy to shrink productivity to fall etc that is exactly what it will do to remain balanced no choice given no matter how draconian the regulations to force it this is true under purely economies of the past pure communism and even this is why i am a capitalist because nature gives me no choice but acceptance of that fact does not require me to have an ounce of tolerance for cronyism   the only thing we can do is not push this balance in either direction to destructive levels because destruction is what will happen for the balance to remain because so much of our productive capacity has been in productivity gains since the 1990s and wages and demand have as yet not matched these productivity gains we have a huge latent wealth capacity that continues to grow as we fail to take advantage of it so far our supply side policies have n't so much destroyed wealth and productivity rather it has prevented us from seeing the potential gains from the latent productivity growth from technologies over the few decades     the last part you mention about wealth capital needing to be intrinsically linked with the creation of real value you are absolute 100 entirely correct perhaps even more than you know ever heard of planned obsolescence or the light bulb light bulb that link is a documentary on the issue that will make you mad we could almost certainly pay a flat 90 tax rate on everything and still not come close to what this issue cost us that 's not the only means this issue imposes cost but it is extreme    of course just because an appliance still works does n't mean people will not replace it with newer better models but the trash pile insures there is a much more limited secondary market for poorer people consumption debt cost is also a far bigger issue than people recognize debt to finance capital goods for production is fine as this feeds productivity and wealth in a manner that itself even as the debt is paid consumption debt is an entirely different beast creating a significant section of the population that feeds on peoples income without producing a thing only to let allow people to consume income they have n't earned yet   this generally falls under the category of rent seeking behavior yeah the lack real value creation turns my stomach that people will knowingly spend money on temporary non essential and such is all fine and dandy but renting our base appliances for a certain number of uses is outrageous in my book

gt we were talking about net taxation not some ratio of gross income on a per family basis    i was your claim that the top 1 pay 50 of all taxes   gt the bottom 40 of american are net beneficiaries of taxes anyway   i disagree   welfare programs in the us total a little over $ just above 5 of the federal budget   meanwhile military spending is about 25 if you count the va   military spending is much more valuable to the rich since they can earn the contracts and have much more to defend

bad question   even people choosing a 401k strategy have to choose risk over reward   but looking at this simply if you take a 10 year chart of gold you will not find any other stock or commodity that could have been invested in that would have provided you with the same results with as little volatility over this time period

in the usa there are two ways this situation can be treated first if your short position was held less than 45 days you have to when preparing the taxes add the amount of dividend back to the purchase price of the stock that 's called adjusting the basis example short at $ 10 covered at $ 8 but during this time stock paid a $ 1 dividend it is beneficial for you to add that $ 1 back to $ 8 so your stock purchase basis is $ 9 and your profit is also $ 1 inside software depending what you use there are options to click on adjust the basis or if not than do it manually specifically for those shares and add a note for tax second option is to have that payment in lieu paid deducted as investment but that option is only available if you hold the shorts for more than 45 days and itemize your deductions hope that helps

is my financial status ok if not how can i improve it based on the fact that you have $ 100 k in the bank and no debts your situation is ok you do n't have credit card debt or an underwater car loan though the fact you are thinking about a car and a home shows you have started to put some thought into planning is now a right time for me to see a financial advisor   the fact that you do n't mention retirement savings 401 k ira or pension means that you have not planned for retirement and you need to do so the espp can be a part of a plan but if that is you only investment you are focusing too much of your current and future income on one source of income is it worthy it can be you want to avoid working with a planner that makes money only if you invest in specific investments they suggest you want to find a planner that takes a fixed fee for developing the plan and only provides advice on types of investments how would she he help me they will look at where you are where you can quickly make adjustments and where you want to go over the next year decade and lifetime then they will provide guidance on those steps you should follow   if your situation changes in the future because of marriage or kids you can then revisit with a planner and make changes

when you 're selling something through a provider like craig 's list or newspapers the only thing that may limit your choices is the provider they may refuse your post if it 's against their rules or the law but luckily they usually do n't limit or enforce certain payment choices   these private business providers have the right to do so if they want you do n't need to be their customer they may state their terms for using the service and even refuse service before any payment is made   the fun part is that you may do so as well just remember to state your terms in your post so the prospective buyers are aware of them i 've found it best to put payment and delivery terms in separate lines so that they are easily noticeable for example nice victorian with gold only used once signed by the original author comes with a certificate of authenticity no delivery only cash payments

assuming you are in the usa i would recommend making this a gift   you can gift someone up to per year without paying a gift tax additionally you can gift someone up to but it is a one time deal tied to inheritance tax    you can have a general expectation with the that they will return the money with some interest on some schedule   you can even write that payment schedule down   but for legal tax and personal relationship reasons you should both consider all these payments gifts if you think failure to repay will put a strain on your relationship then you should n't make the loan   if not then the payments in both directions really are gifts as a gift legal documentation can be really minimal really only the has to document anything and that is just on their tax return even then i think it is only necessary if you exceed the annual gift limit i would however recommend documenting any interest rates or payment schedules for personal reasons being a gift these numbers are just guidelines but at least you wo n't find yourself arguing about whether or not the guidelines are being met depending on how large the amounts involved are you might want to spread the load over several people to stay under that annual limit but the limit is per tax year so you could do half now and half in january

comparing retirement savings to ordinary investment is not an apples to apples comparison retirement savings are savings for retirement if you want to invest in things now and live off of or reinvest those earnings then retirement accounts are not the right vehicle    that said here are some benefits of the main types of retirement accounts benefits of a 401(k benefits of a ira benefits of a roth 401(k benefits of a roth ira the benefits above are not exhaustive there are other benefits such as using a roth ira for higher ed expenses etc but those are the highlights if you have a plan for how you hope to use the money now rather than later does it make sense to hold onto it if your plan is meant to provide income at retirement and earns returns higher than the returns plus matches and tax benefits you get from retirement accounts then yes it may make more sense but those benefits are generally very hard to beat   plus having the money locked away in an account that is painful to tap can be a good thing you 're less tempted to use that money for foolish decisions which everyone makes at some point

no and just a caution about that super low risk suppose that you lived during the late 70s and early 80s when savers in the united states could get interest rates over 10 for savings   you put your money into an account in 1980 knowing that in five years you 'll have made a solid amount of interest   except that you might have been smarter to convert your money to aud and save in that currency because it would have moved from in value to 1.43 in value in principal only not interest when i look at the 's bank interest it appears they were also paying double digit interest to savers now i get that this may not be the answer that you want to see because it means that if the interest rates were higher in the us for savers they might be higher elsewhere too and it also means that what may appear to be a super low risk could actually be a high risk

does it make sense to calculate the irr based on the outstanding value of the project or just use the cash flows paid out let 's assume i invest x amount every year for 49 years and the investment grows at a constant rate but i do not get dividends before which will be constant 50 years later i assume that the value of the investment will decline as it pays dividend and will be worth 0 when the dividends stop    do i calculate the irr as the negative streams of outflows for the first 49 years and then positive cash inflows from 50 year in the future if i apply this method the irr will be very low almost equal to the annual expected return   or based on the current value of the project for each year combined with cash outflows for the first 49 years and dividends from year 50 if i apply this method the irr will be a lot higher than the first method

stock prices are indeed proportional to supply and demand the greater the demand for a stock the greater the price if they are would this mean that stock prices completely depend on how the public feels thinks about the stock instead of what it is actually worth this is a question people have argued for decades literature in behavioral finance suggests that investors are not rational and thus markets are subject to wild fluctuation based on investor sentiment the efficient market theory emt argues that the stock market is efficient and that a stock 's price is an accurate reflection of its underlying or intrinsic value this philosophy took birth with harry 's efficient frontier and eugene fama is generally seen as the champion of emt in the 1960 's and onward   most investors today would agree that the markets are not perfectly efficient and that a stock 's price does not always reflect its value the renowned professor benjamin graham once wrote in the short run the market is a voting machine but in the long run it is a weighing machine this suggests that prices in the short term are mainly influenced by how people feel about the stock while in the long run the price reflects what it 's actually worth for example people are really big fans of tech stocks right now which suggests why linkedin stock has such a high share price despite its modest earnings relative to valuation people feel really good about it and the price might sustain if linkedin becomes more and more profitable but it 's also possible that their results wo n't be absolutely stellar so the stock price will fall until it reflects the company 's fundamentals

i had a similar situation when i was in college the difference was that the dealer agreed to finance and the bank they used wanted a higher interest rate from me because of my limited credit history the dealer asked for a rate 5 percentage points higher than what they put on the paperwork i told them that i would not pay that and i dropped the car off at the lot with a letter the sale they were n't happy about that and eventually offered me financing at my original rate with a $ 1000 discount from the previously agreed upon purchase price what i learned through that experience is that i did n't do a good enough job of negotiating the original price i would suggest that your son stop answering phone calls from the dealership for at least 1 week and drive the car as much as possible in that time if the dealer has cashed the check then that will be the end of it he owes nothing further if the dealer has not cashed the check he should ask whether they prefer to keep the check or if they want the car with 1000 miles on the odometer this only works if your son keeps his nerve and is willing to walk away from the car

while i agree with this i also think a tiny fraction of that mentality comes from the simple notion that you can find a desk job that pays great so why work a hard manual job that also pays great    take the average worker and tell them you can do manual labor for $ or you can do a desk job for $ most people will pick the desk job for obvious reasons so it 's not just the belief that certain jobs are below them although that is most of it but the simple notion that we were sold over the last 30 years that desk workers in cubicle farms can make as much money as someone working a labor manual job so go for the desk job

there are markets in which there is n't a lot of choice to enable downward price pressure like drugs and healthcare     also consolidation always results in reduced consumer choice and sooner or later increased prices   that 's a big part of why they do it    in healthcare in the us there is huge consolidation among specialty practices in order to force insurance companies to pay more   e.g every and in a 30 mile radius from here was bought by the same practice so now the are forced to pay the rate this practice dictates   no small practices have started here in the past 20 years all the new mds just join the big existing practice in order to fill any increased demand   these practices often pick and choose which insurers they will work with and they do n't take medicare   but this is one example of how markets get and harmful if not regulated there are many others

the title of your question is quite different then the content   the term rat race was coined in the 70 's and refers to the endless cycle of working hard to consume more   fortunately it is very easy not to participate in the cycle and probably will lead to more happiness   just because one works does not mean they are participating in the rat race and i would recommend the following when i think of rat race i picture a a bumper to bumper of people struggling to get to work   for others it might be different but that kind of rat race is easily avoided by the multitude of remote work opportunities   some jobs allow you to work anywhere in the world avoiding the rugged consumerism also helps avoid the feelings of being a rat on the wheel   sure one can like nice things but do we have to have everything that madison ave is trying to sell us   no   pick some nice things and pay cash debt especially consumer debt causes a person in effect to work for a bank   avoiding debt will remove those feelings saving and investing also helps avoid those feelings   there is profound satisfaction in watching ones account balances grow   once you see that your investment earnings can outpace your expenses and then your salary you really feel like you are getting ahead       above all else giving is a paramount and often overlooked part of a person 's financial life   it causes one to be humble and recognize that most people in this world are less fortunate that us   it avoids provide that justifies purchases that we can not afford    so yea you can avoid the rat race and still work

if you 're asking this question you probably are n't ready to be buying individual stock shares and may not be ready to be investing in the market at all   short term in the stock market is gambling pure and simple and gambling against professionals at that you can reduce your risk if you spend the amount of time and effort the pros do on it but if you are n't ready to accept losses you should n't be playing and if you are n't willing to bet it all on a single throw of the dice you should diversify and accept lower potential gain in exchange for lower risk standard advice index funds   the way an investor as opposed to a gambler deals with a stock price dropping or surging upward or not doing anything is to say that 's interesting given where it is now do i expect it to go up or down from here and do i think i have someplace to put the money that will do better if you believe the stock will gain value from here holding it may make more sense than taking your losses   specific example the mortgage crisis market crash of a few years ago people who sold because stock prices were dropping and they were scared or whose finances forced them to sell during the down period were hurt badly those of us who were invested for the long term and could afford to leave the money in the market or who were brave contrarian enough to see it as an opportunity to buy at a better price came out relatively unscathed all i have lost was two years of growth so you made your bet now you have to decide do you really want to buy high sell low and take the loss as a learning experience or do you want to wait and see whether you can sell not so low if you do n't know enough about the company to make a fairly rational decision on that front you probably should n't have bought its stock

i suggest rolling it over to the 401(k with your new employer   particularly if they match any percentage of your contribution it would be in your interest to take as much of that money as possible when it comes to borrowing money from your 401(k it looks like the issues mentioned only apply if you do n't pay back the money   the reasonable argument against taking money out of your 401(k to buy a home is that it leaves a dent in your retirement nest egg and its earning power during key earning years   on the plus side for borrowing from your 401(k it 's very low interest and it 's interest you 're paying back to yourself over a 5-year period   at its current value the most you could borrow from your 401(k is $   if you 're fortunate in where you live that could be most or all of the downpayment in my own experience my wife borrowed against her 401(k balance for the earnest money when we purchased a new home   fortunately for us an investor snapped up my previous home within 4 days of us listing it so she was able to pay back her loan in full right away

if you have maxed out your ira contribution for 2017 already and it all went into your roth ira then until the 2017 tax day in april 2018 you can remove any part of this contribution and the earnings from your roth ira without any tax consequences or penalties if you discover in early 2018 that you are not eligible or only partially eligible to contribute to a roth ira then of course you must remove all or part of your 2017 contributions and the earnings from your roth ira by the 2017 tax day in april 2018 indeed if you have filed for an extension of time to submit your 2017 tax return then you have until the extended due date to make the withdrawal as 's answer points out for 2017 you and withdraw and re contribute as many times as you like though if you push this idea to excess with the same ira custodian the custodian may start charging fees   note that irs publication 590b says in the roth ira section withdrawals of contributions by due date    if you withdraw contributions including any net earnings on the contributions by the due date of your return for the year in which you made the contribution the contributions are treated as if you never made them if you have an extension of time to file your return you can withdraw the contributions and earnings by the extended due date the withdrawal of contributions is tax free but you must include the earnings on the contributions in income for the year in which you made the contributions now if in the middle of all these transactions you need to take a distribution from your roth ira during 2017 say because you have a cash flow problem then it makes a lot of sense to first withdraw all your 2017 contributions and the earnings if more money is needed than you can take a distribution from your roth ira what the distribution consists of is described in great detail in publication 590b and you might have to pay a tax penalty for a   premature distribution depending on how much the distribution is the first dollars coming are assumed to be previous contributions in the order in which you made them and these are tax free and penalty free after that the rollover and conversion amounts start to come out and are penalized if they have not spent 5 years in the ira etc but you can put the money back into your roth ira within 60 days and avoid penalties   important notes regarding rollover transactions

the auction market is where investors such you and me as well as market makers buy and sell securities   the auction markets operate with the familiar bid ask pricing that you see on financial pages such as google and yahoo   the market makers are institutions that are there to provide liquidity so that investors can easily buy and sell shares at a fair price market makers need to have on hand a suitable supply of shares to meet investor demands   when market makers feel the need to either increase or decrease their supply of a particular security quickly they turn to the dealer market in order to participate in a dealer market you must be designated a market maker   as noted already market makers are dedicated to providing liquidity for the auction market in certain securities and therefore require that they have on hand a suitable supply of those securities which they support   for example if a market maker for apple shares is low on their supply of apple shares then will go the dealer market to purchase more apple shares   conversely if they are holding what they feel are too many apple shares they will go to the dealer market to sell apple shares   the dealer market does operate on a bid ask basis contrary to your stated understanding the bid ask prices quoted on the dealer market are more or less identical to those on the auction market except the quote sizes will be generally much larger this is the case because otherwise why would a market maker offer to sell shares to another market maker at a price well below what they could themselves sell them for in the auction market   and similarly with buy orders   if market makers are generally holding low quantities of a particular security this will drive up the price in both the dealer market and the auction market similarly if market makers are generally holding too much of a particular security this may drive down prices on both the auction market and the dealer market

your goals are excellent i really admire your thoughts and plans and i hold you in high esteem good credit is indeed an important thing to have and starting young is the smart idea with respect to this i see that you have as a goal the purchase of a home indeed another fine ambition wow you are a different breed from what i normally encounter on the internet that 's for sure since this wo n't happen overnight i would encourage you to think about another option at this point in your life you have what few people have options and you have lots of them the option i would like to suggest you consider is the debt free life this does not mean life without a credit card nor does it mean living with ones parents all their days in its simplest form it means that you do n't owe anybody anything today an adapted form of that with the reality of leases and so on is that you have more immediate cash in the bank than you have contractual responsibilities to pay others e.g. if the rent on a place is x and the lease is 12 months then you do n't sign until you have in the bank   that 's the idea if there is anything good that these past 10 years of recession and financial disasters have provided us as a nation it is a clear picture presented to our young people that a house is not a guaranteed way to riches indeed i just learned this week of another couple forced out by foreclosure again yes in the 1970s and 1980s the formula which anyone could follow was to take a mortgage on a single family house just about any house in any community and ten years later double your money while during those ten years paying about the same and in a few years actually less amount of money as you would for an apartment with about half the space those days were then not now and i seriously doubt that i will ever see them again in my lifetime you might at your age one day in the mean time i would like to suggest that you think about that word options again something that you have that i do n't if your mind is made up for certain that a house is the one and only thing you want okay this does not apply during this time of building your credit we 're talking more than a year i would like to encourage you to look at some of the other options that are out there waiting for you such as i also encourage you to take a calculator and a spreadsheet i would be surprised if there is no freeware out there to do this with a few clicks and compare the past 30 years of various investments for example it is especially educational if you can see line charts with the ups and downs along the way one last thing about the stock market you have an option i love that word when people your age are actually thinking called dollar cost averaging if you are not aware of this concept just ask and i will edit this post although i 'm confident it has been explained by others far better than myself on this very site hit just about any solid stock market investment plain old mutual fund even with a load and it will still work and i believe you 'll see what i 'm trying to get across still yes you need a roof and a young person should clearly plan on leaving parents in a healthy and happy way so again if the house is the one and only goal then go for it kid kid if you 're still under 18 all the best do remember that you will be fixing the pipes not the maintenance guy

what you 're describing is a non deductible traditional ira   that is what happens when your employer 401 k or your high income from using a traditional ira the normal way    yes non deductible traditional iras are stupid    now let 's be clear on the mechanism behind the difference   there 's an of tax law that the same money ca n't be taxed twice   this is baked so deep into tax law that it often is n't even specified particularly   the irs is not allowed to impose tax on money already taxed i.e. the original contribution on an nd trad ira   so this is not a new kind of ira it is simply a trad ira with an   but then some say so are deductible traditional iras when compared to the roth    the real power of an nd trad ira is that it can be converted to roth at all income levels   this is called the roth backdoor   it combines three factors contribute to an nd trad ira stick it in a money market sweep fund and a week later convert to roth pay taxes on the 17 cents of growth in the sweep fund since the rest was already taxed   the net effect is to work the same as a roth contribution not tax deductible becomes a roth and is not taxed on distribution    if you already have traditional ira money that you contributed that was n't taxed this really screws things up   because you ca n't segment or lifo your ira money the irs considers it one huge bucket and requires you draw in proportion eek suppose you contribute $ 5000 to an ira in a non deductible mode   but you also have a different ira funded with pretax money that now has $ 45,000    as far as irs is concerned you have one $ 50,000 ira and only $ 5000 10 is post tax    you convert $ 5000 to roth and irs says 90 of that money is taxable since it 's the same pool of money   you owe taxes on all of it less the $ 500 fraction that was pre taxed and $ 4500 of already taxed ira remains in the account   the math gets totally out of hand after just a couple of conversions    your best bet is to convert the whole at one time and to avoid a monstrous tax hit do this in a gap year

this is almost a question in financial engineering first i will note that a discussion of the greeks is well presented at these measures are first second and higher order derivatives or rate of change comparisons for information that is generally instantaneous bear with me for example the most popular delta compares prices of an option or other derived asset to the underlying asset price the reason we are able to do all this cool analysis is because the the value of the underlying and derived assets have a direct instantaneous relationship on each other because beta is calculated over a large period of time and because each time slice covered contributes equally to the aggregate then the difference in beta would really just be showing two pieces of information summarizing those two pieces of information into delta beta would not be useful to me for further discussion please see specifically look at the huge difference in calculation of ge 's beta using end of month returns versus calculation using day before end of month returns

i think you are making this more complicated that it has to be   in the end you will end up with a car that you paid x and is worth y. your numbers are a bit hard to follow   hopefully i got this right i am no accountant this is how i would figure the deal the payments made are irrelevant   the downpayment is irrelevant as it is still a reduction in net worth    your current car has a asset value of <   that should make anyone pause a bit    in order to get into this new car you will have to finance the shortfall on the current car the price of the vehicle the immediate depreciation say 7,000   in the end you will have a car worth 38 k and owe   so you will have a asset value of <   obviously a much worse situation   to do this car deal it would cost the person of net worth the day the deal was done   as time on it would be more as the reduction in debt is unlikely to keep up with the depreciation additionally the new car purchase screen shows a payment of $ if you bought the car with zero down   except you do n't have zero down you have down   making the car payment higher i with months   so rather than having a hit to your cash flow of $ for 69 more months you would have a payment of about $ 1000 for 84 months if you could obtain the interest rate of 3.5 those are the two things i would focus on is the reduction in net worth and the cash flow liability    i understand you are trying to get a feel for things but there are two things that make this very unrealistic   the first is financing   it is unlikely that financing could be obtained with this deal and if it could this would be considered a sub prime loan   however perhaps a relative could finance the deal secondly there is no way even a moderately financially responsible spouse would approve this deal   that is provided there were not assets like a few million if that is the case why not just write a check

i 'm not certain if you can get a debit card with it but if you have a pnc in your area they have a special kind of account designed around teaching financial literacy to children i 'm not sure if you can get a debit card for the child or not but the custodian gets one i believe and the child gets a special online login to manage the money so if you do n't mind the name issue it might be worth looking into if you do n't have pnc maybe one of the banks in your area have a similar program
