if your sole proprietorship losses exceed all other sources of taxable income then you have what 's called a net operating loss nol you will have the option to carry back and amend a return you filed in the last 2 years where you owed tax or you can carry forward the losses and decrease your taxes in a future year up to 20 years in the future for more information see the irs links for nol note it 's important to make sure you file the nol correctly so i 'd advise speaking with an accountant especially if the loss is greater than the cost of the accountant

gt you 're the one arguing for a change away from the status quo here to something that not only is entirely untested but requires everyone to do it at once and everyone to think just like you do for it to work properly it 's nothing but hypotheticals yet you 're saying the burden of proof is on me to prove that your hypothetical scenarios wo n't work   i do n't have to prove anything when i 'm advocating for not being a part of your system i am in no way advocating that you be forced into mine i 'm not advocating any positive action towards you nor anyone else simply arguing against the status quo does n't place a burden of proof upon me   gt that 's not a thing you can do you ca n't prove a negative   then do n't make that claim easy as that i laid out how the market could deal with a court system and you into making unsupported claims when we get back to what does make sense we can have productive conversation it 's not productive to use baseless conjecture and unsupported claims   gt all i can do is say look around at all the free markets and populations we have now living in perfect harmony with each other and the environment oh wait they do n't exist because they do n't work in the real world   wrong it does not follow that because something does not exist that it does not work   gt any advantage is going to be used to the competition with until you have a monopoly quasi state   you have no evidence to support this why are you reverting to this nonsense   gt   it relies on the population being informed in and believing in the system enough to make a conscious effort to not buy the cheaper goods at the store with the bad business practices or potentially drive further to a different store if it 's the store doing the bad practice   no it does not this is a straw man a voluntary society does n't preclude the possibility of people buying bad food or something like that it does n't even preclude the possibility of third party assurances to prevent bad food it just does n't have a built in monopoly on assurance services that you have to use in order to buy sell   gt so you 're saying there can never be a truly free market then   no people buy and sell freely all of the time ever bought something from craigslist ebay silk road i 'd say those are pretty much free markets   gt you had little kids getting their arms ripped off by textile looms for fucks sake people working 14 hour days but it made more money than working in the fields so worth right   you 're conveniently leaving out how kids worked people all day and still starved to death as the alternative up until industrialization allowed a better quality of life it 's not like they could have just passed a fucking law and mandated a 40 hour week and instantly had prosperity it was because they did grind their way through the industrial revolution that we 're able to live lives of leisure and prosperity if you think that government action can get people out of poverty by decree then tell it to the third world countries that are still developing i 'm sure they 'd be all ears   gt because the pooling of vast resources for disaster relief is something that states do   that they do it does n't mean that it could n't happen without the state on a voluntary basis the funding for all of these programs combined is easily less than what a quarter of the government 's budget if the people who made this same objection put their money where their mouth is there would be no shortage of funding people from the left and the right alike claim that they want these things so which is it are you telling me that there are just millions and millions of people who virtue signal about humanitarian efforts   gt this is my point neither you nor i have any evidence to base this off rather than a tendency for people to be utter bastards to each other looking at history you 're that if all governments in a puff of smoke there would n't be huge conflict in the resulting power vacuum   actually i do n't think that immediately destroying governments will create the best outcomes as that usually happens violently and results in someone wanting to fill the roles performed by government instead i think that based upon history individuals are less likely to be violent when they are n't acting on behalf of governments and they can and will find alternatives to the state that will replace it over time if they are not violently stopped here are some examples   1 i would rather be entirely left alone by the state police agents and allowed to use my own private security i would not be taxed for state agents and would instead pay out of pocket this would likely lower the cost since they would be interested in preventing losses rather than busting people for parking tickets speeding tickets drug offenses civil asset forfeiture etc would you not agree that this is a superior model 2 i would rather have private large scale defense since it would not be involved in international wars of aggression i would not be taxed and would instead pay out of pocket all else equal this would be less expensive and less dangerous since resources would only be used for defense would you not agree that this is a superior model 3 i would rather have a private system of healthcare rather than a government one being free to not pay into medicare medicaid this along with eliminating certificates of need monopolization by the ama eliminating ip protections and the like would lower the cost more than nationalization would and would also allow providers to better align with my preferences would you not agree that this is a superior system   gt yeah good one there were n't any anarchists in a position to do any of that great straw man   actually the purported left wing anarchists in spain did carry out what is called the red terror i put that in quotes because i do not agree with their methods or their ideology change must be done through the market not through violence   gt why is the burden of proof on the statists it 's the anarchists who are arguing for the change in the status quo   because appeals to tradition are not rational arguments and anarchists are not advocating for positive action against you statists are arguing that others be subject to their government if a person is trying to argue against his own he would n't have the burden of proof simply because he had been enslaved for some time   gt you 're the one making the claim that it would be a better system here with nothing to back it up   on the contrary i do have something to back it up the market responds better to consumer preferences on an individual level than governments do if you disagree with me on healthcare and want a collective system the market can put you with other like minded individuals and me with those who share my views a state can not   gt why do we have states right now   you 're conflating violence and efficiency that 's like saying if kids have such great ideas why are they still living under their parent 's rule it 's not because the ideas are bad it 's because the parents are keeping them there states do n't compete they rule with violence the notion of creating a market for violence to stop rule by violence is contradictory

i do n't know how taxes work in israel but i imagine it is relatively similar to taxes in the us in the us you need to pay taxes on investment earnings when you sell them or in this case trade them for something of value the amount that would typically would be taxed on would be the difference between how much you paid for the currency and the value of the item you traded it for   in theory there should n't be any difference in trading bitcoins versus dollars or euros reality is that they are rather weird and i do n't know what category they would fall into are they a currency or a collectors item i think this is all rather hypothetical because there is no way for any government to track digital currencies and any taxes paid would be based on the honor system   i am not an account and the preceding was not tax advice

there has been a lot of research on the effects of stock splits some studies have concluded that however note that i these are averages over large samples and does not say it will work on every split and ii most of the research is a bit dated and more recent papers have often struggled to find any significant performance impact after 1990 possibly because the effect has been well documented and the arbitrage no longer exists this document the existing research on the subject although it seems to miss some of the more recent papers more practically if you pay a commission per share you will pay more commissions after the split than before bottom line do n't it and focus on other criteria to decide when whether to invest

you can move money in and out of the business at will just keep track of every transaction ideally you 'd use an accounting software like quickbooks or similar create a capital contributions account and every time you put money into the business checking account record it as a capital contribution likewise if you take money out of the business it comes from your capital accounts you can create a separate capital distributions account in your accounting software or just use a single account for contributions and distributions money coming in and out of those capital accounts is not taxable because you will pay taxes based on net earnings regardless of whether or not you have distributed any profits so there 's no need to make a loan to the company which would have tax consequences to reimburse yourself for purchases already made submit an expense report to the company if the company is unfunded right now you can make a capital contribution to cover current expenses submit the expense report and wait until you have some profits before paying out the expense report or making any distributions welcome to entrepreneurship

yes you can do this buy placing a conditional order to buy at market if the price moves to 106 or above once the price hits 106 your market order will hit the market and you will purchase the stock at 106 or above you can also place a tack profit order at 107 linked to your initial conditional buy order so that once you buy order is executed and you buy at 106 a take profit order will be executed only if the price reaches 107 or above   if the price never reaches 106 neither your market buy order or take profit order will hit the market and you wo n't buy or sell anything

nobody tracks a single company 's net assets on a daily basis and stock prices are almost never derived directly from their assets otherwise there would be no concept of growth stocks   stocks trade on the presumed current value of future positive cash flow not on the value of their assets alone funds are totally different   they own nothing but stocks and are valued on the basis on the value of those stocks   commodity funds and closed funds muddy the picture somewhat but basically a fund 's only business is owning very liquid assets not using their assets to produce wealth the way companies do a fund has no meaning other than the direct value of its assets    even companies which own and exploit large assets like resource companies are far more complicated than funds e.g. gold mining or oil extracting companies derive most of their value from their physical holdings but those holdings value depends on the moving price and assumed future price of the commodity and also on the operations efficiency of extraction etc still different from a fund which only owns very liquid assets

it 's only a loss if you believe the purpose of indexes is to represent the basket of underlying companies with the highest returns   but that 's simply not true   an index is just a rules based way to track measure a thing   that thing could be the largest us companies all the companies in a specific sector all of the companies in the world a commodity or basket of commodities pretty much anything   somebody just has to write down the explanation of what an index tracks then create etfs to track the index   by being a passive investor you are still making active investing decisions to some degree in that you need to decide which indexes to passively invest in   if people are not going to attempt to understand the companies they invest in because they 're almost certainly better off indexing which is fine then the responsibility must fall on someone to make decisions about what are the best rules for the indexes   for most of the history of capital markets good corporate governance has been enforced by shareholders   if management did something bad shareholders could vote to replace the board of directors and in general they had tools to hold management accountable   only in recent years founders of companies like google facebook snap etc have attempted to this relationship public shareholders give a company money and in return the company must answer to the shareholders and essentially take money for nothing   so far it 's still a pretty short experiment this has worked as long as the share price is going up but what happens when it does n't   what happens when these companies screw up and stop performing well and there 's nothing shareholders can do about it   investors who intentionally own individual shares will have little to no leverage to demand change and passive investors would be stuck with some of their money in these companies with terrible governance and the precedent would only make dual class and non voting shares more attractive for future ipos making the problem more prevalent   if you think it is in your best interest to own the entire s&amp;p 500 plus snap then just do that   for every dollar you invest into spdr or something similar allocate something like $ 0.01 into snap   it 's that simple   but do n't make this out to be a story about how s&amp;p is anti free markets or doing a disservice to investors   that 's ridiculous   if most americans are just going to blindly put their retirement savings into index funds without bothering to understand them again which is fine then somebody needs to make sure the companies in said indexes are good companies   historically a company with zero corporate governance and entrenched management = /= a good company   s&amp;p realized this and decided to set a good precedent for us equity markets rather than a very bad precedent   you wanna buy shares with no voting rights   go for it   but that should be your decision not a default inclusion in major indexes

there is a strategy called merger arbitrage where you buy the stock of the acquired company when it sells for less than the final acquisition price usually the price will rise to about the acquisition price fairly rapidly after the merge is announced so you have to move fast the danger is that the merger gets called off regulatory reasons the acquired company board votes no and you get left holding shares bought at a price higher than the price after the merger collapses this is kind of an advanced strategy and a tough one to back test since each deal is unique

do you plan a monthly budget at the beginning of each month   this might seem counter intuitive but hear me out doing a budget is of course critically important for those who struggle with having enough money to last the month   having this written spending plan allows people struggling with finances to control their spending and funnel money into debt reduction or saving goals   however budgeting can also help those with the opposite problem there are some like you perhaps that have enough income and live frugally enough that they do n't have to budget   their money comes in and they spend so little that the bank account grows automatically   it sounds like a good problem to have but your finances are still out of control just in a different way   perhaps you are simply because you do n't know if you will have enough money to last or not by making a spending plan you set aside money each month for various categories in three broad areas since you have plenty of money coming in generously fund these spending categories   as long as you have money in the categories when you go to the store you can feel comfortable splurging a little because you know that your other categories are funded and the money is there to pay those other bills   create other categories such as technology or home improvement and when you need an app or have a home improvement project you can confidently spend this money as it has already been allocated for those purposes if you are new to budgeting software such as ynab can make it much easier

you are wrong on the l1 visa with respect to no limit there is an overall limit of 7 years max for and 5 yrs for   also it is only limited to companies who have offices in foreign countries where that worker must have worked at least 1 year in a managerial executive or special skill set capacity so not every company would qualify to bring in l1 visa workers you are right about no required minimum with respect to salary but it would throw an unnecessary attention if a manager you brought into the us getting paid peanuts so that in itself is a self regulator if you will

employment output and inflation are your feedback too little spending manifests as a an output gap with elevated unemployment and low inflation too much spending shows up as full employment full capacity and rising inflation as additional dollars just bid up prices   get it right and you have full employment with price stability   so are we there yet well it 's not a static point we reach and cross but a dynamic balance in every period based on what 's going on in the non government sectors lately we 've been leaning towards too little and the result is a stagnant recovery dragging on for years with elevated unemployment weak growth and a output

you bet if it was so simple this is when financial acumen comes into its true form the bank would never ever want to go insolvent what it does is take insurance against the borrower defaulting   remember the financial crisis of 2008 which was the outcome of borrowers defaulting the banks had created derivatives based on the loans distributed cdo cds are some of the simple derivatives banks sell to cover their backs in case of defaults there are derivatives using these derivatives as underlyings which they then sold it across to other buyers including other banks google for and you would realise how much deep the banks go to save themselves from if everything fails then go to the government for help that was what happened when the us government out $ 600 billion to save the financial sector

to build a us credit record you need a social security number ssn which is now not available for most non residents    an alternative is an itin number which is now available to non residents only if they have us income giving a reason to file a us tax return do you really want to get into all that assuming you did have a reason to get a itin one reason would be if you sold some ebooks via amazon us and need a withholding refund under the tax treaty then recent reports on give mixed results on whether it 's possible to get a credit card with an itin and whether that would build a credit record   it does sound possible in some cases    a credit record in any other country would not help   you would certainly need a us address and banks are increasingly asking for a physical address rather than just a mailbox regardless building this history would be of limited benefit to you if you later became a us resident at that point you would be eligible for a new ssn different from the itin and have to largely start again if getting a card is the aim rather than the credit record you may find some banks that will offer a secured card or a debit card to non residents especially in areas with lots of canadian visitors border florida arizona   you 'd find it a lot easier with a us address though and you 'd need to shop around a lot of banks in person until you find one with the right rules   most will simply avoid anyone without an ssn

if you are living together casually no formal partnership agreement then my option would be to ask her politely to as she has offered make a contribution   by buying the groceries or some such which you share a voluntary contribution not an enforceable one just as between flat mates where only one is the actual tenant of the flat but the tenancy allows sharing check your tenancy allows you to share ps an old saying is never do business with close family i.e do not charge your wife or living in partner rent it mixes emotional domestic life with a formal business life which can set going in case of a break up or dispute if you enter into child bearing relationship or parent hood or formal partnership or marriage then all this changes at some time in the future

most people advocate a passively managed low fee mutual fund that simply aims to track a given benchmark say s&p 500 few funds can beat the s&p consistently so investors are often better served finding a no load passive fund first thing i would do is ask your benefits rep why you do n't have an option to invest in a fidelity passive index fund like spartan 500 ideally young people would be heavy in equities and slowly divest for less risky stuff as retirement comes closer and rebalance the portfolio regularly when market swings put you off risk targets few people know how to do this and actually do so so there are mutual funds that do it for you for a fee these in are called lifecycle funds the freedom funds here   i hesitate to recommend them because they 're still fairly new if you take a look at underlying assets these things generally just reinvest in the broker 's other funds which themselves have expenses fees and there 's all kinds personal situations that might lead to you place a portion with a different investment

a somewhat provocative but not proposal rent do n't buy a house to live in in the thing that got many people in deep trouble is their mortgage it 's not a productive investment but a speculative bet on what was in fact a bubble and a class of assets that is notoriously slow to recover after a slump before thinking about your savings or buying into silly ideas about gold you should realise that as a middle class worker the biggest risk after a crisis is losing your job renting your accommodation means being able to downgrade or move very quickly and not being forced to sell a house at the worse possible time if you really do need to liquidate some of your investments at a bad time having a more diversified portfolio means that you are not losing everything to meet some short term obligations assuming you 're in the us this means forgoing some nice tax advantages that might be too tempting to resist i 'm not so i am basing this on what i read on this site but bubbles aside there is nothing that makes real estate a particularly good investment as such especially if you also live in the house you 're buying you might very well come out on top but you expose yourself to several risks and are less prepared to face a crisis

gt a trucking company making millions of dollars a year on us highways derives more value from the roads than i do    trucking companies run on very slim margins typical for a commoditized business and the vast majority of benefit is captured by other players employees and the government in the form of taxes    moreover you appear to be confusing revenue and profits   gt honestly anyone who says that they do n't need to pay for roads because of their level of benefit from them is limited and i will call you a liar unless you are living in a box in the woods 100s of miles away from civilization you absolutely rely on the road system even if you never set foot on it    nobody ever said this you are inventing an argument in order to counter it silly   gt though at the same time a national highway system was something no business would ever make as it derives too little value for an individual business for the scale required to reach enough of the market this is a perfect example of a project that is good for society but wo n't see the tab picked up by business voluntarily    sure again you are way off on a tangent though nobody here has argued against infrastructure nor taxes required to fund them    gt it is foolish to assume your market value increases do not rely on infrastructure to happen as much as paper trading inflates value for the most part it is still tied to some kind of real work or rather the expectation of being done somewhere that assumption of ability for a corporation to serve it 's shareholders is based on the fact that companies have infrastructure needs handled and that expanding delivery to three new markets wo n't be hampered because the company must first complete the highway to serve these markets   again you seem confused about the argument we are not arguing about the basis of stock valuations and appreciation which you happen to be wrong on btw we are talking about the relative value of infrastructure gained by the wealthy vs. non wealthy replace stock market with 30 year us bonds actually do n't the next thing i 'll see from you is some kind of comment about how infrastructure forms the basis for interest rates   gt;the existence of infrastructure not only supports the market but allows you to exploit it the internet here makes a great example prior to funding and a push by the government to standardize military and academic networks and technology as well as make more powerful in order to stay ahead in tech race we had a mish mash of proprietary networks with very poor abilities to use them today we have the internet a largely private system today however it would not exist without the involvement and funding from the government for the multiple programs that led to it 's existence   great nobody ever said otherwise   gt if the taxes really outweighed utility businesses would not operate in the area at all the thing is they do n't and taxes are not preventing businesses from growing    i said personal utility i personally employ 40 families i pay considerable taxes for them they pay income and sales taxes on top of that it 's a huge amount of money the government receives that they would n't have had i not chosen to go into business   incidentally this brings up another point does n't the government owe me something for generating that many jobs why am i not getting a tax break   gt yes but that is because unless you are doing it all yourself then you did not generate that $ 10 as a business owner you are in charge of managing resources to help generate that $ 10 you yourself however did not generate that $ 10 you had employees and contractors and people managing your building payroll and yes even taxes every person involved in getting the product or service from idea to the door are all part of that $ 10 if your efforts in that co are netting you 15 of the total then you are beating the market already and i am not sure what your problem is if you are looking to double or triple your investments you are looking for las vegas not wall st or main st.   i see you do n't understand how business works   gt i think the issue i see among people with your opinion is a failure to understand 2nd and 3rd order effects your bubble extends to what you do in your daily life and the parts of it you visibly see and touch the world you see and touch every day is supported and made comfortable by a whole system and people whom you will never see or know    the issue i see among people with your opinion is that it is naive and obviously not based in any real world experience if you had ever actually run a business you would realize how many people get paid before you do including the government you have maybe a 5 chance of making an above average wage and you fight like hell every day to stay afloat    i encourage you to open your eyes and try to see the perspective of people who are actually making a difference in this world and not the political and leeches who have a vested interest in seeing to it that you believe something that simply is n't true

just for clarification delta and probability of expiring in the money are not the same thing what the guy meant was that delta is usually a close enough approximation to the probability one way to think about it is to look at the probabilities and deltas of in the money out of the money and at the money options in these cases the delta and probabilities are about the same in fact if you look at an options chain with delta and probabilities you can see that they are all about the same in other words there is a linear relationship between delta and probability here are a couple links to other answers around the web hope this answer helps

as others have stated the current price is simply the last price at which the security traded for any given tick however there are many bid ask prices because securities can trade on multiple exchanges and between many agents on a single exchange this is true for both types of exchanges that chris mentioned in his answer chris answer is pretty thorough in explaining how the two types of exchanges work so i 'll just add some minor details in exchanges like nasdaq there are multiple market makers for most relatively liquid securities which theoretically introduces competition between them and therefore lowers the bid ask spreads that traders face although this results in the market makers earning less compensation for their risk they hope to make up the difference by making the market for highly liquid securities this could also result in your order filling in pieces at several different prices if your brokerage firm fills it through multiple market makers of course if you place your order on an exchange where an electronic system fills it the other type of exchange that chris mentioned this could happen anyway   in short if you place a market order for 1000 shares it could be filled at several different prices depending on volume multiple bid ask prices etc if you place a sizable order your broker may fill it in pieces regardless to prevent you from moving the market this is rarely a problem for small time investors trading securities with high volumes but for investors with higher capital like institutional investors mutual funds etc who place large orders relative to the average volume this could conceivably be a burden both in the price difference across time as the order is placed and the increased bookkeeping it demands   this is tangentially related so i 'll add it anyway in cases like the one described above all or none orders are one solution these are orders that instruct the broker to only execute the order if it can be filled in a single transaction most brokers offer these but there are some caveats that apply to them specifically i have n't been able to find some of this information so some of this is from memory   all or none orders are only an option if the order is for more than a certain numbers of shares i think the minimum size is 300 or 400 shares   your order wo n't be placed until your broker places all other orders ahead of it that do n't have special conditions attached to them   i believe all or none orders are day orders which means that if there was n't enough supply to fill the order during the day the order is cancelled at market close   orders only apply to limit orders if you want to replicate the behavior of a market order with characteristics you can try setting a limit buy sell order a few cents above below the current market price

credit unions require you to open an account because of their history a credit union is just that a union only instead of a union of workers collectively bargaining for better pay or worker 's comp they are lending each other money they are chartered to offer their services to members of the union rather than the public at large   for that reason credit unions historically had targeted niche memberships ie employees at a specific company or property with a specific hobby such as fishing most credit unions these days attempt to skirt the issue by claiming to serve members of a specific geographic area anyway membership is defined a owning a stake in the union which is usually termed a share by opening the account and purchasing a share you are becoming both an owner and member of the union and are eligible for their services that 's why the account is required before you can have a loan

if your primary concern is a drop in your credit score go to a mortgage broker instead of multiple banks and finance companies each time you ask a bank or financial institution for a loan they do a hard pull on your credit rating which costs you a couple of points visit a dozen lenders and you 'll lose 24 points you will also be signalling to lenders that you 're shopping for money if you visit a mortgage broker he does a single hard pull on your credit score and offers your loan query to a dozen or more lenders some of which you may not have even heard of this costs you 2 points instead of 24 if you are only going to visit one financial institution or another specific one the drop in credit score is the same couple of points the above answer only applies if you make loan inquiries at multiple institutions

for the person being hired this is a tricky situation specially with the new laws there is no real magic number that can be applied as a lot will depend on what benefits you want and what is actually available this will really shift the spectrum quite a bit   under the care act everyone has to have insurance or pay a fine were really not sure what to call this yet but there are two provisions that really mess with the numbers you look at as an employee   first the cost of heath care has skyrocketed so the same benefits that you had 5 years ago now cost maybe 10 15 times as much as they used to this gets swept under the rug a bit because the main costs of insurance has only increased a tiny amount what this actually comes down to is does your new aca approved heath plan cover exactly the benefits you need or does it cut corners   sorry this is complicated and i do n't mean it to come off as a speech against the aca so i will give an example my wife has ra she really has it under control with the help of her ra doctor this is not something she ever wants to change because she has had ra from the age of 15 and because it 's she does n't want to spend 5 years working with a new doctor to get to the same place she is with her current doctor   in addition the main drugs she takes for ra are not covered under any aca plan nor are the that her doctor makes we are trying to have kids so she has to be off the main meds and a couple of the things this doctor has tried has been meds that reduce are pregnancy safe but are not for the treatment of ra you now have to take into effect rather the cost of health insurance + the cost of the things now not covered by the heath insurance + the out of pocket expenses is worth the insurance   second the aca has set up provisions to straight up trick those people that have lower income and are not paying close attention when shopping for insurance they get quotes like $ 50 a month or $ 100 a month the truth is that the remainder of the actual cost is deducted from their tax returns this takes consideration because if you thing your paying $ 50 a month for insurance but your really paying $ 650 then you need to make sure your doing your math right finally you need to understand how messed up things are right now in the us with heath care largely this goes unreported i 'm not really sure why but in order to do this i will have to give examples   for my wife to see a specialist her ra doctor the co pay is $ 75 so she goes to the doctor he charges her $ 75 and bills the insurance $ 200 the insurance pays the doctor $ 50 with out insurance the visit costs $ 50   at first you want to blame the doctor for cheating the system but the doctor has to pay for hours of labor to get the $ 50 back from the insurance company from the doctors perspective it 's cheaper to take the $ 50 then it is to charge the insurance company and by charging the insurance company he has no control over the cost of the co pay he essentially has to charge more to make the same money and the patient gets the in the process another example i got throat last year i went to the walk in clinic paid $ 75 saw the doctor got my z pack for $ 15 went home in bed and got better my wife who still had separate insurance from before the marriage got throat that went to the same clinic they charged her $ 200 for the visit $ 50 co pay and $ 250 for the z pack $ 3 co pay the insurance paid the clinic $ 90 for the visit and $ 3 for the drugs again the patient is left out in this scenario in this case it worked better for my wife unless you account for the fact that to get that coverage she had to pay $   my point is that when comparing costs of with insurance and without out insurance its often times much cheaper for the practices to have you self pay then it is for them to go through the loops of trying to insurance to make them whole this creates two rates self pay rates and insured rates when your trying to figure out the cost of not having insurance then you need to use the self pay rates these can be vastly different   so as an employee you need to figure out your cost of heath care with insurance and your cost of heath care without insurance then user those numbers when your trying to negotiate a salary the problem is that there is no magic number to use for this because the cost will very a lot for us it was cheaper to not have insurance even with a pre existing condition that takes constant attention it 's just better if we set aside $ 500 a month then it is to try to pay $ 750 a month that might not hold true for everyone for some people or conditions it may be better to pay the $ 750 then to try to handle it themselves   so for my negotiations i would go with without insurance or with insurance   now as an employer it 's a lot simpler usually you have a group plan that offers you a pretty straight $ x per year per person or $ y per year per family so you can offer exactly that salary $ x or salary $ y. as a starting point however this is where negotiations start   if your offering me $ and insurance i would rather just have $ and no insurance of course your real cost is only $ 55,000 cause you do n't care about my heath care costs only about insurance costs so you try to negotiate down towards $ 55,000 and no insurance but that 's not good enough for me so i either go else where and you loose talent or i accept $ and insurance or somewhere in between

the best answer is i think also the simplest   a bank is an entity which performs maturity transformation   conversely any entity that performs maturity transformation is acting as a bank regardless of whether it is called one or is regulated as one   and an entity which does not perform maturity transformation is n't really a bank   maturity transformation is the process by which a bank accepts short term deposits and makes long term loans   the benefit to society is fairly obvious we collectively like being able to take out mortgages but we also like having our money in a checking account and available on demand   banks allow this to happen although property bubbles and similar make it clear that this is n't without cost   note   central banks are a completely different kettle of fish

an economy produces goods and services and people use money to pay for those goods and services   money has value because people believe that they can buy and sell goods and services with it in that economy how much the value of money is is determined by how much money there is in comparison to goods and services supply and demand in most economies it is the job of the federal national reserve bank to ensure that prices stay stable ie the relationship of goods and services to how much money there is is stable as this is necessary for a well running economy   the federal reserve bank does so by making more printing decreasing interest rates or less increasing interest rates available to the economy to determine how much money needs to be in the economy to keep prices stable is incredibly hard as many factors have an impact if the reserve bank gets it wrong and there is more money compared to goods and services than previous prices will rise to compensate this is inflation if it 's the other way round is deflation since it is commonly regarded that deflation is much more destabilizing to an economy than inflation the reserve banks tend to err on the side of inflation

news about a company is not the only thing that affects its stock 's price there is also supply and demand   that of course is influenced by news but it is not the only actor   an insider with a large position in their company 's stock may want to diversify his overall portfolio and thus need to sell a large amount of stock   that may be significant enough to increase supply and likely reduce the stock 's price somewhat that brings me to another influence on stock price perception   executives and other insiders with large positions in their company 's stock have to be careful about how and when they sell some of that stock as to not worry the markets   many investors watch insider selling to gauge the health of the company which brings me to another important point   there are many things that may be considered news which is material to a certain company and its stock   it is not just quarterly filings earnings reports and such   there is also news related to competitors news about the economy or a certain sector news about some weather event that affects a major supplier news about a major earthquake that will impact the economy of a nation which can then have knock on effects to other economies etc there are also a lot of investors with varying needs which will influence supply and demand   an institutional investor needing to diversify may reduce their position in a stock and thus increase supply enough that it impacts the stock 's price   meanwhile individual investors will make their transactions at varying times during the day   in the aggregate that may have significant impacts on supply and demand the overall point being that there are a lot of inputs and a lot of actors in a complicated system   even if you focus just on news there are many things that fall into that category news does not come out at regular intervals and it does not necessarily spread evenly   that alone could make for a highly variable environment

i 'm not a financial expert but saying that paying a $ 1 dividend will reduce the value of the stock by $ 1 sounds like awfully simple minded reasoning to me it appears to be based on the assumption that the price of a stock is equal to the value of the assets of a company divided by the total number of shares but that simply is n't true you do n't even need to do any in depth analysis to prove it just look at share prices over a few days you should easily be able to find stocks whose price varied wildly if say a company becomes the target of a federal investigation the share price will plummet the day the announcement is made did the company 's assets really disappear that day no what 's happened is that the company 's long term prospects are now in doubt or a company announces a promising new product the share price shoots up they may not have sold a single unit of the new product yet they have n't made a dollar but their future prospects now look improved many factors go into determining a stock price sure total assets is a factor but more important is anticipated future earning i think a very simple case could be made that if a stock never paid any dividends and if everyone knew it would never pay any dividends that stock is worthless the stock will never produce any profit to the owner so why should you be willing to pay anything for it one could say the value could go up and you could sell at a profit but on what basis would the value go up why would investors be willing to pay larger and larger amounts of money for an asset that produces zero income update i think i understand the source of the confusion now so let me add to my answer suppose that a company 's stock is selling for say $ 10 and to simplify the discussion let 's suppose that there is absolutely nothing affecting the value of that stock except an expected dividend the company plans to pay a dividend on a specific date of $ 1 per share this dividend is announced well in advance everyone knows that it will be paid and everyone is extremely that in fact the company really will pay it they wo n't run out of money or any such then in a pure market we would expect that as the date of that dividend approaches the price of the stock would rise until the day before the dividend is paid it is $ 11 then the day after the dividend is paid the price would fall back to $ 10 why because the person who owns the stock on the dividend day will get that $ 1 so if you bought the stock the day before the dividend the next day you would immediately receive $ 1 if without the dividend the stock is worth $ 10 then the day before the dividend the stock is worth $ 11 because you know that the next day you will get a $ 1 refund if you buy the stock the day after the dividend is paid you will not get the $ 1 it will go to the person who had the stock yesterday so the value of the stock falls back to the normal $ 10 so if you look at the value of a stock immediately after a dividend is paid yes it will be less than it was the day before by an amount equal to the dividend plus or minus all the other things that affect the value of a stock which in many cases would totally mask this effect but this does not mean that the dividend is worthless just the opposite the reason the stock price fell was precisely because the dividend has value but it only has value to the person who gets it it does me no good that you get a $ 1 dividend i want me to get the money so if i buy the stock after the dividend was paid i missed my chance so sure in the very short term a stock loses value after paying a dividend but this does not mean that dividends in general reduce the value of a stock just the opposite the price fell because it had gone up in anticipation of the dividend and is now returning to the normal level without the dividend the price would never have gone up in the first place imagine you had a company with negligible assets for example an accounting firm that rents office space so it does n't own a building its only tangible assets are some office supplies and the like so if the company liquidates it would be worth pretty much zero everybody knows that if liquidated the company would be worth zero further suppose that everyone somehow knows that this company will never ever again pay a dividend maybe federal regulators are shutting the company down because it 's products were declared hazardous or the company was built around one genius who just died etc what is the stock worth zero it is an investment that you know has a zero return why would anyone be willing to pay anything for it it 's no answer to say that you might buy the stock in the hope that the price of the stock will go up and you can sell at a profit even with no dividends why would anyone else pay anything for this stock well unless their stock certificates are pretty and people like to collect them or something like that otherwise you 're supposing that people would knowingly buy into a pyramid scheme of course in real life there are usually uncertainties if a company is dying some people may believe rightly or wrongly that there is still hope of it etc do n't confuse the value of the assets of a company with the value of its stock they are related of course all else being equal a company with a billion dollars in assets will have a higher market capitalization than a company with ten dollars in assets but you ca n't calculate the price of a company 's stock by adding up the value of all its assets subtracting liabilities and dividing by the number of shares that 's just not how it works long term the value of any stock is not the value of the assets but the net present value of the total future expected dividends subject to all sorts of complexities in real life

if you sold the stock for a profit you will owe tax on that profit whether it is taxed as short term or long term capital gains depends on how long you held the stock before selling it presumably you 're going to invest this money into mutual funds or something of that sort those may pay dividends which can be reinvested and will grow in value you hope just as the individual stock shares would you hope assuming the advice you 've been given is at all reasonable there 's no need for buyer 's remorse here you 're just changing your investing style to a different point on the risk versus return curve if you have to ask this question i tend to agree that you should do more homework before playing with shares in individual companies unless you 're getting shares at employee discount in which case you should still seriously consider selling them fairly quickly and reinvesting the money in a more structured manner in a very real sense your job is itself an investment in your employer if they ever get into trouble you do n't want that to hit both your income and investments

the cash is not penalty free if you take up loans from the policy to pay for retirement growth essentially stops and the interest will eat away policy value over time so instead of gaining 7 8 per year and taking withdrawals you would be taking loans and losing whatever the interest rate is   dividends are just the profits made from the company which is why its tax free its considered a return of premium you are just overpaying for the policy by its dividend rate    whole life is a great vehicle for some situations but it always comes after a 401k or other retirement savings whole life does nt even begin to make sense imo until you are making a few hundred thousand a year and need it for a business buy sell agreement or legacy money to leave children grandchildren   it does nt scale well to lower incomes

to be honest i think a lot of people on this site are doing you a disservice by taking your idea as seriously as they are not only is this a horrible idea but i think you have some alarming misunderstandings about what it means to save for retirement first off precious metals are not an investment they are store of value the old saying that a gold coin would buy a suit 300 years ago and will still buy a suit today is pretty accurate buying precious metals and expecting them to appreciate in the future because they are undervalued is just flat out speculation and really does n't belong in a well planned retirement account unless it 's a very small part for the purposes of diversification so the upshot to all of this is the most likely outcome is you get zero return after inflation maybe you 'll get lucky or maybe you 'll be very unlucky next you would say that sure you 're giving up some expected return for a reduction in risk but you 've done away with diversification which is the most effective way to minimize risk and i 'm not sure what scenario you 're imagining that the stock market or any other reasonable investment does n't make any returns if you invest in a market wide index fund then the expected return is going to be roughly in proportion with productivity gains to say that there will be no appreciation of the stock market over the next 40 years is to say that technological progress will stop and/or we will have large scale economic disruptions that will wipe out 40 years of progress if that happens i would say it 's highly questionable whether silver will actually be worth anything at all i 'd rather have food property and firearms so to answer your question practically any other retirement savings plan would be better than the one that you currently outlined but the best plan is just to put your money in a very low cost index fund at vanguard and let it sit until you retire the expense ratios are so stupidly small that it 's not going to meaningfully affect your return

mba and cfa are n’t necessarily mutually exclusive    mba teaches you a broader set of skills and more importantly gives you access to a network of alumni that can open doors for you network is perhaps the most valuable part of top mba programs    cfa is a gold standard in finance and would give you a set of useful skills for wealth management    if you can get into top 10 business schools i would say do both otherwise if you are absolutely sure about money management then go for cfa it ’s cheaper and you can still   earn income while pursuing it

with the scenario that you laid out ie 5 and 10 loans it makes no sense at all the problem is when you 're in trouble the rates are never 5 or 10 getting behind on credit cards sucks and is really hard to recover from the problem with multiple accounts is that as the banks tack on fees and raise your interest rate to the default rate usually 30 when you give them any excuse late payment over the limit etc the banks will also cut your credit lines as you make payments making it more likely that you will bump over the limit and be back in default status one payment even at a slightly higher rate is preferable when you 're deep in the hole because you can actually pay enough to hit principal if you have assets like a house you 'll get a much better rate as well in a scenario where you 're paying 22 25 interest your minimum payment will be $ 150 200 a month and that is mostly interest and penalty one big loan will usually result in a smaller payment and you do n't end up in a situation where the banks are for position so they get paid first the danger of consolidation is that you 'll stop triggering defaults and keep making your payments so your credit score will improve then the will start circling and offering you more credit cards edit mea   i wrote this based on experiences of close friends whom i 've helped out over the years not realizing how the law changed in 2009   back around 2004 a single late payment would trigger universal default on most cards jacking all rates up to 30 and slashing credit lines resulting in over the limit and other fees credit card banks generally apply payments in order to interest on penalties penalties interest on principal principal in a way that makes it very difficult to pay down principal for people deep in debt they would also offer payment plans to entice you to pay bank b vs. bank a which would trigger fees from bank a. another change is that minimum payments were generally 2 of statement balance which often did n't cover the monthly finance charge the new law changed that resulting in a payment of 1 of balance + accrued interest under the old regime consolidation made it less likely that various circumstances would trigger default and gave the struggling debtor one throat to choke with the new rules there are definitely a smaller number of scenarios where consolidation actually makes sense

is my financial status ok if not how can i improve it based on the fact that you have $ 100 k in the bank and no debts your situation is ok you do n't have credit card debt or an underwater car loan though the fact you are thinking about a car and a home shows you have started to put some thought into planning is now a right time for me to see a financial advisor   the fact that you do n't mention retirement savings 401 k ira or pension means that you have not planned for retirement and you need to do so the espp can be a part of a plan but if that is you only investment you are focusing too much of your current and future income on one source of income is it worthy it can be you want to avoid working with a planner that makes money only if you invest in specific investments they suggest you want to find a planner that takes a fixed fee for developing the plan and only provides advice on types of investments how would she he help me they will look at where you are where you can quickly make adjustments and where you want to go over the next year decade and lifetime then they will provide guidance on those steps you should follow   if your situation changes in the future because of marriage or kids you can then revisit with a planner and make changes

if the job looks good i would n't let having to relocate stop you some companies will help you with relocation expenses like paying travel expenses the movers the security deposit on an apartment etc it does n't hurt to ask if they help with moving expenses if they say no fine i would n't expect a company to decide not to hire you   for asking such a question i would certainly not buy immediately upon moving buying a house is a serious long term commitment what if after a few months you discover that this job is not what you thought it was what if you discover that you hate the area for whatever reason etc or even if you are absolutely sure that wo n't happen it 's very hard to buy a house long distance how many trips can you make to look at different houses learn about neighborhoods get a feel for market prices etc a few years ago i moved just a couple of hundred miles to a neighboring state and i rented an apartment for about 2 years before buying a house for all these reasons assuming the company wo n't help with moving expenses do you have the cash to make the move if you 're tight it does n't have to be all that expensive if you 're six months out of college you probably do n't have a lot of stuff when i got my first job out of college i fit everything i owned in the back seat of my and tied my one piece of furniture to the roof if you ca n't fit all your stuff in your car rent a truck and a tow bar to pull your car behind get a cheap apartment you 'll probably have to pay the first month 's rent plus a security deposit you can usually furnish your first apartment from garage sales and the like very cheaply if you do n't have the cash do you have credit cards or can your parents loan you some money they might be willing to loan you money to get you out of their house

other responses have focused on getting you software to use but i 'd like to attempt your literal question how are such transactions managed in systems that handle them i will answer for double entry bookkeeping software such as quicken or gnucash my choice disclaimer i am not an accountant and accountants will probably find error in my terminology your credit card is a liability to you and is tracked using a liability account as opposed to an asset account such as your bank accounts or cash in your pocket a liability account is just like an asset except that it is subtracted from rather than added to your total assets or from another perspective its balance is normally negative the mathematics works out identically when you make a purchase using your credit card the transaction you record transfers money from the liability account increasing the liability to the expense account for your classification of the expense when you make a payment on your credit card the transaction you record transfers money from your checking account for example to the credit card account reducing the liability whatever software you choose for tracking your money i strongly recommend choosing something that is sufficiently powerful to handle representing this as i have described transfers between accounts as the normal mode of operation not simply lone increases decreases of asset accounts

as you note your question is inherently opinion based   that said if i were in your situation i would sell the stock all at once and buy whatever it is you want to buy hopefully some index etf or mutual fund according to what i see the current value of the hd stock is about $ 8500 and the jnj stock is worth less than $ 500   with a total investment of less than $ 10,000 any gain you are likely to miss by liquidating now is not going to be huge in absolute terms this is doubly true since you were given the stock so you have no specific reason to believe it will do well at all   if you had picked it yourself based on careful analysis it could be worth keeping if you believed in yourself or even if you just wanted to test your acumen but as it is the stock is essentially random   even if you want to pursue an aggressive allocation it does n't make sense to allocate everything to one stock for no reason   if you were going to put everything in one stock you 'd want it to be a stock you had analyzed and picked   i still think it would be a bad idea but at least it would be a more defensible idea so i would say the risk of your lopsided allocation just two companies with more than 90 of the value in just one outweighs any risk of missing out on a gain   if news breaks tomorrow that the ceo of home depot has been or if trump decides to go on the twitter for some reason your investment could disappear another common way to think about it is if you had $ 9000 today to buy stocks with would you buy $ 8500 worth of hd and $ 500 worth of jnj   if not it probably does n't make sense to hold them just because you happen to have them the only potential exception to my advice above would be tax considerations   you did n't mention what your basis in the stock is   looking at historical prices it looks like if all the stock was 20 years old you 'd have a gain of about $ 8000 and if all of it was 10 years old you 'd have a gain of about $ 6000   if your tax situation is such that selling all the stock at once would push you into a higher tax bracket it might make sense to sell only enough to fit into your current bracket and sell the rest next year   however i think this situation is unlikely because a since the stock has been held for a long time most of the gains will be at the lower long term rate b if you have solid income you can probably afford the tax and c if you do n't have solid income your long term capital gains rate will likely be zero

i actually tend to disagree   this was one of the most watched ipos in history   facebook would have benefited greatly from a pop   people would have thought wow they really can do no wrong   instead there are endless negative articles about how this is a horrible failure   sure financially savvy people look at this and think fb did a beautiful job   they maximized their take from the ipo   but the price of the bad press ca n't be accurately measured   the benefit in terms of publicity of being seen as a stock company on the move up is hard to measure too   suppose they had priced it at $ 25 and limited the number of shares they would have gotten less money but they 'd also be looking at a massively successful pop on their share price   the effect on their business of that reality seems to me to have had the potential to be significant   so i 'm not so sure in the long term whether it would have made more sense for them to get less money up front and get a successful ipo rather than go for the max dollars and have a pr disaster   i think the way things turned out made fb go from an into a company that can fail just like any other

before starting with investing you should make sure you are saving enough   living in a welfare country france does not exempt you from potentially needing to save large amounts of money you state that you do not need much of an emergency day fund but this is not true   being dismissed from your job is not the only way to become unemployed and not all roads lead to unemployment pay   being fired for cause or leaving your job voluntarily are two work related causes that will leave you without an income source   unexpected major expenses are another reason you might need to dip into your emergency fund if your emergency fund is in order the next thing to investigate is your pension and saving for retirement   in a country with a strong pension system you need to check how comfortable you are with its sustainability greece anyone and also whether it will adequately meet your needs   if not there are no 401ks or iras in france but there is a relatively new personal supplementary pension plan that you might investigate contributing to if you 're comfortable with your emergency fund and your retirement savings then preparing for buying a house is likely your next savings goal   a quick search shows that to get a mortgage to buy a house in france banks will commonly require a downpayment of 20 plus various closing costs   see for example here   this is 40,000 + euro for a 200k euro house which will take you several years at the rate of 500 euro month   france has special plans plan with tax exempt interest for saving up for a house that you might want to investigate in your other question you also ask about buying a cheap car   as you get older and possibly start a family having a car will likely become more of a necessity   this is another goal you can save for rather than having to take a loan out when you buy one

there are several areas of passive fraud by being unclear on what you are doing   when a citizen buys a house the mortgage lender wants all the details as to how the buyer rounded up the money   that is so they can use their own formulas to assess the buyer 's creditworthiness and the probability that the buyer will be able to keep up on payments taxes and maintenance or have they overextended themselves the fraud is in the withholding of that info by way of tricking them into making a favorable decision when they might not have if they 'd had all the facts   then there 's making this sound all good intentions no strings attached no expectations you 're lying to yourself   what you 've actually done is put money between yourselves because you have not laid down fair rules to cover every possibility   you 're not willing to plan for failure because you do n't want to admit failure is possible which is vain   once you leap into this bell jar the uncertainty of what happens if will itself into everyone 's thoughts slowly your relationship   it 's a recipe for disaster   that uncertainty puts her in a very uncomfortable position   she has to labor to make sure the issue does n't explode so she 's around you to avoid fights   every fight she 'll wonder if you 'll play the breakup card and threaten to demand the money back   the money will literally come between you this is what money does   thinking otherwise is a young person 's mistake of inexperience   do n't take my word on it contact suze orman and see what she says your lender is also not going to like those poorly defined lovers promises because they 've seen it all before and do n't want to yet again foreclose on a house that fighting lovers trashed   it 's like superhero battles are awesome unless you own the building they trashed   this thing can still be done but to remove this fraud of wishful thinking you need to plan for every possibility agree to outcomes that are fair and achievable put it in writing and share it with a neutral third party   you have n't done it because it seems like it would be awkward as hell and it will be or it will test your relationship by forcing direct honesty about a bunch of things you have n't talked about or are afraid to and it will and to be blunt your relationship may not be able to survive that much honesty   but if it does you 'll be in much better shape    the other passive fraud is taxes   by not defining the characteristics of the payment you up the question of how your contribution will be taxed if it will be taxed a proper contract with each other will settle that   there 's an argument to be made for involving a tax advisor in the design of that contract so that you can work things to your advantage   as an example defining the payment as rent is about the worst you could do as you will not be able to deduct any home expenses she will need to pay income tax on the rent but she can can not take landlord 's tax deductions on anything but the fraction of the house which is exclusively in your control i.e. none

the one thing we know for certain is that holding large amounts of cash is n't ideal inflation will eat away at your wealth it 's understandable that you 're hesitant to put all your wealth in common stock the s&p 500 's price earnings is right now a little high by historical standards but consider that the s&p 500 has given a cagr of approximately 10 not inflation adjusted since 1970 if you do n't time the market correctly you could miss out on considerable gains so it 's probably best to invest at least a portion of your wealth in common stocks and just accept the risk of short term losses you 'll likely come out ahead in the long run compared to an investor who tries to time the market and ends up holding cash positions for too long if you really think us stocks are overpriced you could look at other markets but you 'll find similar p es in europe and japan you could try an emerging market fund like if you have the risk tolerance let 's say you 're not convinced and do n't want to invest heavily in stocks right now in the current market safe cash alternatives like treasury bills offer very low yields not enough to offset inflation tax so i would invest in a diversified portfolio of long term bonds real estate maybe precious metals and whatever amount of stock you 're comfortable with

but i wish to know why the parameter is dividend market price rather than just dividend what extra info you can uncover by looking at dividend market price that you can not get from dividend consider two stocks a and b. a offers a dividend of $ 1 per year b offers a dividend of $ 2 per year let 's remove all complications aside and assume that this trend continues if you were to buy each of these stocks you will get the following amounts over its life assumed infinity for simplicity cash flows from a = $ = $ 25 assuming risk free is 4 per annum cash flows from b = $ = $ 50 assuming risk free is 4 per annum the price you buy them at is an important factor to consider because let 's say if a was trading for $ 10 and b for $ 60 then a would look like a profitable while b wo n't of course this is a very simplistic view dividend rates are not constant and many companies pose a significant risk of going bust but this should help illustrate the general idea behind the d p ratio the formula i have used is one for computing the npv of a perpetuity

back when they started discover undercut visa and amex fees by about a point this was also true when i worked for a mail order computer retailer in the 90s if a customer asked us which credit cards we took we were told to list discover first and amex last because discover had the lowest merchant charges possibly this is no longer true today but for quite a while it was a significant selling point of the discover card to merchants and a reason why many did sign on a reason some stores did not sign on was that discover was owned by sears and many businesses that competed with sears did n't like the idea of sending any of their profits to the competition today discover also owns diners club and the fees for those cards are higher

a simple rule of tax is it does n't matter where u live or your residence when it comes to income accruing in india   as far as i know you will need to find out the purchase prices of the inherited land and calculate the index value then pay tax on the capital profit not sure i guess its 20   example original value is 100,000 and the index value is so the profit will be you pay 20 of the only   for paying minimum tax tax saving there are few sections which gives exemption like purchase some bonds or purchase a house   its best if you ask a chartered accountant for this simple case he should n't charge much he should have updated knowledge of the situation and guide you better

several factors are considered in loans as significant as a home mortgage   i believe the most major factors are 1 credit report 2 income and 3 employment status if you borrow jointly all joint factors are included not just the favorable ones   some wrinkles this can cause may include credit report the second person on the loan may have poor credit or no credit   this can will hurt your rate or even prevent them from being listed on the loan at all which will also mean you ca n't include their income in addition there are future consequences that any late payments default foreclosure etc will be listed on all borrower 's reports if you both have solid work history great credit and want to jointly own the home then there should n't be any negatives   if this is not the case compare both cases fully not just rates as some agents could say you can get the same rate either way but then not tell you closing costs in one scenario are higher and pick the one that is best overall this is just information from my recollection so make sure to verify and ask plenty of questions do n't go forward on assumptions

because people are risk averse suppose that you own an asset worth $ 10,000 to you   suppose that each year the asset has 1 chance of being stolen or completely broken   the expected value is 99 x 10,000 + 1 x $ 0 = $ 9,900 this is the average outcome if you do not buy insurance   now consider two mutually exclusive outcomes 99 chance of keeping $ 10,000 and 1 chance of losing everything expected value $ 9,900   100 chance of keeping $ 9,900 expected value $ 9,900   everyone would choose option 2 even though the expected values are the same   option 2 is an insurance that cost $ 100 fair aka the odds are fair   now suppose the insurance costs $ 150 instead of $ 100 despite that the bad probability is still 1 you are faced with   99 chance of keeping $ 10,000 and 1 chance of losing everything expected value $ 9,900   100 chance of keeping $ expected value $   some people would still choose option 2 even though the expected value is actually lower   the $ 50 is called risk premium which people are willing to pay in order to avoid uncertainty the odds are unfair but the risk premium has its value   that being said competition between insurance companies would drive down the premium until the insurance is close to fair but they have cost to cover sales administration etc making the odds unfair

one can never be too cautious when when choosing a financial adviser for example has the company your adviser claims to represent ever been sanctioned by the local financial authorities does your adviser reside in the country in which he purports to operate have you thoroughly researched his background   it is also important to bear in mind what venues a company uses for advertising if the company resorts to advertising by spamming then their overall business practices are likely unethical and this could lead to trouble down the line   finally one should also research how the company 's clientele has been built up was it through word of mouth or was the client data acquired by other means

i wrote a detailed article on tax loss harvesting to show the impact on returns   for my example i showed a person in the 15 bracket in years with no loss they trade to capture gains at 0 long term rate thus bumping their basis up in years with losses they tax harvest for a 15 effective rebate on that loss   i showed how for the lost decade 2000 2009 a buy and hold would have returned -1 cagr but the tax loss would have gained 1 just 1 for the decade not cagr ending the decade with no loss   as one 's portfolio grows the math changes you can only take $ 3000 capital loss against ordinary income and my example relies on the difference between taking a gain for free but using a loss to offset income note the higher earner would take gains at 15 but losses at 25 but only for the relatively small portfolio the benefit for them is to use loss harvesting to offset gains less so for ordinary income   as the other answer state wealthfront can aid you to do this with no math on your part

the answer to your question depends very much on your definition of long term because let 's make something clear an investment horizon of three to six months is not long term and you need to consider the length of time from when an emergency develops until you will need to tap into the money emergencies almost by definition are unplanned when talking about investment risk the real word that should be used is volatility stocks are n't inherently riskier than bonds issued by the same company they are likely to be a more volatile instrument however this means that while stocks can easily gain 15 20 percent or more in a year if you are lucky as a holder they can also easily lose just as much which is good if you are looking to buy unless the loss is by significantly weaker fundamentals such as earning lookout most of the time stocks rebound and regain lost valuation but this can take some time if you have to sell during that period then you lose money the purpose of an emergency fund is generally to be liquid easily accessible without penalties stable in value and provide a cushion against potentially large unplanned expenses if you live on your own have good insurance rent your home do n't have any major household or other items that might break and require immediate replacement or repair then just looking at your emergency fund in terms of months of normal outlay makes sense if you own your home have dependents lack insurance and have major possessions which you need then you need to factor those risks into deciding how large an emergency fund you might need and perhaps consider not just normal outlays but also some exceptional situations what if the refrigerator and water heater breaks down at the same time that something breaks a few windows for example what if you also need to make an emergency trip near the same time because a relative becomes seriously ill notice that the purpose of the emergency fund is specifically not to generate significant interest or dividend income since it needs to be stable in value not depreciate and liquid an emergency fund will tend towards lower risk and thus lower yield investments the extreme being cash or the for many more practical option of a savings account account forms geared toward retirement savings tend to not be particularly liquid sure you can usually swap out one investment vehicle for another but you ca n't easily withdraw your money without significant penalties if at all bonds are generally more stable in value than stocks which is a good thing for a longer term portion of an emergency fund just make sure that you are able to withdraw the money with short notice without significant penalties and pick bonds issued by stable companies or a fund of investment grade bonds however in the present investment climate this means that you are looking at returns not significantly better than those of a high yield savings account while taking on a certain amount of additional risk bonds today can easily have a place if you have to pick some form of investment vehicle but if you have the option of keeping the cash in a high yield savings account that might actually be a better option any stock market investments should be seen as investments rather than a safety net hopefully they will grow over time but it is perfectly possible that they will lose value if what triggers your financial emergency is anything more than local it is certainly possible to have that same trigger cause a decline in the stock market money that you need for regular expenses even unplanned ones should not be in investments thus you first decide how large an emergency fund you need based on your particular situation then you build up that amount of money in a savings vehicle rather than an investment vehicle once you have the emergency fund in savings then by all means continue to put the same amount of money into investments instead just make sure to if you tap into the emergency fund replenish it as quickly as possible

k welcome to money se   you knew enough to add good tags to the question now you should search on the dozens of questions with those tags to understand in less than an hour far more than that banker knows about credit and credit scores   my advice is first never miss a payment ever the advice your father passed on to you is nonsense plain and simple i 'm just a few chapters shy of being able to write a book about the incorrect advice i 'd heard bank people give their customers the second bit of advice is that you do n't need to pay interest to have credit cards show good payment history i.e. if you choose to use credit cards use them for the convenience cash rebates tracking and guarantees they can offer pay in full each bill   last use a free service first annualcreditreport.com to get a copy of your credit report and then a service like credit karma for a simulated fico score and advice on how to improve it as member has commented discover not just for cardholders offers a look at your actual score as do a number of other credit cards for members   by the way i would n't be inclined to discuss this with dad most people take offense that you 'd believe strangers more than them most of the answers here are well documented with links to irs etc and if not quickly peer reviewed when i make a mistake a top rated member will correct me within a day if not just minutes

from my understanding by paying your bills more than 5 days late will not lead you into bankruptcy or stop you from getting a new loan in the future however it may mean that lenders offer you credit at a higher interest rate this of course would not help you as you are already struggling with your finances however no matter how bad you think things might be for you financially there are always things you can do to improve your situation set a budget the first thing you must do is to set a budget list down all sources of income you receive each month including any allowances then list all your sources of expenses and spending list all your bills such as rent telephone electricity car maintenance credit card and other loans keep a diary for a month for all your discretionary spending including coffees lunches and other odd bits and ends you can also talk with your existing lenders and come to some agreement on reducing you interest rates on your debts and the repayments but remember any reduction in repayments may increase your repayment period and the total interest you have to pay in the long term if you need help setting up your budget here are some links to resources you can download to help you get started once you set up your budget you want your total income to be more than your total expenses if it is n't you will be getting further and further behind each month some things you can do are to increase your income get a job second job sell some unwanted items or start a small home business some things you can do to reduce your expenses make coffees and lunches at home before going out and buying these pay off higher interest debts first consolidate all your debts into a lower interest rate loan reduce discretionary spending to an absolute minimum cancel all unnecessary services etc debt consolidation in regards to a debt consolidation for your existing personal loans and credit cards into a single lower interest rate loan can be a good idea but there are some pitfalls you should consider if you are taking out a loan with a lower interest rate but a longer term to pay it off you may end up paying less in monthly repayments but will end up paying more interest in the long run if you do take this course of action try to keep your term to no longer than your current debt 's terms and try to keep your repayments as high as possible to pay the debt off as soon as possible and reduce any interest you have to pay again be wary of the fine print and read the of any products you are thinking of getting refer to money smart website for more valuable information you should consider before taking out any debt consolidation assistance improving your skills and getting a higher paid job if you are finding it hard to get a job especially one that pays a bit more look into your options of doing a course and improving your skills there is plenty of assistance available for those wanting to improve their skills in order to improve their chances of getting a better job check out centrelink 's website for more information on payments for students and other action you can take if you are finding that the repayments are really getting out of hand and no one will help you with any debt consolidation or reducing your interest rates on your debts as a last resort you can apply for a part 9 debt agreement but be very careful as this is an alternative to bankruptcy and like bankruptcy a debt agreement will appear on your credit file for seven years and your name will be listed on the national personal insolvency index forever further assistance and help if you have trouble reading any or want further information or help regarding any issues i have raised or any other part of your financial situation you can contact centrelink 's financial information service they provide a free and confidential service that provides education and information on financial and lifestyle issues to all australians learn how to manage your money so you can get out of your debt and can lead a much more comfortable and less stressful life into the future

answers to your questions 1 do bank account numbers have a checksum no 2 is it plausible that they found out your number after sending you the money by accident no there is no way to find out who possesses a particular bank account just by the number also how they even know they made a mistake they targeted you and knew who you were and your bank account number before the money was sent 3 and 4 is this a scam yes they never paid you any money they forged a check for a large amount and deposited it in an account then divided it up wiring pieces to multiple people all of whom they investigated beforehand since it is a bank to bank transfer it clears once the forgery is discovered all the transfers will be unwound if you had sent them money you would have lost that money other things to note there is zero chance of a wire transfer going to the wrong person because the sender has to list the name and address on the account as well as the number you basically did the right thing which is to notify your bank that you received an unauthorized transfer into your account never accept money into your account from someone you do n't know if money appears in your account tell the bank it is an error and probably proceeds from a forgery and they will take care of it

your suggestion seems a bit too extreme handing auditing responsibility to a government body agency would just create its own set of problems and other conflicts of interest for example opinions could be subject to politics increased bureaucracy laziness due to monopoly hell if the government audited the statements they would have the power to authorize only accounting policies that maximized a company 's tax payout   the audit only firm proposal by the european commission seems to be the more reasonable solution to try to avoid conflicts of interest firms that audit companies are less likely to issue adverse qualified opinions on them since those companies were simply following the firms own consulting advice which seems to be the heart of the problem even though the sox nearly eliminated that but if the audit business was effectively separated from accounting firms other practices and audit only companies sprung up then other problems would arise audit only firms would still be unwilling to piss major clients off by issuing qualified opinions and lose future business also since the audit business is not really the present firms money maker costs to audit would only increase to ensure that audit only firms are profitable

having savings only in your home currency is relatively low risk compared with other types of low diversification this is because in a simple case your future cash outflows will be in your home currency so if the gbp fluctuates in value it will theoretically still buy you the same goods at home in this way keeping your savings in the same currency as your future expenditures creates a natural hedge against currency fluctuation this gets complicated for goods imported from other countries where base price fluctuates based on a foreign currency or for situations where you expect to incur significant foreign currency expenditures retirement elsewhere etc in such cases you no longer have certainty that your future expenditures will be based on the gbp and saving money in other currencies may make more sense in many circumstances diversification of the currency of your savings may actually increase your risk not decrease it be sure you are doing this for a specific reason with a specific strategy and not just to generally spread your money around even in case of a brexit consider what would you do with a bank account full of usd if the answer is convert it back to gbp when needed in 6 months 5 years 30 etc to buy british goods then i would n't call this a way to reduce your risk instead i would call it a type of investment with its own set of risks associated

much of what you 're asking will not be disclosed for obvious security reasons so do n't be surprised when call center people say they do n't know   they may actually not know but even if they did they 'd be fired if they were to say anything   nothing could be a subject than online security for the financial institutions i do n't know of reliable sources for the data you 're asking about and i do n't know the banks or other firms would release it   for a bank to talk about its incidence rates of fraud would be unusual because none of these institutions wants to appear less safe than their competitors   if there 's any information out there then it 's going to be pretty vague   none of these institutions wants the bad guys to know what their degree of success is against one bank versus any other   i hope that makes sense the smaller banks usually piggyback their data on the networks of the larger financial institutions so they are as secure as a general rule as the larger banks networks they 're running on   also your transactions on your credit cards are not generally handled directly by your bank anyway unless it 's one of the big like chase or bank of america   all transactions run through merchant processors who act as intermediaries between merchants and the banks and those guys are pretty damned good at security   i 've met some of the programmers and they 're impressive to me i 've been a programmer for 35 years and ca n't put a finger on these guys most banks require that you must provide proof of identity when opening an account and that id must me the standards of the usa real id act   here 's an excerpt from the department of homeland security website on what real id is passed by congress in 2005 the real id act enacted the 9/11 commission ’s recommendation that the federal government set standards for the issuance of sources of identification such as driver 's licenses the act established minimum security standards for state issued driver ’s licenses and identification cards and prohibits federal agencies from accepting for official purposes licenses and identification cards from states that do not meet these standards states have made considerable progress in meeting this key recommendation of the 9/11 commission and every state has a more secure driver ’s license today than before the passage of the act in order for banks to qualify for fdic protection they must comply with the real id standards when opening accounts as with any business especially online the most effective way to minimize fraud is vigilant monitoring of data   banks and other online financial entities have become very adept at pattern analysis and simply knowing where and what to look for when dealing with their customers   there are certainly sophisticated measures which are kept carefully out of the public eye for doing this and obviously they 're good at it   they have to be right there 's no way to completely eliminate fraud too much incentive exists for the bad guys to not constantly search for new ways to run their schemes and the good guys will always be at the disadvantage because there 's no way to anticipate everything anyone might come up with   just look at online and malware   your antivirus software can only deal with what it knows about and the bad guys are always coming up with some new variant that gets past the filters until the antivirus maker learns of it and comes up with a way to deal with it your question 's a good one to ponder and i would n't want to be the chief of internet security for a bank or online institution because i 'd lay awake at night pondering when the call 's going to come that we finally ran out of luck grin i hope this was helpful good luck

as long as you paid 90 of the taxes you owed you are good and there will be no negative consequences these calculations are supposed to help you find the right amount not to bind you to it so you do n't need to worry too much about the most common problem is that people underpay and not come up to the 90 limit and do n't have the cash to pay when tax day comes if you happen to come in under 90 which will come out when you file taxes you will owe interest for the underpayment as you should have paid it some time ago typically 0.5 per month also up to 10 in addition depending on the situation this is expensive so you should avoid it and playing to hit is dangerous better try to hit about 100 and use the 90 limit as safety margin as intended

if you are investing for 10 years then you just keep buying at whatever price the fund is at this is called dollar cost averaging if the fund is declining in value from when you first bought it then when you buy more the average price you bought in at is now lower so therefore your losses are lower and when it goes back up you will make more even if it continues to decline in value then you keep adding more money in periodically eventually your position will be so large that on the first uptick you will have a huge percent gain anyway this is only suggested because you are in it for 10 years other people 's investment goals vary

the current fed 's spend is to encourage spends by putting in more liquidity some of this funds directly or indirectly reach emerging markets and get invested in stocks so without these forex inflows the balance of payments would be under pressure so these forex are artificially keeping the exchange rate down for example the usd vs inr rate was in the range of 1 usd to around inr 50 for nearly 4 5 years in the period the inflation in india was around 10 15 so ideally the rate should have slowly moved towards inr 60 however it took a news of fed cut back to more the rates in the range of inr 65 before stabilizing to rs 60

if you have a great technical trading system that gets you winning trading 80 85 of the time in backtesting the question should be why are you not trading it to get a better idea of how good your trading system is you should work out your expectancy per trade this will tell you how much you should make on average for every trade you take expectancy not only considers your win rate but also you win size to loss size ratio for example if you are getting winning trades 80 of the time but your average win size is $ 100 and your 20 of losses average $ 500 then you will still be losing money you should be aiming for an average win size of at least 2.5 to 3 times you average loss size this will provide you a profitable trading system even if your win rate is 50 if your trading system is really that good and provides a win size of at least 2.5 times your loss size then you should be actively trading it also if you put your trading system out there in the public domain together with your trading results you will actually find that quite opposite to what the consensus above is your results from your trading plan should actually improve further the more people acting on the outcome of a signal in the same direction the higher the probability that the movement in the desired direction will actually occur if you are looking to make money from your trading ideas no one will pay anything unless you have real results to back it up so if you are so confident about your system you should start trading it with real money of course you should start off small and build it up over time as your results as per your simulations

basically you have 4 options use your cash to pay off the student loans put your cash in an interest bearing savings account invest your cash for example in the stock market spend your cash on fun stuff you want right now the more you can avoid 4 the better it will be for you in the long term but you 're apparently wise enough that that was n't included as an option in your question to decide between 1 2 and 3 the key questions are   what interest are you paying on the loan versus what return could you get on savings or investment   how much risk are you willing to take how much cash do you need to keep on hand for unexpected expenses what are the tax implications basically if you are paying 2 interest on a loan and you can get 3 interest on a savings account then it makes sense to put the cash in a savings account rather than pay off the loan you 'll make more on the interest from the savings account than you 'll pay on interest on the loan if the best return you can get on a savings account is less than 2 then you are better off to pay off the loan however you probably want to keep some cash reserve in case your car breaks down or you have a sudden large medical bill etc how much cash you keep depends on your lifestyle and how much risk you are comfortable with i do n't know what country you live in at least here in the u.s. a savings account is extremely safe even the bank goes bankrupt your money should be insured you can probably get a much better return on your money by investing in the stock market but then your returns are not guaranteed you may even lose money personally i do n't have a savings account i put all my savings into fairly safe stocks because savings accounts around here tend to pay about 1 which is hardly worth even bothering you also should consider tax implications if you 're a new grad maybe your income is low enough that your tax rates are low and this is a minor factor but if you are in say a 25 marginal tax bracket then the effective interest rate on the student loan would be more like 1.5 that is if you pay $ 20 in interest the government will then take 25 of that off your taxes so it 's the equivalent of paying $ 15 in interest similarly a place to put your money that gives non taxable interest like municipal bonds gives a better real rate of return than something with the same nominal rate but where the interest is taxable

the problem is that both the h1b and l1 visas have problems and are gamed and this is what is probably causing resentment   h1b visas have quotas that run out in one day a year it means for a company to employ someone with skills they need to throw a bunch of them at this yearly crap shoot and hope they manage to win a visa for one of them   the rest will have to wait another year to try again   this is not how businesses employ if they find a highly skilled foreign worker with skills they ca n't find in the us and are even willing to pay him more than anyone in the us they ca n't unless they want to play that yearly gamble   a highly skilled employee also do n't want to sit around waiting for it so they 'll work for someone else   the l1 visa at least allows large multi national companies to first employ people at one of their foreign offices for a year before them over to the us   it 's also good in a way to be able to figure out if the employee is as good as he seems on paper and in interviews even before he gets to the usa   this means most of the better skills probably enter the usa this way which leaves the h1b visas to who systematically game the system   they find a lot of young graduate applicants who are willing to wait for the yearly crapshoot and then take all those who win a visa and then employ them and contract them out competitively   the l1 visa can also be systematically gamed those who do n't win an h1b visa could be working for a foreign office of this consultancy in the meantime and then get a transfer to the usa on an l1 visa   i think what needs to happen is that the h1b visa bar should be raised e.g. a minimum salary and then the quotas should be spread over a year like they do in the uk   that means companies have more certainty that they can actually bring a skilled worker in and it would make sure it 's a skilled worker and not someone who is just a cheaper worker   then that would ideally shift the route for most skilled workers to h1b instead of l1 visas which means l1 visas can be tightened to make sure they are used appropriately too for example having to have worked for the company for 2 years instead of one and also a minimum salary

typically businesses always charge their home currency so if the shop is in canada you will pay canadian dollars normally you do n't have any choices either your credit card company will convert it to your currency using the current international currency exchange rate pretty good plus a potential fee between 0 and 5 depending on your credit card not so good if it is a significant amount or you plan to do that more than once and if you have multiple credit cards check first to see which one has the lowest international fee 0 is not uncommon but neither is 3 or 4 if it 's a 10 $ it 's probably not worth the time but 4 of 1000 is already 40 $ as of right now the currency exchange rate is 1.33 so you would pay usd plus the potential fee 0 $ understand that this exchange rate is floating continuously it probably wo n't change much but it will change

i have been in a very similar place like that before as an intern and got the hell out quickly   let me try to paint a picture   on the 12th floor of a random nyc building there will be a large office floor with long desks in several rows   around the outside against the windows will be maybe some empty conference rooms random senior people you wo n't be allowed to talk to and a poor miserable compliance guy stuck in a somewhere   each desk will have a phone and a call sheet   there wo nt be many computers anywhere maybe one bloomberg machine in the back   every single person in there is on the phone   in fact that will be your job   starting at sharp you will be at your desk   at 8 you will start dialing the call sheet put on your desk   if it is a bunch of residences you will get angry house wives because their husbands are at work do nt pitch the bitch next call you will get someone that passed away 2 years ago mark your sheet dead and cross out as you are dialing the next number   if you manage to get someone that answers their own phone at work and listens to a pitch you will now get the opportunity to give a pitch on why a mid market dividend paying stock is fantastic and should be bought now   now as in you have to open a brokerage account on the first call for no less than a $ 5k trade   you will pitch them on why they do nt need to ask their wife why you will bring them great ideas   ask them what is their net worth have they ever hired a broker over the phone qualify them or get hung up on   anything short of them threatening to call the sec and you before hanging up means you will be sure to call them again a prospect actually picking up the phone is about a 1 in 20 dial event   people just slamming the phones on you call them back for fun because you got disconnected     if you ever manage to get a client you will be charging them enormous percentages and fees to do simple trades but do nt worry you probably wo nt get a client in the first 2 months and even if you manage to get clients it will be maybe one or two a month   think about the sheer volume of calls you have to make 300 400 calls a day is probably a normal pace    you will meet the most insane people   people will go down for lunch or coffee and never return to the office   most of the people there you wonder how they ever passed a series 7   there are people that fail the 7 3 times and quit   there will be a guy that opens 10 accounts a month and actually will be talking with two phones up to his ears at once           this is the definition of a high pressure sales job

this depends on what the alternative is your loan of .99 is very favorable rate if you have the 15,000 right now but only hold it in your checking account or cash then you might as well just pay it all you have an adequate emergency fund paying the debt off sooner will save you on interest currently if you pay the minimum you will pay a total of $ by the end of the loan a $ 230 premium to $ 15,000 math credit goes to   joe if you have an investment vehicle you feel can successfully yield more then .99 you might want to consider investing that money instead while paying the minimum on your car loan also be sure to check the .99 is not an introductory rate which increases later on it comes down to whether you can get a better return then .99 investing that money or whether you rather just pay off the debt and not worry about it if you do n't want to bother investing the money than just pay it off i also assumed you have no other revolving debt with a higher apr if you do first pay off the higher apr debt

look at price book value and there are more than a few stocks that may have a p b under 1 so this does happen there are at least a couple of other factors you are n't considering here current liabilities how much money is the company losing each quarter that may cause it to sell repeatedly if the company is burning through $ 100 million quarter that asset is only going to keep the lights on for another 2.5 years so consider what assumptions you make about the company 's cash flow here the asset itself is the price really fixed or could it be flexible could the asset seen as being worth $ 1 billion today be worth much less in another year or two as an example suppose the asset was a building and then real estate values drop by 40 in that area now what was worth $ 1 billion may now be worth only $ 600 million as something of a final note you do n't state where the $ 100 million went that the company received as if that was burned for operations now the company 's position on the asset is $ 900 million as it only holds a 90 stake though i 'd argue my 2 previous points are really worth noting the following 6 stocks are trading at or below 0.5 x book value sep 2013 has a half dozen examples of how this is possible if the $ 100 million was used to pay off debt then the company does n't have that cash and thus its assets are reduced by the cash that is gone depending on what the plant is producing the value may or may not stay where it is if you want an example to consider how would you price automobile plants these days if the company experiences a reduction in demand the plant may have to be sold off at a reduced price for a cynic 's view here

the property tax valuation and the fair market price are not one and the same   they track each other correlate to each other but are almost never the same number in some parts of the usa a municipality has to re assess property tax values every ten years   in these places the tax value of a property is on something like a 10-year moving average not on the volatile daily market price edit   it is easy to fall into the trap of thinking that property tax valuation is intended to represent fair market value   it 's intent is to provide an accurate or as accurate as possible relative valuation of your property compared to the other properties in the municipality the sum of all the property values is the tax base of the municipality   when the town budget which is paid in part via property taxes is set the town simply divides the tax base into the budget total to arrive at the ratio of tax to collect to the tax base also called the tax rate per thousand dollars of valuation   i.e. if the town tax base is us$ 10,000,000 and the town budget is us$ 500,000 then the ratio is 0.05 or $ 50 per thousand dollars of valuation   if your property is assessed at us$ 100,000 then you would pay 100 x $ 50 or $ 5000 in property taxes that year since this is the goal of the property tax valuation not deciding what your house is worth on the open market then we are left with the question of why use the market value of a house for property assessment and the answer is that of all the various schemes and algorithms you can try fair market value is the easiest and most accurate if time are taken out   for example if i buy a house in a development for $ 250,000 today and next summer the housing market crashes and you buy the identical house next door to me for $ 150,000 it does not stand to reason that you should pay less taxes than me because your house is worth $ 100,000 less   in fact both our houses are worth $ 100,000 less what matters most in property tax valuation is n't the actual number but rather is your valuation the same as other essentially similar properties in your tax base   getting the relative ratio of value between you and your neighbors correct is the goal of property tax valuation

from chase faq it looks like this is a regular ach transfer ach transactions can be reversed under certain conditions i have n't been able to find some authoritative link on this so i suggest this budgeting blog instead allowed reasons you can have ach transactions reversed for one of three reasons under    the rules wrong money amount wrong account or    transactions for example if your mortgage bill is for $ but    your lender 's website messes up and you 're charged $ the    transaction is reversible it because it 's the wrong dollar amount if    the website charges you $ twice the second    transaction is reversible reversal procedures you might have to bring a mistake to the originator 's attention to get    it fixed only the originator the person or company taking or    sending money can ask for a reversal for example if you have a    transaction for a wrong dollar amount from your lender 's website the    originator is the lender an originator is supposed to send the    reversal within 24 hours of the error 's discovery and within five    banking days of the original transaction when a reversal is required    because of a wrong amount or wrong account the originator must send a    correcting entry with the right information bank 's responsibility a bank should honor an ach reversal even if it means debiting a    customer 's account again because of a correcting transaction however    the bank does n't have to debit your account if you closed it or the    new transaction would overdraw it your bank does have to tell you if    a correcting entry is going to take money out of your account but the    bank does n't need your permission to do it

# 589602
the first two answers to this are very good but i feel like there are a couple of points they left out that were a little too long for comments first off take a look at the expense percentage the load fees and the average turnover ratio for the funds in your retirement account assuming they are mutual funds having low expense fees < 1 preferably and turnover ratios will help tremendously because those eat into returns whether the value of the fund goes up or down the load fees either incoming or outgoing will lower the amount of money you actually put in and get out of the fund there are thousands of no load funds and most that have a backend load for taking the money out have clauses that lower that percentage to zero over several years it is mostly there to keep people from trying to swing trade with mutual funds and pull their money out too quickly   the last thing i would suggest is to look at diversifying the holdings in your account bond funds have been up this year even though the stock market has done poorly and they provide interest income that can increase the amount of shares you own even when the value of the bonds might have gone down

there will quickly come a time when buying to rebalance is impractical consider you save 10 and at some point you have 5x your income saved you earn $ 50 k and have accumulated $ 250 k a simple allocation 50/50 so $ 125 k stock $ 125 k bonds now in a year the market is up much over 4 your $ 5 k deposit will not be enough to balance earlier on the method may work just fine later on not so much edit the above is an example to show that there will come a time when deposits are not enough to rebalance the above single year produces a split and the rebalance deposits more than 2 years if the market continues to rise a reasonable amount 2 years later you are even more out of balance perhaps   i chose reasonable numbers as a starting point just 5x income saved and a 10 annual deposit in the end you can waive off any divergence from your target that 's your choice

many web sites and articles warn against buying former rental cars    because people renting these cars often them rental cars are typically driven by people over 25 these are typically people with some financial means air travel credit card additionally rental cars are subject to frequent inspection and likely to be on tighter maintenance schedules than many owners would keep so while some people may drive a rental harder than they would their own car it 's not typical and not likely to result in some hidden damage that makes a rental less desirable all else being equal on the used car market does the fact that they sell the car mean during this time suggest that they know the car 's cost of further maintenance or other costs will be higher or is there another reason they sell at this time which has a calculated advantage to them but which is less than idea statistically for me the purchaser rental companies buy at incredible volumes as such some manufacturers have programs where they will buy back used cars from the rental company at a set price and/or time other incentives are guaranteed depreciation wherein the manufacturer will make up the difference if the used vehicle does n't sell for a set percentage of it 's purchase price after a set amount of time outside of these incentive programs rental companies also get substantial volume discounts and they typically are buying base models which hold value better than their higher trim counterparts according to kbb market analyst so the conventional wisdom about depreciation does n't really apply the timing of their sales is primarily based on their purchasing arrangements and their desire to keep an up to date fleet not on projected maintenance repair costs the best you can do with any used car purchase is to test drive get a pre purchase inspection and review whatever history is available

it depends on how immediately you think you 'll need your emergency fund cash if you anticipate running into problems where you need cash right away e.g. you live paycheck to paycheck and your car breaks down a lot put it into a checking or money market account if you do n't think your emergencies will require immediate access to cash e.g. unemployment then put it in a savings account or cd if there is a lot of money in your accounts that goes unused and you want a bigger safety net then consider investing it though it 's generally a better idea to pay off debts at this point i think the best idea is to split your emergency fund between your checking and savings maybe 20 checking and 80 savings that way you have some extra cash on hand when you need it while most of your money is growing in savings

without reading the source from your description it seems that the author believes that this particular company was undervalued in the marketplace it seems that investors were blinded by a small dividend without considering the actual value of the company they were owners of remember that a shareholder has the right to their proportion of the company 's net value and that amount will be distributed both a in the form of dividends and b on liquidation of the company   theoretically eps is an indication of how much value an investor 's single share has increased by in the year of course this is not accurate because accounting income does not directly correlate with company value increase but it is a good indicator this means in this example that each share had a return of $ 10 of which the investors only received $ 1 the remainder sat in the company for further investment considering that liquidation may never happen particularly within the time frame that a particular investor wants to hold a share some investors may undervalue share return that does not come in the form of a dividend this may or may not be legitimate because if the company reinvests its profits in poorer performing projects the investors would have been better off getting the dividend immediately however some value does need to be given to the non dividend ownership of the company it seems the author believes that investors failing to consider value of the non dividend part of the corporation 's shares in question led to an of the company 's shares in the market

re a trader when buying needs to buy at the ask price and when selling needs to sell    at the bid price so how can a trade happen in between the bid and ask saying the trade can happen in between the bid ask is simplistic   there is a time dimension to the market   it 's more accurate to say that an order can be placed in between the current best bid ask observed at time t=0 thus establishing a new level for one or the other of those quoted prices observed at time if you enter a market order to buy or sell then yes you 'll generally be accepting the current best ask or best bid with your order because that 's what a market order says to do accept the current best market price being offered for your kind of transaction   of course prices may move much faster than your observation of the price and the time it takes to process your order you 're far from being the only participant market orders aside you are free to name your own price above or below the current best bid ask respectively then one could say that you are placing an order in between the bid and ask at the time your order is placed   however and this is key you are also moving one or the other of those quoted prices in the process of placing your above bid buy order or your below ask sell order then only if somebody else in the market chooses to accept your new ask or bid does your intended transaction take place and that transaction takes place at the new ask or bid price not the old one that was current when you entered your order read more about bid ask prices at this other question p.s fwiw i do n't necessarily agree with the assertion from the article you quoted i.e. by looking for trades that take place in between the bid and ask you can tell when a strong trend is about to come to an end   i would say maybe perhaps but maybe not

only select items first i agree beware the factor any of those items may very well lead to greater consumption which will impact your worse than your bottom line and in this category chips and snacks in general you 'll typically get twice the size bag for the same price as supermarket for a large family this might work ok if one is interested in saving on grocery items the very first step is to get familiar with the unit cost often cents per ounce of most items you buy warehouse store or not this knowledge will make you a better buyer   in general the toiletries are cheaper than at the store but not as cheap as the big sale coupon cost at the supermarket or pharmacy cvs so if you pay attention you may always be stocked up from other sources all that said there are many items that easily cover our membership cost for costco the meat beef $ i can pay up to $ 18 at the supermarket or big 12 to the lb $ easily $ 15 at fish dept funny i buy the carrots mentioned they are less than half supermarket price per lb so i am ahead if we throw out the last 1/4 of the bag more often than not it 's used up 100   truth is everyone will have a different experience at these stores costco will refund membership up to the very end so why not try it and see if the visit is worth it last year i read and wrote a review of a book titled the paradox of choice the book 's premise was the diminishing return that come with too many things to choose from in my review i observed how a benefit of costco is the lack of choice there 's one or two brands for most items not dozens if you give this a bit of thought it 's actually a benefit

what you say about monetary velocity is true but i do n't think its the whole story banks also create money by lending out their deposits if i put $ 1000 in my account and the bank lends out $ 500 of it i still have my $ 1000 on deposit but someone else is also spending an extra $ 500 if the banks are lending less then this effect is reduced and the volume of money reduces as well as its velocity

this all happens at once and quickly not in order   so the hft floods the exchange with orders this is independent of anything they would be doing this no matter what simply in anticipation of finding someone who will want what they 're trying to buy    they then notice someone wants what they have a buy order for they at the same time cancel all orders that do n't fit this criteria at the same time they 're testing this guy to see what his price is so while they 're testing this guy they 're cancelling all orders that are above his strike price for that stock they let the right order go through for a lower price if they ca n't get a lower price they just forget it however they probably can because they were in line first they 're buying before this guy and after they know what he wants to pay     then they sell it to him

this is exactly how monopolies are made   allowing a business to use one extremely profitable business to undercut competitors in other areas at below cost mind you   this should be illegal practice   google should be hit hard   while i understand your stance i do n't believe it is creating an equal playing field in the economy and it is hurting it badly    for example no startup out there is going to create an online maps startup even if they have an awesome idea that would make maps better because they do n't have the ability to monetize and survive   google gives their 's away free using their near monopoly on online advertising to subsidize it   you talk about the only exit for a startup being acquired by a larger company   that is exactly the problem   you 're creating unbeatable   google msft apple fb will only grow startups will only have 10 20 companies to exit to   they should be able to survive and grow and compete on their own    groupon was a company that tried to do that and you can see how they 're doing   the tech world is turning into that very oligopoly that you try to caveat    people just do n't realize it     we should break the stranglehold   if people paid for services then their would be more entrants into the market as they could monetize quicker and the best ideas would win vs. the best connections to vcs and having an entrepreneurial track history which is how the bay area works   startups would n't be so dependent on financiers they could monetize their actual client base

a utma may or may not fit your situation the main drawbacks to a utma account is that it will count against your child for financial aid it counts as the child 's asset the second thing to consider is that taxes are n't deferred like in a 529 plan the last problem of course is that when he turns 18 he gets control of the account and can spend the money on random junk which may or may not be important to you a 529 plan has a few advantages over a utma account the grandparents can open the account with your son as the beneficiary and the money does n't show up on financial aid for college under current law which could change of course earnings grow tax free which will net you more total growth you can also contribute substantially more without triggering the gift tax also many states provide a state tax break for contributing to the state sponsored 529 plan the account owner would be the grandparents so junior ca n't spend the money on teenage junk the big downside to the 529 is the 10 penalty if the money is n't used for higher education the flip side is that if the money is left for 20 years you will also have additional growth from the 20 years of tax free growth which may be a wash depending on your tax bracket and the tax rates in effect over those 20 years

why do people always seem to forget that plenty of people went and studied all sorts of wacky topics in university during the 1960s and 1970s and paid no more for tuition housing food etc than a minimum wage job could support in up front cash       the problem is n't going to study 4 years of dance the problem is the government induced tuition inflation that will give someone $ 50k in government backed loans to go study 4 years of dance get the freaking government out of the tuition inflation business already and let people go study 4 years of dance for $ 1k year if they so desire       if you do n't believe that nearly 100 of tuition inflation is caused by government backed loans then ask yourself what kind of investor in their right mind would freely lend $ 50k in unsecured funds to someone to study 4 years of dance

let me start with a somewhat sarcastic statement there are probably as many things done to analyze a stock as there are people doing the analysis that said at a general level an analyst researches the historical performance of the company at a fairly detailed level operations within divisions of the company product development cycles within divisions expenses vs income trends for each division and product marketing costs customer acquisition costs etc gathers information about what the company is doing now and planning to do in the future often by a discussion with principles at the company establishes a view on related macro economic trends sector and industry trends demographic trends etc and combines it all to forecast a change in revenues margins free cash flow dividends etc over a period of time    they then apply statistics that relate those numbers to stock price in order to imply stock prices and price ranges over those same periods   finally depending on how those stock prices compare to the current stock price they 'll classify the stock as buy sell hold etc this sounds like alot of work    and it generally is if you get detailed about it which is what professionals or significant money managers are doing    however there are also lots of arm chair analysts posting their output on any number of financial sites seeking alpha motley fool etc if you 'd like to really explore the range of detail some people consider as a stock analysis   that sounds more negative than i intended it to be so let me clarify that i think some of these write ups are really quite good imo

if the rate of interest on both loans is 6.5 it does not make any difference against which loan you offset if you offset it with 50 k loan you will close it sooner i am assuming your 50 k loan is of shorter tenure compared to the 300 k without considering offset the overall interest looks larger if you close the shorter loan vs closing the larger loan however the net effect is the same if you start putting out the balance $ 400 to the 300 k loan after you have closed it out

many of my friends turn to me for financial advice and here 's what i always tell them because it 's super effective for me 1 i opened an online bank account with scottrade for which i did not request a card or checks i set up direct deposit straight to that account it would be a complicated pain to take money out of that savings the only time i did so was to buy my house which was the purpose of the savings and it involved a wire transfer and printing of the form to fill out and it in etc i have continued to use the account to save for my second house i basically completely forget that the account is even there or that i am missing a large chunk of my money 2 it is very important to actually budget for spending money to continue to spend on impulse items basically allow yourself to spend money on yourself but in a controlled way decide a specific amount that you want to put in a separate account that is just for you to spend to your hearts content and have it direct deposit i find and dave ramsey also encourages this that when i know how much money i am going to blow i feel much more in control and it causes me to not get carried away and blow more than i realized take this a step further decide specifically what you want to buy for yourself and label the account accordingly for example i decided back in march that i wanted to buy an xbox one for when star wars comes out this november i calculated exactly how much money i would need at that time figured how many paychecks i would receive until then and did the math to determine exactly how much i need to direct deposit into an account just for saving to buy the xbox and game i use and i can actually rename the account as it is displayed so i called it xbox fund seeing that title a reminder of what i really want encourages me to not touch it what is your goal behind wanting to save money better what are you saving for label your account accordingly so you do n't just see it as money but as progress

i have an answer and a few comments back to the basics   insurance is purchased to provide protection in case of a loss it sounds as though you are doing well from a financial perspective if you have $ 0 of financial obligations loans mortgages credit cards etc and you are comfortable with the amount that would be passed on to your heirs then you do not need life insurance life insurance is protection for your heirs so that they can pay off debts and pay for necessities if you are the bread winner and your assets wo n't be enough that 's all life insurance should never be viewed as an investment vehicle some policies allow you to invest in funds of your choosing but the fees charged by the insurance company are usually high higher than you might find elsewhere to answer your other question i think ny life is a great life insurance company they are a mutual company which is better in my opinion than a stock company because they are okay with holding extra capital this means they are more likely to have the money to pay all of their claims in a specific period which shows in their ratings whereas public companies will yield a lower return to their stock holders if they are just sitting on additional capital and not paying it back to their stock holders

i am not a financial advisor but i an tell you what i did in exactly this situation which is pretty much what you are proposing   i put money into the offset savings account until i had only a small amount of mortgage balance left less than a year 's worth of mortgage payments then i set it up so that each month i did the transfer from the offset savings pot into the mortgage itself this depleted the offset savings in line with the mortgage debt and the interest on the two balanced out almost to zero this was self sustaining and meant that i kept the same margin owing over time i.e. if i was in this situation for 5 years for the whole 5 years i would effectively have 1 year remaining on the mortgage meanwhile since i now did n't have any mortgage outgoings from my regular income i put any spare money into isa savings no need to withdraw money from the mortgage to move to the isa the benefits of this as opposed to just paying off the damn mortgage already were that i kept the full liquidity of the mortgage amount i could withdraw all the offset savings pot if i wanted to although i would then have to have funded the mortgage payments differently and as that liquidity went down over time i was building up other savings in parallel it worked well for me it almost does n't matter what the offset mortgage rate is since you are effectively paying it off by keeping the offset savings pot so high

almost any kind of tax will cause market distortions if market distortions discourage activities which would have produced wealth society will lose out not only on the money which was taken by the tax but also on the wealth which could have been but was n't produced if those setting tax policy seek to maximize the amount of revenue that is made available for each dollar that the tax costs society taxing money which is being used to produce more wealth will go against that goal   further most of the things that companies do with their money to produce wealth end up generating taxable income for someone   if a company deducts from its taxes the money it pays to an employee who then has to pay taxes on that money the government ends up collecting about the same taxes as it would collect if the company did n't hire the employee and thus did n't take the deduction the effects of taxes on markets should be one of the most important factors considered when setting tax policy if one tax would cost society $ 1.05 for every dollar raised and another would cost society $ 5.00 for every dollar raised a wise policy would favor the first over the second   unfortunately politics often dominates over economic rationality

i have n't read the terms here but the question may not have a good answer   that wo n't stop me from trying    call the real rate interest rate inflation and you 'll have what is called negative real rates it 's rare for the overnight real rate to be negative   if you check the same sources for historical data you 'll find it 's usually higher   this is because borrowing money is usually done to gain an economic benefit ie make a profit   that is no longer a consideration when borrowing money short term and is imo a serious problem   this will cause poor investment decisions like you see in housing notice i said overnight rate   that is the only rate set by the boc and the longer rates are set by the market   the central bank has some influence because a longer term is just a series of shorter terms but if you looked up the rate on long canadian real return bonds you 'd see them with a real rate around 1 what happens when the central bank raise or lowers rates will depend on the circumstances   the rate in india is so high because they are using it to defend the rupee   if people earn more interest they have a preference to buy that currency rather than others   however these people are n't stupid they realize it 's the real rate that matters   that 's why japan can get away with very low rates and still have demand for the currency they have or had deflation   when that changed the preference for their currency changed so if canada forex driven inflation then the boc will have to raise rates to defend the dollar for the purpose of lowering inflation from imports   whether it works or not is another story   note that the canadian dollar is very dependant on the total dollar value of net oil exports if canada has inflation due too an accelerating economy this implies that there are profitable opportunities so businesses and individuals will be more likely to pay a positive real rate of interest   in that scenario the demand for credit money will drive the real rate of return

first you need to figure out what your objectives for the money are   mostly this boils down to how soon you are going to need the money   if you are as you say very busy and you do n't need the money until retirement i 'd suggest putting your money in a single target date fund such as the blackrock fund   you figure out when you are going to retire and put your money in that fund   the fund will then pick a mix of stocks bonds and other investments adjusting the risk for your time horizon maybe your objectives are different and you want to become an trader   you value being able to say at a bbq oh i bought aapl at $ 20 or i think small caps are over valued   i 'd suggest you take your $ 50,000 and structure it so you invest $ 5,000 a year over 10 years   nothing teaches you about investing like making or losing a bit of money in the market   if you put it all in at once you risk losing it all well before you 've learned many valuable lessons which only the market can teach you i 'd suggest you study the efficient market hypothesis before studying specific markets or strategies

what exactly is call protection is no normal for a cd    a callable cd or one without protection can be revoked before maturity by the issuer for example if interest rates drop they might recall the cd since they can borrow money at a lower rate a callable cd should offer a better return in exchange for this is first coupon date the first time it actually pays interest    yes given that the first coupon date is in 6 months and it 's semiannual is it fair to assume that this pays every six months    yes given that the maturity date is this is really a 15-year cd right    it depends cds can be resold on the market so it is at least a 15 year cd it could also be a 20 year cd originally issued in 2005 what does price ask mean it says 100 does that mean you buy in chunks of $ 100    yes more accurately they are $ 100 per cd   what is yield to worst ask is this the worst yield that this cd will return    the lowest potential yield that can be received on a bond without the issuer actually defaulting 3.25 is the best yield i 've seen from something as stable as a cd would it be silly though to lock money up in an investment like this for 15 years      there is no way to really say without a crystal ball if you are n't willing to accept more risk and think that interest rates will remain at these historic lows for a long while then it is probably a good deal if you think interest rates are due to go up substantially then it is probably smarter to ladder your investments in shorter term cds in investment circles this is known as interest rate risk

really this is no different from any kind of large lump sum and having a mortgage   there are probably many questions and answers on this subject   it really does n't matter that the proceeds were the result of a sale an inheritance would not change the answer i think it is important to note that the proceeds will not eliminate the house 2 mortgage a high level choice of investment one makes is between equity such as stock and debt investments such as bonds and mortgages   you are in a unique case of being able to invest in your own mortgage with no investment fee   this may tip the scales in favor of paying down the mortgage    it is difficult to answer in your specific case as we do n't know the rest of your finances   do you have a sizable 401 k that is heavily invested in stocks   do you have the need for a college fund   do you have an emergency fund   do you have a desire to own several homes generating income property if it was me i 'd do the following in order skipping steps i may have already completed i 've heard that the bank may agree to a one time adjustment to lower the payments on mortgage 2 because of paying a very large payment is this something that really happens i really kind of hate this attitude   your goal is to get rid of the mortgage in a timely manner   doing such makes paying for kids college a snap reduces the income one might need in retirement basically eliminates the need for life insurance and gives one a whole lot of money to have fun with

the whole concept of spending a fraudulent check is misleading both in practice and legally there are two separate transactions you not receiving funds by depositing a fraudulent check and you sending a cash transfer further on regarding the fraudulent check generally your bank is responsible in the sense that it 's their responsibility to recover the money from you it will not receive any money from the bank that supposedly issued the fake check and if they give it to you you spend all that money and are unable to pay it back that 's their problem and not of the other institutions regarding the cash transfer from the bank point of view it 's solely your responsibility it was really you who made that payment you explicitly authorised instructed the banks to deliver money to the recipient and none of those banks have the duty to return it you have been defrauded by the recipient of this payment and may attempt to recover the money from the fraudster but that 's not particularly likely to happen even in the case of a successful arrest and conviction   very fast reaction with involvement of police may block the vendor 's account before they are able to withdraw the money if that is the case you might be able to recover your money or part of it

it 's legal in fact they are required to do this assuming you are in fact a hce highly compensated employee to avoid getting in trouble with the irs i 'm guessing they do n't provide documentation for the same reason they do n't explain to you explicitly what the income thresholds are for social security taxes etc that 's a job for your personal accountant here 's the definition of a hce   an individual who owned more than 5 of the interest in the business at any time during    the year or the preceding year regardless of how much compensation    that person earned or received or for the preceding year received    compensation from the business of more than $ 115,000 if the preceding    year is 2014 $ 120,000 if the preceding year is 2015 2016 or 2017    and if the employer so chooses was in the top 20 of employees when    ranked by compensation there are rules the restrict distributions from plans like 401ks for example treasury reg says that a plan can not make a distribution to a hce if that payment reduces the asset value of the plan to below 110 of the value of the plan 's current liabilities so after taking account all distributions to be made to hces and the asset value of the plan everyone likely gets proportionally reduced so that they do n't run afoul of this rule there are for this but these are options that the plan administrators may take not you i suppose if you were still employed there and at a high enough level a company accountant would have discussed these options with you note there 's a chance there 's some other limitation on hces that i 'm missing which applies to your specific situation your best bet to understand is simply ask your money is still there you just ca n't get it all this year

this is a question with a flawed premise   credit cards do have two factor authentication on transactions they consider more at risk to be fraudulent   i 've had several times when i bought something relatively expensive and unusual for me where the cc either initially declined and sent me a text asking to confirm immediately after which they would approve the charges or approved but sent me a text right away asking to confirm after which they 'd automatically dispute if i told them to   the first is legitimately what you are asking for the second is presumably for less risky but still some risk transactions ultimately the reason they do n't allow it for every transaction is that not enough people would make use of it to be worth their time to implement it   particularly given it slows down the transaction significantly and look at the complaints at the ~10 15 seconds extra emv authentication takes imagine that as a minute or more i think you 'd get a single digit percentage of people using that service

what are pivot points pivot points indicate price levels that are of significance in technical analysis of securities pivot points are used to provide clarity for a trader as they are a predictive indicator of where a security might go there are at least 6 different types of pivot points pivot point fibonacci pivot etc and they are different based on their formulas but generally serve the same concept i will be answering your question using the pivot point formula pivot point formula generally any pivot point formula uses a combination of the open high low and close of the previous timeframe since you are technically a swing trader indicated by   say between a couple of days to a couple of weeks as i do n't want to    do day trading you should use a weekly 5 to 30 minute chart but you can also use a daily chart as well so for example if you use a daily chart you would use the open high low and close of the previous day example of fictitious stock money stack exchange open high low close 11.50 on level level r2 level level pivot point s1 level s2 level s3 level s4 level r = resistance s = support   how to identify these pivot points most charting software already have built in that will identify the pivot points for you but you can always find and draw them yourself with an tool since we are using the pivot point formula the important pivot point levels are the which is considered as the breakout pivot the s4 which is considered as the breakdown pivot and s3 are reversal pivot points once identify the pivot points how should you proceed in a trade this is the million dollar question and without spoon feeding you requires you to come up with your own strategy to distinguish yourself from being a novice and pro trader is to have a strategy in a trade now i do n't really have the time to look for actual charts to provide examples with but generally this is what you should look for to proceed in a trade potential buy short signals potential sell signals if a stock moves above the level but then crosses below it this would be a sell signal this is confirmed when their is a lower lower then the candle that first crosses below it sell a stock when s4 level is confirmed see above for the confirmation other useful tips use the pivot point as your support or resistance the pivot point levels can be used for your stop loss for example with an s3 reversal buy signal the s4 should be used as a stop loss conversely the pivot point levels can also be used for your target prices for example with an s3 reversal buy signal you should take some profits at level you should also use a combination of other indicators to give you more information to confirm if a signal is correct examples of a good combination is the rsi macd and moving averages read that book in my comment above

there are two fundamentally different reasons merchants will give cash discounts one is that they will not have to pay interchange fees on cash or pay much lower fees on no reward debit cards   gas stations in my home state of nj already universally offer different cash and credit prices   costco will not even take visa and mastercard credit cards debit only for this reason the second reason not often talked about but widely known amongst smaller merchants is that they can fail to declare the sale or claim a smaller portion of the sale to the authorities in order to reduce their tax liability   obviously the larger stores will not risk their jobs for this but smaller owner operated mom and pop stores often will   this applies to both reduced sales tax liability and income tax liability   this used to be more limited per sale but more widespread overall since tax authorities would look closely for a mismatch between declared income and spending but with an ever larger proportion of customers paying by credit card merchants can take a bigger chunk of their cash sales off the books without drawing too much suspicion both of the above are more applicable to tvs than cars since 1 car salesmen make substantial money from offering financing and 2 all cars must be registered with the state so alternative records of sales abound   also car prices tend to be at or near the credit limit of most cards so it is not as common to pay for them in this way

the heart of the question is why ca n't bill just pay whatever he owes based on his income in that quarter if q2 is gang he 'll increase his tax payment then if q3 is surprisingly slow he 'll pay less than he paid in q2 i think what 's most interesting about this question is that the other answers are geared towards how a taxpayer is supposed to estimate taxes but that 's not my objective nor is it bill 's objective my his real objective is   in other words the answer to this question either needs to deal with not overpaying or it needs to deal with mitigating the underpayment penalty there are 2 solutions solution 1 figure your estimated taxes based on last year 's tax you wo n't owe a penalty if your withholding + estimated tax payments in each quarter are 25 or more of your previous year 's tax liability here 's the section that i am basing this on minimum required each period    you will owe a penalty for any 2011 payment period for which your estimated tax payment plus your withholding for the period and overpayments for previous periods was less than the smaller of 22.5 of your 2011 tax or 25 of your 2010 tax your 2010 tax return must cover a 12-month period solution 2 use the annualized income installment method this is not a method for calculating estimated taxes per se it 's actually a method for reducing or eliminating your underpayment penalty it 's also intended to assist tax payers with unpredictable incomes if you did not receive your income evenly throughout the year for example your income from a shop you operated at a marina was much larger in the summer than it was during the rest of the year you may be able to lower or eliminate your penalty by figuring your underpayment using the annualized income installment method emphasis added in order to take advantage of this you 'll need to send in a schedule ai at the end of the year along with a form 2210 the downside to this is that you 're basically racking up underpayment penalties throughout the year then at the end of the year you 're asking the irs to rescind your penalty the other risk is that you still pay estimated taxes on your q2 q4 earnings in q1 you just pay much less than 25 so if you have a windfall later in the year i think you could get burned on your q1 underpayment

assuming that the will that the money to your son did not stipulate any restrictions or set up a trust to hold the money until your son turns 25 or something like that i do n't think you have much choice except to put the money in a utma account which of course can be invested in whatever   the trustee which could be you or you and your wife jointly decides   note not a ugma account since the money is not a gift you also do n't have any option except to turn the account over to your son when he turns eighteen the point is the investment can be in anything as long as the account is registered as a utma account   but do remember also that your son is entitled to sue you for breach of fiduciary duty if you do n't take good care of the money so that blowing it all in risky investments is also not a good idea if you are worried about taxes and your son 's income being taxed at your rate one way of deferring the issue is to buy us savings bonds the interest can be deferred from taxation until the bonds are redeemed edit added in response to joetaxpayer 's comments but a better strategy is to declare the accrued interest each year as unearned income of the child on the kiddie tax form that is part of your tax return and pay the tax if any that results to ease your mind or conscience think of the tax that you pay on your child 's behalf as a gift to your child in any case there will likely not be much tax due since the first $ 950 of unearned   income of a child is tax free and the next $ 950 taxed at 10 then when the bonds are cashed in the interest that accrued and was taxed in earlier years can be deducted   from the interest cash in price minus purchase price that you or your son will be told is the interest that the bonds earned of course if kiddie tax is not a concern and it should n't be given the amount available for investment an even better strategy is to set up the utma account(s in long term investments in low cost index funds or etfs as joetaxpayer suggests and pay the tax if any as it comes due

intuit has a pretty good write up on this subject as you noted you are allowed to exceed your limit by $ 2000 though this overcontribution is not tax deductible also your contribution room accumulates so you may be able to contribute $ 18k for the 2015 tax year but if you have unused space from previous tax years you can make use of that too if you discover you have indeed you may be eligible for a waiver the cra looks kindly on honest mistakes consider talking to a tax accountant and then calling up the cra and discussing it with them if you are not eligible for a waiver on the excess you need the form this lets you declare the excess contributions and pay the tax on it you also need to withdraw the excess from your rrsp and may need to provide evidence of this withdrawal again strongly consider talking to an accountant and to the cra who are surprisingly polite and helpful on the phone 1 penalty per month can quickly get expensive and now 's the time to ensure you have your ducks in a row

you want to take the hit now    there are tons of calculators out there but the rule of 70 should be enough to help convince you assume you can put an extra $ 10k in a 401k now or keep it   if you pay ~30 in taxes you   can have either a $ 7k now or b what $ 10 k will grow to in your 40 years till retirement less taxes at the end the rule of 70 is a quick dirty way to calculate compounded returns   it says that if you divide 70 by your assumed return you get the approximate number of years it will take to double your money    so let 's say you assume a 5 rate of return you can replace that with whatever you want 1 is 14 so you 'll double your $ 10k every 14 years 2 in 40 years you 'll double your money almost 3 times 3 that means you 'll end up with almost $ 80k before taxes 4 even if we assume the same tax rate at retirement of 30 odds are decent it 's lower since you 'll have less income presumably you still have $ 56k whatever you think inflation will be $ 56k later is a lot better than $ 7k now

if i understand right you 're asking whether it 's better to withdraw a currency that is more valuable or less valuable in currency units than your home country 's currency   that is using your examples you 're asking whether it 's better to withdraw euros when the euro is worth more than the pakistani rupee or when the euro is worth less the answer is that it does n't matter   what matters is whether the euro is worth more pakistani rupees than it will be worth later   for instance suppose that the exchange rate today is such that you can buy 115 pkr for 1 eur or equivalently you can buy 1 eur for 115 pkr   realistically the rates would be different due to conversion fees but i 'll keep it this way for   if tomorrow the exchange rate changes so that you need 120 pkr to buy 1 eur then you have to spend more rupees to buy a euro so this is bad for you it would have been better to buy earlier when it was only 115 pkr for a euro   if on the other hand the exchange rate the other way so that you only need 110 pkr to buy a euro then this benefits you because you are spending less than you would have if you had bought earlier   so in these terms you want to change rupees into euros when one euro is worth fewer rupees and you want to change euros into rupees when one euro is worth more rupees it does n't matter how many pkr you spend for a euro in raw numbers   all that matters is are you spending more for that one euro than you would have spent had you bought earlier or later   indeed for your specific example it is unlikely that one rupee will be worth more than one euro in the foreseeable future as far as i can see the euro has never been worth less than about 50 rupees in practice of course it 's hard to know whether the current rate is good   you ca n't easily know how currency rates will change in the future   if you are just visiting for a short period of time it probably does n't make sense to worry about the exchange rates   just take out as much money as you need when you need it   you 're just as likely to lose money as to save money if you try to game the exchange rates   if you 're staying in a place for a longer period of time it might be worth pulling a bit extra out at a time when the rate is especially favorable but you 're still unlikely to see major savings in the long run

real estate is a lousy investment because renting a home and buying a home all else being equal are pretty similar in costs in the long term if you can force yourself to invest the would be down payment so buy a home if you want to enjoy the benefits of home ownership buy a home if you need to hedge against rising housing prices e.g. you 're on a fixed income and could n't cope if rent increased a bunch when the economy heated up maybe buy a home if you 're in a high tax bracket to save yourself from being taxed on your imputed rent if it works out that way consult your financial advisor but do n't consider it a really great investment vehicle returns are average and the risk profile is n't that attractive

if you think about it it 's really all one big pot of money   the idea behind an emergency fund is that you want to make sure your financial life has stability it 's not going to be suddenly driven into the red below $ 0   as long as that does n't happen you can figure out how to live your life as you want the reason we separate out an emergency fund is to simplify decision making   in theory every single purchase you make should include a consideration of how it you   every $ 100 you spend on groceries is $ 100 you wo n't be able to bring to bear if you get fired or have a major accident   in practice this would be a crippling way of thinking about things   you do n't know what emergencies can hit you nor when they will hit   that 's why they 're emergencies   if you had to think about them all the time it 'd be horrible   you would end up simply not thinking about it like most people and then the emergency hits when you do n't have enough cash to stay solvent the purpose of an emergency fund is to help make these decisions easier   if you have money set aside for emergencies that you only have to think about every now and then you can make the decisions in the rest of your financial life without too much concern for them   you do n't have to worry about that $ 100 in groceries because you are confident that if an emergency hits that $ 100 wo n't be the straw that broke the 's back because you have reserves to draw on so you should define an emergency fund in a way which is most helpful for you to remain stable and solvent without having to fret about it too much   for most people the criteria for tapping that fund is very high because the goal is to not have to think about it all that much   if you wanted to you could feel free to lump those medium predictability items into the emergency fund but it just means you have to spend more time and effort thinking about the state of the fund   every medium predictability purchase has to come with the thought process what is the state of the emergency fund could this purchase meaningfully destabilize my ability to handle emergencies   your emergency fund might yo yo under these extra purchases which could force you to think about the state of your emergency fund for normal purchases   that 'd be bad different people might want to think about things different ways   i 'm a big picture guy so i prefer to think about all of my assets as one big account when i make a lot of my decisions   my wife on the other hand prefers not to have to think that way when she makes her purchases   for her having a very discrete emergency fund has great value   for me it has less   so when i look at the finances i choose to lump the emergency funds in with say the funds to re do our backyard something we are looking at doing over the next 2 5 years   for me that is the most natural way to deal with analyzing the risks i just have to be aware of how backyard purchases interact with our safety net   my wife prefers to keep those funds separate in her head so that she can look at how to spend money on the backyard without thinking about how it affects our emergency   while complicated it shows that even within a household it 's possible to think about emergency funding two different ways   it causes minimal headaches though a fair bit of book keeping so define emergency fund however suits you and your life best   however practically speaking most people find it desirable to not put those medium predictability purchases into the same bucket as emergencies   those that do find it desirable to put them in the same bucket typically have a personal reason for why that suits their needs better

you need to track all of your expenses first all of your assets and liabilities and set financial goals for example you need to know your average monthly expenses and exactly what percentages interest each loan charges and you need to know what to save for your children retirement large purchases etc then you create an emergency fund keep between 4 to 6 months worth of your monthly expenses in a savings account that you can readily access base the size of your emergency fund on your expenses rather than your salary this also means its size changes over time for example it must increase once you have children you then pay off your loans starting with the loan charging the highest interest you do this because e.g. paying off $ x of a 7 loan is equivalent to investing $ x and getting a guaranteed 7 return the stock market does generally does not provide guarantees starting with the highest interest first is mathematically the most rewarding strategy in the long run it is not a clear whether you should pay off all loans as fast as possible particularly those with low interest rates and the mortgage you need to read up on the subject in order to make an informed decision this would be too personal advice for us to give after you 've created that emergency fund and paid of all high interest loans you can consider investing in vessels that achieve your set financial goals for example since you are thinking of having children within five years you might wish to save for college education that implies immediately that you should pick an investment vessels that is available after 20 year or so and does not carry too much risk e.g. perhaps bonds or deposits these are a few basic advices and i would recommend to look further on the internet and perhaps read a book on the topic of personal finance

not to detract from the other answers at all which are each excellent and useful in their own right but here 's my interpretation of the ideas equity is the answer to the question where is the value of the company coming from   this might include owner stakes shareholder stock investments or outside investments   in the current moment it can also be defined as equity = x + current income current expenses i 'll come back to x this fits into the standard accounting model of assets liabilities = value equity where assets includes not only bank accounts but also warehouse inventory raw materials etc liabilities are debts loans shortfalls in inventory etc   both are abstract categories whereas income and expense are hard dollar amounts   at the end of the year when the books balance they should all equal out equity up until this point has been an abstract concept and it 's not an account in the traditional gnucash sense   however it 's common practice for businesses to close the books once a year and to consolidate outstanding balances   when this happens equity ceases to be abstract and becomes a hard value how much is the company worth at this moment which has a definite numeric value when the books are opened fresh for a new business year the current income and current expense amounts are zeroed out   in this situation in order for the big equation to equal out assets liabilities = x + income the previous net value of the company must be accounted for   this is where x comes in the starting previous year 's equity   this allows the assets and liabilities to be non zero while the current income and expenses are both still zeroed out   the account which represents x in gnucash is called equity and encompasses not only initial investments but also the net increase decreases from previous years   while the name would more accurately be called starting equity the only problem caused by the naming convention is the confusion of the concept equity x + income expenses with the account x named equity

do n’t take the cash deposit whatever you do this is a retirement savings vehicle after all and you want to keep this money designated as such    you have 3 options   1 rollover the old 401k to the new 401k once your new plan is setup you can call who ever runs that plan and ask them how to get started it will require you filling out a form with the old 401k provider and they ’ll transfer the balance of your account directly to the new 401k   2 rollover the old 401k to a traditional ira this involves opening a new traditional ira if you do n’t already have one i assume you do n’t vanguard is a reddit favorite and i can vouch for them as well other shops like fidelity and schwab are also good but since vanguard is very low cost and has great service it ’s usually a good choice especially for beginners   3 convert the old 401k to a roth ira this is essentially the same as step 2 the difference is you ’ll owe taxes on the balance you convert why would you voluntarily want to pay taxes f you can avoid them with options 1 or 2 the beauty of the roth is you only pay taxes on the money you contribute to the roth then it grows tax free and when you ’re retired you get to withdraw it tax free as well the money contained in a 401k or a traditional ira is taxed when you withdraw in retirement    my $ .02 401k accounts typically have higher fees than iras even if they own the same mutual funds the expense ratios are usually more in the 401k the last 2 times i ’ve changed jobs i ’ve converted the 401k money into my roth ira if it ’s a small sum of money and/or you can afford to pay the taxes on the money i ’d suggest doing the same   you can read up heavily on the pros cons of   roth vs traditional but my personal strategy is to have 2 buckets or money when i retire some in roth and some in traditional i can withdraw as much money from the traditional account until i max out the lowest tax bracket and then pull any other money i need from the roth accounts that are tax free this allows you to keep taxes fairly low in retirement   if you do n’t have a roth now this is a great way to start one

two things you should consider about paying off student loans ahead of the 10 year amortization schedule what interest rate are you paying on your loans what are you earning on your investments in a balanced mutual fund when you pay off your student loans you are essentially guaranteed a return of the interest rate on your loan future interest you would have had to pay however if you are investing well and getting a good return on your investments you will get a greater return ex half of my student loans are at 6.8 other half are at 2.5 i make the minimum payments on the loans at 2.5 and invest my money in tax sheltered retirement accounts the return on these funds has been 8 and that is on per tax dollars so really closer to 11 now there is also downside risk when you invest in the market but 2.5 guaranteed i will for 11 in low risk return however my loans at 6.8 i repay in excess of the minimums because 6.8 guaranteed return is pretty good so this decision is based on your confidence in your investments and your own risk tolerance once you pay your bank on your student loans that money is gone out of your control if you need it in the future you may need to pay higher interest on an unsecured loan or you may not be able to borrow it when you want to make large purchases a car house that money you per paid on your loans is n't available to you as a down payment banks should want you to have some of your own skin in the game on these purchases and the lending standards keep getting tougher you are better off if you have money saved in your name rather than against the balance on your loan yes you ca n't bankrupt these loans but the money you repay on them does n't go toward housing you or paying your bills on a rainy day i went through the same feeling when i completed my mba with $ 50k in debt you want to pay it off as soon as possible but you need to step away and realize that it was an investment in your future and your future is long you need time to make a financial foundation for it and you will feel a lot more empowered when you have money saved and you can make the decision for how you want to deploy it to work for you ex i could pay down my student loans with the balance i have in the bank but i am going to use it to invest in myself and open my own business

the plan is perfectly valid and legal as tax rules currently stand there is no limit to the amount you can rollover or convert to roth assuming your 401(k is traditional pre tax you 'll have to pay income taxes on the amount you convert above personal exemption + standard deduction which is currently about $ 10k year for single filers the other caveat is you 'll need funds to live off of while your conversion money is for 5 years in your roth ira if you start the conversion while you are still working you 'll be paying taxes on it in your marginal bracket which will negate much of the benefit of the pre tax 401(k if your living expenses are low you can convert about $ 10k year without federal income taxes while living off capital gains from a taxable account which have a 0 rate in the 15   income tax bracket goes up to about $ year

pensions are pretty much gone and likely to be drastically cut back where available for my generation   every recession provides excuses to cut or freeze more of them   who has n't seen that compound interest infographic that shows investor a saving for retirement in the first decade of their career coming out ahead of investor b that starts a decade later and contributes for 25 years because of compound interest   that does n't work the same way when that first decade is a lost decade   investor a is always behind in that situation and must become investor c that contributes the whole time   who has n't see that average college grads that start their careers in a recession take a decade or more to catch up to the income of those that graduated into a recovery or boom   who has n't seen an odd money mentality of those who lived through the great depression   it clearly stuck with many people for the rest of their lives   my grandmother is 97 and is paranoid about running out of money   at her current burn rate she has over 20 years of savings left

index funds are well known to give the best long term investment not exactly indexes give the best long term performance when compared to actively managing investments directly in the underlying stocks that is if you compare an s&p500 index to trying to pick stocks that are part of it you 're more likely to succeed with blindly following the index than trying to actively beat it that said no one promises that investing in s&p500 is better than investing in djia for example these are two different indexes tracking different stocks and areas so when advisers say diversify they do n't mean it that you should diversify between different stocks that build up the s&p500 index they mean that you should diversify your investments in different areas some in s&p500 some in djia some in international indexes some in bond indexes etc still investing in various indexes will likely yield better results than actively managing the investments trying to beat those indexes but you should not invest in only one and that is the meaning of diversification in the comments you asked why diversify at all and that is entirely a different question from your original what diversification is you diversify to reduce the risk of loss from one side and widen the net for gains from another the thing is that any single investment can eventually fail regardless of how it performed before you can see that the s&p500 index lost 50 of its value twice within ten years whereas before it was doubling itself every several years many people who were only invested in that index or what 's underlying to it lost a lot of money but consider you 've diversified and in the last 20 years you 've invested in a blend of indexes that include the s&p500 but also other investments like s&p bse mentioned by victor below you would reduce your risk of loss on the american market by increasing your gains on the indian market add to the mix soaring chinese real estate market during the time of the collapse of the us real estate gains on the dollar losing its value by investing in other currencies canadian dollar for example etc there are many risks and by diversifying you mitigate them and also have a chance to create other potential gains now another question is why invest in indexes that has been answered before on this site it is my opinion that some methods of investing are just gambling by trying to catch the wave and they will almost always fail and rarely will individual stock picking beat the market of course after the fact its easy to be smart and pick the winning stocks but the problem is to be able to predict those charts ahead of time

my take is that he can avoid a big tax hit by leaving it as and giving    the untouched fund to the heirs 100 correct by withdrawing now he 'll be subjected to the income tax on the gains since his gains are almost the whole value of the account he 'll actually find himself in the highest bracket not the lowest as joe suggests not only that but his ss income will become taxable as well capital gains are included in the agi by leaving as is the heirs will get stepped up basis and the whole 700 k will not be taxed its below the estate tax threshold and the basis for the heirs will be the value at death

in the united states you ca n't because the average millennial in the united states has no opportunity to save money either you get a college education then you will be burdened with a student loan the cost of college education skyrocketed in the past decades it is now practically impossible to enter the workforce without a huge debt unless you are one of the lucky few who has rich and generous parents or you skip college but college is the only way in the united states to obtain a generally accepted qualification so you wo n't get any job which pays enough to save any money as soon as that student loan is paid off you need to get another loan for you house which you pay off for several decades as soon as the house debt is paid off you will be old and develop some medical problems the medical bills will come in and you will be in debt again so when in their life are millennials supposed to save money

you 're conflating the amount of money the american economy makes with the amount of debt the american government accrues the deficit is not 2.3 of tax receipts   really your story is about somebody who makes $ has their parent 's co signed on a mortgage for $ and spent $ last year they just put the extra $ 9 on their parents credit card and ignored all the times their parents have tried to sit down and talk about their spending habits over the years   the total american debt is $ 60 trillion which is 350 of gdp

using a vehicle is a common technique to isolate project specific risk from the remainder of the company there 's not any problem with the vehicle making zero paper profits it was only ever a paper company    the dodgy bit is when they start offering remuneration to participants based on the vehicle 's profits anyone with any sense goes on gross   or when they are artificially shifting the profits around for tax reasons

again   gt go ahead and show me one article or picture of palestinians dying of thirst or untreated diseases   please   gt back to palestine a short real true and verifiable historical summary there was never ever a country or nation of palestine the only reason we hear about palestine and palestinians today is because in 1967 israel liberated the local arabs from a 1948 occupation by egypt and jordan of land given to them by the un for which israel agreed to if the 1967 events never happened you would not hear today about palestine and palestinians true or false   gt so israel never wanted to be a greater israel to rule over millions of additional arabs as part of its democracy or occupation more arabs than jews israel is not that dumb true or false   gt the blockade is actually by egypt and israel check the map egypt has a border with gaza true or false   gt the local arabs can have a palestine for themselves already in 1948 if they agreed to the un partition plan or 1967 after they were liberated by israel israel has only one condition in 1948 and in 1967 for a palestine that palestine needs to be a nice neighbor to israel they do n't want to be nice so no palestine until they grow up true or false

in your journal entry debit the appropriate expense account office supplies etc and credit your equity account   the equity account should be called something like partner investments or something like that you can choose to enter these all separately on the specific dates listed or as one entry   some people choose to summarize the expenses they 've paid personally and only enter one entry per month or so to minimize data entry time and also because the end effect is the same of course the above is assuming you are considering these purchases to be investments in the company and not expecting the company to repay you   if you are expecting repayment you could enter a bill instead or credit an account like loan from shareholder rather than the equity account

one significant reason it makes sense for filing to be the default is home ownership rates   i think far more so than investment income americans own homes as there is a significant mortgage interest deduction between that and investments a large number of americans would have to file about a third of americans get the mortgage interest tax deduction and a large chunk of the richest do n't qualify but would have to file for investments anyway we also have a very complicated tax code with nearly everyone getting some kind of deduction   earned income tax credit for the working poor folks making say $ 30k for a family of 4 with a full time job get several thousand dollars in refundable credits for example the student loan interest deduction the above mortgage deduction almost everyone gets something finally your employer may not know about your family situation   as we have tax credits and deductions for families based on number of children for example it 's possible your employer does n't know about those if you do n't get health insurance on their behalf they may well not know   start reporting things like that separately and you end up with about as much work as filing is now

there are number of reasons why someone does n't want to give you a receipt for cash payment anything ranging from not wanting to pay taxes to being able to deny you gave them money for service in the event you 're not happy with the service and ask for money back you wo n't get in trouble for giving him cash however you should be worried because any reputable person providing any type of service product will provide a receipt regardless of payment type
