first filing status if you and your wife are legally married you should be filing your tax returns as married either jointly or separately in the us head of household has a specific meaning and is for unmarried people who are supporting one or more relatives per the irs if you are working full time and your wife is not then likely you will file a joint return including all your income and all the expenses for your wife 's business so yes the losses in her business will offset your income depending on how complex things are you may want to hire a professional to help with your taxes the rules for what can and can not be deducted as a business expense can be opaque

there are some tools that might help you for example i have an expense it application on my iphone where i can type in a purchase while still at the cashier the idea is to track expenses on a trip but the implementation will suit your needs perfectly keeping slips is a way to go too but i personally do n't like that because i 'm a messy person and after a couple of days all the receipts are gone if you can keep track of tons of slips you can just do that

generally speaking granting rights to one bank account e.g. making a joint account does not extend rights to other accounts or otherwise let one joint owner create new obligations on the other owner e.g. opening a line of credit that the other owner must pay for except to the extent of the joint account   i assume there are no uk rules that would change this feature the other party can of course withdraw all the money without need for your approval   this also means that the joint account could be exposed to all the creditors of either party   if your account joint tenant has huge debts the creditors could theoretically look to the joint account for satisfaction   at least that would be an issue under us law frankly it may be simpler to get a separate account for the other person if possible and make transfers with online banking   it could also make sense to get a banking card if those are in the uk which works like a debit card and can be through various means sometimes a call sometimes online deposits sometimes in physical stores   there may be fees to getting such a card or a second account of course   the benefit is that the cardholder has no access to your account and you control recharging   such cards are widely available in the us to people who otherwise would not qualify for traditional bank accounts note also the fatca complication with adding a us person to your account   my understanding is that a number of non us banks will simply close the accounts of americans rather than deal with hassles under fatca

i have lived in communal houses most people do n't want roommates especially if that means having several kids   i feel like your arguments are practical i suppose but not realistic if i had 3 kids right now if anything i would probably be earning less money because my flexibility would be much less i could n't pursue an education to earn more money because i would still have bills to pay for my kids my parents are poor and they live in an area that my job options would be about 3 and none would pay much more than minimum wage i am 26 but i have known plenty of 19 year old single moms who just are n't able to get a job that pays well enough to support them and again they have few options to develop new skills i guess you can say it is their fault but we can hardly say that subway should n't have to pay them overtime or what is really less than a living wage economists and reality have shown us time and time again that more wages overall means a healthier economy every state that has raised wages in the past few years is better off because of it every state that has done so has seen their economy grow and go down

this is pretty meaningless and somewhat misleading they measured price increases mostly on things that were produced elsewhere and would not be expected to see price increases e.g. gas most retail prices are not heavily impacted by local labor prices for many goods local retail labor costs would constitute less than 5 of the total cost plus local retailers still have to compete with online retailers as well as retailers outside the city limits so they ca n't dramatically hike prices and be competitive if the min wage increases did impact prices it 's more likely that local retailers would see their margins shrink and some of them would go out of business as a result    on the things that are produced locally such as food from a restaurant they found significant price increases there 's also been significant evidence showing that restaurant job creation lagged behind in seattle versus the rest of washington state        they also seem to have forgotten to mention substitution effects for labor such as restaurants using more technology to eliminate labor    overall the articles reads like yet another rose colored classes spin on one of the most detrimental economic policies in the us it 's almost silly watching people try to find reasons how increasing the price of labor and destroying contractual freedom for unskilled laborers creates magical free lunches

this is referred to as an hsa mistaken distribution an hsa mistaken distribution occurs when you take a distribution and later find out that it is not for a qualified medical expense   for example this could occur if you accidentally pay for a restaurant dinner with your hsa debit card   it can also occur if you take a distribution to pay for a medical expense but then are later reimbursed by insurance this is discussed in the instructions for irs forms 1099-sa and   note these forms are submitted by the hsa bank not the consumer so the instructions are addressed to them hsa mistaken distributions    if amounts were distributed during the year from an hsa because of a mistake of fact due to reasonable cause the account beneficiary may repay the mistaken distribution no later than april 15 following the first year the account beneficiary knew or should have known the distribution was a mistake for example the account beneficiary reasonably but mistakenly believed that an expense was a qualified medical expense and was reimbursed for that expense from the hsa the account beneficiary then repays the mistaken distribution to the hsa   you have until april 15 in the year following the refund to repay the hsa and avoid the extra tax and penalty that should be paid if you were to keep the distribution that was not ultimately used for medical expenses   when you send the money to the hsa bank you need to explicitly tell them that it is a mistaken distribution repayment so that they can report it to the irs correctly and it will not affect your contribution limits

it might be best to step back and look at the core information first   you 're evaluating an llc vs a corporation both corporate entities   both have one or more members and both are seen similarly emphasis on similar here they 're not all the same to the irs   specifically llc 's can opt for a pass through tax system basically seen by the irs the same way an s corp is put another way you can be taxed as a corporate entity or it 's p l statements can flow through to your personal taxes   when you opt for a flow through the business files and you get a separate schedule to tie into your taxes   you should also look at filing a business expense schedule schedule c on your taxes to claim legitimate business expenses good reference point here while there are several differences see this and this and this between these entities the best determination on which structure is best for you is usually if you have full time employ while you 're running the business   s corps limit shares shareholders and some deductions but taxes are only paid by the shareholders   c corps have employees no restrictions on types or number of stock and no restrictions on the number of shareholders   however this means you would become an employee of your business you have to draw monies from somewhere and would be subject to paying taxes on your income both as an individual and as a business employment taxes such as social security medicare etc from the broad view of the irs in most cases an llc and a corp are the same type of entity tax wise   in fact most of the differences between llcs and corps occur in how profits losses are distributed between members llcs are arbitrary to a point and corps base this on shares back to your question imho you should opt for an llc   this allows you to work out a partnership with your co worker and allows you to disburse funds in a more flexible manner   from wikipedia a limited liability company with multiple members that to be taxed as partnership may specially allocate the members share of income gain loss deduction or credit via the company operating agreement on a basis other than the ownership percentage of each member so long as the rules contained in treasury regulation 26 cfr 1 are met s corporations may not specially allocate profits losses and other tax items under us tax law hope this helps please do let me know if you have further questions   as always this is not legal or tax advice just what i 've learned in setting several llcs and corporate structures up over the years edit as far as your formulas go the tax rate will be based upon your personal income for any pass through entity   this means that the same monies earned from and llc or an s corp with the same expenses and the same pass through options will be taxed the same more reading llc and the law google group

in my experience no cash transactions are the best deal take your portuguese credit card get some cash $ 60 for emergencies only pay with your credit card it 's much cheaper because it 's all virtual   the best would be to set up an american bank account and transfer the money there you can also get paypal account they offer credit cards too the virtual banks credit unions are the best option because they do n't charge you for transactions they do n't have expenses with keeping actual money find some credit union that accepts foreigners and take it from there you can exchange your money on the airport because it 's in tax free zone i recommend the country of the currency since they sell you their and you are buying dollars not selling euros make sure to find out what is the best deal

hmmm as far as i know wire transfers are still the best option if you make sure your us account accepts international wires for free like td bank does you 'll have eliminated most of the costs assuming your foreign bank does n't charge too much for wiring the funds in the first place also if your able to you could consider wiring 6 or so months at the same time i 'm not familiar with xe.com but it seems it 's not set up for transferring money so much as for trading currencies while you could probably use it to transfer funds if you 'd link both your accounts it seems a rather complicated way to go about things paypal could be an option if they 'd allow you to set up an account in each country or if you have a relative that could help out but it gets more expensive than wire transfers quickly as for getting the best exchange rate i 've given up on that a long time ago and have accepted that as the cost of living internationally
# 537418
has mentioned this in a comment but i think it ought to be expanded upon companies that are n't already penny stocks really do n't stand to gain anything from trying to prevent short interest   short selling does not inherently lower the stock price not any more so than any other kind of selling   when somebody shorts a stock it 's simply borrowed from another investor 's margin as long as it 's not a naked short resulting in an failure to deliver then it does not add any artificial selling pressure in fact shorting can actually drive the price up in the long term due to stops and margin calls   not a guarantee of course but if a rally occurs then a high short interest can cause a cascade effect from the short squeeze resulting in an even bigger rally than what would have occurred with zero short interest   many investors actually treat a high short interest as a bullish signal compare with margin buying essentially the opposite of short selling which has the opposite effect   if investors buy stocks on margin then if the value of that stock decreases too rapidly they will be forced to sell which can cause the exact same cascade effect as a short interest but in the opposite direction   shorting is in a sense evening out the odds by inflating the buying pressure at lower stock prices when the borrowers decide to cover and take profits bottom line is that aside from illegal insider trading it does n't do businesses any good to try to manipulate their stock price or any trading activity   yes a company can raise capital by selling additional common shares but a split really has no effect on the amount of capital they 'd be able to raise because it does n't change the actual market cap and a dilution is a dilution regardless of the current stock price   if a company 's market cap is $ 1 billion then it does n't matter if they issue 1 million shares at $ 50.00 each or 10 million shares at $ 5.00 each either way it nets them $ 50 million from the sale and causes a 5 dilution to which the market will react accordingly they do n't do it because there 'd be no point

i believe the only thing you have n't mentioned to him is the possibility that his activity is criminally fraudulent i would sit him down and say something substantially similar to the following we 've talked about your investment before and i know you believe it 's fine   i just want to make sure you understand that this is very likely fraudulent activity   i know you believe in it but you 've said you do n't understand how or why it works   the problem with that is that if it is a fraud you ca n't protect yourself from criminal prosecution because you did n't understand what you were doing   the prosecutor will ask you if you asked others to give you or the organization money and then they will you based on trying to defraud others it does n't matter whether you did it on purpose or just because you believed the people you are investing in so i very strongly advise you to understand exactly what the system is and how it works and then make sure with a lawyer that it 's legal   if it is then hey you 've learned something valuable   but if it 's not then you will save yourself a whole lot of trouble and anguish down the road if you step away before someone you attract to the investment decides to talk to their accountant or lawyer   a civil lawsuit may be bad but if you 're criminally prosecuted it will be so much worse now that i 've said my piece i wo n't talk to you about it anymore or bother you about it i wish you luck and hope that things work out fine i would n't talk to the police or suggest that i 'd do anything of that nature without proof then there 's no real way to start an investigation anyway and unfortunately scams like this are incredibly hard to investigate so the police often spend little to no time on them without a high level insider giving up evidence and associates chances are good nothing would happen to your friend one day the organization will disappear and he wo n't recover any more money but there 's a distinct possibility that when that happens the people below him will come for him and he wo n't be able to look further up the chain for help perhaps the threat of illegal activity will be enough to prevent him from defrauding others but if not i think at least you can let it go and know that you 've done everything for him that might work

two come to mind never finance a depreciating asset if you ca n't pay cash for a car you ca n't afford it if you decide you can finance at a low rate and invest at a higher one you 're leveraging your capital   the risk here is that your investment drops in value or your cash flow stops and you are unable to continue payments and have to sell the car or surrender it there are fewer risks if you buy the car outright   there is one cost that is not considered though   opportunity cost    since you 've declared transportation necessary i 'd say that opportunity cost is worth the lower risk assuming you have enough cash left after buying a car to fund your emergency fund which brings me to my final point   be sure to buy a quality used car not a new one   your emergency fund should be able to replace the car completely in the case of a total loss where you are at fault and the loss is not covered by insurance tldr my opinion is that it would be better to pay for a quality efficient basic transportation car up front than to take on a debt

based on the information you gave there are dozens if not hundreds of possible theories one could spin about the rental market sure it 's possible that there are no listings because rental units on this street are quickly snapped up on the other hand it 's also possible that there are no listings because almost all the buildings on the street have been abandoned and aside from this one property that someone is tying to sell you the rest of the street is only by wild dogs and/or drug dealers or maybe the street is mostly owner occupied i.e. the properties are not being rented to anyone or maybe it 's a commercial district or maybe craigslist is n't popular with people who own property on this street for whatever reason maybe syracuse has a city ordinance that says property must be advertised in the newspaper and not on websites for all i know or maybe you missed it because nobody in syracuse calls it housing for rent they all call it apartments for rent or houses for rent or some local phrase or or or before i bought a property i 'd do more research than one search on one web site have you visited the property i do n't know how much you 're preparing to invest i have no idea what property prices are in syracuse but i 'd guess it 's at least tens of thousands of dollars surely worth making the drive to syracuse to check it out before buying

well an empty fridge is a waste of 100 of the cooling   if you are cooling nothing then all of the energy to cool it is wasted   air is not very conductive of heat   its why double glass is more than single pane the air provides an barrier    so in a fridge you want to quickly bring the temperature of items placed inside down to a storage temperature around 1c   having a fridge full of already cold items will allow for a much quicker transfer of heat out of the item placed within   and since the heat is out through a larger mass the amount of cooling required will be the same but because the mean temperature change over time is less the fridge will have to work harder for less time if the fridge is full    but in the end the amount of energy required to cool a full will be higher than an empty one as there is more heat to   but the cost of keeping it cold is spread out among many items   so if you only have 1 orange per day in your fridge and it costs you 30 a month to run your fridge then your oranges have an additional 1 cost on them   but if you use 20 things a day and it costs you 60 a month   it only costs you .1 extra per item

the most likely answer to your question regarding what the market expects is perhaps that the market expects that currently linked in like a lot of other startups has been almost it makes into building the business and brand   so right now the net profits are pretty low percentage of income roughly 1.5 of revenue   given the size of the other numbers it does n't take a lot of movement in the right direction to get a big change in that tiny final number   the other factor is the gap between their net and the income available   i think but i 'm making a logical guess here a large part of that gap was paying off the losses of the prior two years   if that 's the case and everything else is static then next year 's available number ought to at least triple   in order to grow the net all li needs is to either continue current trends of growth in expenses relative to costs   keep expenses steady and experience a slight growth in income or find a way to reduce expenses without having it impact income or something in between those three    if we take the first case as an example income has been roughly doubling every year but expenses growing less than that   if they were to continue that but manage to get some economy of scale and have expenses grow at a slower rate then the jump in net income ought to be substantial most of the trends you could project end up with a big growth in the bottom line but yeah i got ta admit none of that gets you growth in a single year   so the conclusion i would draw is that the market is trending a few years out and being pretty optimistic given the current pe ratio   of course you could also conclude that the market is social network happy and represents one of the few opportunities for the average investor to get in on that given that facebook and myspace are not trading on the open market

technically you owe self employment taxes not fica taxes because they are imposed under a different law however since se taxes are by design exactly the same rates as combining the two halves of fica employer and employee it is quite reasonable to treat them as equivalent se taxes and income tax also are based on your net self employment income after deducting business expenses but not non business items like your home mortgage dependent exemptions etc which factor only into income tax you owe se medicare tax 2.9 on all your se net income unless it is under $ 400 adjusted down by 7.65 to compensate for the fact that the employer half of fica is excluded from gross income before the employee half is computed you owe se social security tax 12.4 on your adjusted se net income unless and until the total income subject to i.e. your w-2 wages plus your adjusted se net income exceeds a cap that varies with inflation and is $ for 2017 otoh if income exceeds $ 200k single or $ 250k joint you owe additional medicare tax 0.9 on the excess if your w-2 income alone exceeds this limit your employer should withhold for it however the additional medicare tax is part of obamacare ppaca which the new president and republican have said they will repeal and replace whether any such replacement will affect this for ty 2017 is at best uncertain at this point yes se taxes are added to income tax on your 1040 with schedule se attached and schedule c e f as applicable to your business virtually so if you file electronically and paid together you are supposed to pay at least 90 during the year by having withholding increased on your w-2 job or by making quarterly estimated payments irs quarters are not exactly quarters but close or any combination but if this is your first year which you do n't say but someone who had gone through this before probably would n't ask you may get away with not paying during the year as normally required specifically if your w-2 withholding is not enough to cover your increased taxes for this year because of the additional income and se taxes but it is enough to cover your tax for the previous year and your agi that year was n't over $ 150k then there is a safe harbor and you wo n't owe any penalty although you must keep enough money on hand to pay the tax by april 15 but for your second year and onwards your previous year now includes se amounts and this does n't help similar related

generally for tax questions you should talk to a tax adviser do n't consider anything i write here as a tax advice and the answer was not intended or written to be used and it can not be used by any taxpayer for the purpose of avoiding penalties that may be imposed on the taxpayer does irs like one payment method over other or they simply do n't care    as long as she can show the receipts they do n't care as long as she withholds the taxes 30 unless specific arrangements are made for otherwise she should withhold 30 of the payment and send it to the irs the recipient should claim refund if the actual tax liability is lower it 's only consulting work at the moment so most of the communication    is done over phone should they start engaging in written    communication to keep records of the work done yes if she wants it to be a business expense is it okay to pay in one go to save money transferring fees can she    pay in advance again she can do whatever she wants but if she wants to account for it on her tax returns she should do it the same way she would pay any other vendor in her business she can not use different accounting methods for different vendors basically she has not outsourced work in previous years and she    wants to avoid any red flags then she should start by calling on her tax adviser and not an anonymous internet forum

not at all impossible what you need is fundamental analysis and relationship with your investment if you are just buying shares not sure you can have those i will provide examples from my personal experience   my mother has barely high school education when she saw house and land prices in bulgaria she thought it 's impossibly cheap we lived on rent in israel our horrible apartment was worth $ 1 m and it was horrible we could never imagine buying it because we were middle class at best my mother insisted that we all sell whatever we have and buy land and houses in bulgaria one house for example went from $ 20k to between 2001 and 2007 but we knew bulgaria we knew how to buy we knew lawyers we knew builders   the company i currently work for when i joined share prices were around 240 2006 they are now 2015 at 1500 i did n't buy because i was repaying mortgage at 5 i am very sorry i did n't everybody knew 240 is not a real share price for our company an established + 30 years software company with piles of cash we were not a hot startup outsiders did n't invest many developers and finance people who work in the company made a fortune again relationship knowledge   i bought a house in the uk in 2012 everyone knew house prices were about to go up i was lucky i had a friend who was a he told me buy now or lose money i bought a little house for 200k it is now worth not double but pretty good money   my point is take your investment personally do n't just dump money into something once you are an insider your risk will be almost mitigated and you could buy where you see an opportunity and sell when you feel you are near the maximal real worth of your investment it 's not hard to analyse it 's hard to make a commitment

before going into specific investments i think it would be a good idea to assess how free is that $ 5000 how much do you have to rely on it in emergency you always want to buy low and sell high however if you need to make unplanned withdraw from an investment you risk unfavorable market conditions at the time when you need the money and lose money that way one common suggestion is to keep 3 6 months living expense in checking saving very very liquid short term investments after that you can invest the rest in more profitable ventures   assuming that you are all set in that regard next consideration is whether you have any goal for the money besides generating the maximum return is this for retirement buying a house apartment a few year down the road graduate school emergency cash store for the time between graduation and getting a job or traveling a year in europe after graduation there are myriad of other possible goals knowing that you get a better idea of the time frame involved in the investment and what you need to do with your money if this is for retirement you just need to generate the highest possible return for 40 50 years while minimize taxes when you have to withdraw that money there are more nuanced concerns but large idea wise that 's what you need to do if you want it for a trip to an exotic location in 2 year then your primary goal will be to preserve the value of your capital while assessing whether you need to manage foreign exchange risk   the time frame also rule in or rule out certain types of investments if you are planning to use the money to purchase a house in 5 years iras probably would not be what you are looking for if you are planning to retirement short term cd would not be the most effective way after figuring out a bit of what you are trying to do with the money i think how you want to invest it will be much more clear to you in case of retirement people seem to generally recommend no load index funds and mid cap growth funds nothing is really off the table since your investment time frame is so long and you can tolerate risk you might also be interested to check out i have no relation with them a friend recommended it to me and i think their pitch make sense   in other cases it really is case dependent and there might have more than one solution to any case there is just one more potential investment venture that people you might not immediately thinking of and that might be of interest to you that is to use the $ 5000 as your own budget to build maintain connections with people and network use it to take professors out to a meal to pick their brain travel to keep in touch with old friends network with potential future employers and peers to improve job prospect or get opportunities to meet interesting people   i hope this helps

gt;you assume that student performance is a good proxy for teacher performance one of the bigger influences on student performance is parent engagement   if the goal is success in actual conveyance of knowledge then external factors are merely the environment in which the performance or lack thereof must be executed   if a teacher is incapable of reaching a particular group of students due to whatever environmental reasons then that teacher is obviously not performing in that environment   it would be best then for everyone including that teacher to get a different teacher in their place and for that teacher then to attempt to teach in a different environment where they may be capable of shining rather than to keep them in an environment where they are failing   a big part of the problem here is that merit is seen by teachers as if it were a judgment of them as people which ironically enough is a rather juvenile mindset when in fact it is merely a judgement of their specific performance in a particular situation   and as far as pay is concerned pay varies in virtually every profession and industry and people move and choose accordingly the seeking of some utopian is woefully naive

i think the question as worded has some incorrect assumptions built into it but let me try to hit the key answers that i think might help your broker ca n't really do anything here    your broker does n't own the calls you sold and ca n't elect to exercise someone else 's calls your broker can take action to liquidate positions when you are in margin calls but the scenario you describe would n't generate them   if you are long stock and short calls the calls are covered and have no margin requirement   the stock is the only collateral you need and you can have the position on in a cash non margin account    so assuming you have n't bought other things on margin that have gone south and are generating calls your broker has no right to do anything to you if you 're wondering about the other guy meaning the person who is long the calls that you are short they are the one who can impact you by exercising their right to buy the stock from you   in that scenario you make $ 21 your maximum possible return since you bought the stock at $ 100 collected $ 1 premium and sold it for $ 120   but they usually wo n't do that before expiration and they pretty definitely wo n't here   the reason they usually wo n't is that most options trade above their intrinsic value the amount that they 're in the money     in your example the options are n't in the money at all    the stock is trading at 120 and the option gives the owner the right to buy at 120 put another way exercising the option lets the owner buy the stock for the exact same price anyone with no options can in the market   so if the call has any value whatsoever exercising it is irrational the owner would be better off selling the call and buying the stock in the market

if something in any transaction in life financial or otherwise make you feel comfortable and the choice is between saving money with one thing versus another do n’t sell your personal needs short pay more elsewhere that treats you the way you expect to be treated in the long run the $ $ $ you save in a cheaper transaction might cost you more in the headaches and annoyance you have to swallow in dealing with this bargain in the future your question is this do his sales tactics indicate other underlying problems how can i deal effectively with those tactics and you state this as well to make a long story short the dealer 's aggressive sales tactics have made me somewhat uncomfortable and finally ask how can i deal effectively with those tactics okay first and foremost if you feel discomfort in anything in life not just a financial situation just walk away you might have to say no when doing this but it ’s not always the case you will have to counter aggression with aggression and specifically in the case of a purchase like this you need to also ask yourself is this discount being offered me worth the headache i am getting at the end of the day money is meaningless and has it ’s main worth as an economic motivator someone has a need and someone else has something that can solve that need what would it take for the side of need to connect to the side of solution to that need this is the basic concept surrounding all economics so that said i have personally avoided buying things for less money and paid slightly more elsewhere for a service experience that made me feel comfortable at the end of the day if you feel happy in the transaction it helps in the long run more than let ’s say the $ 20 to $ 40 you save by buying from someone else also on the side of customer service this person ’s sales techniques sound like something out of a very old fashioned sales playbook nowadays it ’s all about relationships and service the immediate sale is not as important for competent and reputable businesses because they know a better customer service experience will bring people back so it does n’t matter how long this guy has been in business it could be that he ’s been in business a long time just because he has been in business a long time that said and in the case of musical instruments maybe this guy is really good at care and upkeep of instruments but has crappy sales techniques keep that in mind as well and just push back on their sales methods for things like musical instruments people might be jerks on the sales side but in the maintenance and repair side they are great will you need to go to them if when your instrument needs repair or you do n’t care at the end of the day go with your gut and if your gut says no then just go somewhere else and spend your money on an item you like from a place that treats you the way you need

that 's not 100 correct as some leveraged vehicles choose to re balance on a monthly basis making them less risky but still risky   if i 'm not mistaken the former oil etn was a monthly re balance before it was shut down by the man monthly leveraged vehicles will still suffer slippage not saying they wo n't   but instead of re balancing 250 times per year they do it 12 times    in my book less iterations equals less decay basically you 'll bleed just not as much   i 'd only swing trade something like this in a retirement account where i 'd be prohibited from trading options seems like you can get higher leverage with less risk trading options plus if you traded leaps you could choose to re balance only once per year

the answer depends on what is your portfolio 's objective    if you are operating a multi asset class portfolio i.e. your portfolio has both bonds and stocks and are targeting absolute returns then yes comparing a stock 's beta or correlation to a bond benchmark makes sense what you do with this stock 's bond beta information further depends on what kind of return profile you want your multi asset class portfolio to have if you want stocks that appreciate in price when bond prices decline then of course you want to buy negative bond beta stocks   if you are operating a purely relative equity portfolio i.e. you are to the stock market then comparing the bond beta is of little use to you   hope this helps

so why or why should i not invest in the cheaper index fund they are both same one is not cheaper than other you get something that is worth $ 1000   to give a simple illustration there is an item for $ 100 vanguard creates 10 units out of this so price per unit is $ 10 schwab creates 25 units out of this so the per unit price is $ 4 now if you are looking at investing $ 20 with vanguard you would get 2 units with schwab you would get 5 units this does not mean one is cheaper than other both are at the same value of $ 20    the factors you need to consider are related question what index funds and etfs

unfortunately the tax system in the u.s. is probably more complicated than it looks to you right now first you need to understand that there will be taxes withheld from your paycheck but the amount that they withhold is simply a guess   you might pay too much or too little tax during the year   after the year is over you 'll send in a tax return form that calculates the correct tax amount   if you have paid too little over the year you 'll have to send in the rest but if you 've paid too much you 'll get a refund   there are complicated formulas on how much tax the employer withholds from your paycheck but in general if you do n't have extra income elsewhere that you need to pay tax on you 'll probably be close to breaking even at tax time when you get your paycheck the first thing that will be taken off is fica also called social security medicare or the payroll tax   this is a fixed 7.65 that is taken off the gross salary   it is not refundable and is not affected by any allowances or deductions and does not come in to play at all on your tax return form there are optional employee benefits that you might need to pay a portion of if you are going to take advantage of them such as health insurance or retirement savings   some of these deductions are paid with before tax money and some are paid with after tax money the employer will calculate how much money they are supposed to withhold for federal and state taxes yes california has an income tax and the rest is yours at tax time the employer will give you a form w-2 which shows you the amount of your gross income after all the before tax deductions are taken out which is what you use to calculate your tax   the form also shows you how much tax you have paid during the year form 1040 is the tax return that you use to calculate your correct tax for the year   you start with the gross income amount from the w-2 and the first thing you do is add in any income that you did n't get a w-2 for such as interest or investment income and subtract any deductions that you might have that are not taxable but were not paid through your paycheck such as moving expenses student loan interest tuition etc   the result is called your adjusted gross income next you take off the deductions not covered in the above section property tax home mortgage interest charitable giving etc   you can either take the standard deduction $ 6,300 if you are single or if you have more deductions in this category than that you can itemize your deductions and declare the correct amount after that you subtract more for exemptions   you can claim yourself as an exemption unless you are considered a dependent of someone else and they are claiming you as a dependent   if you claim yourself you take off another $ 4,000 from your income what you are left with is your taxable income for the year   this is the amount you would use to calculate your tax based on the bracket table you found california has an income tax and just like the federal tax some state taxes will be deducted from your paycheck and you 'll need to fill out a state tax return form after the year is over to calculate the correct state tax and either request a refund or pay the remainder of the tax   i do n't have any experience with the california income tax but there are details on the rates on this page from the state of california

i like your enthusiasm and initiative however there are a few things you need to consider that you have n't yet thought about first it is important to remember that trading with fake money is not the same as trading with real money   in the fake world you have $ 100k   with this fake money you can do reckless things with it such as put it all on one stock   if you lose it costs you nothing so you do n't have an emotional attachment to it   with real money it will feel different and that is something you have n't experienced yet second you mentioned that you are good at making picks   with all due respect i suggest that you are n't old enough to make that determination   you have n't been trading for long enough to determine if you are doing well at it     that having been said i do n't want to completely discourage you from trying something new third you mentioned long term investing but you also said that you need to make your money back quick and mentioned trading daily   those things are n't really compatible   i would n't consider what you are doing as long term investing   with the type of investing you are doing picking individual stocks and hoping for the value to go up in a relatively short time frame it is similar to gambling   the risk of losing is very much there and you should n't be investing money this way that you are n't prepared to lose   if you need the money for something soon do n't put it in the stock market never forget this   what can happen is that you start with small amounts of money do well and then thinking that you are good at this put in larger amounts of money   you will eventually lose   if you put in money that you need for something else you have a problem if you are trying this out for education and entertainment purposes that is great   but when it starts to get serious make sure that you are aware of the risks   educate yourself and be smart here is what i would suggest if you want to try this short term day trading type investing and you understand that the money can easily be lost i would balance that with investing in a more traditional way set aside an amount each month to put in a low expense index mutual fund   doing this will have several benefits for you   as for your specific questions about stock trading with small amounts yes you can trade with small amounts however every time you trade you will be paying a commission   even with a discount broker if you are trading frequently the commissions you will be paying will be very significant at the dollar amounts you are talking about   the only way i can see around this would be to try the robinhood app which allows you to trade without paying sales commission   i have no experience with that app

as i stated in my comment on 's answer the only way you benefit by putting your money in an ira or other tax deferred vehicle is if you expect to have a lower tax rate when you withdraw than when you put the money in   if you look at 's numbers and remember to pay taxes when you withdraw the money in 30 years you will see that both situations paying taxes now or 30 years from now give you the exact same dollar amount if the tax rates are the same at both points in time   so if you put money in an ira you 're betting on the fact that the government will not substantially raise interest rates by then and/or that you will be in a lower tax bracket to me the only valid reasons to invest in an ira or 401 k are the following however you should also consider the major downside that the money is locked away and at best inconvenient to access when you need it   at worst you have to pay taxes and penalties if you ever withdraw that money   if you are a financially responsible person i think you 're generally better off keeping your money outside of an ira or 401 k with the exception of making sure to get all of your employer 's matching contributions

nobel laureate economist paul krugman wrote a piece many ago about economic expansion and money supply   as an illustration of how money supply affects the economy he used the example of a baby sitting co op   while simplistic it provides an easy to grasp notion of how printing money and restricting it e.g. by pegging the currency to gold reserves can affect the economy here is an excerpt from his webpage with the decline of the traditional extended family in which relatives were available to take care of children at need many parents in the united states have sought alternative arrangements a popular scheme is the baby sitting coop in which a group of parents agree to help each other out on a reciprocal basis with each parent serving both as baby sitter and baby any such coop requires rules that ensure that all members do their fair share one natural answer at least to people accustomed to a market economy is to use some kind of token or marker system parents earn tokens by babysitting then in turn hand over these tokens when their own children are minded by others for example a recently formed coop in western massachusetts uses sticks each representing one hour of babysitting when a new parent enters the coop he or she receives an initial allocation of ten sticks   this system is self regulating in the sense that it automatically ensures that over any length of time a parent will put in more or less the same amount of time that he or she receives it turns out however that establishing such a token system is not enough to make a coop work properly it is also necessary to get the number of tokens per member more or less right to see why suppose that there were very few tokens in circulation parents will want on average to hold some reserve of tokens enough to deal with the possibility that they may want to go out a few times before they have a chance to babysit themselves and earn more tokens any individual parent can of course try to accumulate more tokens by babysitting more and going out less but what happens if almost everyone is trying to accumulate tokens as they will be if there are very few in circulation one parent 's decision to go out is another 's opportunity to babysit so if everyone in the coop is trying to add to his or her reserve of tokens there will be very few opportunities to babysit this in turn will make people even more reluctant to go out and use up their precious token reserves and the level of activity in the coop may decline to a low level   the solution to this problem is of course simply to issue more sticks but not too many because an excess of sticks can pose an equally severe problem suppose that almost everyone in the coop has more sticks than they need then they will be eager to go out but reluctant to babysit it will therefore become hard to find and since opportunities to use sticks will become rare people will become even less willing to spend time and effort earning them too many tokens in circulation then can be just as destructive as too few paul krugman 1997 accessed webpage 2010

you 're getting paid by the job not by the hour so i do n't see why you think the employer is obligated to pay you for the drive time   the only way that might be true as far as i can see is if he were avoiding paying you minimum wage by structuring your employment this way   it looks like to me you 're over the minimum wage based on what you wrote   at maximum unpaid drive time 59 min each way and maximum length of job 4 hours as you stated it gives your minimum hourly rate of $ the federal minimum wage is currently $ so you 're over that   a quick search online suggests that nv does have a higher minimum at $ under some conditions but you 're still over that too the fact that you 're required to pick up the and that you have a company car at home probably does mean that you 're on the clock from the moment that you leave your house but again you 're not actually being paid by the clock   as long as no other law is being broken and it appears from your telling that there is n't then the employer can set any policy for how to compute the compensation that he wants regarding taxes the employer probably has no discretion there   you 're making what you 're making and the employer needs to tax it in total   since you 're driving a company vehicle from home i do n't think that you 're entitled to any reimbursement vs. wages that would not be taxed unless maybe you pay for gas yourself   the gas money if applicable should be reimbursable as a business expense and that generally would not be taxed

in 2010 the restore online shoppers confidence act was passed which prohibited certain activities most of which had to do with online sites sharing your cc info with third parties   however the final part of the act deals with negative option marketing which is basically what you 're describing we will charge you unless you say no it requires three components to allow a negative option if you did not explicitly enroll in automatic payment and made the initial purchase online or made your most recent purchase online i suspect then it sounds like this was a violation of this act   on the other hand the act is n't terribly careful about defining terms and is really quite vague in a lot of places so it 's possible they would argue they are not using a negative option scheme but instead simply charging your bill similar to how your phone company might use autopay if it was not online then this probably does n't apply   instead the ftc 's rule on negative option with regard to sale of goods applies   title 16 part covers this this law is much less limiting as to what the marketer can do

in fact buybacks were often considered a vehicle for insider trading especially prior to 1982   for instance prior to the reagan era executives avoided buybacks due to fears that    they would be prosecuted for market manipulation but under sec rule    adopted in 1982 companies receive a safe harbor from market    manipulation liability on stock buybacks if they adhere to four    limitations not engaging in buybacks at the beginning or end of the    trading day using a single broker for the trades purchasing shares    at the prevailing market price and limiting the volume of buybacks to    25 percent of the average daily trading volume over the previous four    weeks

there are two answers to this excluding central banks which are really just a banks to private banks   please note   this is an oversimplification and not accounting for the fact that banks operate in both categories now     banks are either depository institutions or financial service transaction providers     depository institutions are your typical retail bank regions boa retail wells fargo retail etc   they accept deposits from account holders and lend out via reserve lending to mortgages and business loans for their revenue generation     financial service transaction providers are better known as   you have your goldman sachs deutsche bank jp morgan morgan stanley etc   these have traditionally been banks that do not accept deposit accounts but revenue generation comes from financial services such as asset management and research or from financial transaction such as market making offering both buy sell quotes in capital markets   this is generally the role that banks have played historically from the medieval ages on they started out as being entities that provided access to connecting buyers and sellers of markets

the mortgage interest deduction alone could n't make this work but if you realize less income by living off the mortgage funds then it could definitely reduce your taxes by much more than the cost of the mortgage interest   particularly if you are waiting for some future cut off date e.g. turning 59.5 and getting access to roth funds turning 70 and getting social security simply doing a roth conversion with strategic recharacterization at age 40 and waiting 5 years to get the money out penalty free etc   and that future date could be quite far off if you only use a small fraction of the total mortgage each year plus it is fairly reasonable to assume that equity market returns will outpace mortgage rates especially if you are rich and do n't need to worry about living on the street even if the market hits unprecedented lows   while i find most financial advisers to be incompetent most people really i would n't write this guy off just because he left out the specific details that made the strategy work for one particular client

you would appear to be a swing trader like myself i have been trading futures and futures options for 29 years and have both made and lost a lot of money in that time my trades last hours to days to at most a few weeks from my experience the most important skills are 1 money management keeping trade size small in relation to total capital i typically risk 2 3 of my capital on a trade so a loss is fairly immaterial 2 risk management limit your loss on every trade either by using stop orders options or a combination of these 2 3 emotional discipline be prepared to exit a position or reverse from long to short or short to long   on a moment 's notice the market does n't care where you entered or whether you make or lose money do n't let your or the news influence your decisions but follow the market 4 methodology discipline test your analysis trade entry method to ensure that it is objective and has a reasonably good probability of success then stick with it variation will inevitably lead to indecision or emotional reactions 5 flexibility consider trading anything which can make you a profit but ensure that there is a lot of liquidity i trade 30 different futures markets as well as various option writing strategies in these markets   feel free to reach out if you want to discuss further i have about 500 yes 500 trading e books as well on every trading subject you can think of

my husband made a similar car loan decision when he was younger and did n't have an established credit history favourable credit rating   as a result he ended up paying triple what the car was worth because of the interest when we consolidated our finances this ugly loan was first on our list of priorities to change convert eliminate but unfortunately in our case the terms of the loan were such that only the lender benefited   there was no incentive to pay off the loan early in fact we would have to have paid all the future interest at once without saving a penny so check the terms of your loan hopefully you 're better off than we were   in our case the only upside we could figure was the lesson of live and learn

ditto bill and i upvoted his answer but let me add a bit if everyone knew exactly what the risk was for every investment then prices would be bid up or down until every stock or bond or derivative or whatever was valued at exactly risk times potential profit or more precisely integral of risk times potential profit if company a was 100 guaranteed to make $ 1 million profit this year while company b had 50 change to make a $ 2 million profit and 50 to make $ 0 and every investor in the world knew that then i 'd expect the total price of all shares of the two stocks to stabilize at the same value the catch to that though is that no one really knows the risk the risk is n't like we 're going to roll a die and if it comes up even the company makes $ 1 million and if it comes up odd the company makes $ 0 so we could calculate the exact probability the risk comes from lack of information will consumers want to buy this new product how many what are they willing to pay how capable is the new ceo etc it 's very hard to calculate probabilities on these things how can you precisely calculate the probability that unforeseen events will occur so in real life prices are the risk reward ratio should be roughly sort of approximately linear but that 's about the most one can say

i do n't buy new cars anymore but i 've helped family members negotiate prices on new cars recently there are various online services to see the average price paid as well as the low outliers i 've looked at for instance to see what others have paid within 50 miles of my zip code i think the only way for you to know you 're being offered a good deal is to see if any of the other dealers that have not responded are willing to talk when you offer them $ which the dealer above suggested was break even point if none of them respond then you know you 're really at the bottom of the negotiating window if one of them does respond then you can go back to that internet sales manager and ask why another dealership do not disclose which one is willing to sell it to you for less than $ do not disclose how much lower they offered to sell it for   in my experience most dealers will sell at or just below the break even price at the end of the quarter so that they can beat other dealerships out for the quota that gives you a week and a half to find the bottom price before going in on new years eve to seal the deal

one factor to consider is that some employers have a 401k contribution match policy that only allows a certain percentage of any given paycheck to be matched so if the company is willing to match 4 of each paycheck you could run into a problem here where you lose out on some of your company match for example suppose you get a $ 20,000 bonus you can contribute $ 18,000 per year to your 401k and this bonus could be a nice way to knock most of that out and then take home your full paycheck the rest of the year sounds pretty nice but there 's a problem the company will only match 4 of your $ 20,000 $ 800 when they otherwise would have matched up to 4 of your annual salary $ 4,000 if you 're making $ 100,000 in this example i 'd say it 's definitely worth it to make a big contribution to your 401k when you get a bonus as it 's an easy way to get a lot of money in there without really feeling a loss since it 's extra money on top of your normal paycheck but i 'd definitely be careful about this situation you do n't want to throw away free money to avoid this problem make sure that you leave enough of your annual limit so you can contribute enough to get your 4 company match on every paycheck of the year

since you have no sales i 'd likely question how well could you determine the value of the company 's assets in a reasonable fashion you may be better to estimate sales and discount that back to a current valuation for example insurance companies could determine that if you wanted to be paid $ x month for the rest of your life the present day value of that is $ y. there are similar mechanisms for businesses but this does get tricky as the estimates have to be somewhat conservative and you have to be prepared for some other scenarios for example if you got the $ 200,000 then would you really never have to ask for more external equity financing in the future or is it quite likely that you 'd want another infusion down the road while you can mark it at $ 1,000,000 there will be questions about why that value that you 'd have to answer and saying cause i like big round numbers may not go over well my suggestion is to consider what kind of sales will the company have over the next 5 years that you could work back to determine a current price if you believe the company can have $ 5,000,000 in sales over the 5 years then it may make sense to place the current valuation of $ 1,000,000 on it i would n't look too much into the money and time you 've invested as that is n't likely to go over well with investors that just because you 've put in what is worth $ x the business may or may not be worth that the challenge is that without sales it is quite difficult to get an idea of what is the company worth if it makes billions then it is worth a lot more than a company that never turns a profit another way to consider this is the question of what kind of economic output do you think you could do working here for the next 5 years could you do thousands of dollars of work millions of dollars or just a few bucks consider how you want this to be seen where if you want some help look up episodes of tv shows like dragon 's den or shark tank as these give valuations often as part of the pitch which is what you are doing

i assume you 've no debt if you do then pay that off i 'd be tempted to put the money into property   if you look at property prices over the past 20 years or so you can see returns can be very good   i bought a house in 1998 and sold it in 2003 for about 110 of the purchase price   disclaimer past performance is no guarantee of future returns it 's a fairly low risk option property prices appear to be rising currently and it 's always good to get your foot on the housing ladder as quickly as you can as prices can rise to the stage where even those earning quite a good salary can not afford to buy of course you do n't have to live in the house a rental income can be very handy without tying you down too much there are plenty of places in the uk where £ 60k will buy you a reasonable property with a rental income of £ it have to be near where you live currently just to put a few more figures in if you get a house for £ 50k and rent it for £ 400 a month perfectly feasible where i live then that 's very close to a 10 return year on year   plus any gains made by the price of the house the main downside is you wo n't have easy access to the money and you will have to look after a tenant if you decide to rent it out   also if you do buy a property make sure it is in a good state of repair you do n't want to have to pay for a new roof for example in a couple of years time ideally you would then sell the house around the time property prices peak and buy another when they bottom out again   not easy to judge though i 'd review the trust fund against others if you decide to keep it there as 12 over 6 years is n't great although the stock market has been depressed so it may compare keep some rainy day money spare if you can

the deposit insurance is n't provided by the bank it 's provided by the singapore deposit insurance corporation sdic in the event that the bank fails or is declared insolvent the sdic will pay deposit holders their total balance in all accounts with that bank up to s$50,000 if you hold in all of your insured accounts you 'll only receive s$50,000 if the bank fails   the sdic provides an example page with sample calculations and this is exactly what they show if you deposit an amount greater than $ it 's only insured up to s$50,000   so does it mean one should open multiple accounts under different banks to spread the money around and maintain only s$50,000 in one deposit account this is one option the calculations page i linked to above gives this reminder deposits are not insured separately in each branch office of a di scheme member i.e. all your eligible accounts maintained with different branches of a di scheme member are aggregated and insured up to s$50,000 this seems like common sense but it 's important to remember that if you open an account with two branch offices of bank a your deposits are aggregated and insured up to s$50,000 the sdic insurance is per institution called a deposit insurance member not per branch if you hold in each branch office for a total of you 're still only insured up to s$50,000 for that bank if you want to spread out your accounts between multiple banks make sure they 're different banks not just different branches another option if it applies to you is to open a joint account with your spouse in the faq page the sdic gives this example under point 14 if you and your husband have a joint account with and you have a separate account of your total deposits of will be covered to the maximum of s$50,000 the deposit of $ is split evenly between the spouses so in the eyes of the sdic each are holding then the husband 's additional is added to for a total of s$50,000 this is then insured up to s$50,000 as usual   i 'm sure there are other options specific to singapore that i 'm not aware of if you 're well above the limit i.e. holding millions of dollars i 'm sure a professional accountant in singapore could guide you further

i recommend you take a look at this lecture really the whole series is enlightening from swenson he identifies 3 sources of returns diversification timing and selection he appears to discard timing and selection as impossible a student kinda calls him out on this diversification reduces risk not increase returns it turns out they did time the market by shorting .com 's before the bubble and real estate just before the downturn in 1990 yale started a absolute return unit and allocated like 15 percent to it mostly by selling us equities that specializes in these sorts of hedging moves as for why you might employ managers for specific areas consider that the expense ratio wall street charges you or me still represent a very nice salary when applied to the billions in yale 's portfolio so they hire internally to reduce expenses and i 'm sure they 're kept busy they also need people to sell off assets to maintain ratios and figuring out which ones to sell might take specialized knowledge finally in some areas you functionally can not invest without management for example yale has a substantial allocation in private equity and by definition that does n't trade on the open market the other thing you should consider is that for all its diversification yale lost 25 percent of their portfolio in 2009 for a technique that 's supposed to reduce volatility they seem to have a large range of returns over the past five years

if you pay your statement balance in full before the due date you will never pay a cent in interest no matter what your interest rate is   in fact i do n't even know what my interest rates are credit card companies offer this sort of thing in the hopes you will spend more than you can afford to pay completely in those first 15 months   unless you use a cash advance with those you will accrue interest immediately upon receiving the cash sometimes with an additional fee on top

in the us the key to understanding the benefits of retirement accounts is to understand capital gains taxes and how they work retirement accounts are designed for making investments throughout your career then after several decades of contributions withdrawing that money to pay for your needs when your full time employment has concluded normally when you invest money in a brokerage account if the value of your investment increases and you sell in less than a year those investments are considered short term gains and taxed as ordinary income if you hold that same investment for over a year the same investment is taxed at a lower capital gains rate depending on which tax bracket you are in during that year the amount due could be up to 20 but much lower than your regular income tax rate when you place your money in a retirement account you are choosing to either pay the tax due on the income when you put it in the account or put the money in tax free and pay the tax when you withdraw these are called tax deferred accounts when you have money invested several decades the raw dollar amount increases greatly but inflation is also reducing the value of those dollars imagine you bought some bonds that payed 4 over 40 years but inflation was 2 during those same years when you sell those bonds 40 years later you will owe capital gains on the entire gain even though half of the gain came from inflation retirement accounts allow you to buy and sell according to your investment needs and goals without any consideration about whether the gains are short term or long term and they also allow you to pay taxes just once either when you put it in or when you take it out with no worries about whether you 're paying taxes on inflated gains

i think in such situations a good rule of thumb may be if you are asked to pay significant sums of money upfront before anything is done stop and ask yourself what would you do if they do n't do what they promised they know who you are but usually most you know is a company name and phone number both can disappear in a minute and what are you left with   if they said they 'd pay off the debt and issue the new loan fine let them do it and then you pay them if they insist on having money upfront without delivering anything unless it 's a very big and known and established company you probably better off not doing it either it 's a scam or in the minuscule chance they are legit you still risking too much you 're giving money and not getting anything in return

first do you understand why it dropped was it overvalued before or is this an overreaction to some piece of news about them or about their industry or arguably if you ca n't answer that you are n't paying enough attention to have been betting on that individual stock assuming you do understand why this price swing occurred or if you 're convinced you know better than the folks who sold at that price do you believe the stock will recover a significant part of its value any time soon or at least show a nice rate of growth from where it is now if so you might want to hold onto it risking further losses against the chance of recovering part or all of what is at this moment only a loss on paper basically if having just seen it drop you 'd still consider buying it at the new price you should buy it from yourself and go on from here that way at least you are n't doing exactly what you hope to avoid buying high and selling low heck if you really believe in the stock you could see this as a buying opportunity on the other hand if you do not believe you would buy it now at its new price and if you see an alternative which will grow more rapidly you should take your losses and move your money to that other stock or split the difference if you are n't sure which is better but can figure out approximately how unsure you are the question is how you move on from here more than how you got here what happened happened what do you think will happen next and how much are you willing to bet on it on the hand this is part of how the market operates risk and potential reward tend to be pretty closely tied to each other you can reduce risk by diversifying across multiple investments so no one company sector market can hurt you too badly and almost anyone sane will tell you that you should diversify but that means giving up some of the chance for big winnings too you probably want to be cautious with most of your money and go for the longer odds only with a small portion that you can afford to lose on if this is really stressing you out you may not want to play with individual stocks mutual funds have some volatility too but they 're inherently diversified to a greater or lesser extent they will rarely delight you but they wo n't usually slap you this way either

there 's not a single answer here as the premium you pay for car insurance depends on multiple factors including but not limited to all these factors contribute to the likelihood of getting into an accident and the expected damage from an accident   so just having an accident and making a claim will likely raise your premium all else being equal but whether or not it will be cheaper in the long run depends obviously on how much your premium goes up which can not determined without all of the facts   your agent could tell you how much it would go up but even making such an inquiry would likely be noted on your insurance record and may cause your premium to go up although probably not by as much however the point of insurance is to reduce the out of pocket expenses from future accidents so the question to ask is how likely am i to have another accident and if i do can i pay cash for it or will i need to offset some cost with an insurance claim   do you risk making a claim and having your rates go up by more than $ 700 over the next 3 4 years the rough time it takes for a surcharge to expire   or do you just pay for the repair out of pocket and keep your premiums lower

i feel that getting money sooner than later is always advantageous if i offered you the choice between getting which option would you take i would take the last option and for the same reason from a purely numbers point of view i would argue that getting paid biweekly is preferable assuming the the annual salary is pro rated fairly and barring any compulsive spending habits your calculations suggest to me that they are trying to answer the question looking at a single year or month or some other fixed amount of time in a vacuum is there any financial benefit to being paid bi weekly over monthly the analysis seems to be focusing on comparing the two pay schedules on a month by month basis noting when one is paid bi weekly some months you get paid more times than the other however one could also compare the two pay schedules on a fortnight by fortnight basis and note that when one is paid monthly many you do n't get paid at all and some you get paid a lot or one could compare the two pay schedules on an hour by hour basis too but in the long run the money adds up to be the same amount i prefer getting it as soon as i can

what you are seeing is the effects of inflation as money becomes less valuable it takes more of it to buy physical things be they commodities shares in a company 's stock and peoples time salaries   just about the only thing that does n't track inflation to some degree is cash itself or money in an account since that is itself what is being devalued   so the point of all this is buying anything a house gold stocks that does n't depreciate a car is something of a hedge against inflation however do n't be tricked as many are into thinking that house just made you a tidy sum just because it went up in value so much over x years remember 1 all the other houses and things you 'd spend the money on are a lot more expensive now too and 2 you put a lot more money into a house than the mortgage payment taxes insurance maintenance etc i 'm with the others though do n't get caught up in the gold bubble doing so now is just speculation and has a lot of risk associated with it

i feel like that any full answer has multiple facets   free for 7 years i 'm currently in kc and most of the people in my area are opting in for the free service so if i were able to get fibre my neighborhood did n't get enough votes it would cut my $ bill from time warner and my service would increase if anything that 's a huge cut and it pays for itself $ 300 set up fee in the first year then over the next 7 years it saves me over $ 3000 in bills for some company like time warner to offer this they 'd lose a large amount of service free mediocre internet is a huge threat to companies whose top sellers are expensive mediocre internet   lawsuits like other people have stated it 's pretty impossible to become an actual competitor to these companies the other isps namely twc and comcast fight anybody who pops up there are minor providers in some of the outer suburbs but they ca n't offer near the speed that a fibre solution provides   city approval even google ran into issues with this cities have to approve things like new fibre lines and if they do n't you 're pretty much stuck park a wealthier suburb of kansas city were really dragging their feet on getting google approved google just decided to take the deal off the table google is such a big name however that people in park freaked out at their city council and i do n't know what they did but google has opened up signups for them now if this was a no name company though they would have been out of luck and just been barred from entry altogether city council problems are actually pretty interesting   cost effectiveness and overhead building a fibre network in kc is a pretty big cost there are others around but really only in the commercial areas so whatever company wants to compete with google has to go without making a profit for several several years in order to speed up that time and save the company they 'd have to raise prices and less people would be interested in their product   google really pulled off something huge here i 'm pretty excited for what their doing even if my stupid neighbors did n't sign up and i do n't get to reap the benefits i 'm interested to see what effects this has on a larger scale when they start moving to other cities

without knowing what the balances are i associate uncomfortable with high as in tens of thousands    what i would do is 1 cut up the cards and stop using them and 2 have some balance transfer offers in hand the next time you call to negotiate with the companies   essentially you will have to convince them that they will have to explain one of two things to their boss why they lowered your rate or why you left they can collect less interest from you or no interest from you   it 's up to them   if they do n't offer you something that 's in the ballpark of your balance transfer offer then bid them goodbye and complete the balance transfer as far as paying them off the top two modes of repayment are lowest balance first aka snowball or high interest rate first   both methods are similar in that you pay minimums on all but the method 's focus point   whether it is lowest balance or highest interest rate you pay all of your extra money on the lowest balance or the highest interest debt until it is gone and then you move onto the next one in the list for what it 's worth i prefer the lowest balance method you see progress faster

yeah me too as i said actually what i 'd really prefer is single payer but failing that getting health insurance separated from employment would be a big step forward if people really knew how much they are paying for health insurance things would change   i 've never worked for an employer that did n't renegotiate health insurance every year often changing insurance providers every year to the extent that hr departments are competent in finding the best value the current environment is pretty dynamic and competitive are individuals going to be as competent and well informed as hr departments i do n't know but i do know that simply making a market free does n't guarantee lower prices if consumers are ill informed and bad at making decisions   as for wages currently companies are not required to carry health insurance and many have dropped it already without increasing wages so i do n't see an upward pressure on wages from greater employee mobility   but it 's true that if there were a single large pool for insurance to be based off of large businesses would no longer get the pool advantage of health insurance over small businesses hence my preference for single payer or single group multi payer

expenses matter at the back end retirement the most often quoted withdrawal rate is 4 how would it feel to be paying 1/4 of each years income to fees separate from the taxes due separate from whether the market is up or down kudos to you for learning this lesson so early   your plan is great and while i often say do n't let the tax tail wag the investing dog being mindful of the tax hit in any planned transaction is worthwhile   selling and moving enough funds to stay at 0 is great a no brainer as they say selling more depends on the exact numbers involved do a fake return and see how an extra $ etc worth of fund sale impacts the taxes it will depend on how much gain there is for each $ xxx of fund say you are up 25 so $ 1000 has $ 200 of gain 15 of $ 200 is $ 30 a fee cost you $ so it 's worth waiting till january to sell the next shares of the fund   keep in mind the test return will still have the 2013 rates and brackets i suggest this only as an estimating tool

quote from the article the banks achieved this gigantic rip off by secretly colluding to rig the public bids on municipal bonds a business worth $ 3.7 trillion   please explain to me how you read that and why you think it is correct does it read as the banks made 3.7 t are the values of the banks 3.7 t did they steal 3.7 t did the bonds return 3.7 t or is it just that the total value of the bonds over many many more years than this entire fraud took place total to 3.7 including the value that really was owned by bond holders and had nothing to do with the profits or theft   hint 1 3.7 trillion is not the worth of any of those businesses not even the sum of all their market caps probably reaches that value hint 2 matt taibbi is smart enough to know this yet writes it that way anyways because sloppy thinkers will buy his crap find that the value of an entire class of assets is 3.7 t even though it is not the value of any business it 's like saying citibank is worth the sum of all the deposits it holds when that is nonsense

i 'll try to give you some clues on how to find an answer to your question rather than answering directly the question asked   why not answer it directly well i can but it wo n't help you or anyone else much in two months when the rates change again generally you wo n't find such in brick and mortar banks you can save some time and only look at online banks examples ing direct capitalone capitalone amex e*trade ally etc there are plenty go to their web sites look for promotions and compare sometimes you can find coupons promotions which will yield more than the actual savings rate for example ing frequently have a $ 50 promotion for opening a new account you need to understand that rates change frequently and the highest rate account today may become barely average in a week there are plenty of sites that offer various levels of comparison information one of the most comprehensive ones imho is bankrate.com another place to look is these sites provide various comparisons and you can also find some promotions advertised there there are more similar sites also search the internet and you can find various blog posts with additional promotions frequently banks give referral bonuses to provide incentive for clients to promote the banks do some due diligence on the results that appear promising not much you wo n't find any savings account that would keep the value purchasing power of your money over the long term keeping money in savings accounts is a sure way to lose value because the inflation rate is much higher than even high yield savings accounts but savings accounts are safe insured by fdic ncua up to the limit and very convenient to keep short term savings such as an emergency fund that you can not afford to lose to investments sometimes you 'll get slightly better rates by locking up your money in a certificate of deposit cd but not significantly higher when the cd is short term

if you really believe in the particular stocks then do n't worry about their daily price   overall if the company is sound and presumably paying a dividend then you 're in it for the long haul notwithstanding that it is reasonable to look for a way out   the two you describe are quite different in their specifics selling sounds like the simpler of the two but the trigger event and if it is automatic or manual matters   if you are happy to put in a sell order at some time in the future then just go ahead with that many brokers can place a stop order that will trigger on a certain price threshold being hit   do note however that by default this would place a market order and depending on the price that breaks through in the event of a flash crash depending on how fast the brokers systems were you could find yourself selling quite cheaply a stop limit order will place a limit order at a triggered price   this would limit your overall downside loss but you might not sell at all if the market is really running away options are another reasonable way to deal with the situation sort of like insurance   in this case you would likely buy a put which would give you the right but not the obligation to sell the stock at the price the that was specified in the option   in this case no matter what you are out the price of the option itself hence my to insurance but if the event never happens then that was the price you paid to have that peace of mind i can not recommend a specific course of action but hopefully that fleshed out the options you have

i know that if you make more you pay more but do those who have    more not make more pay higher income tax in general no in most locales income tax is based on income not on wealth i am retired i have little income but a fair amount of wealth i play very little income tax but i do pay other kinds of taxes here 's a scenario 2 people of average wealth with similar situations    have the same job with equal pay after 5 years their situations    have n't changed and they still earn equal pay but now one has $ 40,000    in their account and the other $ 9,000 does one now pay higher income    tax because he has more in his account or does he pay the same because    he makes the same in most locales you pay income tax on everything that is counted as income your salary is income in some cases earned interest is income   but aside from the earned interest from your bank accounts neither the $ 40,000 nor the $ 9,000 is income your huge mansion is n't income your expensive car is n't income the huge amount of land you own is n't income the pricey artwork on your walls is n't income you do n't pay income tax on any of these but your local may impose other taxes on these such as property tax etc note consult the tax laws of your specific locale if you want to know details

i have a job and would like to buy equipment for producing music at home and it would be easier for me to pay for the equipment monthly i just want to address your contention that it would be easier to pay monthly with an interest calculation   lets say you get a credit card with a very reasonable rate of 12 and you buy $ 2,500 of equipment   a typical credit card minimum payment is interest charges + 1 of the principle you can see how this is going   you 've paid nearly $ 200 to clear about $ 100 off your principle   obviously paying the minimum payment will take forever to wipe out this debt   so you pay more or maybe you get 0 interest for a while and take advantage of that paying $ 100 per month against $ 2,500 at 12 per year will take 29 months and cost about $ 390 in interest   at $ 200 per month it 'll take 14 months and cost $ 184 in interest   also note you 'll probably get an interest rate closer to 16 or 17 it 's always easier to pay small amounts frequently than it is to pay a lot of money all at once that ease has a cost   if you 're buying the gear to start a little business or you already have a little business going and want to upgrade some gear great disciplined debt handling is a wonderful skill to have in business   if you want to start yourself in to a new hobby you should not do that with debt   if interest rates are low enough financing something can make sense   0.9 apr on a car sure 15 apr on a mixing board no   credit card interest rates are significant and really should not be with

if the building has no income it also probably has minimal expenses the heat water and electricity costs are nearly zero they are letting the value depreciate and taking it off the taxes i also suspect the condition of the building is poor so any effort to make the building productive would be very costly many cities combat this by setting the tax on empty buildings or empty lots at a much higher rate or they set the value of the property at a high valuation based on what it could generate sometimes this is only targeted at some sections of the city to encourage development they also offer tax breaks when the owner of a house has the house as their principal residence

a couple of distinctions first if you were to invest in real estate were you planning to buy a home to live in or buy a home to rent out to someone else   buying a home as a primary residence really is n't investing in real estate per se   it 's buying a place to live rather than renting one   unless you rent a room out or get a multi family unit your primary residence wo n't be income producing   it will be income draining for the most part   i speak as a homeowner second if you are buying to rent out to someone else buying a single home is quite a bit different than buying an reit   the home is a lot less liquid the transaction costs are higher and all of your eggs are in one basket   having said that though if you buy one right and do your homework it can set you on the road for a very comfortable retirement

in addition to having separate income for federal and state tax purposes things can get really complicated if you ever have capital gains and losses suppose you sell taxable stocks for a loss of $ 5000 and meanwhile have capital gains of $ 1000 in your hsa from the federal perspective the gains in the hsa do n't exist so you deduct $ 3000 of the loss and then carry over the remaining $ 2000 however from the state perspective $ 1000 of the capital loss went to canceling out the gains in the hsa therefore you only carry over $ 1000 assuming you continue to have losses and gains this will carry on forever you 'll have to track completely independent sets of gains and losses and carryover losses for federal and state purposes forever even if you no longer use the hsa therefore i 'd recommend not investing hsa proceeds at all if you live in a state that does n't recognize hsas it 's just too complicated to be worth it especially since your provider wo n't track any of this for you

indeed there 's no short term long term issue trading inside the ira and in fact no reporting if you have a large ira balance and trade 100 for example times per year there 's no reporting at all   as you note long term gains outside the ira are treated favorably in the tax code as of now 2012 but that 's subject to change also to consider the worst thing i did was to buy apple in my ira a huge gain that will be taxed as ordinary income when i withdraw it had this been in my regular account i could sell and pay the long term cap gain rate this year   last there 's no concept of wash sale in one 's ira as there 's no taking a loss for shares sold below cost to clarify trading solely within an ira wo n't trigger wash sale rules a realized loss in a taxable account combined with a purchase inside an ira can trigger the wash sale rule if the stock is purchased inside the ira 30 days before or after the sale at a loss thank you dilip for the comment aside from the warnings of trading too much or running afoul of frequency restrictions your observation is correct

gnucash is much more designed for accounting than for budgeting while it does have some simple budgeting features they 're largely based around tracking how much has been spent in the expense categories accounts and seeing how close one is to a limit that 's been set because the point of gnucash is accounting there 's not a way to track an expense in two expense categories simultaneously you can split a transaction across multiple categories to have a grocery store purchase of $ 150 be split across $ 100 food and $ 50 phone minutes or whatever but not have a $ 150 purchase be tracked as $ 150 food and $ 150 household expenses because that 's not how double entry accounting works the closest way to do what i think you 're looking for is to take advantage of the account structure and repeat as needed for example this would allow you to see household expenses vs. vacation expenses and still see what it got spent on reporting on all food purchases if you want to do so is slightly more tricky as you 'd need to select all those food categories separately in your report but it 's possible you speak about wanting to track expenses multiple ways so i think that this would allow you to record data sufficient to track it but the point of tracking any data is to be able to report on it in some fashion so if you have more specific reporting requirements you might want to ask about that as well

war 2 was what carried america out of the great depression   not really the end results of world war ii did basically the destruction of all economic competition along with the fortunate improvements in productivity the advent of gasoline tractors in agriculture etc but the war years were ones of a combined voluntary forced austerity amp centralized planned production the vast majority of what was produced being destroyed or squandered   's possible people do desperate things when they 're hungry most people will resort to within 2 weeks without food    no most people will resort to a lot of other things first and then those failing they die of starvation   is and always has been a relatively rare thing   gt;it 's too unpredictable but my bet is that the coming collapse will be multiple times worse than the great depression   yes and no   probably longer in duration 20 to 30 years rather than ~10 and no doubt some significant parts of the infrastructure will deteriorate to the point of collapse   what in political amp economic terms comes out the other side of that is what is really unpredictable there will almost undoubtedly be some type of dictatorship police state in there most likely during the depression making it longer amp worse before it amp gets better but whether it would survive amp remain or be replaced by yet another in the aftermath is the big question

in the united states the general policy is that the irs would consider it income when you have access to the money i work for a company that has a contract with another company near the end of the year i turn in a time card that has my hours that i worked as of that date because they do n't pay me until early january the money on the check is counted in the new year i could n't touch the money until they issued the check if they had paid me on december 31st it would have counted as the old year even if i only had a short window to have access to it before the year ended it would even count as old year money if i held on to the december check but did n't deposit it until march so it would become income when you could use it so if you could access it via a check or debit card or transfer it to the bank it is now income of course that is in the united states you would need to see what the situation is in singapore the edge cases always depend on the country

if you do n't think you 're necessarily going to stay in this area for five years consider another option renting five years is often quoted as the minimum length of time for buying over renting as the costs of the house purchase and the mortgage are significant and if you 're buying a new house every 5 years you 're putting several thousand dollars of fees up front each time   if you do n't assume that house prices will increase as they wo n't necessarily then you can consider these costs say $ for a $ 500k house an extra 1 or so of interest that first year   if you are there 5 years then you 're paying 0.2 extra more or less that 's reasonable but if you 're there only 2 years you 're adding 0.5 to your rate which is pretty significant you wo n't necessarily come out ahead here versus renting renting for a year or two gives you enough time to find out if you do like the area and if you do you buy then with more knowledge of the area and a chance to make a purchase at the right time for you you pay off your loans or at least a chunk of them now save some of the rest and then rethink in a couple of years   if you then do n't qualify for a doctor 's mortgage anymore you just save up the rest of the 20 before making the purchase

in a free market supply and demand control the equilibrium point of a commodity price is one of the variables that demand   but the problem is employment is n't a free market you can not freely decide not to accept a job because you need some income to live    the wage of an employee especially at the unskilled tier is much more about availability of workers vs. jobs and better yet those jobs can be into shifts and so you can employ more people for less hours or vice versa    the employer therefore has a lot of control over effective wages as a result and it 's only connected to the free market of the value of service of a burger    so i 'd guess the market value would steadily drop to about the cost of living in the local area maybe a little below even because you can still employ people who are partially subsidised by family and further still you can have people themselves by working additional hours    so i reckon you 'd get equilibrium at about 90 of local cost of living if you work an 80 hour week

there seems to be a contradiction here home warranties not worth paper they 're written on and what struck us is that the immediately had the unit replaced there is a huge difference when you buy the insurance yourself and when a bank forces you to buy one because in the latter case the insurance is not for you it 's for the bank to protect their collateral which is your asset as well it becomes obvious when a claim comes up because the insurer is not negotiating with you it 's negotiating with another large financial institution and as far as the stereotype of banks being ruthless behemoths goes in this case you happen to benefit from being on the behemoth 's side and the insurer simply ca n't brush off a bank as much as it can brush off a person like you as you 've put it a house in phoenix without ac is not worth much so the bank could not let that happen because in case of another foreclosure they would have to fix the ac anyway

well yes but you should also begin to understand the sectoral component of real estate as a market too in that there can be commercial property   industrial property and retail property each of which is capable of having slightly tho usually similar of course different returns yields and risks   whereas you are saving to buy and enter into the residential property market which is different again and valuation principles are often out of here because buying a home although exposing your asset base to real estate risk is nt usually considered an investment as it is often made on emotional grounds not strict investment criteria

excellent question and it is a debate that is often raised   mathematically you are probably best off using option 1   any money that is above and beyond minimum payments earns a pretty high interest rate about in the form of saved interest payments the problem is you are likely to get discouraged   personal finance is a lot about behavior and after working at this for a year and still having 5 loans albeit a lower balance might take a bit of fight out of you paying off such a large balance in a reasonable time will take a lot of fight with the debt snowball you pay the minimum to the student loan save in an outside account and when it is large enough you execute option 2   so a year from now you might only have three loans instead of five   if you behaved exactly the same your balance would be higher after that year then using the previous method however often one does not behave the same   because the goals are shorter and more attainable it is easier to delay some gratification   the 8 dollars you are saving in your weekly gas budget because of low prices is meaningful when saving for a 4 k goal where it is meaningless when looking at it as a 74 k goal   with the 4 k goal you are more apt to put that money in your savings where the 74 k goal you might spend it on a latte for me the debt snowball worked really well with either option make sure that excess payments actually go to a reduction in principle not a prepayment of interest   given this you may be left with no option   for example if method 1 you only prepay interest you are forced to use option 2

it 's pretty easy for foreign scammers to get a us phone number or email    a domestic bank account is a little harder   very likely the direct contact   is a us citizen or a legal immigrant   the nigerian may be completely made up to throw you off the scent   and that person can be found or deported and there 's even a small chance of reversing the bank transfers it 's also hard for foreign scammers to sound american on the phone again suggesting a domestic scam or one with domestic agents   if you or your son is willing to do a serious amount of skill building and legwork you can uncover evidence by filing a lawsuit   once you have done so you can use the legal processes of discovery to force banks etc to give you information they would never give willingly   there are countless details   lawyers get paid to get the details right    suing actual people can backfire they can   but since you do not know their real name you would probably be filing a john doe lawsuit   john doe is a placeholder the idea being that you will later through discovery uncover the defendants real names   for a novice exploring the legal system for the first time there 's a big advantage john doe never or he never gets in your way or wastes your time heck he never even shows up in court and when you collect evidence via discovery you can take that to law enforcement or immigration    it goes without well there 's no need to go into that   just realize you did goof and make sure you learn the lessons

if your investment returns are the main variable you use to determine if your advisor is doing a good job you are using his or her services incorrectly   also if you are using a good advisor he or she needs to know how your investments are doing not you   however my thoughts are based on the idea that you ca n't go it alone   if you are not among the people concerned about the market waiting for the market to go down so you can find a better buying opportunity or making one of many other novice mistakes i 'm not speaking directly to you with my comments

i believe your question is based on a false premise first no broker that i know of provides an rrsp account that is a margin account rrsp accounts follow cash settlement rules   if you do n't have the cash available you ca n't buy a stock   you ca n't borrow money from your broker within your rrsp if you want to borrow money to invest in your rrsp you must borrow outside from another source and make a contribution to your rrsp   and if you do this the loan interest is not considered tax deductible in order for investment loan interest to be tax deductible you 'd need to invest outside of a registered type of account e.g. using a regular non tax sheltered account even then what you can deduct may be limited refer to cra line carrying charges and interest expenses you can claim the following carrying charges and interest    you can not deduct on line any of the following amounts

thanks    gt how do you believe it should be approached    businesses should be more cognizant of the fact that they have enormous amounts of technical debt or what will be considered to be debt that will suddenly need to be solved   infrastructure or applications that have n't seen a dime in 5 + years shadow it that was stood up e.g. hey we use this access database that everyone completely forgot about to meet this one specific need and has somehow managed to survive that 's one of the most frequent issues that will grind to a halt the business need to involve it as early as possible in the m&amp;a process   cross platform can usually be solved by some form of extraction load processes that 's straightforward but it does take time   if you 're a company that cares enough to have a disaster recovery team you should also have an it m&amp;a team that meets regularly to have a dry run of an m&amp;a that covers the processes from end to end for 2 3 worst case scenarios new scenarios should be identified if you do enough you 'll have compiled a fairly decent playbook of scenarios after the third or fourth you 'll have a well oiled machine that your investors can and should be proud of    for perspective the best m&amp;a team i 've seen was microsoft 's and even then shit regularly hits the fan for those guys when it comes to technical debt that 's something to keep in mind

this is n't negotiations anymore they are trying to change the deal after the fact stop negotiating and tell them they are bound to the agreement they signed they are leaning on you because they know you are small and likely ca n't fight them document every conversation do not allow them to keep pushing after they 've signed the agreement   they accepted your bid after giving your pricing to a competitor which is shitty and should have been your first red flag then they started working on you at that point your answer should have been we have a verbal agreement of x services for y price a different scope of work is not scalable and would require a new quote   at this point you can either accept that they will continue to beat you up or you can jam the contract down their throats until they agree or walk away    i 've been in a situation like this before a major multinational asked for bid pricing that was agreed to be estimated only based on very loose requirements then they handed us a contract with that pricing included as not to exceed   we ended up walking away it sounds like you may want to do the same if you can big companies often will have legal and departments that basically exist to fight any obligation to pay out money in our case shortly after we ran into someone in our industry who 'd worked with that company and they said to assume that company would reject 30 of all invoices we sent if nothing else to delay payment just a bit longer so they could keep earning interest on the money   also in the future i would n't turn away work until you are under a signed contract for a big project like this you ca n't rely on such a contract to come through if they drag feet and your schedule is full that 's on them or you bring in additional help or subcontract the work to deliver

why do they have to endorse every check every time they want to    deposit it they told you why they said it was because it was made out to one person and there were    others on the account that could withdraw money from the acct so    endorsing it acknowledged that the payee still wanted to deposit the    money knowing others could take the $ out the reason they insist on it may have something to do with their responsibility in case of abuse they are worried that you may be using your parents money without their knowledge and if it ends up being true and they did n't enforce the requirement they may also be liable i have a joint account with my spouse and they do not let us deposit checks written to both of us unless we both endorse this is similar and stems from the same concern so here 's the unusual situation in case of a death of a joint account holder the whole account is frozen until the estate is executed you can not deposit a check of a deceased person to such an account

i do n't know enough about taxes and real state in the netherlands to be super helpful in determining whether or not a rental property is a good investment one thing for certain is that there 's some risk in spending everything on a rental property it 's wise to have some buffer an emergency fund of 3 6 months expenses if things got dire you 'd still need to live somewhere until your tenant was gone and you 'd want to be able to handle any major repairs that crop up so even if it is a good idea to buy a rental property you should probably wait until doing so does n't leave you without a healthy buffer as for owning a rental you described a scenario where you 'd get 6 income on your investment each year if there were zero expenses associated with owning the property are there property taxes is there a monthly cost to maintain the building the apartment is in are rental incomes taxed more heavily than other investment income just be aware of the full financial picture before deciding if it 's a worthwhile investment

the price of a share of a mutual fund is its net asset value nav before the payout of dividends and capital gain distribution the fund was holding both stock shares and cash that resulted from dividends and capital gains after the payout a share only holds the stock therefore once the cash is paid out the nav must drop by the same amount as was paid out per share thus of course assumes no other activity or valuation changes of the underlying assets regular market activity will obscure what the payout does to the nav

your question is listed as how to invest 100k not how would i find someone without a hidden agenda so i 'll answer that it depends i believe the best choices available are essentially as follows if you are looking to pay for your childrens college it might be nice just to put the money in a roth ira and have that done right off the bat if you disciplined enough to keep the money invested in some type of stock indexed fund that might be good the stock market has often outperformed almost every other form of investment over the very long haul but if you could see yourself tapping it for things then you might not want this another option is to put the money against your house if that does n't pay it off refinance the remaining portion into a lower rate for less years obviously this knocks down a huge portion of the interest duh and gives you a nice cash flow you can use for investing also the money you 've put into a primary residence is pretty safe i believe in some cases safe even from bankruptcy but as you 've noted being underwater on the home you are essentially throwing that money away in some way or fashion and really all in all houses are terrible investments you never really get your money out of your primary home unless you downsize the money is essentially saved without an equity line this is a good choice if you 're not disciplined your choice depends on of course you can do any combination of these things and as dave ramsey is apt to remind his and you ought to have your emergency fund set before you do any of these things

your argument is biased vastly in favor of the banks   does n't the simultaneous growth of the residential and commercial real estate pricing bubbles undermines the case made by yourself that fannie and freddie were at the root of the problem   why does your explanation also leave out predatory lending or that during 2006 22 of homes purchased 1.65 million units were for investment purposes with an additional 14 1.07 million units purchased as vacation homes during 2005 these figures were 28 and 12 respectively in other words a record level of nearly 40 of homes purchased were not intended as primary residences    or that housing prices nearly doubled between 2000 and 2006 a vastly different trend from the historical appreciation at roughly the rate of inflation   or that the proportion of subprime arm loans made to people with credit scores high enough to qualify for conventional mortgages with better terms increased from 41 in 2000 to 61 by 2006    from wikipedia so why did lending standards decline in a award winning program npr argued that a giant pool of money represented by $ 70 trillion in worldwide fixed income investments sought higher yields than those offered by u.s. treasury bonds early in the decade further this pool of money had roughly doubled in size from 2000 to 2007 yet the supply of relatively safe income generating investments had not grown as fast investment banks on wall street answered this demand with financial innovation such as the mortgage backed security mbs and collateralized debt obligation cdo which were assigned safe ratings by the credit rating agencies in effect wall street connected this pool of money to the mortgage market in the u.s. with enormous fees accruing to those throughout the mortgage supply chain from the mortgage broker selling the loans to small banks that funded the brokers to the giant investment banks behind them by approximately 2003 the supply of mortgages originated at traditional lending standards had been exhausted however continued strong demand for mbs and cdo began to drive down lending standards as long as mortgages could still be sold along the supply chain eventually this speculative bubble proved unsustainable

your money management technique is a very personal choice each person 's system will be a little different for us we do n't believe in debt so we operate on a cash basis for everything with the exception of our house we keep our expenses to roughly 75 of our after tax income the rest we save and invest and we are paying extra on our mortgage to get the house paid off asap each person will divide their 75 differently based on your consumption preferences   the same goes for the 25 savings and investing   you need to set some goals and save accordingly

before the prevalence of electronic trading trading stocks was very costly dropping from in the late 1970s to less than a nickel per share today   exchange fees for liquidity takers are per share currently when orders were negotiated exclusively by humans stocks used to be quoted in fractions rather than decimal such as $ 50 1/2 instead of something more precise like $ that necessary ease of negotiation for humans to rapidly trade extended to trade size as well   traders preferred to handle orders in round lots 100 shares for ease of calculation of the total cost of the trade so 100 shares at $ 50 1/2 would have a total cost of $   the time for a human to calculate an odd lot of 72 shares at $ would take much longer so would cost more per share and these costs were passed on to the client these issues have been negated by electronic trading and simply no longer exist except for obsolete brokerages   there are cost advantages for extremely large trades well above 100 shares per trade brokerage fees today run the they can be as insignificant as what interactive brokers charges to as high as a full service broker that could charge hundreds of usd for a few thousand usd trade   with full service brokerages the charges are frequently and quoted at the time a trade is requested   with discount brokerages there is usually a fee per trade and a fee per share or contract   interactive brokers will charge a fee per share or option only and will even refund parts of the liquidity rebates exchanges provide as close as possible to having a seat on an exchange   even if a trader does not meet interactive brokers minimum trading requirement the monthly fee is so low that it is possible that a buy and hold investor could benefit from the de minimis trade fees it should be noted that liquidity providing hidden orders are typically not but are at least discounted the core costs of all trades are the exchange fees which are per share or contract   over the long run costs charged by brokers will be in excess of charges by exchanges and interactive brokers fee schedule shows that it can be reduced to a simple markup over exchange fees    exchanges sometimes have a fee schedule with lower charges for larger trades but these are out of reach of the average individual

the standard approach is to reach an agreement and put it in writing what you agree upon is up to you but in the us if you want to avoid gift taxes larger loans need to be properly documented and must charge at least a certain minimal interest rate or at least you must declare and be taxed upon that minimal income even if you do n't actually charge it last i looked the federal requirement was somewhere under 0.3 so this is n't usually an issue there may also be state rules when doing business with friends treat it as business first friendship second otherwise you risk losing both money and friendship regarding what rate to charge that is something you two have to negotiate based on how much the borrower needs the money how much lending the money puts the lender at risk how generous each is feeling etc sorry but there is no one size fits all answer here what i charge or insist on paying to my brother might be different from what i charge my cousin or a co worker or best friend or if both parties think it 's fair it 's fair if you ca n't reach an agreement of course the loan does n't happen

chris 's answer is a great start keep in mind that when you withdraw from a roth ira you shrink the size of the ira i.e. if the start up you ca n't put the $ 10k you withdrew back as you 're limited to in contributions per year you may want to consider funding your startup with a credit card ideally a balance transfer of $ 10k at 0 interest   if you need to you can always pay your card off with your roth balance but if the startup takes off your ira is on a side note i would n't feel comfortable quitting my job to do a startup with only $ 10k in savings but to each his own

fire insurance as you have discovered is a complete ripoff most people pay fire insurance all their lives with no benefit whatsoever and those such as yourself who are lucky enough to get a payout find that it is completely insufficient to replace their loss i once computed the actual beneficial net present financial value of my fire insurance policy and it came out to $ 40 per month the cost was $ 800 per month that is typical homeowners pay $ 500 to $ 800 per year for something that is worth $ 30 to $ 50 per year ironically banks would actually make more money from mortgages if they did not require to buy insurance but nevertheless they insist on it it is not about logic but about fear and irrationality when i paid off my mortgage and gained ownership of my home the first thing i did was cancel my fire insurance i now invest the money i would have wasted on insurance making money instead of losing it being compelled to throw money down the toilet on fire insurance is one of the hidden costs of a homeowners mortgage in the united states in your situation the main option is to borrow the money to rebuild the house using the land as collateral if the land is valuable enough of course you still owe the money for your original mortgage on your now non existent home so to get a home you will have to have the income to service two mortgages a loan officer at a reputable bank can tell you whether you have the income necessary to support two mortgages if you were maxed out on your original mortgage then you may not have enough income and you are screwed in that case you will have to go back to renting and gradually paying off your old mortgage if it were me i would sue the insurance company pro se as a way to get the necessary money to rebuild the home because insurance companies roll over like a $ 20 when they get sued hate insurance companies but i am unusual in that i love and suing people most people are terrified of though so it may not be an option for you

i still think it will be rather difficult best bet is to call around to the five or so closest dealers and express you are considering the car contingent on price not payment ask for them to send you their best out the door price on a base model then when you get quotes from each of them shop the lowest price around usually dealers will budge a few hundred bucks to beat other dealers    but a 2018 will be difficult if not impossible to negotiate a few grand under msrp understand that the people that buy this car are not doing so because it is a great bargain so dealers can usually push this car at or near msrp    lastly do not set foot in a dealership until you have a firm out the door price they will play sales tricks until you give up on negotiation and will pay anything just to get out of there the only time you should go to the location is to sign papers and drive away with the car do not worry about being nice and with the salesperson    this advice got me my current vehicle at about 15 below the lowest true car estimate i do n't claim this is the best advice out there but it works

gifts given and received between business partners or employers employees are treated as income if they are beyond minimal value if your boss gives you a gift s he should include it as part of your taxable wages for payroll purposes which means that some of your wages should be withheld to cover income social security and medicare taxes on it at the end of the year the value of the gift should be included in box 1 wages of your form w-2 assuming that 's the case you do n't need to do anything special a 1099-misc would not be appropriate because you are an employee of your boss so the two of you need to address the full of employment taxes not just income tax which would be the result if the payment were reported on 1099-misc if the employer wants to cover the cost to you of the taxes on the gift they 'll need to gross up your pay to cover it let 's say your employer gives you a gift worth $ 100 and you 're in a 25 tax bracket your employer has to give you $ 125 so that you end up with a gain of $ 100 but the extra $ 25 is taxable too so your employer will need to add on an extra $ 6.25 to cover the 25 tax on the $ 25 but wait now we 've got ta pay 25 tax on the $ 6.25 so they add an extra $ to cover that tax and now they 've got ta pay an extra $   the formula to calculate the gross up amount is where tax rate is the tax rate expressed as a percentage so to get the up amount for a $ 100 gift in a 25 bracket we 'd calculate or or multiply that by the target gift amount of $ 100 and end up with $   the equation is a little if you have to pay state income taxes that are deductible on the federal return but it 's a similar principle   the entire $ would then be reported as income but the net effect on the employee is that they 're $ 100 richer after taxes the gross up idea can be quite complicated if you dig into the details there are some circumstances where an additional few dollars of income can have an unexpected impact on a tax return in a fashion not obvious from looking at the tax table   if the employer does n't include the gift in box 1 on the w-2 but you want to pay taxes on it anyway include the amount in line 7 on the 1040 as if it had been on a w-2 and fill out form to calculate the fica taxes that should have been withheld

in the case of a vehicle with a lien there is a specific place on the title to have a lien holder listed and the holder of the lien will also hold the title until the lien is cleared usually this means you have to pay off the loan when you purchase the vehicle if that loan is held by a bank meet the seller at the bank and pay the loan directly with them and have them send the title directly to you when the loan is paid this usually involves writing up a bill of sale to give to the bank when paying the loan the only thing you 're trying to avoid here is paying cash to the seller who then keeps the cash without paying the lien holder who then keeps the title and the motorcycle do n't pay the seller if they do n't have the title ready to sign over to you

17.5 thousand miles year is pretty high mileage   you could find an accord or civic of comparable age with much lower mileage than that and it would n't be a stretch for someone even with your limited credit history to get a loan on an old car like that   you might try to have your parents cosign on a loan depending on their financial circumstances   that 's how i bought my first car 13 years ago the biggest surprise you might want to consider is the cost of full collision auto coverage which will be required by whatever bank you finance through   get quotes for that before signing any papers   i spent $ 2000 more on a motorcycle because the more powerful one cost $ 2000 less year to insure just a few years after i bought that first car   speaking of which another thing to consider given the nice la weather is a motorcycle   the total cost of ownership is much lower than a car   you will probably not want to pursue that option if you do not have medical insurance and you may not want to anyway

lending is n't profitable when interest rates are this low   consider what 's involved to offer a savings or checking account   the bank must maintain branches with tellers   the bank has to pay rent or buy and pay property taxes and utilities   the bank has to pay salaries   the bank has to maintain cash so as to make change   and pay for insurance against robbery   all of that costs money    at 6 interest a bank can sort of make money   not great money but it takes in more than it has to pay out   at 4 interest which is about where ten year mortgage rates are in canada the bank does n't make enough margin   they are better off selling the loan and closing their branches than offering free checking accounts    an additional problem is that banks tend to make money from overdraft fees   but there 's been a move to limit overdraft fees as they target the most economically vulnerable   so canadian banks tend to charge monthly fees instead   uk banks may also start charging monthly fees if interest rates stay low and other fees get curtailed

if you really want to decrease inequality in a sustainable way the solution is to make energy cheaper the rate of median household income growth started flattening in the 1970s and it is n't coincidental that it happened when fossil fuel prices sustained significant rises if we ca n't make energy at least as cheap as it was before the 1970s we have to adjust to a much slower rate of ngdp growth the government targets a straight line upward moving rate of ngdp growth through massive debt spending and loose monetary policies if it does n't pull back on these the increasing rates of growth of the ngdp and sustainable economic growth puts us on track for a future correction that will be bigger than the great depression

there absolutely is a specific model that makes this so popular with so many credit card companies and that model is per transaction fees card companies also receive cost sharing incentives from certain merchants there is also a psychological reasoning as an additional incentive when you want to accept credit cards as a source of payment as a business you generally have three kinds of fees to pay monthly yearly subscription fees percentage of transaction fee and per transaction fee   the subscription fees can be waived and sometimes are expressed as a minimum cost so the business pays a certain amount whether you actually have people use credit cards or not many of these fees do n't actually make it to the credit card companies as they just pay the service providers and middle men processing companies the percentage of transaction fee means that the business accepting payment via credit card must pay a percentage usually ranging from 1 3 of the total transactions they accept so if they get paid $ 10,000 a month by customers in the form of credit cards the business pays out $ 100 300 a month to the credit card processor a good portion of which will make it back to the credit card issuing company and is a major source of income for them the per transaction fee means that every time a transaction is run involving a card a set fee is incurred by the business which is commonly anywhere from $ 0.05 to $ 0.30 per transaction if that $ 10,000 a month business mentioned previously had 10 customers paying $ 1,000 each at $ 0.10 a transaction that 's only $ 1 in fees to the credit card processors companies but if instead that business was a grocery store with an average transaction of $ 40 that 's $ 25 in fees   this system means that if you are a credit card company and want to encourage people to make a specific kind of purchase you should encourage purchases that people make many times for relatively small amounts of money in a perfect world you 'd want them to buy $ 1 bottles of water 5 times a day with their credit card if the card company had 50,000 card holders doing this at the end of 1 year the company would have $ spread across transactions the card company might reasonably make $ 0.05 per transaction and 1 of the purchase total the get rewarded for drinking more campaign might earn the card company $ in percentage fees and over $ 4.5 million in transaction fees yet the company would only have to pay 3 in rewards from the percentage fees or $ 2.7 million back to customers if the card company had encouraged using your credit card for large once yearly purchases they would actually pay out more money in rewards than they collect in card use fees yet by encouraging people to make small transactions very often the card company earns a nice net income even if absolutely every customer pays their balance in full on time and pays no annual monthly fees for their card which obviously does not happen in the real world no wonder companies try so hard to encourage you to use your card all the time for card companies to make real money they need you to use your credit card as discussed above the more often you use the card the better for them and there can be a built in preference for small repeated transactions but no matter what the size of transaction they ca n't make the big bucks if you do n't use the card at all selling your personal information is n't as profitable if they do n't have in depth info on you to sell either so how do they get you to make that plastic sing gas and groceries are a habit most people buy one or the other at least once a weak and a very large number of us make such purchases multiple times a week some people even make such purchases multiple times a day so how do people pay for such transactions the goal of the card companies is to have you use their product to pay as much as possible if you pay for something regularly you 'll keep that card in your wallet with you rather than it getting lost in a drawer at home so the card companies want you to use your card as a matter of habit too if you use a card to buy for gas and groceries why would n't you use it for other things too lunch dinner buying online if the card company pays out more and makes less for large less regular purchases then the ideal for them is to have you use the card for small regular purchase and yet still have you use the card for larger infrequent purchases even if you get reduced no rewards what better way to achieve all these goals than to offer special rewards on gas and groceries and because it 's not a one time purchase you are n't so likely to game the system no getting that special 5 cash back card booking your once per decade dream vacation then paying it off and cancelling it soon after which would actually make the card company lose money on the deal in the end credit card companies as a whole have a business model that almost universally prefers customers who use their products regularly and preferably for small amounts a maximum number of times they want to reduce their expenses like rewards paid out while maximizing their revenue they have n't figured out a better way to do all of this so well as to encourage people to use their cards for gas and groceries everything else seems like a losing proposition in comparison the only time this preference differs is when they can avoid paying some or all of the cost of rewards such as when the merchants themselves honor the rewards in exchange for reduced or zero payment from the card companies so if you use an airline card that seems to give you 10 back in airline rewards well that 's probably a great deal for the card company if the airline provides that reward at their own expense to try to boost business the card company keeps the transaction related fees and pays out almost nothing in rewards the perfect offer for them   and this assumes no shenanigans like black out periods not valid with any other offers rewards like on cars where only a fool pays full msrp and sometimes the rewards are tagged in this sort of way like not valid on sale clearance items etc expiring rewards the fact that they know not everyone uses their rewards annual fees that are greater than the rewards you 'll actually be obtaining after accounting for all the other issues etc and credit card industries are known for their shenanigans

not to mention that what they were doing was the right way to do it for many decades it was simply seen as the norm that you would have a job take part of your savings and put that into a 401k because it was the only way to really provide for a safe future   so that 's what we did oops   the other big difference between gen x and the surrounding generations in regards to retirement is social security the baby boomers will have social security for most of the rest of their lives it 's funded and it wo n't be a problem millenials have mostly come of age knowing that 's a joke gen x on the other hand grew up and worked at least part of their lives under the assumption that social security while having problems would at least provide some help however with the way the economy and government is going it 's very possible that wo n't be a guarantee without major adjustments decreased payout increased retirement age etc so they 're going to be taking it there as well   that 's not even to get started on the mortgage situation for a lot of us x'ers we bought homes near or at the top of the bubble again because everyone was telling our generation that we were foolish for renting why with the tax incentives in place and the way housing prices have been rising the last 20 years you 're just throwing your money away by renting so again the baby boomers enjoyed 20 30 years of rising home prices giving them a chance to build up a lot of equity and refinance at lower and lower rates the millenials again were shielded simply by not being at the point in their lives where it would be a problem once again it 's gen x that was just trying to do what they had observed as working their entire life   i think generation x will rise out of everything that has happened much wiser most of us have been through enough at this point that i think we 're beginning to become very of the way things are and that will have heavy ramifications as the reigns of power fall from the boomers to the x'ers   may you live in interesting times
