the prices quoted are for currency pairs traded on the foreign exchange market for currencies traded on these exchanges the exchange rates of a given currency pair are determined by the market so supply and demand investor confidence etc all play a role and reuters are the two primary trading platforms in the foreign exchange market and much of the data on exchange rates comes from them websites will usually get their data either from these sources directly or from a data provider that in turn gets it from reuters or another data source like bloomberg or analytics these data sources are n't free however   in the us many contracts transactions etc that involve exchange rates use the exchange rate data published by the federal reserve you might see this in contracts that specify to use the exchange rate published by the federal reserve at 12 pm noon on date you can also look at the federal reserve economic data which maintains data series of historical daily weekly and monthly exchange rates for major currency pairs these data are free although they are n't realtime data for each business day is mostly updated the next business day

i have my safe money in index funds but like to dabble in individual stocks my criteria and thought process are usually like this let 's use sbux as an example understand what the company does also paraphrased as buy what you know a profitable growing business does n't need to be complicated open stores sell coffee for sbux my decision process literally started inside a store rocky why are you standing in line to overpay for coffee wow look at all these people hmmm i wonder if this is a good stock to buy check out their fundamentals are they profitable book value and peg are helpful and i tend to use them as a gauge for whether i think the stock is overpriced or not i compare those values to others in the industry sbux right now has a pe of ~30 which looks about average for its peers so far so good does it pay a dividend this is n't necessarily good or bad just useful to know i like dividend paying stocks even if it means the stock price might not grow as aggressively also a company that pays a dividend is naturally confident in its ability to turn a profit and generate cash so it 's a safer pick in my opinion sbux pays a dividend a small one but that 's a plus for me am i willing to watch the stock with my index funds i buy and forget with my stocks i keep an eye on the situation read the news and have to make a buy sell decision regularly with sbux i do n't watch all that closely i just keep up with the news imo it 's still a buy based on all the above criteria and i feel less silly now standing in line to overpay for coffee

do n't let tax considerations be the main driver that 's generally a bad idea you should keep tax in mind when making the decision but do n't let it be the main reason for an action selling the higher priced shares possibly at a loss even i think    it 's ok to do that and it does n't necessarily have to be fifo it is ok to do that but consider also the term long term gain has much lower taxes than short term gain and short term loss will be offsetting long term gain means you can lose some of the potential tax benefit any potential related to buying a home that can offset capital gains no and anyway if you 're buying a personal residence a home for yourself there 's nothing to write off except for the mortgage interest and property taxes of course selling other investments for a capital loss to offset this sale again why sell at a loss anything related to retirement accounts e.g. i think i recall being able to take a loan from your retirement account in order to buy a home you can take a loan and you can also withdraw up to 10 k without a penalty if conditions are met bottom line be prepared to pay the tax on the gains and check how much it is going to be roughly you can apply previous year refund to the next year to mitigate the shock you can put some money aside and you can raise your salary withholding to make sure you 're not hit with a high bill and penalties next april after you do that as long as you keep in mind the tax bill and put aside an amount to pay it you 'll be fine i see no reason to sell at loss or pay extra interest to someone just to reduce the nominal amount of the tax if you 're selling at loss you 're losing money if you 're selling at gain and paying tax you 're earning money even if the earnings are reduced by the tax

it 's interesting that you use so many different risk measures here 's what i 'd like to know more in detail   1 about the use of i 've heard from a friend may be unreliable that some investment managers like does n't use var for assessing risk and maintaining capital adequacy requirements rather some firms only rely on tracking error beta standard deviation etc why do you think is this so is n't var supposed to be a widely accepted risk measure   2 the whole expected shortfall vs. var debate i 've read some papers comparing expected shortfall and mainly they criticize var for not being able to consider the 1 probability left where losses can probably skyrocket to infinity if i need to choose between the two which do you think is better and why

my best answer is to simply fish out that old email account dumbcoder makes a good point the company whose shares you own can probably figure out what brokerage firm is holding the shares but it 'd take a lot on their end honestly you 're better off just hitting up random brokerage firms until you find the right one than going to the company and asking them where your shares are good luck

i do n't think you 're missing anything many modern trading systems actually warn you when trying to enter a market order asking if you are sure that you would n't prefer to set a limit i fully agree with you that it is usually just better to define a limit even 20 higher than just doing a market trade let me give you some examples when you still might prefer to use a market order instead of a limit but even in those two examples a wide limit order might just be the safer thing to do   so what it really comes down to is speed a market order has no other to be defined is thus entered faster and saves you a few seconds that might be crucial

here is the investing for retirement theoretical background you should have you should base your investment decisions not simply on the historical return of the fund but on its potential for future returns and its risk past performance does not indicate future results the past performance is frequently at its best the moment before the bubble pops while no one knows the specifics of future returns there are a few types of assets that it 's relatively safe to make blanket statements about the future returns of your portfolio will primarily be determined by your asset allocation the general rules look like there are a variety of guides out there to help decide your asset allocation and tell you specifically what to do the other thing that you should consider is the cost of your funds while it 's easy to get lucky enough to make a mutual fund outperform the market in the short term it 's very hard to keep that up for decades on end moreover chasing performance is risky and expensive so look at your fund information and locate the expense ratio if the fund 's expense ratio is 1 that 's super expensive the stock market 's annualized real rate of return is about 4 so that could be a quarter of your returns all else being equal choose the cheap index fund with an expense ratio closer to 0.1 many 401(k providers only have expensive mutual funds this is because you 're trapped and ca n't switch to a cheaper fund so they 're free to take lots of your money if this is the case deal with it in the short term for the tax benefits then open a specific type of account called a rollover ira when you change jobs and move your assets there or if your savings are small enough just open an ira a traditional ira or roth ira and use those instead or yell at your hr department in the event that you think that 'll actually accomplish anything

well i 'm not an expert and you sound pretty credible however i still do n't see anything to back up what your saying in the sources that i 've found   gt active business income can still be earned by foreign subsidiaries if you can prove to revenue canada that it is a real corporation and taxed at better offshore rates if 90 or more of its income comes from third party transactions    this seems to be consistent with my definition   business profits earned by a foreign sub are taxed when profits are repatriated certain tax credits are available for foreign taxes paid and certain dividends out of surplus are tax free to the corporation not individuals      so when foreign sub pays dividends to the parent corp they are still charged repatriation just like in the us   again this sounds consistent with my previous comment canada has a corporate tax rate that is over 10 lower than the us so this is still a very good deal in its own right    maybe you can explain in more detail or provide a source that has some additional detail i also ca n't find any pieces on this or the deal that suggests beneficial repatriation rules

the reason to do a stock split is to get the price of the stock down to an affordable range if your stock costs $ 100,000 per share you are seriously cutting in to the number of people who can afford to buy it i can think of two reasons not to do a stock split the biggest is why bother if your stock is trading at a reasonable price why change anything it takes time and effort which equals money to do a stock split if this serves no purpose you 're just wasting that effort the other reason is that you do n't want to drive your stock price down too low low prices are normally associated with highly speculative start up companies and so can give a wrong impression of your company also low prices make it difficult for the price to reflect small changes if your stock is trading at $ 10.00 a 1/2 of 1 change is 5 cents but if it 's trading at $ 1.50 a 1/2 of 1 change is a fraction of a penny does it go up by that penny or not you 've turned a smooth scale into a series of hurdles

one problem with this plan is that the individual must have earned income to contribute to a roth ira if you have an infant unless she is the new baby or something like that there is probably no legitimate way for her to earn income if you own a business and have kids who are older you can employ them to do work for you but they must really do work and earn around the market rate for that work otherwise it is unlikely that they will be able to earn enough to fund an ira until they are teenagers when they are old enough to work you can match their earnings by contributing the same amount to a roth ira on their behalf but this will not give you the amount of contributions and growth time that you were counting on

its important to note that aggression or better yet volatility does not necessarily offer higher returns   one can find funds that have a high beta measure of volatility and lower performance then stock funds with a lower beta    additionally to 's point better performance could be undone by higher fees    age is unimportant when deciding the acceptable volatility   its more important as to when the money is to be available   if there might be an immediate need or even less than a year then stick to a savings account   five years some volatility can be accepted if 10 years or more seek to maximize rate of return for example assume a person is near retirement age   they are expected to have 50 k per year expenses   if they have 250 k wrapped up in cds and savings and another 250 k in some conservative investments they can and should be aggressive with any remaining money      on the contrary a person your age that is savings for a house intends to buy one in three years   savings for the down payment should be pretty darn conservative    something like 75 in savings accounts and maybe 25 in some conservative investments   as the time to buy approaches they can pull the money out of the conservative investments at a optimal time also you should not be investing without an emergency fund in place   get that done first then look to invest if your friend does not understand these basic concepts there is no point in paying for his advice

there is no rule of thumb although some may suggest there is everybody will have different goals investment preferences and risk tolerances you need to figure this out by yourself by either education yourself in the type of investments you are interested in or by engaging and paying for a financial advisor you should not be taking advice from others unless it is specifically geared for your goals investment dna and risk tolerance the only advice i would give you is to have a plan whether you develop it yourself or pay a financial advisor to develop one also do n't have all your savings sitting in cash as long term you will fall behind the eight ball in real returns allowing for inflation

you may look into covered calls   in short selling the option instead of buying it playing the house    one can do this on the buying side too e.g. let 's say you like company xyz   if you sell the put and it goes up you make money   if xyz goes down by expiration you still made the money on the put and now own the stock the one you like at a lower price   now you can immediately sell calls on xyz   if it does n't go up you make money   if it does goes up you get called out and you make even more money probably selling the call a little above current price or where it was put to you at the greatest risk is very large declines and so one needs to do some research on the company to see if they are decent e.g. have good earnings not over valued p e etc   for larger declines one has to sell the call further out   note there are now stocks that have weekly options as well as monthly options   you just have to calculate the rate of return you will get realizing that underneath the first put you need enough money available should the stock be put to you    an additional associated strategy is starting by selling the put at a higher than current market limit price   then over a couple days generally lowering the limit if it is n't reached in the stock 's fluctuation   i.e. if the stock drops in the next few days you might sell the put on a dip    same deal if the stock finally is put to you   then you can start by selling the call at a higher limit price gradually bringing it down if you are n't successful i.e. the stock does n't reach it on an upswing my friend is highly successful with this strategy good luck

gt;if you 're in a position you do n't get blindsided by this shit no matter what which division you 're responsible for   blindsided is very different from responsible for    the director of hr might know that the ceo is tanking the company but have no means by which to repair or stop the damage   you 're just making an empty connection to justify your overly broad tough guy fantasy   let 'em quit any stock options they have other benefits get cashed out and applied to outstanding debts accrued under them before any payout reaches them    1 many of those benefits may have already vested or otherwise vest when you constructively terminate them by withholding their salary   what that means is that they no longer belong to the company and ca n't just be seized to play god with the equivalent would be your employer reaching into your 401k and back vested matching   2 you 're still just engaging in tough guy fantasy and ignoring the problem of a company   beating you chest and wo n't stop the employees from being fucked over even harder when inventory stops showing up in the warehouse

the answer probably varies with local law and you have n't said where you 're located in most or all us states it appears that after some statutory length of time the bank would transfer the money to the state government where it would be held indefinitely as unclaimed property in the name of the recipient technically the payee the person to whom the check is made payable   this process is called escheatment   most states publish a list of all unclaimed property so at some later date the payee could find their name on this list and realize they were entitled to the funds   there would then be a process by which the payee could claim the funds from the state    usually the state keeps any interest earned on the money as far as i know there typically would n't be any way for you the person who originated the payment to collect the money after escheatment   before escheatment if you have the uncashed check in your possession you can usually return it to the bank and have it refunded to you i had trouble finding an authoritative source explaining this but a number of informal sources found by googling cashier check escheatment seem to agree that this is generally how it works   here is the web site for a law firm saying that in california an uncashed cashier 's check to the state after 3 years until escheatment occurs the recipient can cash the check at any time   i do n't think that cashier 's checks become stale like personal checks do and there is n't any situation in which the funds would automatically revert to you

luke i 'd like to point out some additional benefits of the roth ira accounts 1 going roth you can effectively increase the amount of your contribution to your ira account in your example you are assuming that your contribution to roth ira is in fact $ 85 $ 100 less $ 15 tax paid in reality albeit more costly roth ira allows you to contribute full $ 100 $ less $ tax incurred using this method you can in fact grow your tax free funds to $ over 30 years the larger you effective tax rate is the larger will be the difference between your maximum effective traditional vs roth ira contribution will be 2 should you need to access your ira funds in case of emergency unqualified event of not buying your first home nor paying for your college education roth ira account contributions can be withdrawn without incurring the 10 penalty charge that would be imposed on your unqualified traditional ira distribution 3 as other contributors noted it 's hard to believe that lower us tax rates would prevail chances are you will be contributing to traditional 401k later throughout your work life having a roth ira account would afford you a tax diversification needed to hedge against possible tax rate hikes coming in the future considering the future of the social security funding and ever growing us national debt can we really expect for there to not be any tax rate increases in the next 20 40 years by the way as others pointed out your effective tax rate will always be lower than your marginal tax bracket

your dad may have paid an opportunity cost for that outright purchase   if the money he saved had been invested elsewhere he may have made more money   if he was that well off then his interest rate should have been the lowest possible   my own father is a multi millionaire not myself and he could afford to have paid for his house outright   he did n't though   to do so would have meant cashing in on several investments   i do n't know his interest rate but let 's say it was 2.5   if he invests that million dollars into something he expects to get a 7 return on in the same period then he would make more money by borrowing the money   hence he would be paying an opportunity cost assuming you need to work some jobs will also do background or credit checks   credit cards can be used by well off people to actually make them money by offering rewards compared to straight cash transactions   the better your credit history the better the cards rewards you can get   you can build that credit history better by having these loans and making timely payments

some basic thoughts mostly on fairness i guess the answer does n't really fit this site it 's more about ethics but this fits the question which is n't really just about money either so when both work the same amount it seems appropriate that both get the same mount of money does n't it that is the scheme of as already contained in your question and in some other answers is fair by this logic pay attention to hidden money for example the one who works more for money might automatically get a pension funded this way this is hidden money which already goes to only one partner so when dividing equally you 'll need to take that into account or just include equal pensions for both in the family 's needs directly

the card you have is one where you had to deposit an amount to your card limit secured limit credit card   capital one is one if the primary cards of this type the typical rules of credit card usage and building your credit do not apply   so yes you want to use the card as much as possible and pay off your balance as often as is necessary to keep your limit freed up you can actually pay the full balance plus 10 and gain a little extra limit use your card as much as possible and call them and ask for a limit increase every three months   usually about 4 5 months in they will increase your limit and do so without asking for a corresponding security deposit   this is really cool because it means you are becoming credit worthy i know so much about this because i applied for this card for my son and am helping him in his attempt to repair his credit   his score increased by almost 200 points last year

as you clarified in the comments it is not a contract work but rather an additional temporary assignment with the same employer you were paid for it in form of a bonus one time irregular payment instead of regular periodic payments irregular wage payments fall under the flat rate withholding rule the 25 for federal some states have similar rules for state withholding this is not taxes this is withholding withholding is money the employer takes from your salary and forwards to the irs on the account of your tax liability but it is not in itself your tax liability when you do your annual tax return you 'll calculate the actual tax you were supposed to pay and the difference between what was withheld and your actual tax will be refunded to you or owed by you if not enough was withheld you can control the regular pay withholding using w4 form

a diversified portfolio such as a 60 stocks 40 bonds balanced fund is much more predictable and reliable than an all stocks portfolio and the returns are perfectly adequate the extra returns on 100 stocks vs. 60 are 1.2 per year historically according to to get those average higher stock returns you need to be thinking 20 30 years even 10 years is too short term over the 20 30 years you must never panic and go to cash or you will destroy the higher returns you must never get discouraged and stop saving or you will destroy the higher returns you have to avoid the panic and despite the likelihood that some 10-year period in your 20 30 years the stock market will go nowhere you also must never have an emergency or other reason to withdraw money early if you look at dry periods in stocks like 2000 to 2011 a 60/40 portfolio made significant money and stocks went nowhere a diversified portfolio means that price volatility makes you money due to rebalancing while a 100 stocks portfolio means that price volatility is just a lot of stress with no benefit it 's somewhat possible probably to predict dry periods in stocks if i remember the statistics about 50 of the variability in the market price 10 years out can be explained by normalized market valuation normalized = adjusted for business cycle and abnormal profit margins some funds such as are completely based on this though a lot of money managers consider it with a balanced portfolio and rebalancing though you do n't have to worry about it very much in my view the proper goal is not to beat the market nor match the market nor is it to earn the absolute highest possible returns instead the goal is to have the highest chance of financing your non financial goals such as retirement or buying a house to maximize your chances of supporting your life goals with your financial decisions predictability is more important than maximized returns your results are primarily determined by your savings rate which realistic investment returns will never compensate for if it 's too low you can certainly make a projection in which 1.2 difference in returns makes a big difference but you have to remember that a projection in which value steadily and predictably compounds is not the same as real life where you could have emergency or emotional factors where the market will move and might have a big plunge at just the wrong time end of the 40 years and so on if your plan relies on the extra 1.2 returns then it 's not a reasonable plan anyhow in my opinion since you ca n't count on them so why suffer the stress and extra risk created by an all stocks portfolio

my two cents    i like many people in finance got into it for the money however i like many other people found myself liking it for intrinsic reasons once i got into it    i genuinely enjoy learning about financial theory economics understanding how global markets work following the different story lines for the eu us asian economies working on financial models reading the wsj keeping up to date on new earning releases analyzing investments learning about companies industries etc   but i never would have found out that i liked these things unless i had chosen to study them and the only reason i chose to study them in the first place was because i wanted to make money i 'd take an intro finance class and see if it seems like something that could grow on you

the only thing worse than finding out you are paid less than a co worker is finding out that you are paid more than all of your co workers a lot of people who think they would prefer an open and transparent pay scale as in unions change their minds when placed in one    i have worked in and implemented both types as both an employee and as an owner manager there are pluses and minuses to both    transparent pay scale is most effective in a high turnover aggressively performance metric oriented environment where you expect people to be competing for jobs including their own job every day for example a pool of commissioned sales agents the more you sell the more you make winner gets a cadillac runner up gets a set of steak knives loser gets fired that kind of thing if you ca n't meet your numbers we let other people start poaching your territory clients and see what they can do    where it does n't work is in a salary type position where people are expected to have multiple soft duties outside of core performance metrics the reasons are multi fold   one immediate effect of implementing performance based pay for salary type employees is that people who are in the office for 8 hours a day five days a week immediate start their time and energy towards getting another notch up on the pay scale even at the expense of their co workers or the company it intrinsically incentivizes gaming the system finding ways to attach your name to easy metrics and to remove yourself from the most difficult problems the people who are best at hitting metrics are often not even close to the    if instead you take a soft metrics or subjective holistic approach to evaluation then you get a culture of brown and office politics people start the boss 's favorite and pursuing approval and credit rather than performance instead of fostering a team oriented problem solving approach it a counter productive buck passing credit grabbing and blame avoidance approach    note that both of the above intrinsically incentivize risk avoidance if you get paid for the number of projects that have your name on them you find some way to get your name attached to every project and then move on to the next one whether the last one was done or not if you get based on how successful the projects bearing your name are then you avoid anything challenging and make sure only to be attached to the easy ones with the best co workers and so on    alternately let 's say we keep the same generic salary oriented pay structure we just make everyone in a certain tier get equal salary that everyone knows that sucks all the life out of everyone 's so fast it will make your head spin you can not get a raise for doing a better job you get paid the same raise as your worst co worker every year for as long as you work here we will never cut your pay all you have to do is not be the in the so long as you can identify the worst performer in your group and so long as it 's not you your job is safe what time do you have to arrive 5 minutes earlier than the latest arriving person how early can you leave 5 minutes after the earliest one to check out how much work do you have to get done only as much as anyone else is doing what will you get for being the hardest working earliest to arrive latest to leave the same as the worst performer gets you 'll be splitting your raise with him since we do n't credit individuals here just job titles    most jobs that can be easily automated are automated if you need a human employee to do it it 's usually because it involves a amount of soft skills and fuzzy logic type thinking and behavior a machine programmed purely to make as many widgets per hour as possible and motivated to so with human style skills ingenuity and incentives will tear down the whole factory and dismantle all its co workers and ignore all quality controls in order to keep producing widgets    you ca n't reduce human beings to input process output or rather you can but they will invariably find unintended ways to outsmart your design criteria with unintended consequences the reason you need a person instead of an automated process is because you need a whole host hard to define soft fuzzy flexible critical thinking type skills    everyone 's job seems easier to the people who do n't have to do it and there is a tremendous hidden danger to de valuing personal desire to do a good job by quantifying the value of their contribution   personnel management is very difficult to reduce to an engineering problem you usually need good managers who can identify and motivate good employees who will feel lucky to have the job and the salary they have and who will come in every day trying to earn it posting everyone 's pay on a bulletin board negates all those soft skills by putting a quantified black and white relative value on everyone 's contribution    even in a very large organization the marketplace of employees is rarely large enough and the quality of real time metrics is almost never good enough to the bell curve of employee performance you end up making it a square wave that all but the most extreme outliers

if i understand you right what you need is the minimum amount in the account until your next deposit   so for example if today is the 10th and you get paid on the 15th how much do i need to have in the account so i know how much i can spend   that amount should be all of the bills that will be paid between today and the 15th an alternative would just to keep a running balance and see what the minimum value is my personal finance software does that for me but it 's possible although a little more complicated in excel   you 'd have to find the date of the next deposit and do a looking for dates between today and that date   that 's about as far as i can get without getting off topic

trading and investing are very very different activities    investing is very generally done for the longer haul by people looking for a reasonable return determined largely by the long term prospects of the business in which they invest accepting some moderate risk usually around the prospects of that business    trading is very generally done shorter term seconds to days weeks and can involve significantly higher risk usually focused around market conditions and players at the time of the trade to reiterate these are gross generalizations but if you are just starting out   a you probably want to be investing rather than trading and b you may be best served by understanding as well as you can the difference between the two   once you understand that difference that will lead you to learning resources on each

how you should record the mortgage payments depends on if you are trying to achieve correct accounting according to the standards or if you are just tracking everything for you and your friends if you 're just keeping track for personal reasons i 'd suggest that you set up your check or journal entry your preference how you 'd like it to be recorded   then memorize that transaction   this allows you to use it as many times as you need to without having to set it up each time   also note there is no way to record a transaction that decreases cash and increases equity if you 're trying to keep track of everything according to accounting standards which it should be if you 've set up an official business then you have a lot more tracking to do with each payment   mortgage payments technically do not affect the equity accounts of the owners   each mortgage payment should decrease the bank balance increase interest expense and decrease the mortgage balance not to mention tracking any escrow account you may have   the equity accounts would be affected if the owners are contributing funds to the bank account but equity would increase at the time the funds are deposited not when the mortgage payments are made hope this helps

the hsa money is yours to keep you ca n't add new money into the account and get a tax deduction for the new money but you can spend the old money on medical expenses first log into the website for the hsa and see if you have money left this can be important because if there is still money left they might be charging you a monthly fee you should have gotten a letter from the old company or the administrator when you left the high deductible insurance plan this would have told you your options regarding the spending or transferring of old funds hsa related numbers would have appeared on your w2 and you should have a 1099-sa from the administrator it is likely that there is a copy of the 1099 on the administrators website the numbers you enter on the tax forms depends on how much you contributed from your paycheck how much your company contributed and how much you sent if any from other sources besides payroll deduction you will also have to know how much money was withdrawn from the hsa and how much was used for medical purposes the last month rule is for those people who start in the middle of the year if you start through the year you are allowed to make the maximum contribution if you still have it at the end of the year and you expect to keep it   the last month rule the last month rule states that if you are covered by an hsa eligible    health plan on the first day of the last month of a given year you    are considered an eligible individual for the entire year in turn    you can then contribute to the hsa for that full year if you are covered by an hdhp on dec 1st of a given year you may contribute the maximum for that year for example you could begin coverage and open up my hsa in november    of a given year come december 1st you are covered and per the last    month rule considered an eligible employee for that full year that    allows you to contribute up to that year ’s contribution limit even    waiting a few months to make a prior year contribution if you like    back up the truck and load up the hsa however there is a catch   the testing period the testing period states if you use the last month rule you must    remain an eligible individual covered by hdhp for the following 12    months if you fail to remain an eligible individual change insurance    plans lose insurance plan receive other health coverage any extra    contributions you made as a result of the last month rule will be    taxed and penalized if you contribute per the last month rule and end your hdhp insurance within 1 year you will have to pay tax on any excess    contributions you were allowed to make and pay a 10 penalty in this case excess contributions are determined by the    contribution limit 12 months compared to your time eligible

gt well first of all how do you define executive and how do you differentiate between executives who had a hand in ruining the company and those that did n't    if you 're in a position you do n't get blindsided by this shit no matter what which division you 're responsible for unless the company has serious communication issues which is a tell in and of itself   gt second executives tend to be flexible mobile and have fuck you money turn off their salaries and they 'll just leave   i do n't find that a very compelling argument it 's the same as the old you ca n't tax the rich they 'll just move argument and should be solved much the same way okay let 'em quit any stock options they have other benefits get cashed out and applied to outstanding debts accrued under them before any payout reaches them they can walk if they want but they 're going to feel it when they go   gt i know reddit has this fantasy where executives do n't do anything but golf and drink all day but you ca n't run a company with an empty c suite    i do n't pretend that they do but by the same metric i do n't believe that many are worth anywhere near as much as they get paid and especially not when they 're producing results like this

hedging you have an investment and are worried that the price might drop in the near future you do n't want to sell as this will realise a capital gain for which you may have to pay capital gains tax so instead you make an investment in another instrument sometimes called insurance to offset falls in your investment   an example may be that you own shares in xyz you feel the price has risen sharply over the last month and is due for a steep fall so you buy some put option over xyz you pay a small premium and if the price of xyz falls you will lose money on the shares but will make money on the put option thus limiting your losses if the price continues to go up you will only lose the premium you paid for the option very similar to an insurance policy diversification this is when you may have say $ 100,000 to invest and spread your investments over a portfolio of shares some units in a property fund and some bonds so you are spreading your risks and returns over a range of products the idea is if one stock or one sector goes down you will not lose a large portion of your investment as it is unlikely that all the different sectors will all go down at the same time

the yield on treasury bond indicates the amount of money anyone at can make at virtually zero risk    so lets say banks have x say 100 amount of money they can either invest this in treasury bonds and get y% say 1 interest that is very safe or invest into mortgage loans i.e. lend it to people at say at 3 the extra is to cover the servicing cost and the associated risk put another way if you wanted only y% why not invest into treasury bonds rather than take the risk and hassle of getting the same y% by lending to individuals in short treasury bond rates drive the rate at which banks can invest surplus money in the market or borrow from the market this indirectly translates into the savings lending rates to the banks customers

the biggest issue with a pure physical dividend is the cost of transfer cash or stock dividends are decentralized and easy to transfer ownership hence the majority of value can be transferred to the shareholder    if you were to deliver wine to every shareholder you would have to deduct the cost of transport from the value of the wine dividend otherwise it becomes value to shareholders and they 'd be better off keeping the dividend as stock value

well for a start funds do n't pay interest   if you pick an income paying fund as opposed to one that automatically reinvests any income for you you will receive periodic income based on the dividends paid by the underlying stocks but it wo n't be the steady predictable interest payment you might get from a savings account or fixed rate security this income is not guaranteed and will vary based on the performance of the companies making up the fund it 's also quite likely that the income by itself wo n't cover the interest on your mortgage   the gains from stock market investment come from a mixture of dividends and capital growth i.e. the increase in the price of the shares   so you may have to sell units now and again or cover part of the interest payments from other income you 're basically betting that the after tax returns from the fund will be greater than the mortgage interest rate you 're paying    3 facts if you 're comfortable with these 3 facts go for it if they 're going to keep you awake at night you might not want to take the risk

the simplest way to handle this is for you to rent the apartment and sublet to the girlfriend and friend   i 'd split the utilities evenly one third from each   the reason for this is that each of you contribute evenly to generating the utility bills   it 's not like your income makes the water cost more for you    utilities are driven by usage   dividing them other than equally is likely to lead to more problems than it solves   also it seems unlikely that a different apartment would use significantly different water electricity or internet   those are driven by the appliances rather than the size or location of the apartment   only pay more for the utilities if you want something that they do n't   for example maybe you want hbo etc   it would be reasonable for you to pay the entire premium if that 's a luxury that they simply would n't buy    i 'd also divide the groceries evenly if you share and share alike   if you eat separate meals you can buy separate groceries    if the rent ca n't be split evenly but you could afford it alone then you can just sign up for it   if you break up with the girlfriend and/or the friend moves out you 're still fine   you have your fancy apartment and can afford it    the bigger problem comes if you ca n't afford the apartment without both the girlfriend and friend contributing   if so you should probably avoid this situation   it 's fragile   any person leaving would put you in a financially untenable position   you can look for a new tenant to replace your friend but you ca n't exactly rely on getting a new move in girlfriend on demand    neither the girlfriend nor the friend can afford to be on the main lease   in case of emergency or tragedy they could n't replace you as a tenant   that 's why they should sublet   then their obligation is to you not to the landlord    how much apartment would the girlfriend and friend get if you were n't involved   what rents would they pay   that 's probably how much rent they should pay for this apartment   you want a better apartment or a better location   that 's on you    you should only do this if you want to do it   if you want to share apartments with the girlfriend and friend then do so   work out something equitable   if you plan on moving in together to reduce your costs then you do n't sound like you are compatible   obviously there are reasons to move in with the girlfriend aside from costs   why ca n't the friend get his or her own place   the added rent probably wo n't do more than pay for the added room you could get a one bedroom without the friend    that points to an alternative way of calculating the friend 's contribution   the difference between a two bedroom and a one bedroom apartment   that 's the additional cost of the bigger apartment   if the friend ca n't afford that then this might not be a good idea    make sure that you can afford the apartment if one or both of the friend and girlfriend move out   you can eventually replace the friend as the tenant but do n't rely on doing the same with the girlfriend   share utilities evenly   possibly groceries too   the friend should pay at least the added cost of the additional bedroom   do n't expect either to pay more in the new apartment than they would pay without you   you should be the only one on the main lease sublet to them

i think this is a good question with no single right answer   for a conservative investor possible responses to low rates would be probably the best response is somewhere in the middle consider riskier investments for a part of your portfolio but still hold on to some cash and in any case do not expect great results in a bad economy for a more detailed analysis let 's consider the three main asset classes of cash bonds and stocks and how they might preform in a low interest rate environment by stocks i really mean mutual funds that invest in a diversified mixture of stocks rather than individual stocks which would be even riskier   you can use mutual funds for bonds too although diversification is not important for government bonds cash advantages safe in the short term   available on short notice for emergencies disadvantages low returns and possibly inflation although you retain the flexibility to move to other investments if inflation increases bonds advantages somewhat higher returns than cash   disadvantages returns are still rather low and more vulnerable to inflation   also the market price will drop temporarily if rates rise stocks advantages better at preserving your purchasing power against inflation in the long term 20 years or more say   returns are likely to be higher than stocks or bonds on average   disadvantages   price can fluctuate a lot in the short to medium term   also expected returns are still less than they would be in better economic times although the low rates may change the question a little the most important thing for an investor is still to be familiar with these basic asset classes   note that the best risk adjusted reward might be attained by some mixture of the three

the situation you 're proposing is an over simplification that would n't occur in practice orders occur in a sequence over time time is an important part of the order matching process orders are not processed in parallel otherwise the problem of fairness already heavily regulated would become even more complex first crossed and locked markets are forbidden by regulators   crossed orders are where one exchange has a higher bid than another 's ask or a lower ask than another 's bid   a locked market is where a bid on one exchange is equal to the ask on another   hfts would be able to make these markets because of the gap between exchange fees since these are forbidden and handling orders in parallel would ensure that a crossed or locked market would occur orders are up processed in order of price time priority so the first to cross the market will be filled with the best oldest opposing order regulators believe crossed or locked markets are unfair   they would however eliminate the bid ask spread for many large securities thus the bid ask cost to the holder

good credit is calculated by many lenders by taking your fico score which is calculated based upon what is in your credit report   building credit generally means building up your fico score your fico score is impacted my many factors one small one of which is your utilization ratio of your installment loans like student loans   this is the ratio of the current balance to your original balance   to improve your score slightly you would want a lower ratio   i would recommend paying your student loan down to 75 ratio as fast as you can and then you can go back to $ 50/month a much better way to improve your fico score is to have revolving credit   your student loans are not revolving they are installment loans   therefore you should open at least one credit card assuming you currently have none right away   the longer you have had a credit card open the better your fico score gets   your revolving credit utilization ratio is way more important than your installment loan ratio   therefore to maximize your fico try to never have more than 10 utilization on your revolving credit report to the credit bureaus each month   only the current month 's ratio affects your score at any given moment   you can ensure you do n't go above 10 by paying your balance before the statement cuts each month to get it below 10 way before any payment would be due   you should always pay your remaining credit card statement balance in full each month by the due date after the statement cuts to avoid any interest charges   note that there is a slight fico advantage to having at least one major bank credit card instead of just only credit union credit cards   also never let all your revolving credit report a zero balance in a month you must always have at least $ 1 reporting to the credit bureaus on at least one of your open credit cards or your fico score will take a big negative hit if you can not get a normal credit card go to a credit union and find one that offers secured credit cards or a bank that does   a secured credit card is where you place a deposit with the bank that they hold and give you a credit limit to match your security   ideally it would be a card that graduates to unsecured after your demonstrate good history with them   for example the navy federal credit union secured card for many people   i also believe the wells fargo bank credit card you can join if there is a family member who served or a who did also will   the reason you want it to and not be forced to open a new account to get an unsecured account is that you want your average age and oldest age of open revolving credit accounts to be as high as possible as this is another impact on your fico score credit unions that anyone can join include digital federal credit union the pentagon federal credit union which offers a secured card that does not graduate and the state department federal credit union also offers secured card that i think does not graduate one other method to boost your fico score is to get added as an authorized user on one of your parent 's credit cards that has been open a long time   not all lenders will report such an authorized user however ones that are known to do so are bank of america citi bank and capital one   it is a good sign that it will report if they ask for the social security number of the authorized user however note that the authorized user addition can have no impact if the lender is using one of the newer versions of the fico scoring model only the older versions reward you for the age of accounts for which you are an authorized user a very long term boost is to open your first american express card underwritten directly by amex such as their card which is pretty easy to get   the advantage of american express is that they remember the date your first credit card was opened with them and if you open new accounts in the future they will back date the date of their opening to match the date your first card was opened   if you let your membership lapse be sure to record the account number and date opened in your personal files so that you can help them locate it again if you reopen as they can have trouble if it has been on the order of ten years or more finally note that the number of accounts opened in the last twelve months is a small negative mark on your score along with number of inquiries so if you open a lot of accounts all at once in addition to bringing down your average age of accounts you will also get dinged for how many were opened in the last year

there are quite some options but without additional information i can only provide examples last year i had the option to buy a house but i decided against it because in my area it is getting harder and harder every year to sell it at a reasonable price but if i had bought a house my mother would have lent me the money with me paying it back to her over the years on 3 interest so it would have been some kind of a private loan but my mom would never have taken ownership of the house since it was not her intention to own it in any way does your dad intend to own the house and rent it to you if yes and if you are comfortable with renting instead of buying then this is an option the second option the one we discarded because of the additional cost is that i could have taken a loan paying 4.5 interest to the bank which would then pay under 1 to my mom and keep the rest banks always want to make profit and this profit has to come from somewhere from the difference between the interest rates if your dad has 230k on the bank and you owe 230k to the bank you are better off if you keep the bank out at least as long as your dad is comfortable with lending you money and you are comfortable with owing him money my gf would never money from her mother because her mother would always play the you are in my debt card on each and every visit and whenever she needed help in any way so the key is what does your dad feel comfy with and what do you feel comfy with if possible keep the banks out but set up a written contract between you and your dad

tarp was billion of loans to institutions   loans that are to be paid back with interest albeit very low interest   a significant percentage of the tarp loans have been or will be paid back   so the final price tag of the tarp was only a few $ billion pretty low considering the scale of the program there is ~$10 trillion in mortgage debt outstanding   that 's a much higher price tag than tarp   secondly paying off the mortgages = no repayment to the government as there was with tarp   the initial price tag of your plan would be ~$10 trillion instead of a few $ billion furthermore how does a government with > $ 15 trillion in debt already come up with an extra ~$10 trillion to pay off people 's mortgages   should the government go deeper into debt   print more money and trigger inflation note   some people like to talk about a secret bailout by the fed implying that the true cost of tarp was much higher than claimed by the government   the secret bailout was a series of short term low no interest loans to banks   because they were loans which were paid back my point still stands   some other issues to consider remember that the principal balance of your mortgage is only a small portion of your payments to the bank   over 30 years you pay a lot of $ $ $ in interest to the bank that 's how banks make a profit   banks are expecting that revenue and it is factored into their financial projections   if those revenue streams suddenly disappeared i expect it would majorly screw the up the financial industry many people bought houses during the real estate boom when housing prices were inflated far beyond the real value of the house   is it right to overpay for these houses   this rewards the banks for accepting the inflated value during the appraisal process   loan modification forces banks to accept the real value of the house the financial crisis was triggered by people buying houses they could not afford   should they be rewarded with a free house for making poor financial decisions

what joetaxpayer means is that you can sell one etf and buy another that will perform substantially the same during the 30 day wash sale period without being considered substantially the same from a wash sale perspective more easily than you could with an individual stock for example you could sell an s&p 500 index etf and then temporarily buy a djia index etf as these track different indexes they are not considered to be substantially the same for wash sale purposes but for a short term investing period their performance should still be substantially the same

anytime you borrow money at that rate you are getting ripped off    one way to rectify this situation is to pay the car off as soon as possible   you can probably get a second job that makes $ 1000 per month   if so you will be done in 4 months     do that and you will pay less than $ 300 in interest   it is a small price to pay for an important lesson while you can save some money refinancing working and paying the loan off is in my opinion a better option   even if you can get the rate down to 12 you are still giving too much money to banks

personally i would hold off on buying a house until you have the credit card paid down even more or paid off completely so that it is one less bill you have to worry about and once it is paid off you free up that much more money to maintain the home likewise you also have a lot of variables right now and the resolution of those variables will affect how much you can afford in the way of a home the less surprises the better as i 'm sure you know being a home owner can be quite expensive and if something ends to be repaired then you have to pay for it out of your own pocket at least when you are renting that falls onto someone else likewise unless you are confident that the market has bottomed out by you you might find that you are underwater on the mortgage once everything is said and done if you want to start making process towards buying a home though you could check to see if any of the local banks or credit unions have some sort of savings program where you get higher interest rates in exchange for designating the savings for the down payment on a mortgage likewise you could just find a high yield savings account and start making automatic transfers into it every month

an exchange traded fund etf is a special type of mutual fund that is traded on the stock exchange like a stock   to invest you buy it through a stock broker just as you would if you were buying an individual stock when looking at a mutual fund based in the u.s. the easiest way to tell whether or not it is an etf is by looking at the ticker symbol   traditional mutual funds have ticker symbols that end in x and etfs have ticker symbols that do not end in x    the jpmorgan emerging markets equity fund with ticker symbol is a traditional mutual fund not an etf   jpmorgan does have etfs the jpmorgan diversified return emerging markets equity etf with ticker symbol is an example   this etf invests in similar stocks as however because it is an index based fund instead of an actively managed fund it has lower fees if you are n't sure about the ticker symbol the advertising prospectus of any etf should clearly state that it is an etf   in the example of above they put etf right in the fund name   if you do n't see etf mentioned it is most likely a traditional mutual fund another way to tell is by looking at the investment minimums of the fund   has a minimum initial investment of $ 1000   etfs however do not have an investment minimum listed because it is traded like a stock you simply buy whole shares at whatever the current share price is   so if you look at the fees and investment minimums section of the page you 'll see the fees listed but not any investment minimums

i would disagree with your analysis   to me there are two purposes for a money market mm your emergency fund should be from 3 to 6 months of expenses   think of it of an insurance policy against murphy   you may want to have some money designated for big expenses or even sinking funds   for example i keep some money in a mm for a car as both the wife daughter and i driver older vehicles   i may need to replace them if you were planning on making a larger purchase car house boat engagement ring i would put the money in a mm fund so you are not subject to the whims of the market    after that you are free to invest all your money   its likely that you should have some money outside of tax advantaged funds so if you want to start a business you will not have to do high cost withdrawals

in futures once you have established your position you will earn or lose money depending on what the underlying does   theoretically if you had no stop you could lose far more than you invested   an option will slowly lose all its value if the stock does not rise assume it is out of the money when purchased   depending on the strike it could rise substantially and you 'd still lose all your money   but you ca n't lose more than you put in   so options have limited risk compared to futures at the expense of a decaying time value that you will effectively be paying while holding the option

since you have no sales i 'd likely question how well could you determine the value of the company 's assets in a reasonable fashion you may be better to estimate sales and discount that back to a current valuation for example insurance companies could determine that if you wanted to be paid $ x month for the rest of your life the present day value of that is $ y. there are similar mechanisms for businesses but this does get tricky as the estimates have to be somewhat conservative and you have to be prepared for some other scenarios for example if you got the $ 200,000 then would you really never have to ask for more external equity financing in the future or is it quite likely that you 'd want another infusion down the road while you can mark it at $ 1,000,000 there will be questions about why that value that you 'd have to answer and saying cause i like big round numbers may not go over well my suggestion is to consider what kind of sales will the company have over the next 5 years that you could work back to determine a current price if you believe the company can have $ 5,000,000 in sales over the 5 years then it may make sense to place the current valuation of $ 1,000,000 on it i would n't look too much into the money and time you 've invested as that is n't likely to go over well with investors that just because you 've put in what is worth $ x the business may or may not be worth that the challenge is that without sales it is quite difficult to get an idea of what is the company worth if it makes billions then it is worth a lot more than a company that never turns a profit another way to consider this is the question of what kind of economic output do you think you could do working here for the next 5 years could you do thousands of dollars of work millions of dollars or just a few bucks consider how you want this to be seen where if you want some help look up episodes of tv shows like dragon 's den or shark tank as these give valuations often as part of the pitch which is what you are doing

first   great job on getting it together   this is good for your family in any respect i can think of   this is a life long process and skill but it will pay off for you and yours if you work on it your problem is that you do n't seem to know where you money goes   you ca n't decide how your expenses are until you know what they are   looking at just your committed expenses and ignore the other stuff might be the problem here   you state that you feel you live modestly but you need to be able to measure it completely to decide i would suggest an online tool like mint.com if you can get it in your country because it will go back for 90 days and get transactions for you   if you primarily work in cash this is n't helpful but based on your credit card debt i am hoping not   although a cash lifestyle would be good if you tend to overspend take the time and sort your transactions into categories   do n't setup a budget just sort them out   i like to limit the number of categories for clarity sake especially to start do n't get too crazy and do n't get too detailed at first   if you buy a magazine at the grocery store just call it groceries once you know what you spend then you can setup a budget for the categories   if somethings are important create new categories   if one category is a problem then break it down and find the specific issue the key is that you budget not be more than you earn but also representative of what you spend follow up with mint every other day or every weekend so the categorization is a quick and easy process   put it on your iphone and do it at every lunch break   share the information with your spouse and talk about it often

i stumbled on the same discrepancy and was puzzled by a significant difference between the two prices on etr and fra for example today is sunday and google shows the following closing prices for dai fra dai etr dai so it looks like there are indeed two different exchanges trading at different prices   now the important value here is the last column volume according to wikipedia the trading on stock exchange is done today exclusively via xetra platform thus the volume on etr dai is much more important than on fra dai   obviously they wikipedia is not 100 accurate i.e. not all trading is done electronically via xetra according to their web page exchange has a specialist trading on frankfurt floor service which has slightly different trading hours   i suspect what google and yahoo show as exchange is this manual trading via a specialist opposed to xetra electronic trading to answer your question the stock you 're having is exactly the same meaning if you bought an etr bmw you can still sell it on fra by calling a fra trading floor specialist which will probably cost you a fee on the other hand for the portfolio valuation and performance assessments you should only use etr bmw prices because it is way more liquid and thus better reflect the current market valuation

frequently people saving money for a down payment or for their emergency fund feel that they need to find a way to the process via methods that will generate more interest than a bank account or a cd once they have reached their goal they also feel that having the money sitting around not generating income is a missed opportunity all investments that are n't 100 safe introduce risk to entice you to invest they offer the opportunity make more money than a bank account or cd but the downside is that the extra money is n't guaranteed in fact the introduced risk also opens up the investment to the possibility of losses including a total loss you have identified risks with bank accounts and cds with the bank account you will generally lose money vs. inflation with a cd the investment is less liquid if you sell early or you want need to sell 1/2 a cd you will give up some of that extra income also if rates on a cd rise next month you are locked into your current rate til the cd ends putting some or all of the money you are saving for the house into a risky investment means that you may shorten or extend the time period nobody knows   by investing in real estate we can offset the risk of real estate    going up in the next couple years if real estate goes up we will    still be able to use our down payment for a comparable house as of    now inversely if real estate goes down we will lose on the down    payment but be able to get a house cheaper unless the reit matches the market of residential real estate in your city metropolitan region there is no guarantee that home prices in your city will move the same way the reit does   a recent listing of the 10 largest holdings of the index is none of these tell me what home prices in my neighborhood will do next year

generally most businesses will not but it 's not uncommon not sure about other countries but in australia merchants here generally have to pay visa or mastercard a commission if the consumer chooses to use credit so even if they do n't levy a charge they may have a minimum purchase amount which you can use credit cards for amongst some of the ones who do include pretty much all of the budget airlines like virgin airlines   i think there 's been some outrage with them cause they charge $ 4.50 per person per trip which in some cases is greater than the transaction cost they have to pay to the credit card companies aldi supermarket link they 're kind of a budget supermarket you got to pay for shopping bags and also charge 1 more for credit card on a side note we also have a thing called here which is a debit card network i think this network charges less commission because generally a of businesses that charge for credit may not charge for i also feel is also more secure as it requires a pin number unlike a credit card which requires a signature

also the will stipulated that the house can not be sold as long as one of my wife 's not the same one who supposedly took the file cabinet is alive this is a turkey of a provision particularly if she is not living in the house   it essentially renders the house which is mortgaged valueless   you 'd have to put money into it to maintain the mortgage until she dies and you can sell it    the way that i see it you have four options crack that provision in the will   you 'd need to hire a lawyer for that   it may not be possible    abandon the house   it 's currently owned by the estate so leave it in the estate   distribute any goods and investments but let the bank foreclose on the house   you do n't get any value from the house but you do n't lose anything either   your father 's credit rating will take a hit that it can afford   you may need to talk to a lawyer here as well but this is going to be a standard problem    explore a reverse mortgage   they may be able to accommodate the weird provision with the aunt and manage the property while giving a payout   or maybe not   it does n't hurt to ask    find a property manager in philadelphia and have them rent out the house for you   google gave some results on find property management company philadelphia and you might be able to do better while in philadelphia to get rid of his stuff   again i 'd leave the house on the estate as you are blocked from selling   a lawyer might need to put it in a trust or something to make that work if the estate has to be closed in a certain time period   pay the mortgage out of the rent   if there 's extra left over you can either pay down the mortgage faster or distribute it    note that the rent may not support the mortgage   if not then option four is not practical   however in that case the house is unlikely to be worth much net of the mortgage anyway   let the bank have it option two    if the aunt needs to move into the house then you can give up the rental income   she can either pay the mortgage possibly by renting rooms or allow foreclosure   a reverse mortgage might also help in that situation    it 's worth noting that three of the options involve a lawyer   consulting one to help choose among the options might be constructive   you may be able to find a law firm with offices in both florida and pennsylvania    it 's currently winter   someone should check on the house to make sure that the heat is running and the pipes are n't freezing   if you ca n't do anything with it now consider by turning off the water and draining the pipes   turn the heat down to something reasonable and unplug the refrigerator throw out the food first   note that the kind of heat matters   you may need to buy oil or pay a gas bill in addition to electricity

just read the book flash boys by michael lewis   it describes this process in detail albeit a bit more dramatically than it has to   basically what hfts high frequency traders do is they set up their line to the exchange so its microseconds faster than everyone else   then they test out the market with tiny orders seeing how fast it 's getting filled if these are getting filled immediately it probably means there 's a big order coming in from an investor   so the algorithm and it 's all algo based obviously because no human can remotely hope to catch this will detect that as soon as there 's a spike in volume it will buy all of the volume at the current price and sell it back for higher forcing the big investor to take on higher prices     another case is that some hfts can basically buy the entire trade book from an exchange like nasdaq   so every time someone places a market order for 200 shares of a 6.5 stock the hft will see it buy up all the current stock from say 6.5 6.6 and sell it back at 6.7   not rocket science if you already get info about the trade coming in in fact this is basically market making but performed by an evil hft instead of a trustworthy bank     but honestly there are a lot more ways to make money from hft than front running which is n't even possible anymore because exchanges no longer sell their books to hfts

what you 're asking about is called a distribution when it comes to an llc   it 's basically you paying yourself some or all of the proceeds of the business depending on how you 're set up   you can pay yourself distributions on a regular schedule say monthly or you can do it at the end of the year whatever you do in this regard what you take out as distributions is reported on your personal income tax as taxable income   llcs in the u.s. use pass through taxation unless you intentionally elect to have the llc treated as a corporation for tax purposes which some people do so whatever the principals receive in distribution is personally taxable keep in mind that you 'll have to pay all of the taxes normally covered by an employer such as self employment tax usually about 15 social security tax and so on   this is in addition to income tax so remember that i hope this helps good luck

unlike other responses i am also not good with money   actually i understand personal finance well but i 'm not good at executing my financial life responsibly   part is avoiding tough news part is laziness there are tools that can help you be better with your money   in the past i used ynab you need a budget   i 'm not affiliated and i 'm not saying this product is better than others for op   whether you use their software or not their strategy works if you stick with it   each time you get paid allocate every dollar to categories where your budget tells you they need to be prioritizing expenses then bills then debt reduction then wealth building   as you spend money mark it against those categories   reconcile them as you spend the money   if you go over in one category eating out for example you have to take from another entertainment   there 's no penalties for going over but you have to take from another category to cover it   so the trick to all of it is being honest with yourself sticking to it recording all expenditures and keeping priorities straight    i used it for three months   like many others i saved enough the first month to pay the cost of the software   i do n't remember why i stopped using it but i wish i had not   i will start again soon

an employer can decide that the employee funds are automatically vested the new company could have had a more aggressive vesting schedule and grandfathered in all the employees of the company they acquired this could have been part of the purchase    i would be surprised if they did it for employees that left years ago especially if they were beyond the return period i would n't keep money in a plan with a former employer just in case it happens check the plan documents to see all the verbiage regarding vesting here is a paragraph from one you will receive one year of vesting service for each calendar year    during which you complete 850 or more hours of service once you have    five years of service your account is fully vested and any future    company contributions made to your account will be immediately vested    full vesting also occurs at age 59½ total disability or death while    employed by the company if you leave the company prior to 100    vesting any unvested portion of your plan account will be forfeited

where is the money coming from if you already have the money inheritance gifts or similar sitting in your account you can just buy e.g. index funds from vanguard robinhood or other low cost brokerages but first you should estimate how much money you need for your studies it is a bit of a gamble to invest money that you 'll need to withdraw in a few years time even though the average return may be quite high 12 sounds like an overestimate more commonly quoted figure is 7 over short your stocks will go up and down randomly once you actually have a job and have income from it then the 401k and ira and similar retirement accounts start to make sense there is no need to have all your savings in the same account so you can start saving now already

i 'd roll them all into one account just for your own convenience   it 's a pain to keep track of lots of different accounts esp since you need logins passwords etc for all of them and we all have plenty of those   pick a place like vanguard or fidelity for example where you can find investment options with lower fees and do the standard rollover   once all the accounts are rolled into one you can think about how to invest the stuff   some good investments require larger minimums so if you have several old 401ks putting them together will give you more options rolling them over is not hard if you have paperwork from each of the 401ks   you might be able to diy online but i found it helpful to call and talk to a person when i did this   you just need account numbers etc   if you are moving brokerage accounts you may need to provide paper documents applications which might require getting them notarized i found a notary at my bank even though the accounts i was moving from and to were n't at my bank which means you 'll need to provide ids etc and get a special seal after the notary witnesses your signature

see my recent answer to a similar question on prepaying a mortgage versus investing in ira the issue here is similar you want to compare the relative rates of funding your retirement account versus paying down your debt if you can invest at a better rate than you are paying on your debt with similar risk then you should invest otherwise pay down your debt the big difference with your situation is that you have a variable rate loan so there 's a significant risk that the rate on it will go up if i was in your shoes i would do the following but that 's me if you 're more debt averse you may decide to prepay that fixed rate loan too

yes your privacy is invaded that 's the law in many jurisdictions the goal is to make money laundering and financing evil things harder that 's why banks are required to request proof for every money transfer larger than a specific sum this is only a minor issue most of the time you will have some kind of agreement with that money management company and this agreement or a copy of it will serve as a proof of your lawful reason to transfer money it works just like that you get to the bank and say you want to initiate a money transfer the clerk asks you to show the proof you give them your agreement or a bill that requests you to pay or whatever else document you may have that proves that you 're bound by some kind of contract with the recipient of money the clerk then makes a copy of the proof and it stays in the bank to back the transfer until it is completed the copy is then stored for some time and later destroyed that 's up to how the bank handles documents

to be absolutely sure you should call the agent and check that said i have been renting accommodation through both agencies and directly through landlords for seven years i live in london and this is quite a common situation it normally means that the deposit is being securely held by a third party so that it can not be taken or depleted without the agreement of both parties the deposit protection scheme is one way that deposits are securely held in this manner as a third party they will have different account details it may be the case that the agency is protecting the deposit and you are paying rent to the landlord directly this means that your deposit goes to the agency 's account and the rent goes to the landlord 's account obviously your landlord and agency have different accounts a little colour to your day i am currently paying my rent to the agency who also took the deposit but because of the way they handle deposits versus rent the deposit was sent to a different account held by the same agent in my previous flat i paid the deposit to an agency and the rent directly to the landlord this resulted in an issue one time where i got the two accounts confused and paid rent to the agency who after giving me a small slap on the wrist transferred it to my landlord in the flat before that i paid rent and the deposit to my landlords holding company that is one of the few times that i paid rent and the deposit into the same account again check with the agent that one of these situations is the case but this is absolutely normal when renting through an agency

's answer is fundamentally correct and deserves the but i 'd like to give an economic explanation for how this economically functions the key point from 's answer 's that the interest rate is for one company while this may be much higher than the equilibrium rate the true market interest rate it is not completely unreasonable because of the risk for credit to be continually produced default risk must be compensated because this is a cost to the lender   most are not in business to lose money so making loans to borrowers that default 40 of the time would make this interest rate reasonable for uk citizens this would not be such a problem because the lender can usually pursue the borrower for the balance but if the borrower can the loan and leave the legal reach of the uk creditors the collection rate is 0 the guarantee by the foreign persons not present in the uk is incidental and probably more of a regulatory requirement since the inability to collect from them is just as unlikely one should always look for the lowest price with at least minimum quality when shopping for anything but you are right to be apprehensive legally   read every line and be sure that you yourself understand every clause before signing if alternative cheaper financing is available it is probably superior

your employers insurance premiums will definitely go up if there are a lot of claims when it is time for them to renew their policy it is also possible that if this happens the employer will pass along some of the additional cost to employees the insurance company will not try to have you removed it does n't work that way with group policies they just jack up the price as mentioned previously   if you take a new job your cancer will affect the future employer in the same way as to whether you should keep it a secret i do n't think it is something you have to disclose unless it affects your ability to perform your job even then it may be protected under the americans with disabilities act it is true that some employers could exhibit some bias because of this especially a small company that is likely to have a small group that is more likely to see price hikes because of a single employee making expensive claims bottom line i would n't lie about it to a future employer but i would n't volunteer that information either unless it is material to your job performance

the high frequency trading you reference has no adverse impact on individual investors at least not in the going to take advantage of you way that many articles imply if anything high frequency trading is generally more helpful than harmful adding liquidity to the system although it can cause some volatility and noise in volume and other data and the sudden entrance or exit of this type of trading can drive some abnormal market movements as to research and time needed for trading most data suggests that the less you try to beat the market the better you 'll do    trade activity tends to be inversely related to returns particularly for individuals    your best bet is likely to learn enough about investment risks to ensure you 're comfortable with them and invest in broadly diversified asset classes regions and sectors and then mostly leave them alone or rebalance annually    you 'll almost surely do a lot better that way than you will if you spend countless hours researching the right stocks to buy

that amount of shares is too low to create in the market usually you do n't specify the price to sell the stock unless you are personally on the floor trading the securities and even then with a volume of $ 50,000 it would just mean you threw away $ 45,000 for most people it would mean setting a $ 5 sell order and the broker would understand that as sell this security so long the price is above $ 5 when you get to the trading volume required to influence the price usually you are also bound by some regulations banning some moves one of them is the pump and dump and even if you are suggesting the opposite it might be in preparation of this scam also the software used for high frequency trading what all the cool in wall street are using these days employ advanced and proprietary to analyze the market and make thousands of trades in a short interval of time on 's speed decisions happen in milliseconds and this could result in big market moves without reason   so a human trader attempting to manipulate the market versus these setups would be like a kid in a attempting to the flash dc comics a cool kid not really kids more like suited up sharks money eating sharks

it depends on whether or not you are referring to realized or unrealized gains   if the asset appreciation is realized meaning you 've sold the asset and actually collected liquidity from it then has provided a good route to follow    however if the gains are unrealized meaning only that the current value of the underlying have increased or decreased then you might want to record this under an income unrealized gains account   one of the main distinctions between the two are whether or not you have a taxable event realized or just want to better track your net worth at a given time unrealized    for example i generally track my retirement accounts increase in value sans interest dividends and contributions as income from an income unrealized gains account   i can still reconcile it with my statements and it shows an accurate picture for my net worth but the money is not liquid nor taxed and is more for informational purposes than anything    and no i do n't create an additional expense account here to track losses   just think of unrealized gains as an income account where the balance will fluctuate up and down and potentially even go negative over time

first of all i 've raised vc money before so i have experience in this area the other commenter who said they 'll only cause trouble is wrong as a general statement some may but that just means you 've chosen your investors poorly choosing an investor is a very important decision and you should choose someone who you think will be able truly add value to your business rather than just someone who is willing to write a check cultural alignment is important and having a shared set of goals and timelines for the business is important    that said no one here is going to be able to tell you how to structure your deal because it varies so much based on the business in general i think it 's a good idea to only take money when you need it and have a solid plan for how you 're going to use it every time you take money you 're diluting your ownership and reducing your long term upside keep in mind that as the other commenter said if you take a deal now that means that you maintain 51 and then you take more money in the future that 51 will be diluted further that said with more investors in the mix you still are likely to be the largest shareholder but again that depends on how the deals are structured    my advice seek out as much advice from as many sources as you can and hire a good law firm to handle your financing transaction because their advice is invaluable as you negotiate terms finally you should have more conditions than just retaining 51 ownership there are a lot of terms that get baked into these deals that have an impact on the long term upside learn those terms do a bunch of googling and a bunch of reading and ask for more advice

i assume you are talking about a publicly traded company listed on a major stock exchange and the buyer resides in the us private companies and non us locations can change the rules really a lot the short answer is no because the company does not own the stock various investors do each investor has to make an individual decision to sell or not sell but there are complications if an entity buys more than about 10 of the company they have to file a declaration with the sec the limit can be higher if they file an assertion that they are buying it solely for investment and are not seeking control of the company if they are seeking control of the company then more paperwork must be filed and if they want to buy the whole company they may be required to make a tender offer where they offer to buy any and all shares at a specific price if the company being bought is a financial institution then the buyer may have to declare as a bank holding company and more regulations apply the company can advise shareholders not to take the tender offer but they can not forbid it so the short answer is below 10 and for investment purposes only it is cash and carry whoever has the cash gets to carry the stock away above that various regulations and apply but the company still does not have the power prevent the purchase in most circumstances

gt;i said all that to say that you are correct in assuming i blame the socialist disproportionately but i think this blame is justified if they did n't have such an irrational fear of the free market we would n't have such complex unfair set of rules that tend to hurt the most disadvantaged in our society most   there was n't a regulation that was causing insurance companies to not cover people with pre existing conditions that was a decision the market made based on a strict economic basis i think liberals are right to want to protect people that are n't profitable customers the market is n't interested in them that is why many liberals do not see the market as a viable solution especially when you are talking about healthcare

both of my primary home purchases were either at or close to asking price my first house was during the local seller 's market in 2001 2002 there were waiting lines for open houses in hindsight we bought more home than we needed at the time but that had nothing to do with offering asking price it was the market for the type of property location and features at that time my second house was a little after the peak in 2008 the value had come down quite a bit and the property was priced on the low side versus the comps to this day my second house still appraises higher than what we paid for it even though it was at asking price as a third example my brother in law got into a bidding war on his first home purchase and ended up buying it for above asking price this was normal for the houses in the area he was looking at with real estate like other people have said it really is important to either know the area you are looking at or to get an agent you trust and have them explain their reasons for their offer strategy through the comps yes agents need to make money but the good ones have been in the business a while and also live off of repeat business when you sell your house or refer friends and family to them agents do a lot less work when it comes to selling by the way so they would love for you to come back to them when it 's time to sell if i 'm not happy with the way things are going with my agent i would have a heart to heart with them and give them a chance to correct the relationship i 've spoken to a realtor friend in the past about getting out of buyer 's contracts and he told me it 's a lot easier as a buyer than a seller the buyer has most of the power during the process the seller just has what the buyer wants

i am also confused by what he says the djia has not been at 900 for decades however a $ 36 dividend is 4 per unit if you get $ 9 per unit per quarter 2/3 of 4 is that is inside his 7.5 to 5.5 how much you have in dividend paying stocks vs. bonds most often is a function of your age for example i have heard the advice of subtracting your age in years from 110 and that would be the percent you hold in dividend paying stocks at age 30 you would have 80 in stocks at age 60 you would be 50 in stocks there are retirement funds that do this for you   but the bottom line all depends on your risk tolerance i have a large tolerance for risk so even though i am currently retired i only have 10 of my money in a safe investment ticker = pgf it pays 5.5 per year   the rest is in a leveraged junk bond fund that pays 15.5 per year

they say that banks earn 4 5 on deposits so with lower costs they can give away 2 4 they cite this articles u s banking industry annual profit hit record which says that return on equity for banks up at the highest level since 2013 but net interest bank analytical is lower and that 's in a good year   they elaborate in a blog post   fed funds rates are supposed to affect deposit rates that banks pay to their customers as after all deposit is a form of short term loan from depositor to the bank see the explanation in our recent blog however as notes in their recent report it has not actually happened recently as the report notes for traditional branch based banks savings and checking account rates are virtually unchanged you are probably getting the same 0.01 in your checking or savings account meanwhile rates on your credit card went up by since december 2015   so why are n’t deposit rates increasing one reason often cited is actually the relative decrease in the levels of competition in the u.s. market as we described in our earlier blog while there are still thousands of banks in the u.s. 4 control ~40 of the assets and close to half of the assets loans the other reason could be perhaps that after almost 10 years of getting close to zero in your bank account you will forget that it could be any different in fact bank executives are puzzled why consumers are not demanding more on their deposits you can walk to the branch and demand more money from your bank but you may end up in county jail the only other viable option is to take your deposits elsewhere or vote with your feet   beam makes money by providing value added services to our partnering bank and other financial service partners in the banking that sounds like they might be selling your data

as far as i can tell it works like this note i am assuming you were 18 on jan 1 2009 contribution limits so by the end of 2012 you will have been allowed to contribute $ 20,000 of new money you say you 've contributed $ 10,000 so you still can contribute another $ 10,000 of new money this year but let 's assume you do not now your original $ 10,000 has grown to $ 25,000   you can withdraw this without penalty   next year you will be given an allotment of another $ 5000 of new money bringing your total lifetime limit to $ 25,000 $ 10,000 = $ 15,000 new money plus you will be allowed to re contribute up to $ 25,000 of old money of course the government does n't make a distinction between old and new money so the net effect is assuming a 25k withdrawal 2012 limit $ 10 000 2013 limit $ 40 000 less 2012 contributions from the tfsa contribution room is made up of from this wording it means the 25 k you withdraw will go to the 2013 contribution room bullet 3   if you do n't re contribute it will roll over into the 2014 contribution room under bullet 2    for correctness i must add that i did not include any indexing of the annual amount

i can think of a few reasons for this first bonds are not as correlated with the stock market so having some in your portfolio will reduce volatility by a bit this is nice because it makes you panic less about the value changes in your portfolio when the stock market is acting up and i 'm sure that fund managers would rather you make less money consistently then more money in a more volatile way   secondly you never know when you might need that money and since stock market crashes tend to be correlated with people losing their jobs it would be really unfortunate to have to sell off stocks when they are under priced due to market shenanigans the bond portion of your portfolio would be more likely to be stable and easier to sell to help you get through a rough patch i have some investment money i do n't plan to touch for 20 years and i have the bond portion set to 5 10 since i might as well go for a high growth position but if you 're more conservative and might make withdrawals it 's better to have more in bonds i definitely will switch over more into bonds when i get ready to i 'd rather have slow consistent payments for my retirement than lose a lot in an unexpected crash at a bad time

there is no limit on how much money you can bring into the usa in cash or through electronic transfer you only need to be able to proof or convincingly show that you earned it legally and paid all potential us taxes that you had to pay if you chose to bring it in cash you need to tell customs when arriving and again be prepared to proof the legal sources wire transfer cash in the suitcase whatever you like there is no tax for bringing the money and the tax for making that money supposedly is already paid once the money is in the us and earns more money you will owe taxes on the gain not on the capital itself just on the amounts it increases by i hope you understand that if you live in the us and you have money anywhere in the world you might need to report it to the irs and if your money makes interest anywhere in the world including of course in india you might be are required to pay us taxes on the gains that is independent of your question but if you do n't do it you are cheating the irs and they will ask this when you bring the money back

this is completely disgusting utterly unethical deeply objectionable and yes it is almost certainly illegal the federal trade commission has indeed filed suit halted ads etc in a number of cases but these likely only represent a tiny percentage of all cases this does n't make what the car dealer 's do ok but do n't expect the swat team to bust some heads any time soon which is kind of sad but let 's deal with the details let 's see what the federal trade commission has to say in their article are car ads taking you for a ride deceptive car ads here are some claims that may be deceptive and    why vehicles are available at a specific low price or for a specific    discount what may be missing the low price is after a downpayment often    thousands of dollars plus other fees like taxes licensing and    document fees on approved credit other pitches the discount is only    for a pricey fully loaded model or the reduced price or discount    offered might depend on qualifications like the buyer being a recent    college graduate or having an account at a particular bank only $ what may be missing the advertised payments are temporary teaser    payments payments for the rest of the loan term are much higher a    variation on this pitch you will owe a balloon payment usually    thousands of dollars at the end of the term so both of these are what the ftc explicitly says are deceptive practices has the ftc taken action in cases similar to this yes they have if auto dealers make advertising claims in headlines they ca n’t take    them away in fine print said jessica rich director of the ftc ’s    bureau of consumer protection these actions show there is a    financial cost for violating ftc orders in the case referenced above the owners of a 20 + dealership chain was hit with about $ 250,000 in fines if you think that 's a tiny portion of the unethical gains they made from those ads in the time they were running i 'd say you were absolutely correct and that 's little more than a cost of doing business for unscrupulous companies but that 's the state of the us nation at this time and so we are left with caveat emptor as a guiding principle what can you do about it competitors are technically allowed to file suit for deceptive business practices so if you know any honest dealers in the area you can tip them off about it try saying that out loud with a serious face   but even better you can contact the ftc and file a formal complaint online i would n't expect the world to change for your complaint but even if it just generates a letter it may be enough to let a company know someone is watching and if they are a big business they might actually get into a little bit of trouble

did a great job highlighting the primary pros and cons of hsas so i wo n't go into detail there however i did want to point out another pro hsas are or can be easy to manage you said is this a better way to approach health care costs instead of itemizing health care expenses on yearly federal taxes i 'm not sure which company you are looking at establishing your hsa with but with mine i have a debit card that i use when paying for medical care and then at the end of the year i get a 1099-sa that provides the amount of money spent on qualified purchases that calendar year yes there are a few extra boxes i need to fill in for my 1040 come tax time but i do n't need to itemize my healthcare costs over the year it really is pretty simple and straightforward also one con that is worth noting is that you become much more sensitive to healthcare costs due to the high deductible healthcare plan an hsa requires for example in all the years we 've had an hsa we 've not yet met our deductible which means we pay out of pocket for any non routine doctor visits the health insurer pays 100 of routine visits like my wife 's annual well baby check ups for the little one and so on so when you 're feeling really sick and think a doctor 's visit would be warranted you have to make a decision after being faced with this decision a time or two you will start to envy those who have just a $ 20 copay of course that 's just an emotional con each year i run the numbers on how much we spent per year on out of pocket plus premiums and compare it to what it would cost in premiums for an type plan and the hsa plan always comes ahead in part because we are a pretty healthy family and i work for myself so do not get to enjoy group discount rates but i thought it worth mentioning because there are certainly times when i know i need to see a doctor or specialist and i cringe because i know i am going to be slapped with a big bill in the not too distant future

this may sound very tongue in cheek but the best thing you can invest in is to raise your income in order to increase your retirement savings   how much are you able to contribute to retirement now   i think you would be lucky to do $ and most months probably less than that   however if you were making like 60k year and allowed a little lifestyle bloat you could probably easy put away 20k year   once you are able to do that the savings you can manage now will be quickly    often times when people consider having their money work for them they often neglect to factor risk   prior to investing one should have a proper emergency fund in place   that is 6 months or so of living expenses in a nice safe savings account   those earn about 1.25 these days which is pretty meager but it does earn something    once the emergency fund is in place one can invest with impunity   without it you will have to liquidate investments if economic calamity strikes you   this could be done at a loss furthering the harm done by the calamity    increase your income and create an emergency fund   do those things first

credit cards typically charge interest on money you borrow from them   they work in one of two ways most cards will not charge you any interest if you pay the balance in full each month   you typically have around 25 days the grace period to pay that off   if that 's the case then you will use your credit card without any cost to yourself however if you do not pay it in full by that point then you will owe 19.9 interest on the balance typically from the day you charged the payment so retroactively   you 'll also immediately begin owing interest on anything else you charge typically even if you do then pay the next month the entire balance on time   it 's typically a daily rate which means that the annual rate apr is divided into its daily rate think the apr divided by 365 though it 's a bit different than that since it 's the rate which would be 19.9 annualized when you realize interest is paid on interest    say in your case it 's 0.05 daily that means each day 0.05 is added to your balance due   if you charged $ 1000 on day one and never made a payment but never had to ignore penalties here you 'd owe $ at the end of the year paying $ 199 interest 19.9 1000 note that your interest is calculated on the daily balance not on your actual credit limit if you only charge $ 100 you 'd owe $ interest not $ 199 also note that this simplifies what they 're actually doing   they often use things like average daily balance calculations and such to work out actual interest charged they tend to be similar to what i 'm describing but usually favor the bank a bit or are simpler to calculate finally some credit cards do not have a grace period   in the us most do but not all in other countries it may be less common   some simply charge you interest from day one as far as standard purchases that means buying services or goods   using your credit card for cash advances i.e. receiving cash from an atm using those checks they mail you or for cash like purchases for example at a casino are often under a different scheme they may have the same rate or a different rate   they likely incur interest from the moment cash is produced no grace period and they may involve additional fees   never use cash advances unless you absolutely can not avoid it

war 2 was what carried america out of the great depression   not really the end results of world war ii did basically the destruction of all economic competition along with the fortunate improvements in productivity the advent of gasoline tractors in agriculture etc but the war years were ones of a combined voluntary forced austerity amp centralized planned production the vast majority of what was produced being destroyed or squandered   's possible people do desperate things when they 're hungry most people will resort to within 2 weeks without food    no most people will resort to a lot of other things first and then those failing they die of starvation   is and always has been a relatively rare thing   gt;it 's too unpredictable but my bet is that the coming collapse will be multiple times worse than the great depression   yes and no   probably longer in duration 20 to 30 years rather than ~10 and no doubt some significant parts of the infrastructure will deteriorate to the point of collapse   what in political amp economic terms comes out the other side of that is what is really unpredictable there will almost undoubtedly be some type of dictatorship police state in there most likely during the depression making it longer amp worse before it amp gets better but whether it would survive amp remain or be replaced by yet another in the aftermath is the big question

do developing country equities have a higher return and/or lower risk    than emerging market equities   generally in finance you get payed more for taking risk   riskier stocks over the long run return more than less risky bonds for instance   developing market equity is expected to give less return over the long run as it is generally less risky than emerging market equity   one way to see that is the amount you pay for one rupee lira dollar euro worth of company earnings is fewer rupees lira and more dollars euros when measured in the emerging market 's currency   this makes this question interesting   risky emerging currencies like the rupee tend to devalue over time against less risky currencies euro dollars yen like where most international investment ends up but the results are rather wild   think how badly brazil has done recently and how relatively well the rupee has been doing    this adds to the returns roughly based on interest rates of foreign stocks from the point of view of a emerging market investor on average but has really wild variations do you have data for this over a long timeframe decades ideally for multiple countries not really unfortunately   good data for emerging markets is a fairly new phenomenon and even where it does exist decades ago it would have been very hard to invest like we can now so it likely is not comparable does foreign equity pay more or less when measured in rupees or other    emerging market currency probably less on average theoretically and empirically all things included though the evidence is not strong but there is a massive amount of risk in a portfolio that is 85 in a single emerging market currency   think about if you were a brazilian and needed to retire now and 85 of your portfolio was in the real   international goods like gas would be really expensive and your local currency portfolio would seem paltry right now   if you want to bet on emerging markets in the long run i would suggest that you at least spread the risk over many emerging markets and add a good chunk developed to the mix as for investing goals it 's just to maximize my return in inr or maximize my risk adjusted return that is up to you but the goal i generally recommend is making sure you are comfortable in retirement   this usually involves looking for returns are high in the long run but not having a ton of risk in a single currency or a single market   there are reasons to believe a little bias toward your homeland is good as fees tend to be lower on local investments and local investments tend to track closer to your retirement costs but too much can be very dangerous even for countries with stronger currencies say greece

this question feels like an question to me and so i will treat it as one investment noun form of to invest originally from the latin meaning to means commit money in order to earn a financial return merriam webster online dictionary invest vb tr definition 1 as such when a person commits money with the purpose of earning a financial return they are investing   playing the lottery when done so for the purpose of financial return would fall under this definition even if it 's a poor choice    gambling verb of to gamble likely originally from the word meaning to play means a   to play a game for money or property b   to bet on an uncertain outcome merriam webster online dictionary gamble vb definition 1 playing the lottery is clearly gambling as a lottery is a game by definition the second definition could well include investing in the stock market particularly certain kinds of investments derivatives currency speculation for example aside from the definitions however normal usage clearly favors investment to be something with an expectation of positive return while gambling is taking a risk without that expectation rather with the hope of positive return   legally as well playing the lottery is not something that is considered investment so it is taxed differently   however the question was can and by definition clearly it can be assuming you are not asking legally

i do n't know how much finance you know but a fundamental idea is that something 's value is the present value of all its future cash flows basically what those cash flows are worth today so if we can predict the cash flows the equity holders will get in the future not easy and determine at what rate to discount the cash flows not easy we can value the equity    so a company will have cash flows coming in but not all go to the equity holders some will go to debt holders if any interest payments some will go to preferred equity holders dividends if any what 's left over is what the equity holders will get if there 's no debt preferred equity or other things like that then the equity holders get all the cash flows   this does n't mean the equity holders literally receive the cash they 'll get whatever is given out via dividends but they own the cash and it may be reinvested in the business to generate more cash in the future

this is a common occurrence when somebody has multiple jobs in one year the employer ca n't know if you have reached the annual limit they know to stop when you have hit the maximum for their company but do n't have information on the other jobs in fact the irs does n't let them factor in the other jobs they have to keep making their payment until you hit the max for their company when you fill out the 1040 there will be a line that checks that the total social security amount for each person was not over the annual limit the extra will be refunded when you file your taxes in the future if this happens again you can adjust your withholding to minimize the overage for the example given in the question to get the 4 k extra sooner increase the number of allowances on the w-4   you can under withhold federal income tax because you will over withhold social security tax

using your uber vs. medallion taxi driver as an example   the problem in the sharing economy is an individual working as an independent contractor takes on all the risk and diminishing rewards while the profit of the company to which the individual is contracted increases significantly    case in point with uber let 's say you decide you want to drive for you lease a prius and thus are on the hook financially for $ 350/month + $ 100/month insurance + $ 300/month gas and other car expenses and you 'll have that for three years that 's a $ 750 nut    your nut remains the same but you have very little protection to ensure that your earnings are going to continue to come in especially if you look at it long term i am most familiar with the ridesharing market here in seattle and just in the last two years the number of ridesharing drivers lyft sidecar has exceeded an estimated 3,000 sure the customer base grows but there is also a continuing influx of additional drivers competing for those fares with the medallion system there is some level of protection to ensure that the industry remains viable for those who carry a medallion i am not advocating completely for this system and realize that the the government protection gave to the taxi industry led to customer service quality issues    so back to uber as uber fights for market share both capturing from the taxi industry but also competing against lyft and people driving their own cars they lower prices in some cases these lower prices have been in the form of discounts in some cases lower fares in seattle currently the minimum fare for an ride is $ 4 it was $ 6 a year ago uber takes a 20 percent cut from drivers and also charges drivers $ 10 a week to use their service if a driver makes $ 1000 a week in fares they pull down $ 800 of that after taxes let 's call it $ 600 so over the course of a month you 're looking at $ 2400 minus your nut including phone rental let 's call it $ 1600 take home pay    these people are n't getting rich to begin with and are at a huge risk for when uber or lyft or task rabbit or whoever decides to cut their prices again these services are beyond great for the consumer but are a temporary for anyone relying on them for work the big problem here is that companies like uber are advertising heavily that you can make $ on their service enticing people to make investments in things like cars to drive with them but at the end of the day you 're an independent contractor and uber owes you nothing    i believe uber i single them out because i think lyft is a little better at this on the ignorance of potential drivers to lure them into the system

let me first start by defining an emergency fund this is money which is because emergency 's usually need to be deal with asap boiler breaks gears box in a car generally you need these to be solved as soon as possible because ou depend on these things working and you ca n't budget for this type of expenditure using just your monthly salary this is a personal opinion but i prefer investment types that do n't have another fee on access i really do n't like having another fee on top on money that i need right now investment options market based investments should be seen as long term investments therefore they do not really satisfy requirement one they can also have broker fees therefore you might pay a small extra charge for taking money out and so do not satisfy requirement two investment options for emergency funds you want to get the best return on your money even if it 's your emergency fund so use regular saving accounts but from you emergency fund or use tax effective savings accounts like a cash isa if based in the uk do n't think of an emergency money as just sitting there you have options just makes sure the options fit the requirements update given feedback i appreciate there are levels of emergency fund the above details things which might be about 1 2 month salary in cost car repairs leaks boiler repairs now i have another fund which is in p2p funds which is higher risk than a deposit account but then gives me a better return and is less subject to market fluctuations and it would be the place i go to for loss of job level emergencies say 6 months of salary this takes a bit longer to access but given i have the above emergency fund i have given myself time to get the money from the p2p account

in china people are using litecoin and bitcoin to circumvent capital controls are the biggest exchanges of smart money disclaimer this is not advice this is the answer on a question and answer site the exchange rate of smart money is very volatile you will experience very brief exposure to those networks although litecoin is popular for speculation in china bitcoin gives you and your trading partners the most flexibility as the united states does not have robust and liquid exchanges for litecoin only bitcoin you buy smart money on one of the exchanges in china you send all of it to an exchange in the united states you sell all of it on that exchange for usd if it is n't clear smart money 's flexibility comes the fact that it does n't use banks to work exist and can be transferred to valid addresses over the internet   current regulated liquid and fdic insured us exchanges are coinbase and circle other exchanges use private insurance such as and   so in the course of 30 minutes you should have converted all of your funds from yuan back to stable us dollars in a regulated and insured us banking account to make it for goods and services you need to transfer it out of the exchange to a us bank account this has very little exposure to the bitcoin or litecoin network you do n't need any friends or mules for this the chinese government has issued many many on smart money such as litecoin and bitcoin so it is hard to keep up because they have made half efforts to prevent banks from directly servicing those networks while retaining the legality of their operations within china party members have been waiting for ways to get their wealth out of the country too without risk of blowback so you will need to see what hoops you need to jump through to move your funds to one of those exchanges to begin with this is faster and only uses one transaction instead of broken up ones and there are no tax consequences for sending money to yourself

it does n't sound fishy at all to me just seems like you may be dealing with a company that has relatively light trading volume to begin with meaning that small trades could easily make the price drop 8 which is n't much if you 're talking about a stocks in the $ 5 or less range if someone sells at the bid and the bid happens to be 8 lower than the current price that bid is now the price hence the drop the bid moving up afterward just means that someone is now willing to place a higher order than what the last trade was to try to get in

long term capital gains are taxed at 15 this year so the most you stand to save is $ 150 i would n't sell anything at a loss just to offset that unless you planned on selling anyways   a few reasons the long term capital gains rate will go up to 20 next year so your losses will be worth more next year than this year short term capital gains rates will go up next year as well so again better off saving your losses for next year you must use capital losses to offset capital gains if you have them but if you do n't have any capital gains you can use capital losses to offset ordinary income up to a limit $ 3,000 a year iirc   so if you just bite the bullet and pay the 15 on your gains this year you could use your losses to offset your likely higher rate ordinary income next year fyi complete chart for capital gains tax rates is here i also posted another answer about capital gains to this question a while back that might be useful

make sure you are paid on volume not people   almost all companies have a requirement to recruit a certain number of others   that 's not bad it ensures the company continues to grow without having to pay advertising and training costs   that 's what the commissions are for   the largest cost of distributing a product outside of mlm is advertising and marketing   if i remember correctly this adds up to about 66 of the cost of the product   if that 's true an mlm has quite a bit of money available to pay commissions and still have their products remain relatively competitive but when all is said and done you should be paid on volume just like a sales manager position in a company   a sales manager has to hire and train a sales staff but once they are out producing the manager is paid a percentage based on the volume of their sales staff   if an mlm is setup the same way then this is good   if they are setup to pay on recruiting people then run away as quickly as you can the biggest problem with recruiting is not whether or not you can do it   it 's whether or not the people you recruit can do it i have been involved with an mlm of sorts for 10 years   it pays a nice continual flow of income   i worked it hard for about 6 years and have ever since   the problem was attrition   it was greater than i ever imagined   it became very   i never have and never will be a high pressure person   i would show them the business and if they were interested great if not great   the problem was that people became interested but did n't have the skills to be successful   i should never have let them join the business   so they leave the business and say that mlm is bad   no it just was n't right for them or they were n't right for it regardless of what business you join make sure that you believe that everyone you introduce to the business has the ability to do the same thing you are doing   if they do great otherwise do n't even show it to them

for any shop the biggest costs are not the product itself but associated costs the quality customer experience decor wages rent maintenance tax      gt perishable items are more costly than non perishable   gt some costs are incurred regardless of whether a product is sold these are rent wages maintenance perishables therefore selling more in a shorter space of time generates proportionately more profits   coffee beans are effectively non perishable with how long they last milk is not a good worker can turn into coffee in seconds you may buy multiple coffees per day and for your friends the coffee beans themselves cost but the price charge could be £ 1 depending on the shop   pizza is labour intensive takes more ingredients and longer in the oven you only really buy 1 pizza per person it comes with a cost of ingredients are generally perishable   ice cream usually ca nt be made by a shop so it has to be shipped in it is very perishable leave it out of the freezer for and its melted its not a real replacement for food or drink so its optional

as others have said congratulations on saving up 75 k in cash while seemingly not neglecting other areas of personal finance   considering that only 15 of americans have more than 10 k saved this is quite a feat   source if you sell your old house and buy the new one you will still be in really good financial shape   no need to comment further renting your current home and buying a new home introduces a great amount of risk into your life   the risk in this case is mitigated by cash   as others have pointed out you will need to save a lot more to remove an acceptable amount of risk here is what i see so without paying off your existing house i would see a minimum savings account balance of about double of what you have now   once you purchase the new house the amount would be reduced by the down payment so you will only have about 50 k sitting around the rental emergency fund may be a little light depending on how friendly your state is to landlords   water heaters break renters do n't pay and properties can sit vacant   also anytime you move into a new business there will be mistakes made that are solved by writing checks   do you have experience running rentals    you might be better off to sell your existing home and move into a more expensive home than what you are suggesting you can continue to win at money without introducing a new factor into your life alternatively if you are bitten by the real estate bug you could mitigate a lot risk by buying a property that is of similar value to your current home or even less expensive   you can then choose which home to live in that makes the most financial sense   for example some choose to live in the more dilapidated home so they can do repairs as time permits to me upgrading the home you live in and renting an home for a rental is too much to do in such a short time frame   it is assuming far too much risk far to quickly for a person with your discipline   you will get there

in the u.s. virtually all salaries are expressed as gross salaries which are before the taxes that the individual must pay on their income the numbers shown in the links are almost certainly gross salary figures however the gross salary is not the entire total compensation number which is the total value of all compensation and benefits that the employee receives for his work total compensation includes not only salary and bonuses but the cost or value of any employer paid healthcare retirement company car expense account stock options and other valuable goods or services that 's still not the total amount of money the company has to pay to have you there are employer paid payroll taxes totaling 6.2 of your gross salary plus practical costs like the cost of your computer cubicle or office furniture and the portion of utility costs that keep you well lit clean and comfortable this complete number is called total employee cost and the general rule of thumb is that it 's double your gross cash compensation salary + bonuses lastly $ 100k in california is n't worth as much in real terms as $ 100k in other parts of the u.s. the cost of living in california especially in silicon valley where the majority of the people who make six figures by being c++ programmers are located is ridiculously expensive there are other tech hubs in the u.s. like dfw austin tx atlanta ga st louis mo nc etc where people earn less but also spend less to live and so can use more of their salary in a discretionary manner

there are a number of factors here 1 it 's important that there is human oversight on the system at one level someone needs to be monitoring the computers that manage the trading to be sure they are functioning at another level someone needs to be making judgement calls on important but rare events when you you suspend trading in a stock when do you close the stock exchange entirely it is alleged that computer trades were at least partly responsible for the may 2010 selloff even if that 's unproven would you really want those computers trading with each other for a couple of days or even for a couple of hours 2 providing 24/7 trading would increase the cost of running a stock exchange but with only a tiny improvement in liquidity 3 if the stock exchange ran 24/7 then traders would have to run 24/7 that would add hugely to the cost of trading 4 the people who would really suffer would be day traders because there would no longer be such a thing as a day trader if you were a sole trader then you would need to monitor your investments 24/7 or risk waking up in the morning to find one of your stocks had plummeted overnight

a true 0 loan is a losing proposition for the bank that 's true   however when you look at actual 0 loans they usually have some catches there might also be late payment fees prepayment penalties and other clauses that make it a good deal on average to the bank   individual borrowers might be able to get away with free money but the bank does not look to make money on each loan they look to make money on thousands of loans overall for a retailer including new car sellers the actual financing costs will be baked into the sales price   they will add say 10 to the sales price in exchange for an interest free loan they can also sell these loans to an investment bank or other entity but they would be sold at a deep discount so the difference will be made up in the sales price or other fees it 's possible that they would just chalk it up to promotional discounts or customer acquisition costs but it would not be a good practice on a large scale

as stated in the comments index funds are the way to go stocks have the best return on investment if you can stomach the volatility and the diversification index funds bring you is unbeatable while keeping costs low   you do n't need an individual savings account uk 401(k us or similar though they would be helpful to boost investment performance these are tax advantaged accounts without them you will have to pay taxes on your investment gains however there 's still a lot to gain from investing specially if the alternative is to place them in the vault or similar bear in mind that inflation makes your money shrink in real terms even a small interest is better than no interest   by best i mean that is safe regulated by the financial authorities so your money is safe and insured up to a certain amount and has reasonable fees keeping costs low is a must in any scenario   the two main concerns when designing your portfolio are diversification and low ter total expense ratio as when we chose broker our concern is to be as safe as we possibly can diversification helps with this and to keep costs at the bare minimum   some issues might restrict your election or make others seem better depending on the country you live and the one of the fund you might have to pay more taxes on gains dividends e.g. the us keeps some of them if your country does n't have a special treaty with them look for w-8ben and tax withholding for more information   vanguard and blackrock offer nice index funds morningstar might be a good place for gathering information do n't trust blindly the rating some values are not rated and kick ass the 4 star ones again seek low ter not a big fan of this point but i 'm bound to mention it it can be actually helpful for sorting out tax related issues which might decide the kind of index fund you pick and if you find this topic somewhat daunting you start with a good chunk of money so it might make even more sense in your scenario to hire someone knowledgeable and trustworthy i hope this helps to get you started best of luck

the two terms seem to be used interchangeably   even the irs website uses them interchangeably from one sentence to the next emphasis mine many 401(k plans allow employees to make a hardship withdrawal    because of immediate and heavy financial needs generally hardship    distributions from a 401(k plan are limited to the amount of the    employees elective contributions only it might a difference in perspective   the account holder withdraws the money but the fund manager distributes it another way to look at it would be for cases that are only in transition to another tax advantaged account   you can withdraw the money without it becoming a taxable distribution if you get it into another tax advantaged account within a certain time limit

so far buying of own by own companies like apple is concerned it will surely raise the price of the script at some level the share prices are a factor of supply and demand at a given price apple being a very demanded script its supply in the market goes down with the buy back after a while this will surely make the script price rise it also depends at what price the buy back is affected if the buy back is done at a right price it will help the existing shareholder if a very high price is paid it will erode shareholders wealth   hence each buy back needs to be studies separately there are several and at times complex variables which determines if the buy back is good for continuing shareholders or not

in my experience earning interest is not enough to keep the account in a non dormant state if payment of interest was the trigger to reset the clock then no savings account would ever be considered dormant in general as the account got close to the deadline we were notified that a single transaction moving money into or out of the account would reset the clock i have had this happen in recent years with a bank account and a credit union account   in researching for the exact definition of a dormant account i found this regarding interest on the fdic website that means that the state law may set the definition it also means that you should look at the information regarding the bank policy i did try and see if the rules for a credit union are the same the added twist with a credit union is that if the account is closed they are no longer a share holder and that brings into the discussion voting rights so the policy guidelines is even more complex if the account does go inactive state law will define what happens to the account and how you can get the funds back

the federal funds rate is one of the risk free short term rates in the economy we often think of fixed income securities as paying this rate plus some premia associated with risk for a treasury security we can think this way interest rate = fed funds rate + term premium the term premium is a bit extra the bond pays because if you hold a long term bond you are exposed to interest rate risk which is the risk that rates will generally rise after you buy making your bond worth less   the relation is more complex if people have expectations of future rate moves but this is the general idea   anyway generally speaking longer term bonds are exposed to more interest rate risk so they pay more on average for a corporate bond we think this way interest rate = fed funds rate + term premium + default premium where the default premium is some extra that the bond must pay to compensate the holder for default risk which is the risk that the bond defaults or loses value as the company 's prospects fall   you can see that corporate and government bonds are affected the same way approximately this is all hand waving by changes in the fed funds rate now that all refers to the rates on new bonds   after a bond is issued its value falls if rates rise because new bonds are relatively more attractive   its value rises if rates on new bonds falls   so if there is an unexpected rise in the fed funds rate and you are holding a bond you will be sad especially if it is a long term bond does n't matter if it 's corporate or government   ask yourself though whether an increase in fed funds will be unexpected at this point   if the increase was expected it will already be priced in   are you more of an expert than the folks on wall street at predicting interest rate changes   if not it might not make sense to make decisions based on your belief about where rates are going   just saying brick points out that treasuries are tax advantaged   that is you do n't have to pay state income tax on them but you do pay federal if you live in a state where this is true this may matter to you a little bit they also pay little because they are convenient for use as a cash substitute in transactions and convenience yield   in general treasuries just do n't pay much   young folk like you tend to buy corporate bonds instead so they can make money on the default and term premia

first i do n't claim to have all the answers but can appreciate the dialogue and question you 're posing   as you stated you love the overall advertising experience and i 'm assuming sales generation from those experiences since that is how you 'll generate revenue   integrated marketing to me has always seemed like an especially narrow subject matter i do n't mean that it is simply or easy by any means but rather you become a story teller in the advertising world and your story is to impact your target audience in a particular way i 'll use myself as an example i am a former college athlete and currently work in sales marketing supply chain i watch a lot of sports with my two sons and saw the recent gatorade ad about in order to win you have to lose that ad has stuck in my head because i know that commitment from to school to work it 's a brilliant concept that has me hooked to me that is what is all about a concept that was tailored to tell a story of success through failure and having athletes that repeat that story a truly hand crafted product that now has me opt for a gatorade when leaving the gym    when i consider marketing as a whole i do n't think of these types of tailored situations but rather the whole puzzle marketing and its counterpart analytics create a solid shape for a business to thrive your personal sales lines and how your sales people are performing are a part of your marketing potential customer service to build relations and increase your net promoter scores technical applications to develop products that are in line with customer demand and in turn the supply chain foresight to deliver on said products all of it is marketing    hope this helps

conceptually the entries are    yes and since you 're the sole owner your basis will equal to the equity balance on the balance sheet keep in mind the book and tax basis will probably be different so you may want to keep a separate calculation to track the tax basis there is no journal additional journal entry for this if you 're using bookkeeping software be sure to research its book closing closing entries feature as it is handled differently depending on the software for example quickbooks does n't explicitly close its books but re computes the balance sheet dynamically depending on the selected date range

yes rebalancing with new money avoids capital gains taxes and loads although if you 're financially literate enough to be thinking about rebalancing techniques i 'm surprised to hear that you 're invested in funds with loads on the other hand if it 's taking you years to rebalance then a you are not rebalancing anywhere near frequently enough   rebalancing should be something you do every 6 months or 1 year such that it would take only a few weeks or maybe a month of new investment to get back in balance b you will be out of balance for quite a long time while the whole point of the theory of rebalancing is to always be mathematically prepared for swings in the market   any time spent out of balance represents that much more risk that an unexpected market move can seriously hurt your portfolio you should weigh the time it will take you to rebalance the long way i.e. the risk cost of not rebalancing immediately vs. the taxes and fees involved in rebalancing quickly   if you had said that it would take you only a couple weeks or a month to rebalance the long way i would say that the long way is fine   but the prospect of spending years without a balanced portfolio seems far more costly to me than any expenses you might incur rebalancing quickly since it 's almost the end of the calendar year have you considered doing two quick rebalances one this year and another in january   that way half of the tax consequences would happen in april and the other half not until the next april giving you plenty of time to up the money   also even if you have no capital losses this year with which to offset some of your expected capital gains you would have all of next year to harvest some losses against next year 's half of the rebalancing gains

the us will lose money until the point where production in the us is cheap enough to bring it back    not if they raise taxes   i recently saw a mention of a research job in psychology that came to a conclusion more or less like this given the choice of getting $ 100,000 while their neighbor got $ 250,000 and the alternative of each getting $ 50,000 most americans chose the second option   they 'd rather get less for themselves rather than let their neighbor get more than they did    that 's why so many americans favor higher taxes on the corporations it does n't matter if the corporations become unable to invest in more jobs the important thing is not to let the corporations make money easily

because companies big or small only pay taxes on profits rather than it ca n't be any other way really because of the $ 5 you pay for the big mac most of that goes to pay suppliers and employees and only perhaps $ 0.50 would be profit   but that fact also opens up all sorts of loopholes for example a us company can license a patent from a cayman islands company and make yearly payments thus the us company no longer has any profits and all of that money winds up in the caymans   that 's a trivial example but there 's an entire industry dedicated to doing this shit i 'd be impressed if you could craft any law that banned this without also banning legitimate international commerce

every bank and credit union in the us has a deposit agreement and disclosures document bank of america is no different our general policy is to make funds from your cash and check deposits    available to you no later   than the first business day after the day    of your deposit however in some cases we place a hold   on funds that    you deposit by check a hold results in a delay in the availability of    these funds that sounds great but for determining the availability of your deposits every day is a    business day except saturdays    and federal holidays    if    you make a deposit on a business day that we are open at one of our    financial centers before    p.m. local time or at one of our atms    before p.m. local time in the state where we   maintain your    account we consider that day to be the day of your deposit however    if you make   a deposit after such times or on a day when we are not    open or that is not a business day we   consider that the deposit was    made on the next business day we are open some locations have     different cutoff times so if you deposit a check on friday afternoon the funds are generally available on tuesday but not always in some cases we will not make all of the funds that you deposit by    check available to you by the   first business day after the day of    your deposit depending on the type of check that you deposit   funds    may not be available until the second business day after the day of    your deposit the first   $ 200 of your deposits however may be    available no later than the first business day after the day   of your    deposit   if we are not going to make all of the funds from your    deposit available by the first business   day after the day of your    deposit we generally notify you at the time you make your deposit we    also tell you when the funds will be available ok what happens when the funds are available in many cases we make funds from your deposited checks available to    you sooner than we   are able to collect the checks this means that    from time to time a deposited check may be   returned unpaid after we    made the funds available to you please keep in mind that even though     we make funds from a deposited check available to you and you withdraw    the funds you are   still responsible for problems with the deposit    if a check you deposited is returned to us unpaid   for any reason you    will have to repay us and we may charge your account for the amount of    the   check even if doing so your account fidelity has a similar document each check deposited is promptly credited to your account   however    the money may not be available until up to six business   days later    and we may decline to honor any debit that is applied   against the    money before the deposited check has cleared if a deposited check does not clear the deposit will be removed   from    your account and you are responsible for returning any   interest you    received on it i would think that the longer holding period for fidelity is due to the fact that they want to wait long enough to make sure that the number of times they have to undo investments due to the funds not clearing is nearly zero

i would recommend using growth value income bond based asset allocation because your goal is to find asset classes that have different performance trends when 1 is up the other is down and vice versa     if you chose domestic us stocks and diversified between med cap and large cap stocks they would not exactly mirror each other but they would roughly rise and fall at the same time preventing you from taking full advantage of diversification increasing risk and lowering returns
# 264095
your relatively young age and the current very low bond interest rates make annuities a very poor buy and most of the other suggestions you have mentioned have very low diversification which exposes you to imprudent risks buying shares for dividend income can solve the diversification problem by averaging out your totals as different shares change by different amounts there is no really good solution to the problem of share price volatility except to ignore it take your dividends and pretty much ignore the bouncing around of the share price they usually recover in a year or three owning shares of companies that reliably increase their dividend payouts is the only investment type that gives you both diversification and regularly increasing income to counteract inflation over the years read some investment books and consider consulting with a financial advisor who charges a fee for the advice i.e. you do n't want free advice

a roth ira is simply a tax sheltered account that you deposit funds into and then invest however you choose within the limits of the firm you deposit the funds with for example you could open a roth ira account with vanguard   you could then invest the $ 3000 by purchasing shares of voo which tracks the s&p 500 index and has a very low expense ratio 0.04 as of last time i checked   fidelity has a similar option or schwab or whatever brokerage firm you prefer iras are basically just normal investment accounts except they do n't owe taxes until you withdraw them and roth do n't even owe them then though you paid taxes on the funds you deposit   they have some limitations regarding options trading and such but if you 're a novice investor just looking to do basic investments you 'll not notice    then your ira would go up or down in value as the market went up or down in value you do have some restrictions on when you can withdraw the funds roth ira has fewer than a normal ira as you can withdraw the capital the amount you deposited without penalty but the profits can not be withdrawn until you 're retirement age i wo n't put an actual year as i suspect that actual year will change by the time you 're that old but think 60s the reason not to invest in an ira is if you plan on using the money in the near future even as an emergency fund   you should have some money that is not invested aggressively that is in something very safe and very accessible for your emergency fund and if you plan to buy a house or whatever with the funds do n't start an ira   but if this is truly money you want to save for retirement that 's the best place to start note this is not investment advice and you should do your own homework prior to making any investment   you can lose some or all of the value of your account while investing

it sounds like you plan to sell sooner or later if your opinion is that there is still room for the housing market to grow make your bet and sell later the real estate market is much less liquid than other markets you might be invested in so if you do end up seeing trouble another housing crash you may be stuck with your investment for longer than you hoped i see more risk renting the house out but i do n't see significantly more reward if you are comfortable with the risk by all means proceed with your plan to rent   my opinion is contrary to many others here who think real estate investments are more desirable because the returns are less abstract you can collect the rent directly from your tenants but all investments are fraught with their own risks if you like putting in a little sweat equity doing your own repairs when things break at your rental renting may be a good match for you i prefer investments that do n't require as much attention and index funds certainly fit that bill for me

gt;it 's sad when i hear young workers talk about their job application strategies more often than not they involve figuring out how to fool the hr bots   lol   it took me a second with your hr bots to realize you were talking about the software and not the hr personnel   because i have always even 30 years back viewed hr as basically operating on a lot of faulty fundamental assumptions the best way to get hired even back then before the software application screening process was to do an end run around hr   part of the reason is that hr or previously the personnel dept was really designed from the get go only to fill the generic factory worker positions jobs that had minimal base level skill requirements i.e. the checkbox type stuff where any relatively intelligent person should be able to determine with a pretty high accuracy whether the candidates could do the job in other words the open positions that were effectively commodities and where the turnover was high and/or the number of people employed fairly large   but then a combination of hr wanting to be more professional combined with the advent of the generic mba manager who believes he she can manage anything without specific domain knowledge or experience created an opening for hr to take over the hiring of virtually all positions   so what we ended up with was the generic mba manager lacking domain knowledge experience shifting the responsibility or at least most of it for candidate filtering amp hiring off to generic hr people processes who pretty much by definition lack domain knowledge experience and who then attempted to the whole thing     add in stuff like equal opportunity anti discrimination laws and lawsuits to drive the generic of the whole process and you have the perfect pre conditions for the storm that is the current fiasco   so we end up with generic and lets face it often ignorant managers taking job requirements and coming up with checklist style help wanted ads cs degree 5 10 years of ruby on rails work experience hr departments that are clueless about the validity availability of those requirements pretty much just the crap into the ads amp application filtering software in a rote fashion and like a badly constructed google search it should n't be surprising that they come up with minimal results   of course within the discarded applicants are probably several potentially excellent hires but they will simply never be found     so smart people will still again do their best not to game the bots but to do an end run around the whole thing   and that means using your network to get your name in the door and your resume in the hands of the person that matters within the company that may or just as often may not be the manager who makes the hiring decision it may very well be the most experienced person in his department who then pushes the manager to interview and hire you and you preferably do that before the damned ad is even written and before the hr department is even aware that there is a need for a hire keep in mind that there is often a span of several weeks if not several months between the real awareness of a need and the manager hr getting around to actually starting the help wanted fiasco ridden process   one key aspect of that is that via the in the door ahead of time even if the company requires the hr process to be followed the job spec can be constructed to match the pre qualified candidate and his her resume can go to the top of the stack already being in the manager 's hands with a recommendation endorsement from one of his critical team members i.e. hire this guy gal   unfortunately it seems that for all the emphasis on networking these days colleges and other how to get hired classes seldom if ever teach those techniques   but if you ask around look around within companies and identify the really good fit people a lot of them will have been hired by this method and emphatically were not found via hr listings amp processes

starvation is a highly physical state people are well motivated to avoid if one finds themselves in that state it is because something perhaps circumstances perhaps something else prevents them from adding value to society this is not a personal judgement of the individual its reality   his circumstances add no value to the egg the egg would provide the same nutrition to the starving man as it would the fed man and sustain each of them for exactly the same amount of time the starving mans desire for food does not make him more willing to pay it makes him willing to pay for smaller quantities of cheaper poorer quality eggs the well fed man is able to afford greater and better qualities of egg thus he is more willing to pay

your question is based on incorrect assumptions generally there 's no penalty per se to make a withdrawal from your rrsp even if you make a withdrawal earlier than retirement however you define it a precise meaning for retirement with respect to rrsps is largely irrelevant our u.s. neighbours have a 10 penalty on non hardship early withdrawals before age 59 half from retirement accounts like the 401k and ira it 's an additional measure designed to discourage early withdrawals and raise more tax   yet in canada there is no similar penalty individual investments inside your rrsp may have associated penalties such as the dreaded deferred sales charge of some back end loaded mutual funds or such as funds that generated additional special tax credits that could get clawed back   yet these early withdrawal penalties are distinct from the rrsp nature of your account   choose your investments carefully to avoid these kinds of surprises rather an rrsp is a tax deferred account and it works like this   the government allows you to claim a nice juicy tax deduction which can reduce your income tax at your marginal rate in the year you make a contribution or later if you should choose to defer the deduction the resulting pre tax money accumulated in your rrsp benefits from further tax deferral assets can grow without attracting annual income tax on earned interest dividends or capital gains you do n't need to declare on your income tax return any of the income earned inside your rrsp unlike a regular investment account here 's the rub once you decide to withdraw money from your rrsp the entire amount withdrawn is considered regular income in the year in which you make the withdrawal   thus your withdrawals are subject to income tax and yes at your marginal rate   this is always the case whether before or after retirement you mentioned two special programs the home buyers plan hbp and the lifelong learning plan llp   neither the hbp nor the llp permit tax free withdrawals   rather each of these programs are special kinds of loans that you can borrow from your own rrsp hbp and llp loan money is n't taxed when you get it because you are required to pay it back and you pay it back into your own rrsp you always pay income tax at your marginal rate on your rrsp withdrawals above i said a precise meaning for retirement with respect to rrsps is largely irrelevant   yet there are ages that matter   by the end of the year in which you turn 71 you are required to convert your rrsp to a it 's similar but you can no longer contribute and you must withdraw a minimum amount each year other circumstances related to age may qualify for minor tax relief intended for retirees such as the age amount or the pension income credit   generally such measures do n't significantly change the fact that you pay income tax on rrsp withdrawals at your marginal rate these measures raise the minimum you can take out without attracting tax but most do nothing at the margin exception one might split eligible pension income with a spouse or common law partner which may reduce tax at the margin

some businesses verify the shipping address with the credit card company and refuse to ship to an alternate address without additional offline verification   of course this is only useful for physical goods

front running does not mean what you think it means front running involves getting access to customer orders and trading for your own account ahead of them    this is spoofing or quote stuffing which involves placing fake orders to induce other hft algorithms to do stupid things you can exploit

i can pretty much guarantee you that the vast majority of new small companies will not grow to have 50 workers they probably wo n't even have 49 workers or 48 or even 47   once they approach 40 other solutions even beyond the part time employees suggested by the author a thing i would expect will be addressed by a change in the detailed regulations the federal government will attempt to stop this obvious loophole by redefining what constitutes a full time employee many other solutions will be executed dividing the company into two or three distinct entities with slightly different ownership for example wife owns one location husband another etc plus the obvious expanded use of temp agencies contract and/or subcontract workers work especially generic administrative work out to other firms etc   any and all of those will probably cost far less than $ 40k a year which is probably a woefully underestimated number

you are co signer on his car loan you have no ownership unless the car is titled in both names   one option not the best see below is to buy the car from him   arrange your own financing take over his loan or get a loan of your own to pay him for the car   the bank(s will help you take care of getting the title into your name   and the bank holding the note will hold the title as well best advice is to get with him sell the car take any money left after paying off the loan and use it to buy cash purchase not finance a reliable efficient used car if you truly need a car at all if you can get to work by walking or public transit you can save thousands per year and perhaps use that money to start you down the road to financial independence   take a couple of hours and research this   in the us we tend to view cars as necessary but this is not always true   actually it 's true less than half the time even if you can not or choose not to live within bicycle distance of work you can still reduce your commuting cost by not financing and by driving a fuel efficient vehicle   ask yourself would you give up your expensive vehicle if it meant retiring years earlier   maybe as many as ten years earlier

i 'm a finance major in finland and here is how it would go here as you loan money to the company the company has no income but gains an asset and a liability when the company then uses the money to pay the bills it does have expenses that accumulate to the end of the accounting period where they have to be declared these expenses are payed from the asset gained and has no effect to the liability when the company then makes a profit it is taxable how ever this taxable profit may be deducted from from a tax reserve accumulated over the last loss periods up to ten years when the company then pays the loan back it is divided in principal and interest the principal payment is a deduction in the company 's liabilities and has no tax effect the interest payment the again does have effect in taxes in the way of decreasing them on your personal side giving loan has no effect getting the principal back has no effect getting interest for the loan is taxable income when there are documents the giving the loan and accounting it over the years there should be no problem paying it back

yes anything that lowers your magi will help you avoid the cliff and all above the line deductions like hsa ira contributions do so i 'd prioritize maxing hsa contributions over maxing ira contributions but that 's another topic here 's a good article on avoiding the cliff but you 've already got it figured correctly stay off the obamacare aca premium subsidy cliff here 's what goes into magi for aca purposes from your magi is the total of the following for each member of your    household who ’s required to file a tax return you mentioned traditional ira and that 's important since roth ira contributions do not lower agi

as most people said family loans are dangerous to the relationship   the lender should not lend more than they are willing to forgive and the borrower should not borrow more than they are very certain they can repay i would suggest a few things to consider anecdote i borrowed some money from my grandfather when i graduated from college to help with cash flow for an apartment vehicle etc   it was about 5 of my starting annual salary and i paid it back quickly and with interest

perpetuity means perpetual the assumption is that facebook will continue to be a going concern which means they will operate indefinitely this is a standard assumption and although it may not be true for facebook it serves its purpose as a baseline assumption speculating on the exact timing of the demise of facebook would be even less accurate

thanks just to clarify i am looking for a more value neutral answer in terms of things like sharpe ratios i think it 's an oversimplification to say that on average you lose money because of put options even if they expire 90 of the time they still have some expected payoff that kicks in 10 of the time and if the price is less than the expected payoff you will earn money in the long term by investing in put options i am sure you know this as a phd student i just wanted to get it out guess more formally my question would be are there studies on whether options prices correspond well to the diversification benefits they offer from an mpt point of view

unlikely they believe they are starting a business on the path to the american dream and they can do it from home in their spare time while the kids are asleep that 's how it 's sold to them the reason people play the lottery is for the hope that they will become instantly rich different    is success in business as delusional as winning the lottery maybe would be interesting to calculate and compare the expected value of each

the thing that is working to foxconn 's advantage here is that there were several states competing for this that s exactly it this is actually how all business works its no surprise states usually compete for large businesses to move their by giving tax breaks because it benefits their people and they will eventually still collect taxes   now the first part interest me how much does the state usually spend on a project like this i would nt really consider it a gamble unless you consider all investments to be gambles but that also that you think this is high risk what makes you say that foxconn wo nt live up to its promises wo nt the state just sue based on the terms of agreement

yes on taxes it depends on the other point as you already see from ben 's comment if you 're both very western in your culture you may want to consider ben 's advice because while you will save money it may not be considered a healthy way to start a relationship   western culture tends to see marriage as more of a do it for love whereas other cultures may view marriage more pragmatically and take economics and finance as a major consideration for instance a friend of mine married his spouse and it was 100 pragmatic considering taxes and laws driving most of his family insane because it does n't sound very loving these were the exact words   unfortunately this created tension later on because family on both sides kept telling both of them that the other did n't love the partner and they used how their marriage started as proof   as surprising as it is to me non western many americans are horrified at people at the or other pragmatic ways even if it saves them thousands answering questions about relationships is very difficult because often the issue is less about money and more about culture   if you 're both from pragmatic cultures where economics and finance weigh strongly and you do n't see possible issues with family and really be honest on this point then consider the financial advantages

anyone can sue you whether or not they would win the lawsuit is what matters and to win there would have to be measurable damages how much money could the seller possibly have lost due to this in just a few days imho the most you 'd realistically be out is your earnest money btw your realtor gets paid only if you purchase a home so in this case your realtor may not have your best interests in mind if the choices are buy this house or do n't buy anything definitely talk to an attorney and then consider notifying the seller asap

this is true on line sales mostly by amazon destroyed retail   and while many people lost their jobs new jobs were created but much less many people saved a lot of money   i do n't think the brick and mortar retail can be the same if you can shop and have huge selection on line from anywhere were you live

the money goes to the seller   there are a lot of behind the scenes things that happen and some transactions are very complicated with many parties involved evidenced by all the comments on @keshlam 's perfectly reasonable high level answer but ultimately the money goes to the seller   sometimes the seller is the company   the billions of shares that change hands each day are moving between other individuals like you and investment funds these transactions have no direct impact on the company 's financials in general
