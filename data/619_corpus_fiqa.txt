margin trades let you post a margin of a certain proportion of the value of the trade as collateral against the price of a trade and pay off the difference between the current price and the price that you bought at any losses incurred are taken from the margin so the margin has to be maintained as prices change in practice this means that when the price moves significantly from the buying price a margin call is triggered and the buyer has to increase their posted margin the vast majority of the foreign exchange trades done every day are margin trades as effectively are all spread bets margins get reset overnight whether or not a call has occurred

note this answer was provided when the question was only about life insurance therefore it does not address any other benefits term life insurance is very easy to evaluate once you have determined how much you need and for how long for significant amounts of coverage they may require a physical to be performed the price quotes will be for   two levels of health so you can compare costs from many companies quite easily   you have several sources in no particular order employer independent company 3rd party like aarp aaa or via you bank or credit union note that the 3rd party will be getting a cut of the premium also some choices offered from the employer or 3rd party may be limited in size or duration the independent companies will be able to have terms that extend for 10 years or more so view the insurance offered by aarp as just another option that has to be compared to all your other options

if you buy us stocks when the cad is high and sell them when the cad is lower you will make a currency gain on top of any profit or loss from the stock investments if you buy us stocks when the cad is low and sell when the cad is higher any profits from gains from the stock investment will be reduced and any losses will be increased if you are just starting out you may be better off investing in your own country to avoid any currency risk adding to your stock market risk

at the most basic level of financing a business you are trying to acquire capital as cheaply as you can to invest in your projects   the measure for how expensive your capital is to acquire is weighted average cost of capital     the formula for wacc   equity ratio cost of equity + debt ratio cost of debt 1 tax rate this is also your discount rate when you 're making a dcf model   debt tends to be cheaper than equity when you do n't already have any and is also advantaged by tax rates since you do n't pay taxes on interest   in the real world banks and lenders will ratchet up rates the more debt you acquire or shut you out once you 've taken on too much and your debt service coverage is too low for them   in a classroom though most teachers are too lazy to make a formula for borrowing and will just state a rate for borrowing so you can load up on debt so long as you do n't fall below being able to service your debt cash flow to make your debt payments   this will ultimately juice the returns on equity   realistically you would find lenders would let you have ~20 equity in the business and debt without raising your teacher 's   if you have n't taken accounting yet be careful about the difference between cash and revenue in your analyses   revenue is recognition for work done not cash in hand   you can have all the revenue in the world but if no one 's paid you for it yet you ca n't pay anyone

i came across such a situation and i am still facing it my friend borrowed my credit card for his expenses as he had misplaced his debit card and for the time being had asked for my credit card to handle the expenses he does he paid for initial 2 months and then was not able to make payments mainly due to not being able to arrange money or if it was a party he would collect cash from friends but again spend the same months passes by the bill had come upto 65k and calls from bank and other respective organizations finally my dad came into picture and slowly the issue is resolving he has paid 50 k remaining is still pending    so basically the reason i shared this part of story was he is my best friend and in order to not spoil our friendship i did not want to take any such step which would later on affect our friendship this completely depends on the individuals how they react to the situation keeping ego superiority favour sort of feelings and words apart things can be resolved between friends you do not know what is the situation on the other side   probably you can connect with him ask him to explain you why is not able to pay the debts and take action accordingly if he is not able to provide a proper reason then you may take some actions like mentioned in initial answers run after the assets he own or anything else stay calm and patient do not take any such step which you would regret later on

like everybody else i 'm picking up on the school loans you 're mother is n't exactly earning a massive amount of money given her cost of living why is she taking out student loans that benefit you and your sister i 'm not trying to be offensive but it 's fairly obvious that she ca n't afford it as a first step i think you should at least take over paying your own student loans you sound like you 're out of college already and if you have $ 8k to lend to your mother you probably have enough money to pay the student loans that benefited you after all or as someone else also recommended assume your loans as to your sister maybe it 's time for her to get another job to pay for the tuition so her mother does n't have to go further into debt again i 'm not trying to be mean here but your mother is digging herself deeper and deeper into a hole because of the tuition something 's got ta give and delivering pizza or getting a paper round is a small sacrifice here next the car unless she has a managed to work herself out of some of this mess i would consider getting a much cheaper car instead this is provided that she is n't upside down on the loan personally i would n't trade in a vehicle with an upside down loan if anything that 's another bad financial decision assuming that she is n't upside down on the loan and has some equity in the car i would seriously consider selling the car and using the equity to buy something small and cheap that should also hopefully reduce the cost of gas and maybe insurance somewhat i think these points are probably the quickest steps that can be taken towards recovering this situation you already mentioned the longer term plans like downsizing the apartment but tbh i 'm not sure that this is really necessary the big elephant in the room are the college costs and removing those from the equation would give her a serious amount of breathing room

it 's definitely annoying but it 's not necessarily false advertising there is no rule or law that says they have to fix a pricing error at all let alone within a certain period of time unfortunately they have no obligation to do business with you unless they take and keep your money if they canceled the order and returned your money you have no binding agreement with them   on top of that in the us misleading advertising usually refers to any advertising or promotion that the nature characteristics qualities or geographic origin of goods services or commercial activities act 15 the main criteria that they evaluate before taking legal action is whether or not someone has suffered harm or loss due to the reliance on the bad information but you 're in europe the eu ideas behind misleading advertising tend to focus a lot more on comparing one product to someone else 's and making subjective claims or false promises pricing does come up but still you need to have an ability to prove that you suffered harm or a loss from the business actions   even if you were able to prove that to force the business to change its price catalog you would need to go through legal proceedings demonstrate the harm that you 've sustained and then have a judge decide in your favor and order the supplier to comply my guess is that it 's just not worth it for you but you have n't specified if this is just an annoying shoe shopping experience or if you are regularly experiencing bait and switch tactics from a supplier that is a crucial part of a business operation   if it 's the former just like a physical shop reserves the right to kick you out if you 're not behaving but usually does n't because they 'd like to keep you as a customer an online shop can update its prices whenever they like they can change their prices too and cancel orders   if it 's the latter then start putting together some documentation on how many times this has happened and how it has damaged your business but before you get on the i would recommend you look for another place to buy whatever you have in mind or else try a pound of sugar in your approach to this supplier my own business experience has shown that can go a lot way in figuring out a mutually beneficial resolution if you want to see a bit more   here is the eu justice commission 's website on false advertising here is a pdf from the uk office of fair trading that spells out what is explicitly not allowed from a business by way of advertising business practices

there are lots of different ways to generate passive income   what is passive income basically it is income you receive without having to consistently work for it i.e. paid to do your day job or get paid by the hour instead you do the work once and then receive ongoing payments like a recording artist getting paid royalties or a book author etc   online passive income also some online business models can be great ways to generate passive income you set up an automated system online to drive traffic and sell products either as the merchant or an affiliate and get paid regularly without having to do any more work   you just need to use seo or ppc or media buys or online advertising to generate the automated traffic to your website which will have special landing pages and sales that do the conversion and selling for you if you are an affiliate you do n't even have to handle any products packaging delivering etc   and if it ’s a digital product like software or information products they can be sent straight to the customers automatically online then you can set up a system that can generate true passive income time consuming or expensive however the above mentioned methods of generating passive income tend to require a lot of work or special skills talent or knowledge and can be expensive or time consuming to set up preferred method therefore for many people the preferred passive income method is fully managed hands free property investing or other types of investing for that matter   but for people who want full ownership of the income generating asset then property investing is the best as they can sell and have control over the capital invested whereas investing in a business for example will have a lot of other variables to consider like the business sector the market factors the management team and even down to individual employee performance so in my opinion if you have the money to invest then fully managed hands free buy to let property investing is one of the best types of passive income available to us today   some of the most popular income generating property assets today in the uk include    student property    care homes    residential buy to let

algorithmic trading essentially banks on the fact that a price will fluctuate in tiny amounts over short periods of time meaning the volatility is high in that given time frame as the time frame increases the efficiency of algorithmic trading decreases and proper investment strategies such as due diligence stock screening and technical analysis become the more efficient methods   algorithms become less effective as the time frame increases due to the smoothing effect of volatility over time writing an algorithm that could predict future long term prices would be an impossible feat because as the time frame is scaled up there are far less price fluctuations and trends volatility out and so there is little to no benchmark for the formulas   an algorithm simply would n't make sense for a long term position a computer ca n't predict say the next quarter an ousted ceo a buyout or anything else that could effect the price of the security never mind the psychology behind it all vice versa researching a company 's fundamentals just to bank on a 0.25 daily swing would not be efficient tax advantages or not it is the most efficient methods that are preferred for a given time scale of trading

these rates are so low because the cost of money is so low specifically two rates are near zero   the federal reserve discount rate which is the interest rate charged to commercial banks and other depository institutions on loans they receive from their regional federal reserve bank 's lending facility the discount window the effective federal funds rate which is the rate banks pay when they trade balances with each other through the federal reserve banks want to profit on the loans they make like mortgage loans to do so they try to maximize the difference between the rates they charge on mortgages and other loans revenue and the rates they pay savings account holders the federal reserve or other banks to obtain funds expenses this means that the rates they offer to pay are as close to these rates as possible as the charts shows both rates have been cut significantly since the start of the recession either through open market operations the federal funds rate or directly the discount rate the discount rate is set directly by the regional federal reserve banks every 14 days    in most cases the federal funds rate is lower than the discount rate in order to encourage banks to lend money to each other instead of borrowing it from the fed in the past however there have been rare instances where the federal funds rate has exceeded the discount rate and it 's been cheaper for banks to borrow money directly from the fed than from each other

there was a study last year it was all over the news that concluded that experiences not stuff is what makes people happy the satisfaction from going on vacation lasts even after the holiday is long over that new gadget only gives fleeting satisfaction to that end i recommend splurging on the affordable luxuries that give you a better experience for example i 'm a big believer in paying the a few dollars to check my bags at the curb rather than wait in line at the airport because i hate airports parking is another affordable luxury when the alternative is circling a busy parking lot for 15 minutes pay for the better seats at the show get a room at the nicer hotel eat out a bit more often i ca n't imagine willingly spending hours with customer support though they can have my $ 5

there is almost always money involved somewhere but it does n't have to come from you   it can be investors credit cards or even seller financing i 've done all 3 examples if you can find partners with the money to make the deals happen then your job is to put the deal together   find the properties negotiate the price even get the property under contract all without any obligation or cost on your part yes it absolutely can be done   then your partners will fund the deal if it 's good enough and their terms are met etc in some areas you can put a property on a credit card   if you find a house say for $ 25,000 that will rent for $ 300/month and you can put it on a credit card especially at zero percent for a year or something similar then you can generate cashflow as a landlord without putting up any cash of your own on the purchase   of course there are many risks associated with landlording and i could tell you horror stories but we 're not addressing that here you can negotiate a sale with an owner who agrees to finance the entire purchase for you   i once purchased 3 properties at once this way from a seller who financed the entire sale all closing costs everything this way   of course they needed a lot of repair and such so i had to fund that another way but at least the purchase itself cost me no money out of pocket so these courses are not inherently scams in the sense that what they are teaching is usually i 'm sure there are exceptions true   however they generally give you enough information to get into trouble and not out   but that 's what true learning is it 's getting into trouble and finding a way out that does n't kill you   =)   that 's called experience and you ca n't buy that for any price

a paycheck is simply a check for your salary   it 's just like a rent check or a birthday check or a grocery check   i 've had paychecks that were personal checks from the owner of the business i 've had ones that are printed in the office i worked in and signed right there and i 've had paychecks that are printed through a third party company and mailed to me my favorite of course is to forgo the paycheck entirely and get direct deposit   really they 're all just checks although that 's a little disingenuous because banks are often slightly more trusting of paychecks   however this has little to do with it being a paycheck per se and more to do with the fact that they see you getting the same check for roughly the same amount on a regular basis having seen you get a paycheck for the same amount from the same company for the last 12 months there is less risk of the check bouncing or being returned unpaid so you can often get banks to waive their hold policy and just give you the money

in china people are using litecoin and bitcoin to circumvent capital controls are the biggest exchanges of smart money disclaimer this is not advice this is the answer on a question and answer site the exchange rate of smart money is very volatile you will experience very brief exposure to those networks although litecoin is popular for speculation in china bitcoin gives you and your trading partners the most flexibility as the united states does not have robust and liquid exchanges for litecoin only bitcoin you buy smart money on one of the exchanges in china you send all of it to an exchange in the united states you sell all of it on that exchange for usd if it is n't clear smart money 's flexibility comes the fact that it does n't use banks to work exist and can be transferred to valid addresses over the internet   current regulated liquid and fdic insured us exchanges are coinbase and circle other exchanges use private insurance such as and   so in the course of 30 minutes you should have converted all of your funds from yuan back to stable us dollars in a regulated and insured us banking account to make it for goods and services you need to transfer it out of the exchange to a us bank account this has very little exposure to the bitcoin or litecoin network you do n't need any friends or mules for this the chinese government has issued many many on smart money such as litecoin and bitcoin so it is hard to keep up because they have made half efforts to prevent banks from directly servicing those networks while retaining the legality of their operations within china party members have been waiting for ways to get their wealth out of the country too without risk of blowback so you will need to see what hoops you need to jump through to move your funds to one of those exchanges to begin with this is faster and only uses one transaction instead of broken up ones and there are no tax consequences for sending money to yourself

i 'm not gon na act like i invest in real estate but i 'm relatively well read on the subject and have family who invest as well    i think of a house like a stock sort of say you get a mortgage fix up the place and rent it out for 1500 these renters will be covering the mortgage payments each month plus possibly a little bit more you 're not making bank on the $ 100 profit each month on the rent after you pay the mortgage payment you 're making it on appreciation    just like a stock the appreciation is n't realized until you sell it the fastest way to make money in real estate depending on who you ask is to buy a house below market value fix it up a bit rent it out while it appreciates and hopefully sell high    there 's 100 's of other ways to make money in real estate but that 's the gist of how a lot of people do it hope this helps

much information comes from this source your tags say you are in new york new york security deposit law requires that you store the security deposit in a banking institution additionally the deposit must be stored in a separate account not your own personal account if the lease is for six months or more the money must be stored in an interest bearing account though this is apparently not necessary if the property has fewer than six units investing the money in e.g. a mutual fund would probably be illegal and would be a bad idea anyway if your investment turns out not to be profitable you 'd have to make up the difference security deposits are meant to be deposits not investments besides you have to pay interest on the deposit to your tenant any interest over 1 must be given back to the tenant

degree of operating leverage dol measures the percent change in ebit given a 1 change in revenue in other words if dol is 1.5 then increasing revenue by 1 will increase ebit by 1.5   degree of financial leverage measures the percent change in ni given a 1 change in ebit   degree of total leverage cuts ebit out and measures the percent change in ni given a 1 change in revenue    what all three of these numbers measure is elasticity the elasticity between two variables is always the percentage change effect on one due to a 1 change in the other    before we talk about why you would multiply let ’s first just look at absolute changes between a change of three variables x y and z. lets say x impacts y and y impacts z to make it even more concrete let ’s imagine a classroom where every student is required to have 2 books and every book has 100 pages so x = students y = of books and z = of pages if we add one student to the class we need to add 2 books if we add 1 book to the class we have added 100 pages with absolute changes like this it is obvious that we do n’t add we multiply in other words to directly see the impact of a new student on the number of pages x -&gt z we would say 1 student -&gt 2 books -&gt 200 pages to say 102 pages would obviously be silly    for percent changes this looks pretty similar to make it easy say the class has 100 students so adding 1 student is a 1 change then we go from 200 books to 202 books a 1 change so the degree of student to book leverage is 1 which make sense there are no fixed pages we go from 20,000 pages to pages also a 1 change so the degree of book to page leverage is also 1 thus the student to page leverage is also just a flat 1    let ’s add fixed amounts the teacher has a single 2,000 page book on how to teach we ’ll assume the class has 20 students so we start with 20 2 + 1 = 41 books and 40 100 + 2,000 = 6,000 pages let ’s add a student we have a -1 = 4 increase in students -1 = increase in books 1 = 3.33 increase in pages so the degree of student to book leverage is = and the degree of book to page leverage is = and the direct student to page leverage is = 1.20 again note that here it would be silly to add the degrees of leverage and when we do multiply them we get = 1.2 the right answer    from here the application to ebit = sales fixed cost variable cost = gross margin sales fixed cost and the application to eps = ebit interest taxes = 1 tax interest should be obvious i can supply the full proof mathematically however if you would like

50 dollars euros is a very small amount to invest the first time i ever bought stock i picked a winner it went up by about 40 in the first few months i sold it and lost money how i only bought 10 shares at $ 7.50 each the profit was less than the two commissions for buying and selling about $ 17 a piece if you are thinking of buying individual stocks you simply need to save up more money before it will be practical if you are not trying to beat the market which is probably not something an amateur like you or i should attempt then you should consider low cost index funds i have money in mutual funds some of which have as low as a $ 100 minimum investment i have moved entirely away from picking stocks it was a good experience and i could afford to lose the money but as a long term strategy it just was not working for me note this is coming from an american if this somehow does not apply in europe

it appears that usury has always been a bit of a sticking point for the catholic church ever since the first council of it was officially the position of the church that charging usury was a sin it was n't until the rise of napoleon and his implementation of the code that moved usury into wider acceptance pope essentially said that usury was now in the realm of the state and not a concern of the church however the church itself was unable to invest in interest bearing securities until the code of canon law was updated in 1917 to allow the church to engage in interest bearing investments however there seems to be a renewed push within the holy see essentially the governing body for to push back against some tenets of capitalism so it 's not so much that the church has ever the use usury but just let it kind of slide into a grey area some religions like islam still forbid the use usury which leads to a special type of banking called islamic banking   source

you 're on the right track with buying but letting your current cars get repossessed is a bad idea for the reasons you specified first find an insurance broker instead of an insurance agent a broker works with dozens of companies many of which you may not have heard of he is in a better position to find you the best deal than you are because he is familiar with more insurance company products than you are he does n't charge you extra for this service second ask your insurance broker if he can find any insurers offering discounts for persons who have passed a driver training course find an accredited course and determine pricing if the savings exceed the cost of the course take the course   third if you have outstanding loans on your vehicles pay them off and sell the cars replace them with vehicles you can purchase outright with cash make sure you have enough money to replace them again should another accident happen    once you have vehicles that are free there is no longer a requirement by the lender for you to have insurance for the replacement value of the vehicle which is what 's killing your rates right now find out what the minimum legal requirement for auto insurance is in your state in canada the minimum requirement is $ 100,000 liability anything else is either a sales job or a lender requirement getting your wife to insure her own vehicle may help getting your insurance under her name may also be something to look into since you seem to have issues with people bumping into you and there have been no medical issues $ 100,000 liability may be all you need note tactic 3 is not without risk if you are in an at fault accident you will have to pay for any damages exceeding your insured limit out of your own pocket any damages to your own vehicle whether at fault or not will have to be paid out of your own pocket if you are sued for medical expenses incurred by other parties you 'll have to pay anything over and above your insured limit out of your own pocket   if there is anything you are unclear about on your insurance policy ask your agent broker to explain until you do understand buying auto insurance without fully understanding what you are paying for is another risk

yes there are times when co signing is the right choice one is when you know more about the person than the loan issuer does consider a young person who has just started working in a volatile field the kind of job where you can be told on friday that you only get one shift next week but things might pick up the week after and who makes maybe $ 12 an hour in that job you 've done the math and with 40 hour weeks they can easily afford the loan furthermore you know this person well and you know that after a few weeks of not enough shifts they 've got the to go out and find a second job or a different job that will give them 40 hours or more a week and you know that they have some savings they could use to ensure that no payments will be missed even on low wage weeks you can cosign for this person say for a car loan to get them a car they can drive to that job knowing that they are n't going to walk away and just stop making the payments the loan issuer does n't know any of that   or consider a young person with poor credit but good income who has recently decided to get smart about money has written out a budget and a plan to their credit and who you know will work passionately to make every payment and get the credit score up to a place where they can buy a house or whatever their goal is again you can cosign for this person to make that happen because you know something the lender does n't or consider a middle aged person who 's had some very hard knocks laid off in a plant closing perhaps marriage failure lost all their house equity when the market collapsed that sort of thing they have a chance to start over again somewhere else and you have a chance to help again you know this is n't someone who is going to their money and walk away from the payments and leave you holding the bag if you would give the person the money anyway say a car for your newly graduated child then cosigning instead gives them more of a sense of accomplishment since they paid for it and gives them a great credit rating too if you would not give the person the entire loan amount but would make their payments for many months or even a year say your brother 's mortgage for the house where he lives with a sick wife and 3 small children then cosigning is only making official what you would have done anyway   arrange with the borrower that if they ca n't make their payments any more you will backstop them and the item car house whatever is going up for sale to cover your losses if you do n't think you could enforce that just from the strength of the relationship reconsider co signing then sign what you need to sign and step away from it it 's their loan not yours you want them to pay it and to manage it and to leave you out of it until it 's all paid off and they thank you for your help if things go south you will have to pay and it may take a while for you to sell the item or otherwise stop the paying so you do need to be very confident that the borrower is going to make every single payment on time my point is just that you can have that confidence based on personal knowledge of character employment situation savings and other resources in a way that a lender really can not

in my opinion it depends on the type of product i would get a warranty for a washing machine or tumble dryer or other product with lots of moving parts that is liable to break down i also take into account my luck the one washing machine i did n't get covered broke down 2 weeks outside the normal warranty period i would not get a warranty for a consumer electronics product like a tv pc or ipod because they devalue so quickly as a rule of thumb if the model you buy today is going to be on sale for the next few years for around the same price and has moving parts it is worth considering a warranty if it will be worth a small percentage of its value because newer faster models come along to replace it do n't bother i would also not get the warranty from the shop i bought the product from you can get warranties for consumer products from specialist third parties that will allow you to cover multiple products for a discount these work out a lot cheaper than the one the shop will give you for example in the uk will cover 3 appliances for £ and 6 for £

the first thing to realize is that the type of chart you saw is not appropriate for long term comparisons   the vertical axis uses a linear scale where each unit occupies the same amount of space   this is visually misleading because the relevant information at any point in the chart is how much is the value going up or down and how much change depends on how much the value of the investment is at that moment   for example if you buy something at $ 10 and the price changes $ 1 that is significant 10   if you buy something at $ 1000 and the price changes $ 1 that is not so significant only 0.1   the problem in that chart is that 100 dow points occupy the same space whether the dow is at or to get a better feel for the volatility you should use a log logarithmic scale   google has an option for this   using it shows    in this chart you can see that the volatility appears much less extreme in recent years   true the 2006 2009 change is the largest drop and there might be slightly higher volatility generally but it is not nearly as extreme looking   the drops in 1974 and 1987 can be seen to be significant

you wo n't get a meaningful answer on 1 partially because it 's politically charged and partially because there are too many   unknowns     to begin with the policy itself is not fleshed out   even if it were its impact would be open to debate   lowering the corporate tax rate will be accompanied by closing certain loopholes more companies paying us tax instead of shifting income abroad and it will also impact the level of economic growth   each of those assumptions will have a massive impact on the ultimate effect on the debt

the right answer is use it but use it responsibly the point of the credit report is to prove to potential creditors that you are a responsible person who pays their bills on time if you do n't use the new credit card you ca n't prove that however of course there is a limit if you max out the card you have only proven that you are irresponsible with credit try to stay around 50 of your max limit more is but never go over 89 always pay your bills on time always not just this new credit card but all bills the best way to ruin your credit is not paying your bills even if you are having a dispute with a company pay the bill anyway to save your credit and then dispute the situation and try to get your money back prove to creditors that they can trust you and you 'll have an excellent credit score

is my understanding okay if so it seems to me that this system is    rather error prone by that i mean i could easily forget to make a    wire some day and be charged interests while i actually have more than    enough money on the check account to pay the debt which is where the credit card company can add fees so you pay more and they make more money do n't forget that in the credit case you are borrowing money rather than using your own another thing that bothers me is that the credit card apparently has a    rather low credit limit if i wanted to buy something that costs $ 2500    but only have a credit limit of $ 1500 can i make a wire    from my check account to the visa account to avoid facing the limit    if so what is the point for the customer of having two accounts and    two cards for that matter if you were the credit card company do you believe people should be given large limits first there are prepaid credit cards where you could put a dollar amount on and it would reject if the balance gets low enough prepaid mastercard would be an example here that i received one last year as i was involved in the floods in my area and needed access to government assistance which was given this way part of the point of building up a credit history is that this is part of how one can get the credit limits increased on cards so that one can have a higher limit after demonstrating that they will pay it back and otherwise the system could be abused there may be a risk that if you prepay onto a credit card and then want to take back the money that there may be fees involved in the transaction generally with credit cards the company makes money on the fees involved for transactions which may come from merchants or yourself as a cash advance on a credit card will be charged interest right away while if you buy merchandise in a store there may not be the interest charged right away

i think the question as worded has some incorrect assumptions built into it but let me try to hit the key answers that i think might help your broker ca n't really do anything here    your broker does n't own the calls you sold and ca n't elect to exercise someone else 's calls your broker can take action to liquidate positions when you are in margin calls but the scenario you describe would n't generate them   if you are long stock and short calls the calls are covered and have no margin requirement   the stock is the only collateral you need and you can have the position on in a cash non margin account    so assuming you have n't bought other things on margin that have gone south and are generating calls your broker has no right to do anything to you if you 're wondering about the other guy meaning the person who is long the calls that you are short they are the one who can impact you by exercising their right to buy the stock from you   in that scenario you make $ 21 your maximum possible return since you bought the stock at $ 100 collected $ 1 premium and sold it for $ 120   but they usually wo n't do that before expiration and they pretty definitely wo n't here   the reason they usually wo n't is that most options trade above their intrinsic value the amount that they 're in the money     in your example the options are n't in the money at all    the stock is trading at 120 and the option gives the owner the right to buy at 120 put another way exercising the option lets the owner buy the stock for the exact same price anyone with no options can in the market   so if the call has any value whatsoever exercising it is irrational the owner would be better off selling the call and buying the stock in the market

you must mean the current debt ceiling debacle the meaning of it is us government is constantly borrowing money by issuing treasury bonds and constantly repaying some of the bonds that come to maturity and also has other obligations it has to meet by law all the time such as social security checks bonds interest federal employees salaries and pensions etc by law total amount of money that can be borrowed at the same time is capped that means there can be situation where the government needs to borrow money to pay say interest on existing bonds but can not since the limit is reached such situation is called a default since the government promised to pay the interest but is unable to do so that does not mean the government has no money at all and will completely collapse or could n't raise money on the market if it were permitted by law to do so currently the market is completely willing to buy the debt issued by us government and with interest that is not very high though of course that may change it also does not mean the economy ceases to function dollars cease to have value or banks instantly go bankrupt but if the government breaks its promises to investors it has various consequences such as raising the costs of borrowing in the future breaking promises to other people like social security recipients would also look bad and probably hurt many of them going back to your bank account most probably nothing would happen to the money you store there even if the bank had invested 100 of the money in us treasury bonds which does n't really happen they still can be sold on the open market even if with some discount in the event of credit rating downgrade so most probably your account would not be affected as stated in another answer even if the fallout of all these causes a bank to fail there 's fdic and if your money is under insured maximums you 'll be getting your money back but if your bank is one of the big ones nothing of the sort would happen anyway as we have seen in the past years government would do practically anything to not allow any big bank failures

some people believe that inflation is caused by an increase in the money supply when the banks engage in fractional reserve lending is this correct you are referring to the austrian school of thought the austrians define inflation in terms of money supply in other words inflation is defined as an increase in the aggregate money supply even if prices stay the same of fall this is not the only definition of inflation the mainstream defines inflation as a general increase in the prices of consumer goods based on the first definition then your supposition is correct by definition based on the second definition you can make a case that money supply affects prices but keep in mind it 's just one factor affecting prices furthermore economics is resistant to so it is difficult to establish causality austrian economists tend to approach the problem of proof using a tactic establish by explaining the mechanism then look for historical evidence to back up that explanation as i understand it when there is more available money in the market the price of goods will increase but will a normal merchant acknowledge the increase of money supply and raise prices immediately i posit that in the short run merchants wo n't increase prices in response to increased money supply so why does increased money supply lead to price inflation the simple answer in the austrian school of thought is that you have more money chasing the same amount of goods in other words printing money does n't actually increase the number of widgets made i believe the austrian school is consistent with your supposition that prices do n't increase in the short run in other words producers do n't increase prices immediately after observing an increase in the money supply specifically after the banks print more notes where will the money be distributed first   the austrian story goes as follows imagine that the first borrower is a home and he is borrowing freshly printed money to build new homes this will need to buy materials and hire labor to build homes and in doing so he will bid against other home the increased demand for lumber nails tools carpentry etc will ever so slightly increase the market prices for these goods and services so the money goes first to the borrower but then flows also to the people selling to the borrower and the people selling to the sellers etc it has a ripple effect who will be the first one to have a need to rise their price these producers wo n't need to increase their price but they will choose to do so if the believe that demand outstrips supply in other words if you have more orders than you can fill then you may post higher prices because you think consumers will tolerate the higher price   you might object that competition any one producer from unilaterally raising prices but in fact if all producers are failing to keep up with demand then you can unilaterally raise prices because other producers do n't have any excess inventory to undercut you with

remind yourself that markets recover usually within a few years if you believe this and can remind yourself of this you will be able to see the down cycles of the market as an opportunity to buy stock on sale no one knows the future so many people have found investing on a regular schedule to be helpful by putting in the same amount of money each period you will end up buying fewer shares when the market is up and more when it is down as long as your time horizon is appropriate you should be able to wait out the ups and downs stocks are volatile by their very nature so if you find that you are very concerned by this you might want to consider whether you should adjust the amount of risk in your investments since over time most people lose money by trying to time the market however if your investment goals and requirements have n't changed there likely is n't any need to change the types of assets you are investing in as what you are choosing to invest in should depend on your personal situation edit i am assuming you want to be a long term investor and owner making money by owning a portion of companies profits and not by trading stocks and/or speculation

they do but you 're missing some calculations needed to gain an understanding intro to stock index weighting methods notes in part market cap is the most common weighting method used by an index    market cap or market capitalization is the standard way to measure the    size of the company you might have heard of large mid or small cap    stocks large cap stocks carry a higher weighting in this index and    most of the major indices like the s&p 500 use the market cap    weighting method stocks are weighted by the proportion of their market cap to the total    market cap of all the stocks in the index as a stock ’s price and    market cap rises it gains a bigger weighting in the index in turn    the opposite lower stock price and market cap pushes its weighting    down in the index   pros proponents argue that large companies have a bigger effect on the    economy and are more widely owned so they should have a bigger    representation when measuring the performance of the market which is    true cons it does n’t make sense as an investment strategy according to a market    cap weighted index investors would buy more of a stock as its price    rises and sell the stock as the price falls this is the exact    opposite of the buy low sell high mentality investors should use eventually you would have more money in overpriced stocks and less in    underpriced stocks yet most index funds follow this weighting method thus there was likely a point in time where the s p 500 's initial sum was equated to a specific value though this is the part you may be missing here also how do you handle when constituents change over time for example suppose in the s p 500 that a $ 100,000,000 company is taken out and replaced with a $ company that should n't suddenly make the index jump by a bunch of points because the underlying security was swapped or would you be cool with there being jumps when companies change or shares outstanding are rebalanced consider carefully how you answer that question in terms of histories dow jones industrial average and s p 500 index would be covered on wikipedia where from the latter link the composite as the s&p 500 was first called when it    introduced its first stock index in began tracking a small    number of stocks three years later in 1926 the composite index    expanded to 90 stocks and then in 1957 it expanded to its current    standard poor 's a company that out financial information and analysis was founded in 1860 by henry poor in    poor 's publishing henry poor 's original company merged    with standard statistics founded in as the standard statistics    bureau and therein assumed the name standard and poor 's corporation    the s&p 500 index in its present form began on march 4 1957    technology has allowed the index to be calculated and in    real time the s&p 500 is widely used as a measure of the general    level of stock prices as it includes both growth stocks and value    stocks in september 1962 systems corp. entered into an agreement    with standard and poor 's under the terms of this agreement    computed the s&p 500 stock composite index the stock industrial    index the 50 stock utility index and the 25 stock rail index    throughout the market day these statistics were furnished to standard    poor 's in addition also computed and reported the 94 s&p    sub there are also articles like business insider that have this graphic that may be interesting s p changes over the years the makeup of the s&p 500 is constantly changing notes in part in most years 25 to 30 stocks in the s&p 500 are replaced said    david s&p 's chairman of the index committee and while there    are strict guidelines for what companies are added the final decision    and timing of that decision depends on what 's going through the heads    of a handful of people employed by dow jones

there has been an abundance of articles in recent years which make it fairly clear that many participants in the social security especially those who have started contributing recently and going forward from will experience negative rates of return in other words they will put in more than they will get out some examples of such articles time magazine but it is now official social security is a lousy investment for the    average worker people retiring today will be among the first    generation of workers to pay more in social security taxes than they    receive in benefits over the course of their lives according to a new    analysis by the associated press that ap piece referenced by time people retiring today are part of the first generation of workers who    have paid more in social security taxes during their careers than they    will receive in benefits after they retire it 's a historic shift that    will only get worse for future retirees according to an analysis by    the associated press a piece which appeared in includes a helpful graphic summary   10 myths about social security myth 4 social security is a good deal for today ’s if    there were no reduction in benefits or increase in taxes an    impossibility given social security ’s looming financing    shortfalls social security is an extremely bad investment for most    young workers in fact according to a study by the nonpartisan tax    foundation most young workers will actually receive a negative return    on their social security they will get less in benefits than    they paid in taxes some studies indicate that a year old    two earner couple with average income will lose as much as $    that actual loss does not even consider the opportunity cost what    workers might have earned if they had been able to invest their taxes    in real assets that yield a positive return in fact a study by    financial analyst william demonstrates that if a 25-year old    worker were able to privately invest the money he or she currently    pays in social security taxes the worker would receive retirement    benefits three to six times higher than under social security has that answered your question

specific stock advice is n't permitted on these boards i 'm discussing the process of a call spread with the apple jan 13 calls as an example   in effect you have $ 10 to bet each bet you 'd construct offers a different return odds for example if you bought the $ 750 call at $ you 'd need to look to find what strike has a bid of $ 27 or higher the $ is bid $ so this particular spread is a 4 to 1 bet the stock will close in january over $ with a $ 760 break even   you can pull the number from yahoo to a spreadsheet to make your own chart of spread costs but i 'll give one more example   you think it will go over $ 850 and that strike is now ask $ the highest strike currently listed is $ and it 's bid $ so this spread cost is $ 850 and a close over $ returns $ 8000 or over 9 to 1   again this is not advice just an analysis of how spreads work note any anomalies in the pricing above is the effect of a particular strike having no trades today not every strike is active so last trade can be days old    note my answer adds to 's response in that once you used the word bet and showed a desire to make a risky move options are the answer you acknowledged you understand the basic concept but given the contract size of 100 shares these suggestions are ways to bet under your $ 1000 limit and profit from the gain in the underlying stock you hope to see

i think the issue is that you 're looking for it to be a standalone platform    soundcloud for a long time has been unique in what it offers compared to other music streaming platforms it 's not primarily meant for the end user but more so as a platform for artists to host their music it 's been the place to listen to new up and coming tons of producers and even band demos who knows how many artists have gotten their start from soundcloud not as an end all music streaming library like spotify   i guess it comes down to the user but for people who love to dig for new stuff nothing compares to soundcloud

by mentioning gld i presume therefore you are referring to the gold exchange traded fund that is intended to mirror the price of gold without you having to personally hold bullion or even gold certificates while how much is a distinctly personal choice there are seemingly at least three camps of people in the investment world first would be traditional bond fixed income and equity people   gold would play no direct role in their portfolio other than perhaps holding gold company shares in some other vehicle but they would not hold much gold directly secondly at the mid range would be someone like yourself that believes that is in and of itself a worthy investment and makes it a non trivial but not overriding part of their portfolio   your 5 10 range seems to fit in well here lastly and to my taste over the top are the gold gold gold investors that seem to believe it is the panacea for all market woes   i always suspect that investment gurus that are pushing this however have large positions that they are trying to run up so they can unload given all this i am not aware of any general rule about gold but anything less than 10 would seem like at least a not over concentration in the one area   once any one holding gets much beyond that you should really examine why you believe that it should represent such a large part of your holdings good luck

the catch with any exchange service is that you 're going to involve some sort of business and they 're going to want to get paid for their service these services all come with their own exchange rates fees waiting periods or requirements to even use said service commonly pros towards one of those comes at the cost of e.g. fast transfers have higher fees or worse exchange rates over the past few months i needed a service and ended up using since you 're going from cad to usd you 'd likely need to use pros   cons   overall this option was far better than the $ i was quoted from or the $ 25.00 i was quoted from bmo harris which would have required i open a saving account with them i was n't provided a clean exchange rate between these two to know how all three compared the only bit of advice i can say with any service is compare exchange rates if you 're transferring more than a few hundred dollars the exchange rate can be seen as a hidden fee when it 's unreasonably low i 'm not affiliated with or by any of the exchange services mentioned

the money never becomes your money it has been paid to you in error your best response is to write to the company who has paid you in error and tell them that for the and subsequent stress caused to you by them putting you in a position of looking after their money you hereby give notice that you are charging them $ 50 per week until such time as they request the repayment of their money keep a dated copy of your letter and if they fail to respond then in 12 weeks they will have to pay you $ 600 to retrieve their $ 600 if they come back to you anytime after that they will owe you money but i would n't push for payment on that one i have successfully used this approach with companies who send unsolicited goods and expect me to mess about returning them if i do n't want them i tell them the weekly fee i am charging them for storage and they quickly make arrangements to either take their goods back or in one case told me to keep them

the simple answer because you believe every other option can yield greater losses so the thinking is lend it to france you 'll get your money back put your money in a bank and there 's a chance you wo n't get it back if the bank goes bust investors also believe that rates will continue to go more negative in which case they will actually make money   it 's a momentum play which will eventually reverse but since the bond market is extremely liquid it 's a bet that can quickly be unwound another theory floating around is that if the weaker countries of the euro leave e.g. greece etc and the core keep the euro then the value of the euro will actually rise so by putting your money in french or german bonds you would also be securing cash in french or german euro 's thinking the on a euro break up

personal finances are not intuitive for everyone and it can be a challenge to know what to do when you have n't been taught   congratulations on recognizing that you need to make a change the first step that i would recommend is what you 've already done assemble your bank statements so you can get an accurate picture of what money you currently have   keep organized folders so you can find your bank statements when you need them in addition to the bank statements for your checking and savings accounts you also need to assess any debt that you have   have you taken out any loans that need to be paid back   do you have any credit card debt   make a list of all your debts and make sure that you have folders for these statements as well hopefully you do n't have any debts   but if you are like most people you owe money to someone and you may even owe more money than you currently have in your bank accounts   if you have debts fixing this problem will be one of your goals no matter what your debt is you need to make sure that from now on you do n't spend more money than you take in as income   to do this you need to make a budget a budget is a plan for spending your money   to get started with a budget make a list of all the income you will receive this month   add it up and write that amount at the top of a page   next you want to make a list of all the expenses you will have this month   some of these expenses are more or less fixed rent utility bills etc   write those down first   some of the expenses you have more control over such as food and entertainment   give yourself some money to spend on each of these   you may also have some larger expenses that will happen in the future such as a tuition or insurance payment   allocate some money to those so that by the time that payment comes around you will have saved enough to pay for those expenses if you find that you do n't have enough income to cover all of your expenses in a month you need to either reduce your expenses somewhere or increase your income until your budget is at a point where you have money left over at the end of each month after you 've gotten to this point the next step is figuring out what to do with that extra money left over   this is where your goals come into play   if you have debt i recommend that one of your first goals is to eliminate that debt as fast as possible   if you have no money saved you should make one of your goals saving some money as an emergency fund   see the question oversimplify it for me the correct order of investing for some ideas on what order you should place your goals doing the budget and tracking all of your spending on paper is possible but many people find that using the right software to help you do this is much easier   i have written before on choosing budgeting software   all of the budgeting software packages i mentioned in that post are from the u.s. but many of them can successfully be used in europe   ynab the program i use even has an unofficial german users community that you might find useful one of the things that budgeting software will help you with is the process of reconciling your bank statements   this is where you go through the bank statement each month and compare it to your own record of spending transactions in your budget   if there are any transactions that appear in the statement that you do n't have recorded you need to figure out why   either it is an expense that you forgot to record or it is a charge that you did not make   record it if it is legitimate or dispute the expense if it is fraudulent for more information look around at some of the questions tagged budget   i also recommend the book the total money makeover by dave ramsey which will provide more help in making a budget and getting out of debt

often buyouts are paid for by the buyer issuing a load of new shares and giving those to the seller to pay them sometimes it could be all shares sometimes all cash or any mix in between if you believe in the future of the buyers business model you 'll often get a load of shares at a discounted rate this way if you do not believe in the buyers future then you 're getting shares that you think may be worth little or nothing some day so cash would be better

and how is that even an argument    so the fed needs to raise rates is what you seem to be saying i 'm not sure that now is the time for that considering the weak jobs numbers recently but it 's possibly a good idea for them to announce that a hike will come soon instead of actually raising the rate    either way to say that having a low interest rate for a decade is a bad thing sort of a harsh reality it 's certainly not something that you want but what 's the alternative would the us have been better off without the feds balance sheet expansion very few economists would say yes    in fact that exact line of thought likely turned a financial crash into the great depression of the 30 's

with every caveat that rick said plus many many more lets have some fun   one common way to measure risk is volatility of returns roughly how much the value of your asset jumps around   interestingly the following ordering is fairly similar for many other common measures of risk the first three on the list would be mostly interchangeable   generally putting your money in cash investments has no real day to day price variability and the main risk is that the bank wo n't give you your money back at the end   money market funds are last as they can break the buck to get a feel for the next few on the list i 'm using previous 360 day volatility numbers for representative broad indices 2014 10 27   while these volatility values can move around quite a bit the order is actually remarkably stable hedge funds might seem out of place here but remember that hedge funds can hold be long and short at the same time and this can cancel out daily variation   however hedge funds do have plenty of risks that may not be well accounted for by this measure    for derivatives i 'll refer to back to rick 's answer this is a measure for broad investment in these categories your particular investment in long term capital management or bonds may vary it is important to note that your return on your investment generally grows as you go toward more risky investments down this list as people generally expect to be rewarded   in the long term for risky investments

there are two different issues that you need to consider and the answers to these two questions are not always the same   the answer to the first is described in some detail in publication 17 available on the irs website in the absence of any details about your situation other than what is in your question e.g. is either salary from self employment wages that you or your spouse is paying you   are you or your spouse eligible to be claimed as a dependent by someone else are you an alien etc   which of the various apply to you can not be determined and so i will not state a specific number or confirm that what you assert in your question is correct   furthermore even if you are not required to file an income tax return you might want to choose to file a tax return anyway the most common reason for this is that if your employer withheld   income tax from your salary and sent it to the irs on your behalf but your tax liability for the year is zero then in the absence of a filed tax return the irs will not refund the tax withheld to you nor will your employer return the   withheld money to you saying oops we made a mistake last year   that money is gone an and non tax deductible gift   from you to the us government so while i am not required to file an income tax return and i refuse to do voluntarily what i am not   required to do   is a very stand to take it can have monetary consequences another reason to file a tax return even when one is not required to do so is to claim the earned income tax credit eitc if you qualify for it as publication 17 says in chapter 36 qualified persons must file a tax return even if you    a do not owe any tax    b did not earn enough money to file a return    or    c did not have income taxes withheld from your pay in order to claim the credit in short read publication 17 for yourself and decide whether you are required to file an income tax return and if you are not whether it is worth your while to file the tax return anyway note to readers preparing to down vote this answer is and says things that are far too well known to everybody and especially to you but please remember that they might not be quite so well known to the op

i admit in the long term there are a good number of to work out but in the end i want to see some system where people in general can seize the means to their own well being without stepping on one another   the management you talked about is another reason why i prefer worker co ops to be the optimum form of issuing business because its not just a few people in charge it 's a whole social group acting in     when you discuss the mom and pop store having no suppliers it would be good to promote some way of each money supply to have a share of each industry within it   there are always some people in every trade looking for their next job   they just have to find a supply where there trade is in demand   the process is self feeding   next off or course the mechanism of the system would work in a way that firm 's ca n't just pay themselves with their own debt they have to issue it to their creditors first and even then it 's practically impossible to accept your own debt as payment   you would have to take some from a competitor at best     what i 've been trying to do is find some system where no one institution or no one alliance holds the keys to the definition of value   if you have five to eight dictators fighting at once as opposed to one financial dictator who can oversee all like the fed scenario you just described it 's more possible for people who are freer relatively to survive freely between the borders of these of influence as they can play each dictator off the other   at least from your dialogue i can see you 're one of those who gets what i 'm trying to aim for     here 's another idea i 've explored with it that 's similar but may make the environment slightly different so let me know what you think   what i call the revolving tax window where the government accepts different both in quantity and specific of notes in intervals of every business quarter so that the demand for specific notes changes four times a year   from january until the end of march they could accept taxes in notes from firms a f h and t and for april into june it could be just b and s and so on   the options for note issuing could be set on a list of firms registered with the sec or whoever    the combination for the quarter could be picked at random by a algorithm so no firm could make a plan to be a market dictator and a sense of is maintained in the economy     obviously the more firms are properly registered on this list the more combinations of monetary combinations you have and the more power is distributed from too much control by anybody     what you can do is choose whether or not you want there to be less or more notes in the next quarter because just like fiscal policy and conventional monetary policy the extremes have trade offs but different ones to few currencies the economy may be stimulated but you get market dictators via monetary oligopoly even if temporary   too many you avoid market dictators who will be more focused on getting a real return by investing in competing ventures based on what will actually return investment but the economy may not be as stimulated   what do you think of this structural alternative   one of the sources i 've been building my economic policy on has been debt the first 5,000 years by david if anyone 's familiar

technical people on reddit who have dealt with oracle or similar web sites amp systems myself included seem to believe that oregon 's claims come down to whether it was oracle or the state government who was worse at planning the creation and maintenance of oregon 's healthcare web site   i tend to think that government entities are often worse at managing amp planning things and therefore believe that oracle would be less likely to blame but this does n't necessarily mean that all of the more than dozen claims for damages will all be thrown out either   one key claim is that oracle asserted that of the web site 's functionality would work out of the box thus leaving only 5 of the web site 's functionality requiring third party potentially custom integration   the burden is on oregon to prove that the failures of the web site were the result of more than that 5 and that oracle was contractually obligated to fix issues with the at no additional charge   failure to prove that would result in oracle being justified in asking for more $ to fix the web site such that the alleged and much of the fraud did not actually take place

the apartment complex is satisfied because they have a clear company to go to in case of a problem   however this has nothing at all to do with your belongings renters insurance will cover the people listed on the policy   if you are n't listed then you and your stuff is n't covered    this would imply that the simple fix is to have you listed on her policy   however there are additional concerns   namely that you are n't married   let 's take a worst case scenario she initially puts you on the policy then later you guys get into a fight because you with her girlfriend   she calls the company drops you off the policy and at some no doubt point sets your clothes the tv and whatever else you own on fire in your parking space probably a bit drastic hopefully you were n't wearing those clothes at the time   point is you are n't covered   sure you could sue her but then it just gets even more messy it 's better for you to acquire your own policy   as she has her own you would n't need to include her   once are tied if ever then consolidate   however you two break it off then well this is one less thing to worry about

can i use the foreign earned income exclusion in my situation only partially since the days you spent in the us should be excluded you 'll have to prorate your exclusion limit and only apply it to the income earned while not in the us if not how should i go about this to avoid being doubly taxed for    2014 the amounts you can not exclude are taxable in the us and you can use a portion of your norwegian tax to offset the us tax liability use form 1116 for that form 1116 with form on the same return will require some arithmetic exercises but there are worksheets for that in the instructions in addition us norwegian treaty may come into play so check that out it may help you reduce the tax liability in the us or claim credit on the us taxes in norway it seems that norway has a bilateral tax treaty with the us that if    i 'm reading it correctly seems to indicate that visiting researchers    to universities which really seems like i would qualify as should    not be taxed by either country for the duration of their stay the relevant portion of the treaty is article 16 article allows you $ 5000 exemption for up to a year stay in the us for your salary from the norwegian school you will still be taxed in norway to claim the treaty benefit you need to attach form to your tax return and deduct the appropriate amount on line 21 of your form 1040 however since you 're a us citizen that article does n't apply to you see the savings clause in the article 22 i did n't even give a thought to state taxes those should only apply    to income sourced from the state i lived in right aka $ 0 i do n't know what state you were in so hard to say but yes the state you were in is the one to tax you note that the tax treaty between norway and the us is between norway and the federal government and does n't apply to states so the income you earned while in the us will be taxable by the state you were at and you 'll need to file a non resident return there if that state has income taxes not all do

note i am making a usa assumption here keep in mind this answer does n't necessarily apply to all countries or even states in the usa   you asked two questions i 'm looking to buy a property i do not want to take a risk on this    property its sole purpose is to provide me with a place to live how    would i go about hedging against increasing interest rates to counter    the increasing mortgage costs to counter increasing interest rates obtaining a fixed interest rate on a mortgage is the answer if that 's available   as far as costs for a mortgage that depends as mortgages are tied to the value of the property home   if you want a place to live a piece of property and want to hedge against possible rising interest rates a fixed mortgage would work for these goals ideally i 'd like to not lose money on my property seeing as i will be    borrowing 95 of the property 's value so i 'd like to hedge against    interest rates and falling property prices in order to have a risk    neutral position on my property now we have a different issue   for instance if someone had opened a fixed mortgage on a home for $ 500,000 and the housing value plummeted 50 or more the person may still have a fixed interest rate protecting the person from higher rates but that does n't protect the property value   in addition to that if the person needed to move for a job that person would face a difficult choice move and sell at a loss or move and rent and face some complications renting is generally a good idea for people who 1 have not determined if they 'll be in an area for more than 5 10 years 2 want the flexibility to move if their living costs rises which may be an issue if they lose wages 3 do n't want to pay property taxes varies by state homeowner 's insurance or maintenance costs 4 enjoy regular negotiation something which renters can do before re signing a lease or looking for a new place to live   again other conditions can apply to people who favor renting such as someone might enjoy living in one room out of a house rather than a full apartment or a person who likes a change of scenes and moves from one apartment to another for a fresh perspective but these are smaller exceptions but with renting you have nothing to re sell and no financial asset so far as a property is concerned thus why some real estate agents refer to it as throwing away money which is n't necessarily true but one should be aware that the money they invest in renting does n't go into an asset that can be re sold

i do n't buy the house prices will always increase due to the increased cost of raw materials argument in a lot of countries you will find that the cost of a property is substantially lower than its perceived sale value if it was n't there would be no incentive for developers to take the risk of buying the land and building houses on it say the cost of building the house is 50 of the sale price which might already be generous materials probably account for half of the building cost so you 've got 25 tail 75 dog i 'd start to worry if people buy property as a get rich quick scheme which seems to be what you 're describing

a credit card is essentially a contract where they will loan you money in an on demand basis   it is not a contract for you to loan them money the money that you have overpaid is generally treated as if it is a payment for a charge that you have made that has not been processed yet   the bank can not treat that money as a deposit and thus leverage it make money them selves you can open an account and get a debit card   this would allow you to accrue interest for your deposit while using your money   but if you find one willing to pay you 25 interest please share with the rest of us

the nature of this question finding a financial adviser can make it a conundrum those who have little financial experience are often in the greatest need of a financial adviser and at the same time are the least qualified to select one i 'm not putting you or anyone in particular in this category and of course it 's a sliding scale in general the more capable you are of running your own finances the more prepared you are to answer this question with that said i would recommend backing up half a step consider advisers other than strictly fee only advisers perhaps you have already considered this decision but perhaps others reading this have not my ameriprise adviser charges a monthly fee but also gets percentage based portions of certain investments based on a $ rate that amounts to four hours per year does he spend four hours per year on my account well so far he does ~2 yrs but that is determined primarily by how much interaction i choose to have with him i suppose i could spend more time asking him questions and less time on this forum :p i have never fully understood the towards fee based advisers on principle i guess the theory is they are not making biased decisions about your investments because they do n't have as much of a stake in how well your investments to do i do n't necessarily see that as an advantage it seems they would have less of an incentive to ensure the growth of your investments although if you 're nearing retirement then growth is n't your biggest concern perhaps a fee based adviser makes more sense in that scenario whatever pay structure your adviser uses it would seem to make sense to consider a successful adviser with a good client base this implies that the adviser knows what he she is doing but it could also just be a sign that they are good at marketing themselves if your adviser has a good base of wealthy clients then choosing a strictly fee based adviser would mitigate the risk of your adviser having less incentive to consider your portfolio vs that of more wealthy clients to more directly answer your question i suggest asking several of your adviser candidates for advice on choosing an adviser i suspect you will get some good advice as well as good insight on the integrity and honesty of the adviser
# 582507
what you are saying is a very valid concern   after the flash crash many institutions in the us replaced true market orders where tag and has no price with deep in the money limit orders under the hood after the cftc sec joint advisory commission raised concerns about the use of market orders in the case of large hft traders and concerns on the lack of liquidity that caused market orders that found no limit orders to execute on the other side of the trade driving the prices of blue chip stocks into the pennies   we also applaud the cftc requesting comment regarding whether it is    appropriate to restrict large order execution design that results in    disruptive trading in particular we believe there are questions    whether it is ever appropriate to permit large order algorithms that    employ unlimited use of market orders or that permit at    prices which are a dramatic percentage below the present market price    without a pause for human review so although you still see a market order on the front end it is transformed to a very aggressive limit in the back end however doing this change manually by selling at price 0 or buying at may backfire since it may trigger fat finger checks and prevent your order from reaching the market   for example bats exchange   rejects orders that are priced too aggressively and do n't comply with the range of valid prices   if you want your trade to execute right now and you are willing to take slippage in order to get fast execution sending a market order is still the best alternative

this is only true for countries where we do n't have a tax treaty if we have a tax treaty with the country then you would get foreign tax credits if you repatriated the money the reason us corporates do this is because us corporate tax rate is the second highest effective rate in the world at ~40 depending on the state you 're in    so if they want to repatriated cash from canada they 'd repatriate at the us rate and then receive foreign tax credits for the amount they paid in canadian taxes on balance they 'll have just paid the us rate

account statements and the account information provided by your personal finance software should be coming from the same source namely your bank 's internal accounting records so in theory one is just as good as the other that being said an account statement is a snapshot of your account on the date the statement was created while with your personal finance application is dynamically generated upon request usually once a day or upon login   so what are the implications of this your account statement will not show transactions that may have taken place during that period but were n't posted until after the period ended common with credit card transactions and checks instead they 'd appear on the next statement because electronic account are more frequent and not limited to a specific time period those transactions will show up shortly after they are posted so it is far easier to keep track of your accounts electronically every personal finance software i 've ever used supports manual entries so what i like to do is on a daily basis i manually enter any transaction which was n't posted automatically this usually only takes a few minutes each evening then when the transaction eventually shows up it 's usually reconciled with my manually entered one automatically   aside from finding infrequent bank errors this has the benefit of keeping me aware of how much i 'm spending and how much i have left i 've also caught a number of cashier errors this way noticing i was double charged for an item while entering the receipt total and its the best defense against fraud and identity theft i can think of if you 're looking at your accounts on a daily basis you 're far more likely to notice an unusual transaction than any monitoring service

hold on a moment you were getting 5 7.5 commission on a product that only had a 40 gross margin   that 's amazingly high   really   considering that you are saying that the cost of goods sold for a typical tv is 60 which sounds close enough to be realistic my business is typically about 56 cogs and then add to that the overhead of base salary utilities leasehold and leasehold improvements taxes operating costs   sears was probably making a final total of about 2 net margin on that tv sale which is n't particular great     getting paid a commission that high on commodity goods is really quite good

the implication is market irrationality is stronger than market rationality aka nothing makes sense when tsla climbs to $ 400 or when cmg rises to $ 750    i would n't say there is a systematic flaw in valuation i think there is just a lot of ignorance markets are more open to household investors than ever before you used to go to your broker and ask him what 's up and he 'd give you the inside scoop since you pay them money now you go onto marketwatch and get some random nobody 's opinion on everything and make stock selections based on that    but eventually the chickens come home to roost and things will correct itself big players will jump ship and cause signals to other traders to jump ship the public can pump stocks up pretty high but it does n't just go to infinity eventually someone will stop and say wtf is going on and start selling stocks are sold on a basis of a limit order book so it 's real prices that people are paying people do n't care about prices currently because most do n't have any finance knowledge but want to invest their own money   they just hear about tesla doing something amazing from some clickbait article or news outlet and ca n't stop thinking about buying tesla they go to chipotle and think wow this place is so good and hip they must be a great investment    the markets have been filled with more subjective analysis than ever before especially with so much low quality information at your equally ignorant people blogs about investment and personal finance being for other ignorant people in the end they all lose   people who this stock is going up to $ 250 easily with literally zero quantitative analysis or even a baseline reference point to back it up are prime examples of this    ignorance of markets and cheap money almost always lead to market runs that end dot com bubble 1929 market crash 2008 it 's always the same people who have no business taking loans out or buying on margin or leveraging positions with debt only to get fucked over once things are brought back down to earth after 2 runs of qe we now have cheap money and with everyone being a for their personal investment strategy we now also have rampant ignorance    i do n't expect things to last but no one can call the bottom or the top or else you 'd be very very rich have a safe portfolio do n't try to time the markets have a strategy that hedges against unexpected change do n't try to gamble on this change because it 's ultimately impossible to predict the movement of every single person on this earth that invests their money into markets so do n't try just be prepared      to expand further into valuation theory   at the end of the day people invest their money to make more money   it 's as simple as that   if your money does n't grow in an investment vehicle it 's ultimately a shit investment   but no one values intrinsic value of a company 's equity before they decide whether or not $ 380 for tsla is a good bad deal   as a result stocks can be pumped up way higher and people still see the gains on their stocks through capital gains fueled by other optimistic investors    non zero sum goes both ways   people can make shitloads of money on stock without an equitable loser people can also lose shitloads on stock without any real winner emerging from the   when this bubble bursts lots and lots of people will lose money on tsla when people 's expectations become rational and they stop paying $ 300 a share for a negative or 70 pe ratio   it 's insane what people will pay for these companies without even realizing the implication if you buy a share of a company with a pe ratio of 70 you just paid 70 times their earnings for a share   in an ideal world where they released every single penny of earnings as dividends it would take you 70 periods to reclaim your money on that share   this obviously does n't take into account capital gains but capital gains are n't supposed to be this irrational to where a stock can be pumped up into pe ratio in the first place   it 's a whole messed up web of confusion and irrationality and eventually something will a reaction   imagine a market where everyone just agreed to pump up a single stock to infinity and everyone just in shitloads of money   would this work   of course not   it 's literally a pyramid scheme that relies on future generations to constantly inject capital no real value is being created by this scheme   it requires constantly more future generations to continue adding money into the scheme and will crash once people stop pumping money into it   the same thing will happen here   everyone agreed to pump up tsla in a sense but eventually people will realize this is stupid as shit and the pyramid will come down because there is nothing they receive from this scheme other than the money from other people   it 's essentially moving money around making 0 use of it until people stop pumping money into the system and everyone realizes that nothing of real value had been produced through the use of this money   ultimately the only thing that creates real value is the money that is returned to shareholders from an outside party the company you 're invested in   real value is not created when people exchange stock and money   so why do these transactions create higher values in equity   the basis of equity valuation states that dividends are the only way for companies to raise the price of their stock going off the traditional dividend discount model   and theoretically that 's the only logical explanation   buying and trading stock does nothing for the company minus t stock they might own   ultimately the only party creating real value is the underlying company   if they are n't creating real value then their stock should not be increasing period   the way they create value is by efficiently utilizing assets to generate returns on investment which can be returned to investors through dividends   dividends can only be increased while maintaining an equitable payout ratio by generating more net income that can increase the actual pool of money that can be allocated back to investors   tsla does not do this   tsla regularly loses money and   there is no logical explanation for any of this except that everyone is irrational     obviously theory is not the same as in practice but the theory is important here because it 's really the basis for any investment at all   at the end of the day a share of stock is the right to a share of the company 's equity   people own equity in companies because companies generate money that it returns back to its owners   that 's what a company does   that 's what an owner does   if you own shares of a company you 're an owner   and if your company does not return more money back to you yoy then why are you invested in them     ultimately you 're riding a capital gains wave that will eventually once market irrationality to rationality   and it always does because the real value always catches up to the fake value that is caused by pumping and dumping stocks

you 're making $ 100k together per year you 're not in the hole you 're in the top 25 of all households and the top 10 of non family households as yours would be   to be blunt you 're not in the rely on assistance area you 're in the save up for your downpayment sector my suggestion would be to figure out a way to save more than $ a month for now   $ 100k gross income means you have about $ 8k net income per month $ 2k for rent and other necessities means you have $ 6k per month that you can potentially save   even half of that $ 3k per month means you have $ saved by the end of this year and $ on an annual basis as far as marriage or domestic partnership i would n't get into one based on whether it helps you afford a home   it might be a good idea because it helps you handle some of the details arising when you have joint property perhaps but not solely for the financial aspect and as far as how much home is realistic   $ 250k is certainly realistic if you can save up enough for a good down payment   try to get to the 20 25 range   if you 're already halfway there another year of renting wo n't kill you and it will mean no pmi and much better rates    also consider a 15 year mortgage we 're in the same general income category as you and manage a 15 year on a $ 250k range house quite nicely   it does n't add all that much to your monthly payment amount compared to what you 'd expect particularly since the monthly payment includes property taxes which wo n't increase based on the length of the mortgage now that we have actual numbers from the op so without cutting anything you have $ 2k yourself you can be saving   this assumes your rent number of $ is your portion of rent and not the 100 amount   that 's $ per year just by yourself   on top of that you 've got another $ 40k or so coming from your partner at least some of which should be available as well if he she is going to be co owning   but if not at least you have about $ 2000 a month you can be saving   you could also downsize the car cut cable tv downsize the phone and have another $ 500 or so available but it does n't really look like you need to do that given how much you have available now i 'd look at what you 're doing with that per month right now and see how you can free most of it up   you have n't mentioned a few things like utilities not sure if that 's just or if your partner is paying them so perhaps not all of it is available   but even $ 1000 a month is $ 12000 to add to the $ 20000 you have now which makes a big dent in that down payment

because a wire transfer requires the individual bank to bank process it is usually more expensive than an automated clearing house which requires minimal involvement by individuals at financial institutions many ach transactions come with only a small fee or even no fee at all since they are run with more efficiency however if you want a better guarantee that your money will arrive on time it might be worth it to pay the wire transfer fee with both cases it is possible for errors to be made however since you often get to review the information before it is sent with a wire transfer the method is a little more secure also because identities are verified with wire transfers that take place between bank accounts there is less chance of fraud wire transfers that take place between financial institutions are generally considered quite secure from

i am not sure how anyone is answering this unless they know what the loan was for   for instance if it is for a house you can put a lien on the house   if it is for the car in most states you can take over ownership of it    point being is that you need to go after the asset    if there is no asset you need to go after you friend   again we need more specifics to determine the best course of action which could range from you suing and wages from your friend to going to small claims court   part of this process is also getting a hold of the lending institution   by letting them know what is going on they may be able to help you they are good at tracking people down for free also the lender may be able to give you options   for example if it is for a car a bank may help you clear this out if you get the car back plus penalty   if a car is not in the red on the loan and it is in good condition the bank turns a profit on the default   if they can recover it for free they will be willing to work with you   i worked in repo when younger and on more than a few occasions we had the cosigner helping   it went down like this co signer gets pissed like you and calls bank bank works out a plan and tells cosigner to default cosigner defaults banks gives cosigner rights to repo vehicle cosigner helps or actually vehicle bank gets car back bank car bank asks cosigner for x amount sometimes nothing but not usually cosigner pays x bank does not hit credit bank releases loan and sells car   i am writing this like it is easy but it really requires that asset is still in good condition that cosigner can get to the asset and that the friend still is around and trusts cosigner   i have seen more than a few promise to deliver and come up short and couple conspiring with the friend    i basically think most of the advice you have gotten so far is crap and you have n't provided enough info to give perfect advice   seeking a lawyer is a joke   going after a fleeing party could eat up 40 50 billable hours   it is n't like you are suing a business or something   the lawyer could cost as much as repaying the loan and most lawyers will act like it is a snap of their fingers until they have you dry just really advice for the most part i would suggest talking to the bank and defaulting but again need 100 of the details    the other part is cosigning the loan   why the hell would you cosign a loan for a friend   most parents wo n't cosign a loan for their own kids   and if you are cosigning a loan you write up a simple contract and make the non payment penalties extremely costly for your friend   i have seen simple contracts that include 30 interests rates that were upheld by courts

the ruble was is and will be very unstable because of unstable political situation in russia and the economy strongly dependent of the export of raw resources what you can do i assume you want to minimize risk the best way to achieve that is to make your savings in some stable currency euro and swiss franc are currently very stable currencies so storing your surpluses in them is a very good option if you want to keep your money safe to prevent political risk you should keep your money in countries with stable political regime which are unlikely to nationalize the savings of the citizens in predictable future as for your existing savings in rubles it 's a hard deal i assume as the web developer you have a plenty of money which have lost a lot of value if you convert them to euro or francs you will the current value after the loss you 'll safe them ruble falling down but in case the ruble will return to previous value you 'll loose   keeping savings in currencies is however speculation like investing in gold etc so if you can mentally accept the loss and want to sleep good convert them you have also option to invest in properties for example buy an extra appartment it 's a good way to deal with financial surplus in europe in us however you should be aware in it 's connected with the political risk the real estates can be confiscated in any moment by the state and you ca n't run away with it the savings can also be confiscated but there 's a fair chance you 'll manage to rescue them if you act quickly

we need more info to give a better answer but in short if you assume you will make $ 0 in other employment income next year there is a huge tax benefit in deferring 50k until next year total tax savings would probably be something like $ 15k rough estimate if you took the rrsp deduction this year you would save something like 20k this year but then you would be taxed on it next year if you withdraw it probably paying another 5k the year after ie you would get about the same net tax savings in both years if you contributed to your rrsp and withdrew next year vs deferring it to next year   on a non tax basis you would benefit by having the cash today so you could earn investment income on your rrsp but you would want to go low risk as you need the money next year so the most you could earn would be something like 3 the real benefit to the rrsp contribution is if you defer your withdrawal into your retirement because you can further defer your taxes into the future earning investment income in the meantime but if you need to withdraw next year you wo n't get that opportunity

yield is the term used to describe how much income the bond will generate if the bond was purchased at a particular moment in time if i pay $ 100 for a one year $ 100 par value bond that pays 5 interest then the bond yields 5 since i will receive $ 5 from a $ 100 investment if i held the bond to maturity if i pay $ 90 for the same one year bond then the bond yields 17 since i will receive $ 15 from a $ 90 investment if i held the bond to maturity there are many factors that affect what yield creditors will accept it is the last bullet that ultimately determines yield   the other factors feed into the creditor ’s desire to hold money today versus receiving money in the future   i desire money in my hand more than a promise to receive money in the future   in order to entice me to lend my money someone must offer me an incentive   thus they must offer me more money in the future in order for me to part with money i have a yield curve is a snapshot of the yields for different loan durations   the x axis is the amount of time left on the bond while the y axis is the yield   the most cited yield curve is the us treasury curve which displays the yields for loans to the us government   the yield curve changes while bonds are being traded thus it is always a snapshot of a particular moment in time short term loans typically have less yield than longer term loans since there is less uncertainty about the near future yield curves will or slightly when creditors desire to keep their money instead of loaning it out   this can occur because of a sudden disruption in the market that causes uncertainty about the future which leads to an increase in the demand for cash on hand the us government yield curve should be looked at with some reservation however since there is a very large creditor to the us government that has the ability to loan the government an unlimited amount of funds

for the person being hired this is a tricky situation specially with the new laws there is no real magic number that can be applied as a lot will depend on what benefits you want and what is actually available this will really shift the spectrum quite a bit   under the care act everyone has to have insurance or pay a fine were really not sure what to call this yet but there are two provisions that really mess with the numbers you look at as an employee   first the cost of heath care has skyrocketed so the same benefits that you had 5 years ago now cost maybe 10 15 times as much as they used to this gets swept under the rug a bit because the main costs of insurance has only increased a tiny amount what this actually comes down to is does your new aca approved heath plan cover exactly the benefits you need or does it cut corners   sorry this is complicated and i do n't mean it to come off as a speech against the aca so i will give an example my wife has ra she really has it under control with the help of her ra doctor this is not something she ever wants to change because she has had ra from the age of 15 and because it 's she does n't want to spend 5 years working with a new doctor to get to the same place she is with her current doctor   in addition the main drugs she takes for ra are not covered under any aca plan nor are the that her doctor makes we are trying to have kids so she has to be off the main meds and a couple of the things this doctor has tried has been meds that reduce are pregnancy safe but are not for the treatment of ra you now have to take into effect rather the cost of health insurance + the cost of the things now not covered by the heath insurance + the out of pocket expenses is worth the insurance   second the aca has set up provisions to straight up trick those people that have lower income and are not paying close attention when shopping for insurance they get quotes like $ 50 a month or $ 100 a month the truth is that the remainder of the actual cost is deducted from their tax returns this takes consideration because if you thing your paying $ 50 a month for insurance but your really paying $ 650 then you need to make sure your doing your math right finally you need to understand how messed up things are right now in the us with heath care largely this goes unreported i 'm not really sure why but in order to do this i will have to give examples   for my wife to see a specialist her ra doctor the co pay is $ 75 so she goes to the doctor he charges her $ 75 and bills the insurance $ 200 the insurance pays the doctor $ 50 with out insurance the visit costs $ 50   at first you want to blame the doctor for cheating the system but the doctor has to pay for hours of labor to get the $ 50 back from the insurance company from the doctors perspective it 's cheaper to take the $ 50 then it is to charge the insurance company and by charging the insurance company he has no control over the cost of the co pay he essentially has to charge more to make the same money and the patient gets the in the process another example i got throat last year i went to the walk in clinic paid $ 75 saw the doctor got my z pack for $ 15 went home in bed and got better my wife who still had separate insurance from before the marriage got throat that went to the same clinic they charged her $ 200 for the visit $ 50 co pay and $ 250 for the z pack $ 3 co pay the insurance paid the clinic $ 90 for the visit and $ 3 for the drugs again the patient is left out in this scenario in this case it worked better for my wife unless you account for the fact that to get that coverage she had to pay $   my point is that when comparing costs of with insurance and without out insurance its often times much cheaper for the practices to have you self pay then it is for them to go through the loops of trying to insurance to make them whole this creates two rates self pay rates and insured rates when your trying to figure out the cost of not having insurance then you need to use the self pay rates these can be vastly different   so as an employee you need to figure out your cost of heath care with insurance and your cost of heath care without insurance then user those numbers when your trying to negotiate a salary the problem is that there is no magic number to use for this because the cost will very a lot for us it was cheaper to not have insurance even with a pre existing condition that takes constant attention it 's just better if we set aside $ 500 a month then it is to try to pay $ 750 a month that might not hold true for everyone for some people or conditions it may be better to pay the $ 750 then to try to handle it themselves   so for my negotiations i would go with without insurance or with insurance   now as an employer it 's a lot simpler usually you have a group plan that offers you a pretty straight $ x per year per person or $ y per year per family so you can offer exactly that salary $ x or salary $ y. as a starting point however this is where negotiations start   if your offering me $ and insurance i would rather just have $ and no insurance of course your real cost is only $ 55,000 cause you do n't care about my heath care costs only about insurance costs so you try to negotiate down towards $ 55,000 and no insurance but that 's not good enough for me so i either go else where and you loose talent or i accept $ and insurance or somewhere in between

i agree that you should have received both a 1099 and a w2 from your employer they may be reluctant to do that because some people believe that could trigger an irs audit the reason is that independent contractor vs employee is supposed to be defined by your job function not by your choice if you were a contractor and then switched to be an employee without changing your job description then the irs could claim that you should have always been an employee the entire time and so should every one of the other contractors that work for that company with a similar job function it 's a 's nest that the employer may not want to poke but that 's not your problem what should you do about it when you say he added my federal and fica w h together do you mean that total appears in box 4 of your 1099 if so it sounds like the employer is expecting you to re pay the employer portion of fica can you ask them if they actually paid it if they did then i do n't see them having a choice but to issue a w2 since the irs would be expecting one if they did n't pay your fica then the amount this will cost you is 7.65 of what would have been your w2 wages imho it would be reasonable for you to request that they send you a check for that extra amount note even though that amount will be less than $ 600 and you wo n't receive a 1099 in 2017 for it legally you 'll still have to pay tax on that amount so i think a good estimate would be to call it 10 instead depending on your personality and your relationship with the employer if they choose not to make you whole you could threaten to fill out form additional info thank you for bringing this up the situation you find yourself in is similar to the concept of contract to hire you start off as a contractor and later convert to an employee in order to avoid issuing a 1099 and w2 to the same person in a single tax year companies typically utilize one of the following strategies your particular situation is closest to situation 2 but the reverse instead of retroactively calling you a w2 employee the entire time your employer is cheating and attempting to classify you as a 1099 contractor the entire time this is frowned upon by the irs as well as the employee since as you discovered it costs you more money in the form of employer fica from your description it sounds like your employer was trying to do you a favor and did n't quite follow through with it what they should have done was never switch you to w2 in the first place if you really should have been a contractor or they should have done the conversion properly without you along

this answer fills in some of the details you are unsure about since i 'm further along than you i bought the espp shares in 2012   i did n't sell immediately but in 2015 so i qualify for the long term capital gains rate here 's how it was reported the 15 discount was reported on a w2 as   it was also mentioned twice in the info box not all of my w2 's come with one of these but also   this showed the sale trade with my cost basis as the discounted price of $ 5000 and for interests sake i also got the following in 2012 warning this means that just going ahead and entering the numbers means you will be taxed twice once as income and once as capital gains i only noticed this was happening because i no longer worked for the company so this w2 only had this one item on it this is another example of the us tax system baffling me with its blend of obsessive compulsive need for documentation coupled with missing information that 's critical to sensible accounting the 1099 documents must says the irs since 2015 show the basis value as the award price your discounted price    so reading the form 8949 note if you checked box d above but the basis reported to the irs was    incorrect enter in column e the basis as reported to the irs and    enter an adjustment in column g to correct the basis we discover the number is incorrect and must adjust   the actual value you need to adjust it by may be reported on your 1099 but also may not i have examples of both i calculated the required adjustment by looking at the w2 as detailed above i this information from the following documents provided by my stock management company you should the tax resources section of your provider

it has nothing to do with forcing people to pay off their debt in that case it would make better sense to have people pay off debt rather than interest it is because you want to have your actual payment stay the same each month which is easier for the vast majority of people to comprehend and put into their budget it is called an annuity in finance terms in theory you could use another method eg pay of the same amount of debt each month then your interest payments will decrease over time but in that case your monthly payment debt + interest will not be stable it will start of high and decrease a little bit each month with an annuity you have a constant cashflow in finance you generally operate with three methods of debt repayment annuity fixed cashflow high interest payment in the beginning with small debt payments later it will be reversed serial loan fixed debt payments debt payments are equally spread out accross the period is paid on the remaining debt cash flow will decrease over time because interest payments become smaller for each period standing loan you only pay interest on the loan no debt payments during the period all debt is payed back in the end of the loan in europe it is common practise to combine a 30 year annuity with a 10 year standing loan so that you only pay interest on the loan for the first 10 years thereafter you start paying back the debt and interest the fixed amount each month the annuity this is especially common for first time buyers since they usually have smaller salaries early in life than later and therefore need the additional free cash in the beginning of their adult life

primerica 's primary value proposition is that switching from whole or universal life to term life and investing the difference is a good idea for most people however there are a number of other important factors to consider when purchasing life insurance and i would also be wary of anyone claiming that one product will be the best for you under all circumstances best insurance without getting into a much larger discussion on how to pick insurance companies or products here are a few things that concern me about primerica they have a captive sales force meaning their agents sell only primerica products this means that they are not shopping around for the best deal for you given how much prices on term life have changed in recent years i would highly recommend taking the time to get alternate quotes online or from an independent broker who will shop around for you their staff are primarily part time employees i am not saying they are incompetent or do n't care just that you are more likely to be working with someone for whom insurance is not their primary line of work if you have substantial reason to believe that you may someday need whole life their products may not suit you well primerica does not offer whole life as far as i am aware which also means that you can not convert your term life policy through them to whole life should you need to do so for example if you experience an accident are disabled or have a significant change in your health status in the future and do not have access to a group life policy you may be unable to renew your individual policy above average returns i am also highly skeptical about this claim the only possible context in which i could find this valid would be if they mean that your returns on average will be better if you invest in the stock market directly as compared to the returns you would get from the cash value portion of a life insurance product such as universal life as those types of products generally have very high fees can you clarify if this is the claim that was made or if they are promising returns above those of the general stock market if it is the latter run only a handful of superstar investors think warren buffet peter lynch and bill gross have ever consistently outperformed the stock market as a whole and typically only for a limited period of time in either case i would have the same concerns here as stated in reasons 1 and 2 above even more so than with insurance if you need investment advice i 'd recommend working with someone who is fully dedicated to that type of work such as a fee only financial planner is a good place to find one once you know how you want to invest i would again recommend shopping around for a reputable but inexpensive broker and compare their fees with primerica 's kudos on having a healthy level of skepticism and listening to your gut also remember that if you are not interested in their offer you do n't have to prove them wrong you can simply say no thank you best of luck

for one the startup does n't exist yet so until march i will get nothing on hand though i have enough reserves to bridge that time i would not take this deal unless the start up exists in some form   if it 's just not yet profitable then there 's a risk reward to consider   if it does n't exist at all then it can not make a legal obligation to you and it 's not worth taking the deal yet   if everything else is an acceptable risk to you then you should be asking the other party to create the company and formalize the agreement with you as regards reserves if you 're really getting paid in shares instead of cash then you may need them later   shares in a start up likely are not easy to sell if you 're allowed to sell them at all so it may be a while before a paycheck given what you 've described for a second who pays the tax this is my first non university job so i do n't exactly know but usually the employer has to does pay my taxes and some other stuff from my income that 's what i understood if = where is the tax this i can not answer for germany   in the u.s. it would depend in part on how the company is organized   it 's likely that some or all of the tax will be deferred until you monetize your shares but you should get some professional advice on that before you move forward   as an example it 's likely that you 'd get taxed in part or in whole on what we 'd call capital gains maybe in german that would only be assessed when you sell the shares for third shares are a risk if i or any other in the startup screw really my pay might be a lot less than expected of course if it works out i 'm this is the inherent risk of a start up so there 's no getting around the fact that there 's a chance that the business may fail and your shares become worthless   up to you if you think the risk is acceptable   where you can mitigate risk is in ensuring that there 's a well written and enforceable set of documents that define what rights go with the shares who controls the company how profits will be distributed etc   do n't do this by spoken agreement only   get it all written down and then get it checked by a lawyer representing your interests

first check out some of the answers on this question oversimplify it for me the correct order of investing when you have determined that you are ready to invest for retirement there are two things you need to consider the investment and the account   these are separate items the investment is what makes your money grow the type of account provides tax advantages and restrictions   generally these can be considered separately for the most part you can do any type of investment in any account briefly here is an overview of some of the main options in your situation the roth ira is what i would recommend this grows tax free and if you need the funds for some reason you can get out what you put in without penalty you can invest up to $ 5500 in your roth ira each year in addition to the above reasons which are true for anybody a roth ira would be especially beneficial for you for three reasons for someone that is closer in age to retirement and in a higher tax bracket now a roth ira is less attractive than it is for you inside your roth ira there are lots of choices you can invest in stocks bonds mutual funds which are simply collections of stocks and bonds bank accounts precious metals and many other things discussing all of these investments in one answer is too broad but my recommendation is this if you are investing for retirement you should be investing in the stock market however picking individual stocks is too risky you need to be diversified in a lot of stocks stock mutual funds are a great way to invest in the stock market   there are lots of different types of stock mutual funds with different strategies and expenses associated with them managed funds actively buy and sell different stocks inside them but have high expenses to pay the managers index funds buy and hold a list of stocks and have very low expenses the conventional wisdom is that in general index funds perform better than managed funds when you take the expenses into account   i hope this overview and these recommendations were helpful if you have any specific questions about any of these types of accounts or investments feel free to ask another question

the simplest way to consolidate the funds your old 401(k plans is by doing what 's called a direct rollover whereby the funds go directly into the new plan and skips you completely from each of the old plans into either an ira that you establish with a provider of your choice or even into your current employer 's 401(k plan if that is available that way the funds are in one central account and available to invest plus it eliminates the mandatory 20 withholding if the rollover is indirect and is sent to you first before the deposit into the new plan it is important to bear in mind that you have 60 calendar days from the date of distribution to get the full amount into the new plan and a rollover is considered a tax reportable but not necessarily a taxable event provided you deposit the funds within the time frame allotted

okay i 'm going to give you my opinion based on experience not any technical understanding the options by themselves are pretty meaningless in terms of determining their value the business plan going forward their growth expectations the additional options to be authorized the additional preferred stock offers they anticipate even current estimated value of the company are some of the pieces of data you will be needing i also want to say something cynical like to hell with the stock options give me cold hard but that 's just me my experience two times so far has shown stock options to be worth very very little

gt second ensure your product experience is outstanding creating ongoing repeat from happy consumers   tivo 's customer experience is outstanding i have been a loyal tivo dvr user since 2003 and their interface and feature set is greatly superior to the junk dvrs that the cable companies provide   the problem for tivo seems to be overcoming the convenience and cost benefits that the cable company provides with their inferior product     what would have been an ideal business model for tivo would have been to get cable companies to offer tivo boxes or cable boxes with the tivo interface perhaps as an upsell product from basic dvr i honestly believe that if a user tried a tivo for a short period of time they would choose to pay a little extra for it

let me give you the benefit of my experience i paid a bunch of points 4 when i bought my first house for similar reasons than you mentioned including why i wish i had n't 1 interest rates plummeted not as likely to happen today and i wound up refinancing the loan within the fist 10 years negating the savings that i would have had over the life of the loan also it made me feel stupid for paying close to $ 5 k to knock 1 or so off the loan rate only to have an even lower rate offered to me with no points within a decade 2 i did n't take into account that i 'm the type of person who would try to pay the loan off early and i did way early so even if i had n't refinanced the extra points were really a waste of money 3 in the us at least you ca n't always deduct all of the money you paid in points in the first year you may have to spread that deduction over several years 4 you are right about the alternative being better investing the points since the benefit of paying them is at most 1 2 on your loan you do n't even need a 6 7 return to make it a better deal to invest them however i get skeptical when people compare paying interest to returns on invested money like that if you do n't pay the points will you actually invest that money for the 30 years or whatever the term of the loan is it 's easy to say that when you are talking but $ 5k in your pocket is also pretty tempting when the deal is done good luck with the new house

the 5 to 6.5 loan rates are a bit high you 'll probably want to pay those off first and make it one of your priorities as soon as you have a 6-month savings fund this should probably take precedence over savings for retirement unless you 're giving up a 401(k match pay extra on the highest interest loan until it 's all paid off then switch to the next one down and accelerate the payoff as much as you can if you 're looking at a loan at 6 and a payoff date in 8 years or so 2020 am extra dollar paid now will save you not a bad return in general and an excellent return for something that 's zero risk the other loans at 2 3 are different an extra dollar paid now on a 2 loan will save you $ 0.17 over 8 years that 's a pretty mediocre return if you have a good stable job and good job prospects and a decent family support network and few commitments like children and mortgages and a low cost of living generally the things that help you have a high tolerance for risk then you should consider investing your money in the stock market instead of paying off these loans any earlier than you need to broad index funds and the like not individual stocks

the answers you 've received already are very good i truly sympathize with your situation in general it makes sense to try to build off of existing relationships here are a few ideas i do n't know if you work for a small or large company or local state government but if there is any kind of retirement planning through your workplace make sure to investigate that those people are usually already paid something for their services by your employer so they should have less of an interest in making money off you directly one more thought a no fee brokerage company e.g. charles schwab they offer a free one hour phone call with an investment adviser if you invest at least $ 25k. i personally had very good experiences with them this answer may be too anecdotal and not specifically address the annuity dilemma you mentioned that dilemma is why you need to find someone you can trust who is competent see the credentials for financial advisers mentioned in the other answers and will work the numbers out with you

in this case can the title of the home still be held by both yes it is possible to have additional people on title that are not on the mortgage would the lender bank have any reservations about this since a party not on the mortgage has ownership of the property possibly but there is a very simple way to avoid this clayton could simply purchase the home himself and add emma to the title after closing by recording a quitclaim deed the lender ca n't stop that and from their point of view it 's actually better since they have two people to go after in the case of default but despite it being better they often make it difficult to purchase tip when you have an attorney draft the quitclaim document have them draft the reverse document too emma the property back to clayton there is usually no extra charge for this and then you have it if you need it for example you may need to file the reverse forms if you want to refinance as a side note i agree with   grade eh bacon 's and pete b. 's in recommending that clayton and emma do not do this once they are married the property will either be automatically jointly owned or a spouse can be added to the title easily and until they are married there are no pros but many cons to doing this reasons not to do it as a side note in a comment it was proposed suppose clayton loves emma so much that he wants her name to be on the house i understand the desire to do this from an emotional point of view but realize this does not make sense from a financial point of view

as an individual i am not aware of any insurance you can buy that will cover legal costs for any event that may occur whether criminal or civil i imagine this is because the risk is too difficult to measure and the moral hazard too great i do notice you mention rental property small business needs   if your concern is truly for costs relating to some legal issue that arises out of your professional operations then   professional liability insurance may be what you are looking for oftentimes referred to as errors and or for short   this insurance is specific to whatever business you engage in however will typically protect you against legal claims including defense costs as a result of your business operations   note however that what is actually covered will be specific to your policy as duffbeer703 mentioned the purpose of insurance is for covering specific losses i.e. protecting you from legal claims that may arise during the course of business   if you are looking for a solution that will e.g. provide you a standard set of legal documents maybe a lease agreement then you are not in fact looking for insurance but instead legal services at a fixed rate why would an insurance company pay for services both you and it already know you need

my opinion is that in general it is probably not a good idea to borrow at a cost in order to make your rrsp contribution   banks of course have an interest in loaning you money   do n't expect their literature to be objective on the matter   they are selling you a product and the advice is biased   what better way to double dip than to get guaranteed interest payments from you as well as ongoing fees for probably also getting your loan money invested in their high fee mutual funds a year 's rrsp contribution room allowance is n't use it or lose it unlike 401k contribution allowances in the u.s that is unused rrsp contribution room accumulates and you can take advantage of it in later years if we could n't carry our rrsp contribution room over i might feel different about the general case for rrsp loans yet there are two specific cases i can think of where it may make sense to borrow and pay back a possible case if your tax rate is currently in a high bracket e.g. 46 and you anticipate being in a lower income and bracket next year e.g. 35 then it would make sense to take advantage of the higher tax savings in the current tax year   if you waited until the following year to take the deduction you 'd lose out on 11 of the deducted amount    for a typical person whose income is level or increasing from year to year this is n't likely to be applicable but it could help somebody who is going on leave or otherwise has irregular income a foolish case if you knew somehow that you could realize a return on your invested rrsp money exceeding the pre tax earnings required to pay the interest on the rrsp loan   however i would suggest this is foolish bet to make   the interest you pay is guaranteed but the return you are expected to get is probably not or if it is it is probably a return lower than what your bank wants to charge on the loan if for some reason it does make sense for you take the money and invest it somewhere better than the high fee mutual funds the bank is also pushing

in my experience earning interest is not enough to keep the account in a non dormant state if payment of interest was the trigger to reset the clock then no savings account would ever be considered dormant in general as the account got close to the deadline we were notified that a single transaction moving money into or out of the account would reset the clock i have had this happen in recent years with a bank account and a credit union account   in researching for the exact definition of a dormant account i found this regarding interest on the fdic website that means that the state law may set the definition it also means that you should look at the information regarding the bank policy i did try and see if the rules for a credit union are the same the added twist with a credit union is that if the account is closed they are no longer a share holder and that brings into the discussion voting rights so the policy guidelines is even more complex if the account does go inactive state law will define what happens to the account and how you can get the funds back

if both cards have the same interest rate there 's likely no practical difference here very likely the required minimum payment is calculated the same on both cards pay off one card and put the rest on the other or split the payment across both cards my personal preference would be to entirely pay off one card and put the rest on the other it feels like a bigger accomplishment if one card has a significantly different interest rate obviously you 'd try to pay that one down first alternatively if you owe less on one card you may choose to pay that off and then cut up the card if you are trying to recover from a poor financial situation this way you have achieved a specific goal but again in your case it sounds like your two cards are entirely interchangeable either way you do it well done on putting your money where it 'll make the most difference right now

the name of the gilt states the redemption date but not the original issue date a gilt with 8.75 yield and close to its redemption date may have been issued at a time when interest rates were indeed close to 8.75 for example in the early 1990s the uk inflation rate was about 8 one reason for preferring high or low coupon gilts is the trade off between capital gains and income and the different taxation rules for each if you buy a gilt and hold it to its maturity date you know in advance the exact price that it will be redeemed for i.e. £ 100 you may prefer to take a high level of income now knowing you will make a capital loss in future which might offset some other predictable capital gain for tax purposes or you may prefer not to take income that you do n't need right now and instead get a guaranteed capital gain in future for example when you plan to retire from work also you can use the change in the market value of gilts as a gamble or a hedge against your expectation of interest rate changes in future with the government guaranteed fallback position that if your predictions are wrong you know exactly what return you will get if you hold the gilts to maturity the same idea applies to other bond investments but without the government guarantee of course

we do n't have all the relevant numbers to give you the perfect answer knowing your income is pretty important for this question but since you have 200 k in student loans i 'm going to guess and hope you probably make more than 80k yr which is the cutoff for deducting student loan interest it starts phasing out once you make over 65 k and fully phases out at 80 k or 160 k if you 're married even if you make less than 65 k you can only deduct a max of in student loan interest and you 'll be maxing that out for at least the next 4 years so my take is throw it at the student loan your mortgage interest is probably fully deductible which means your mortgage interest rate is effectively reduced by your tax bracket e.g. if you are in the 28 tax bracket a 4 mortgage rate would effectively become outside of that if you were to make minimum payments on your mortgage and student loans starting now as soon as your student loan is paid off i would start making that same student loan payment amount towards your mortgage this way you wo n't have any change in cash flow but it will significantly lower the term of your mortgage which is what would happen if you choose to pay down the mortgage now but then you do n't get the tax advantage on the difference

why wo n't anyone just answer the original question the question was not about opportunity cost or flexibility or family expenses there are no right answers to any of those things and they all depend on individual circumstances i believe the answer to the question of whether paying off a 30-year mortgage in 15 years would cost the same amount as a 15-year mortgage of the same interest rate is yes but only if you pay it off on the exact same schedule as your supposed 15-year in reality the answer is no for two reasons the amortization schedule and the fact that the 30-year will always have a higher interest rate than the 15-year the way mortgages are amortized the interest is paid first essentially for most people the majority of the monthly payment is interest for the first half of the loan 's life this is good for most people because in reality most mortgages only last a couple years after which people refinance or move and for those first couple years the majority of one 's housing costs interest are tax deductible it is arguable whether this for one 's entire life is wise but that 's the reality of most mortgages so unless you pay off your 30-year on the exact same amortization schedule of your theoretical 15-year you will pay more in interest a common strategy people pursue is paying an extra monthly payment or more each year by the time you get around to chipping away at your principal in that way you will already have paid a lot more interest than you would have on a 15-year and really if you can afford to substantially pay down principal in the first year or two of your mortgage you probably should 've borrowed less money to begin with in theory if the rates were the same they 're not and if you paid the 30 off every month in the exact same way as you would've paid a 15 you wo n't you will pay the same amount in the end you have to decide if the flexibility is worth more to you than the cost savings   for example a 300k mortgage at 3.5 will have a monthly payment of for a 15-year and for a 30-year both will start with of that being in interest gradually declining with time what i think most people undervalue is the freedom and peace of mind that comes with a paid off or nearly paid off home and 15 years is a lot more tangible than 30 plus a lot cheaper over all if you can afford a 15-year mortgage without putting too much stress on your budget it is definitely the better option for financial security   and be careful of the index fund opportunity cost advice on average it may be a good idea when you look at the very long run historically but a lot of people get less than average returns depending on when they buy and what the market does in the short run there is no certainty around what returns you will get from the stock market but if you have a 30-year mortgage there is a lot of certainty around what you will owe every month for the next different mixes of investments make sense for different people and most people would be wise to get some exposure to the stock market for its returns and liquidity however if someone 's goal is borrowing more money for their house in order to invest more money in the stock market for their retirement they would actually be better served in achieving security and independence 15 years sooner

diversifying but is n't that what mutual funds already do they diversify and reduce stock specific risk by moving from individual stocks to many stocks but you can diversify even further by selecting different fund types e.g. large cal small cap income bond funds international etc   your target date fund probably includes a few different types already and will automatically reallocate to less risky investments as you get close to the target date i would look at the fees of different types of funds and compare them to the historical returns of those funds   you can also use things like morningstar and other ratings as guides but they are generally very large buckets and may not be much help distinguishing between individual funds so to answer the question yes you can diversify further and probably get better returns and lower fees that a target date fund   the question is is it worth your time and effort to do so   you 're obviously comfortable investing for the long term so you might get some benefit by spending a little time looking for different funds to increase your diversification note that etfs do n't really diversify any differently than mutual funds they are just a different mechanism to invest in funds and allow different trading strategies trading during the day derivatives selling short etc

it 's wrong in several situations   one the business owner counts this as a business expense which it is not and therefore reduces the company 's profit and taxes that would be tax avoidance and probably criminal   two someone who is not the sole owner counts this as a business expense which it is not reduces the company 's profit and when profits are shared the company pays out less money to the other owners that 's probably fraud   third if the owner or owners of a limited liability company draw out lots of money from the company with the intent that the company should go bankrupt with tons of debt that the owners are not going to pay while keeping the money they off for themselves that would probably bankruptcy fraud   apart from being wrong there is the obvious risk that you lose control over your company 's and your own expenses and might be in for a nasty surprise if the company has to pay out money and there 's nothing left that would be ordinary stupidity if you have to tell your employees that you ca n't pay their salaries but offer them to admire your brand new ferrari that 's something i 'd consider deeply unethical

the hmrc has a dedicated self help learning site that is helpful here it 's important to tell hmrc that you are self employed as soon as    possible   if you do n't you may have to pay a penalty   you do n't want to pay more to hmrc than you have to as it is a waste    of your money your business has started when you start to advertise or you have a    customer to buy your goods or services   it is at this point that your business is trading you can not    register before you start trading for example if you advertise your business in the local newspaper on    15 january but do not get your first customer until 29 march in this    case you have been trading since 15 january you must tell hmrc within six months of the end of the tax year in    which you start self employment   you must therefore register by 5 october   but it 's best to register well before this so that you do not forget    to do so the hmrc also has a youtube channel with help videos and am i trading or not might be of particular interest to you most of the registration is based around the concept of starting to work with the intent to make a profit by the letter of law and regulations you should register within six months of the end of the tax year you started to avoid any potential penalty however note that the situation is different based upon your intent if you begin making putting up videos online as a hobby with the hope that you can make something to help you the basic costs involved and the total amount you make is relatively small say less than 500 pounds you will not be classified as trading and likely have no need to register with hmrc   as soon as you begin to get in regular payments maybe a single payment of a significant size or multiple payments for a similar service item you are vastly more likely to need to register from my reading you would likely be safe to begin putting up videos without registration but if you begin spending a large portion of your time over an extended period multiple months and/or begin getting payments of any notable size then you should likely register with the appropriate services hmrc etc as is the case in both the usa and uk simple registration is pretty cheap and the costs of little no income are usually pretty minor   also note that the hmrc trading and self employment regulations are unusual compared to many us laws institutions in that you are explicitly permitted to begin doing something and only register later so if you start doing videos for an entire tax year + 5 months and make nothing significant you 'd seemingly be fine to never register at all

your scenario 2 in the money options not at the money the former is when the share price is higher than the option strike the second is when share price is right at strike i agree this is a highly unlikely scenario because everyone pricing options knows what everyone else in that stock is doing much about an option has everything to do with the remaining time to expiration depending on how much more the buyer believes the stock will go up before hitting the expiration date that could make a big difference in which option they would buy i agree with the others that if you 're seeing this as real world then there must be something going on behind the scenes that someone else knows and you do n't i would tread with caution in such a situation and do my homework before making any move    the other big factor that makes your question harder to answer more concisely is that you did n't tell us what the expiration dates on the options are this makes a difference in how you evaluate them we could probably be much more helpful to you if you could give us that information

in finance short selling also known as shorting or going short is the practice of selling assets usually securities that have been borrowed from a third party usually a broker with the intention of buying identical assets back at a later date to return to the lender remember your broker has to borrow it from somewhere other clients or if they hold those specific stocks themselves so if it is n't possible for them to lend you those stocks they would n't high p e stocks would find more sellers than buyers and if the broker has to deliver them it would be a nightmare for him to deliver all those stocks which he had lent back to whom he had borrowed from as well as to people who had gone when you went and if every body is selling there is going to be a dearth of stocks to be borrowed from as everybody around is selling instead of buying

this shifting is costs is made even worse by the fact that the worst breaches are coming from companies that most consumers do n't have a choice about dealing with therefore there is n't even a market incentive to encourage companies to behave better if a bank or credit card had no fraud protection or showed the level of incompetence equifax has shown people would move their accounts however most of equifax 's victims did n't really have a say about whether equifax had their data

firstly make sure annual income exceeds annual expenses the difference is what you have available for saving   secondly you should have tiers of savings from most to least liquid and least to most rewarding the core of personal finance is managing the flow of money between these tiers to balance maximizing return on savings with budget constraints for example insurance effectively allows society to move money from savings to stocks and bonds and a savings account lets the bank loan out a bit of your money to people buying assets like homes   note that the above set of accounts is just a template from which you should customize you might want to add in an fsa or hsa extra loan payments or taxable brokerage accounts depending on your cash flow debt and tax situation

yeah i was a libertarian until they said they want to end the federal reserve i 'm more of a conservative    your point that a minimum wage at a major metropolitan area is often not a livable wage is irrelevant wages are a   fee given to employees for their work the way an employee earns a high wage is by providing value that is greater than that wage if the value an employee brings to an employer is less than the wage he 's paid an employer will lay off that individual because the employee costs the employer money therefore setting a minimum wage simply means you ban certain individuals usually first time workers or otherwise unskilled from the workforce because they currently do not have the skills and/or experience to justify that wage furthermore the higher you set the minimum wage the more people you deprive of jobs

in my opinion you should pay off the student loans as soon as possible before you start saving for the house downpayment $ is a big number but you have a great salary   nice   up until now you have been a poor college student accustomed to a relatively low standard of living   your $ 800 per month plan would have you pay off the loan in 3 years but i would challenge you to pay off this entire student loan in 1 year or less   a monthly loan payment of $ will pay off your loan in 12 months after that is done if you take the same amount you had been paying toward your student loans and save it for your condo in less than two years you 'll have a 10 down payment saved $ 50k   the whole thing will take less than three years there are three reasons why i recommend paying off the loan first before saving for the condo one is practical and two are philosophical practical you will save money on interest   paying off the loan in 1 year vs. 3 years will save you $   you wo n't find a short term safe investment that will beat 5 in interest philosophical the loan is something current and concrete that you can focus on   your condo is a dream at this point and there is lots of time to change your mind   if the $ per month amount is at all a sacrifice for you then in a few months you might be tempted to say to yourself this month i really want a vacation so i 'll just skip this month of saving   for the loan however if you establish a concrete goal of 12 months to pay off the loan it will hopefully help motivate you to allocate this money and stick to your plan philosophical getting used to borrowing money making payments to a bank and paying interest is not a great way to live   it is better in my opinion to eliminate your debt as fast as possible and start getting accustomed to saving cash for what you want   clean up your debt and resolve not to borrow any more money except for a reasonably sized mortgage on your home

for a $ 350 monthly payment she is currently paying $ 200 monthly in interest you say that no bank will refinance her but that is not true i 'm sure many banks are happy to refinance her to the value of the car she should start that process you 'll find that your suggestion to pay $ 5000 down on the current loan is pretty similar to what she would need to bring to a bank to refinance maybe as much as $ 7000 to refinance after that she would be paying a much lower amount in interest and she could still retire the loan a year or two but she would be paying even less in interest the advantage to borrowing from her emergency fund is that she retires the loan 14 months earlier the problem is that you are prioritizing the least amount paid and she is prioritizing an emergency fund emergency funds are also very important you might have better success if you prioritize paying back the emergency fund in your plan if she puts $ 7000 down to refinance assume a 3 year loan at 4.5 with a $ 150 monthly payment instead of paying down the remaining $ 5000 quickly what if she put the extra $ 200/month toward paying back her emergency fund it would take the same 3 years to fully pay it back without impacting the rest of her budget at all if she has extra room in her budget she could pay back that emergency fund even faster many of us who prioritize minimizing interest paid and maximizing interest earned already have a robust emergency fund your girlfriend is n't wrong to value that unexpected emergencies can cause much more interest to be paid if there is no way to deal with them that 's how paycheck and title lenders capture their customers talk to her about what emergencies she might need the money for and make a plan to replenish the fund and you 're much more likely to have her buy in

according to pages 6 7 of the instructions for form 1040 in 2009 amt was only temporarily for the year congress ca n't politically afford to drastically cut amt exemptions by 30 to 40 and may even retroactively change it if it is n't passed by the end of the year despite the constitution ex post facto laws what ’s new for 2009     alternative minimum tax amt exemption amount increased the amt exemption amount has increased to $ $ if married filing jointly or a qualifying $ if married filing separately what ’s new for 2010     alternative minimum tax amt exemption amount the amt exemption amount is scheduled to decrease to $ $ 45,000 if married filing jointly or a qualifying $ 22,500 if married filing separately so if you are married and several regular tax deductions push your income below the amt exemption amount of $ 45,000 it 's quite possible you would be required to pay amt even if you did n't last year there is a work sheet for amt in the instructions for line 43 but the irs also provides an amt calculator according to page 146 of the instructions for form 1040 amt is paid as the smallest amount you are allowed to report as your taxable income form 1040 line 43 it is also the smallest amount you are allowed to report as your alternative minimum taxable income    on form line 29 if the amt calculation is larger than your taxable income would otherwise be enter the amount from column c on form 1040 line 43 or form line 29   as always congress finds ways to further complicate things by making a few credits and losses deductible against the absolute minimum you 're expected to pay taxes on making the amt a misnomer

corporate restructuring makes everything a so you might as well revisit some core fundamental questions here 's how to do this professionally start floating your cv now line up interviews in competing companies attend to them score a job offer and have it put into writing with exact salary which should be at least of your current one take a clear empty page and write on top business value provided put down your major contributions and achievements wherever possible put the company 's expected dollar value near to it for bonus points sum it up on the bottom and minus your current salary difference is profit provided directly to the company 's bottom line float this to your manager 's desk at this position you have only one fundamental question to your boss match or pass a corporate spin off is a good time to do this 1 to ensure that your position will not be made redundant 2 if it is you have a backup plan if the parent company 's getting rid of you however there are even more fundamental questions you might want to ask yourself is this really a profitable division or merely a loss leader does this company have a future and the adequate growing options for you personally   to answer these questions you must have an opportunity cost estimation and for that you must have second and preferably third options the strategy above to conclude the best time to do your job research is every other month and the best time to ask for a raise is always now good luck

market cap does n't mean that much money went into the system money in equals money out over time and is not directly tied to market cap which can actually be lower if price drops far enough these concepts are the same for all traded assets such as stocks bonds and commodities market cap is simply the current price times the number of shares available in the market so a $ 300 billion market cap does not mean $ 300 billion was paid to somebody to buy it all instead what 's happened is that some money went in at first but much much less and then price increased   bitcoin is a little different in that money in for many innovators and early adopters was in the form of time spent and contributing to the network what they call mining 1 now as to the price jump that 's an effect of market forces for many reasons the market has to buy bitcoin over the last year 2 but many already holding bitcoin were n't ready to sell supply and demand worked in a way that increased price supply low demand high price increases   this situation could easily reverse just as suddenly as the market wanted bitcoin it can decide it does n't want bitcoin supply and demand would work in a way that would decrease price supply high demand low price decreases   this kind of massive market price movement in this short timeframe is exactly what traders mean by volatile it 's actually not that unusual it 's just that most stocks and other assets that experience such gains do n't get much media attention further gains like this often reflect inflated prices market euphoria and trading bubbles all of these terms essentially mean price will correct go down eventually because price is currently much higher than actual value   if the market loses all faith in the asset price will drop to zero and the money in equals money out breaks down some traders will be left holding the bag   meaning they owned the stock at the moment trading permanently ceased 3 notes exact reasons can not be with facts instead we enter the realm of opinion on this point in my opinion bitcoin has increased massively in value mostly due to the media attention it has received and this media attention is not new it received equally pervasive attention in 2013 as an effect price went from under $ 100 to over $ 1000 back to under $ 200 in about 20 months it 's great news if you 're a trader you could have made tons of money as for the early it was actually kind of annoying because it then brought in all the skeptics calling it a ponzi scheme or pyramid scheme despite the quite obvious fact that bitcoin can not be either by definition further upward market forces may have come from the fact that bitcoin is built on an innovative technology that may very well change the way we do a lot of things in the future i 'm referring to blockchain this effect can be seen in several failing companies rising from the like simply by adding the work blockchain to their name i personally find this exactly analogous to the dot com bubble where companies in the late 1990 's made millions in stock simply by adding .com to their name despite having no profits or sometimes not even a working product for high volatility stocks this is not unusual many penny stocks fail and typically the road down is faster than the road up bitcoin may indeed fail but again it 's a bit different than a stock bitcoin is not a company there 's no financials for bitcoin no vc investors board members to report to no product to produce etc bitcoin is designed to simply be a thing itself the hope is to disrupt currency and commodity markets and create a new store of value literally bitcoin is designed to have intrinsic value whether it 's actually working at this point is still unknown

it 's a big dance share price will go up or down based on a number of factors many that have nothing to do with the company operations if a ceo on quarterly returns that will cause long term investors to want that ceo replaced or to sell their shares unless a ceo is weak and ca n't explain the business to shareholders he should n't need to focus on if he does then shareholders short and long will take advantage of the bump in price to exit thus depressing the valuation then new money comes in after ceo is replaced

gt;they especially the atlantic does investigative journalism vice on the other hand does investigative journalism on the level of buzzfeed    the atlantic is a magazine publisher they publish curated content they do not produce that content   buzzfeed was started as a viral lab to track viral content then it developed into a internet media production house that 's why they try to produce viral content but have a general reputation for creating clickbait the most legitimate part of its reporting is that it actually pays reporters to go to things like the press its revenue is about m a year   vice is a broadcast company worth over $ its revenues exceed $ 1b a year particularly due to its lucrative deal with hbo the fact that hbo charges premium prices for access to this content should be enough to distinguish it from outlets like buzzfeed which is completely free and open to access vice is a producer of content and not just a publisher broadcaster of information you 've falsely equated them in quality to buzzfeed perhaps by correlating that they are both recent upstarts   gt;i mean this linked piece is shallow to say the least    correct i 'm very skeptical of anyone reporting on a report that they themselves co wrote while touting co founding an advocacy organization as somehow being a qualifier credential i would normally consider this to be paid content although it is unclear if the writer paid for vice to publish it the quality of the image editing was also very poor of course i doubt this content would ever make it into the more premium vice communication channels specifically i doubt this content would be covered in any capacity on hbo that 's why i said at some point that the quality of its reporting is inconsistent and sometimes quite dubious   gt;why you think vice does quality work is beyond me the only possible reason is you are their main demographic    it 's not because it appeals to me as someone well versed in media politics i ensure that my media diet is diverse and broadly sourced the reason that i think some of their work is good is because i actually read it and think some of it is actually credible and worthy of my time it 's very clear that you do not find vice news credible so you want to act like your perceptions are equal in value and accuracy with my perceptions of it the problem with your logic is that i actually am exposed to its content while you self select not to expose yourself to it i like some of it because i find that some of it has a reasonable basis underlying the claim and i ca n't get the news anywhere else so you think our perceptions are equally accurate although mutually exclusive i.e. we disagree with each other or you think your perceptions are more accurate than mine most likely due to a confirmation bias but the reality is that my perceptions are broadly based considerations based on a much larger sampling of their content while your perceptions amount to an opinion derived from a first impression glance

your assumption that funds sold in gbp trade in gbp is incorrect in general funds purchase their constituent stocks in the fund currency which may be different to the subscription currency where the subscription currency is different from the fund currency subscriptions are converted into the fund currency before the extra money is used to increase holdings an etf on the other hand does not take subscriptions directly but by creation and redemption of shares the principle is the same however monies received from creation of etf shares are converted into the fund currency and then used to buy stock this ensures that only one currency transaction is done in your specific example the fund currency will be usd so your purchase of the shares assuming there are no sellers and creation occurs will be converted from gbp to usd and held in that currency in the fund the fund then trades entirely in usd to avoid currency risk when you want to sell your exposure supposing redemption occurs enough holdings required to redeem your money are sold to get cash in usd and then converted to gbp before paying you this means that trading activity where there is no need to convert to gbp or any other currency does not incur currency conversion costs in practice funds will always have some cash or cash equivalents on hand to pay out redemptions and will have an idea of the number and size of redemptions each calendar period so will use futures and swaps to mitigate fx risk where the same firm has two funds traded in different currencies with the same objectives it is likely that one is a wrapper for the other such that one simply converts the currency and buys the other currency denominated etf as these are exchange traded funds with a price in gbp the amount you pay for the etf or gain on selling it is the price given and you will not have to consider currency exchange as that should be done internally as explained above however there can be a temporary arbitrage opportunity if the price in gbp does not reflect the price in usd and the exchange rate put together

institutions may be buying large quantities of the stock and would want the price to go up after they are done buying all that they have to buy   if the price jumps before they finish buying then they may not make as great a deal as they would otherwise   consider buying tens of thousands of shares of a company and then how does one promote that   also what kind of pr system should those investment companies have to disclose whether or not they have holdings in these companies   this is just some of the stuff you may be missing here the wall street analysts are the investment banks that want the companies to do business through them and thus it is a win win relationship as the bank gets some fees for all the transactions done for the company while the company gets another to try to play up the stock

most likely this will not work they way you think first things first to get a loan the bank needs to accept your collateral note that this is not directly related to the question what you plan to do with the loan example you have a portfolio of stocks and bonds worth usd 2 million the bank decides to give you a loan of usd 1 million against that collateral the bank does n't care if you will use the loan to invest in foreign re or use it up in a casino it has your collateral as safety so from the way you describe it i take it you do n't have the necessary local collateral but you wish to use your foreign investments as such in this case it really does n't matter where you live or where you incorporate a company the bank will only give you the loan if it accepts the foreign collateral from professional experience with this exact question i can tell you there are very few banks that will lend against foreign property and there are even less banks if any that will lend against foreign projects to sum it up just forget banks you might find a private lender to help you out but it will cost you dearly the best option you have is to find a strategic partner who can cough up the money you need but since he is taking the bigger risk he will also take the bigger profit share

if you owned a bank how would you invest the bank 's money   typically banks are involved in loaning out money to businesses people and government at a higher interest rate then what they are paying to depositors   this is the spread and how they make money if the bank determines that the yields on government bonds is more attractive then loaning the money out to businesses and people then the bank will purchase government bonds   it can also decide the other way   in this manner the mortgage and bond markets are always competing for capital and tend to offer very similar yields certain banks have the unique privilege of being able to borrow money from the fed at the federal funds rate and use this money to purchase government debt or loan it out to other banks or purchase other debt products in this manner you see a high correlation between the fed funds rate mortgage rates and treasury yields     other political factors include legislation that encourages mortgage lending see community reinvestment act where banks may not have made the loans without said legislation in short keep your eye on the fed and ask yourself does the fed want rates to rise and can the us government afford rising rates   the answer to these two questions is no   however the fed may be pressured to stop the presses if inflation becomes unwieldy and the fed actually starts to care about food and energy prices   so far this has n't been the case

last month i spend about 3 4 days totally diving into the kindle e books drm etc   my goal was to basically replace my entire book collection online with books that i could edit etc     the result   kindle and the drm suck   the pirate experience an order of magnitude better than the kindle and drm experience   1   not all books are even available on the kindle or other drm platforms   pirated books   not a problem i can pretty much get any book i want in a matter of minutes   sometimes i have to spend a while to find them maybe 10 15 minutes   2   the quality of the drm books are horrible   for kindle they use fixed width graphics   however many of the pdf books that i 've been using use pdfs and vector graphics which means they look nice on my 30 monitor   4   i can use skim to edit and manipulate the books i can attach i can copy text out i can add bookmarks i can highlight pages   in kindle i can do this but it 's very basic and frankly the highlighting sucks and is hard to use     5   the kindle books are handicapped by the publishers and they wo n't let you actually copy text from them some of the publishers do let you do this but i want a consistent experience i do n't want to be reading a book and want to copy a paragraph to a friend only to find out that this is disabled   6   some of the magazine editions suck they are the same price as the news stand one but do n't actually include the full magazine   and no where on the site does it say this some of these do end up getting downvoted in the amazon reviews but i 've accidentally purchased a few of these and felt screwed   7   many most of the books you use do n't actually have an   they 're just flat out stripped removed   this is because the kindle pages and the book pages do n't line up however in pdf versions they are there and they 're working   i think the pdfs are the leaked master copy which they use to print the book   8   some of my kindle books are far inferior to the print edition that i actually own due to misc errors   for example one of them is missing a whole 2 chapters at the end which were author notes after the book was written but the kindle version says it 's the same edition as the one i own   9   what about bugs   if they make a mistake do they give you a new copy of the book   for example in 8 that 's clearly a bug they should have included those two chapters   do i get a new copy of the book when they fix it   will they ever fix it   do my notes highlights work with the new version do i get to keep the older version   in short i do not mind paying   in fact i allocated the money to upgrade my entire book collection to electronic   but i 'll be damned if i do that now the experience is so bad that i do n't want to give them the satisfaction of taking my money for this crap   further e books could be a revolution in the way we perceive books   why are we limiting ourselves to just text   why not interactive graphs spreadsheets charts i should be able to manipulate the examples change numbers zoom in etc     high resolution images for example that look awesome on my 30 display   video included embedded directly into the book   audio and audio commentary by the author   the entertainment industry went this way with dvds to encourage people to buy this format over the version   we need to do this with too     one could do this with html5 but it needs to be done right   some sort of simple zip with html inside which can be viewed by normal browsers    i 'll also say this i 'm not too concerned about the drm   just in terms of innovation this would be a major step forward     books and print media is dying but we could revolutionize it and embrace the digital publishing medium and really kick ass   edit   holy shit that was long the adderall must have just kicked in

it matters because that is the requirement for the 83(b selection to be valid since the context is 83(b election i assume you got stocks options as compensation and did n't pay for them the fmv thus it should have been included in your income for that year if you did n't include the election letter i can only guess that you also did n't include the income hence you lost your election if you did include the income and paid the tax accordingly or if no tax was due you actually paid the fmv you may try amending the return and attaching the letter but i 'd suggest talking to a professional before doing it on your own make sure to keep a proof usps certified mailing receipt of mailing the letter within the 30 days window

not as you suggest since you are sole prop you are taxed on a cash basis within reason you can prepay vendors so temp to hire through an agency might appear more attractive than direct hire but there needs to be a justification other than avoidance of taxes so pre paying 100k on would look fishy as fuck plus your quality of candidate will suffer if you need anything other than low skill labor   look at your other fully deductible expenses anything you can prepay prepay for example i set my liability insurance renewal january 15 to provide optionality but it just shifts one year into another means if you are in the same marginal bracket next year   the irs has also relaxed depreciation on office technology computers are now fully deductible rather than being capitalized   500k revenue you should have a cpa and legal counsel simply incorporating is n't tax magic the purpose is to limit liability not a tax shelter but shitty things happen once you have employees do n't create the potential for a disgruntled employee lawsuit put your shelter at risk of court judgment   that said assuming you are n't dumping a hypothetical on the internet congrats for all the headaches having employees is the ultimate leverage it 's like a xerox machine for your labor including loss of fidelity with each copy
