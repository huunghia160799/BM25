the dutch tax office is pretty decent although slightly do n't expect a lot of help but they 're not generally known for making a lot of problems digital copies are fine for instance they will send you your first vat notice you probably would have known if your company would have been incorporated so i 'll assume you 're just trading as a natural person that means you still have to file vat returns but the business income is just filed annually as other income   for the vat part you 'll need to invoice your customers keep a copy of those invoices for your own bookkeeping and keep track of the matching customer payments together these form the chief evidence of your vat obligation you also have a vat deduction from your purchases it 's a value added tax after all again keep receipts the usual vat period is 3 months so you 'd pay vat 4 times a year but if you would pay less than euro you might not need to pay at all and just need to file annually the income part is easy with the receipts you had for vat purposes anyway dutch tax office vat in english

employees were already cashing out their rsus and selling stock on private markets     gt;even if facebook could resist an eager army of facebook employees is pushing hard for an according to eric of in 2008 facebook adopted a new restricted stock program that prevented employees from selling their shares until an or a sale or if facebook permitted it   they still could have stayed private if they really wanted to   they were compensating employees in stock and those employees wanted to cash out   the underwriters wanted to cash out before the financials became open to public scrutiny

but i wish to know why the parameter is dividend market price rather than just dividend what extra info you can uncover by looking at dividend market price that you can not get from dividend consider two stocks a and b. a offers a dividend of $ 1 per year b offers a dividend of $ 2 per year let 's remove all complications aside and assume that this trend continues if you were to buy each of these stocks you will get the following amounts over its life assumed infinity for simplicity cash flows from a = $ = $ 25 assuming risk free is 4 per annum cash flows from b = $ = $ 50 assuming risk free is 4 per annum the price you buy them at is an important factor to consider because let 's say if a was trading for $ 10 and b for $ 60 then a would look like a profitable while b wo n't of course this is a very simplistic view dividend rates are not constant and many companies pose a significant risk of going bust but this should help illustrate the general idea behind the d p ratio the formula i have used is one for computing the npv of a perpetuity

it 's not so much about time but about intent   if your intent is to move there permanently it would be when you arrive in the state for the purposes of living there i.e. not from a while before that when you went to check a place out or for an interview   i believe that most if not all states expect you to get a driver 's license from that state within of moving there something like a driver 's license or state id would be proof of your residency   these things vary greatly from state to state so you 'd have to research particular states   or find someone who 's done that already a bit of searching specifically for texas brought me to this forum thread if you he wish to establish residency here here being texas get a texas driver 's license and voter registration here government issued id with a texas address is pretty much bulletproof defense against being found to be a resident of elsewhere your battle if there is one will not be with texas but with your present home of record state and/or local government if there are income taxes associated with having been a resident there during the tax year which brings up the other question you would need to make sure that california does not have some provision that would cause you issues   this is n't so much a case of income from a company in the state as it about capital gains but it is still prudent to check

eventually you are going to need some sort of real credit history   it is possible that you will be able to evade this if you never buy a house or if you pay cash for any house condo car boat etc that you buy   even employers check credit history these days   i would n't be surprised if some medical professionals such as surgeons check it also   obviously if you have a mortgage and car loan this does n't apply but i 'd be curious how you acquired those unless you have substantial income and/or assets combine this with the fact that certain things like renting a car essentially require a credit card because they need to put a hold on more money than they are actually going to take out of your card so they can take that money if you do n't bring the car back and i think you should have a credit card unless you and your wife are individuals with zero impulse control which sounds highly improbable if your concern is the financial liability of the credit line just keep the credit line low

its kind of a dumb question because no one believes that you can earn 8 in the short term in the market but for arguments sake the math is painfully easy   keep in mind i am an engineer not a finance guy so the first payment will earn you one month at 8 the second two   in effect three months at 8 on 997   you can do it that way because the payments are equal 997 .08 3 = earnings 20 so with the second method you pay 997 3 20 =

so are you only sexist once you do something about it if you looked at a black applicant and thought the word are you not racist just because you did n't say it and still hires him   and this is n't me trying to be thought police or a sjw despite a few accusations of that in this thread but if you automatically assume that a woman will behave a certain way just because she 's a woman how are you not sexist hiring her does n't change that    but again i find it odd that people state beliefs that are objectively discriminatory but shy away from admitting that they happen to be if you truly feel that men are better workers less prone to gossip and drama then do n't say i 'm not sexist but say i 'm sexist and this is why

littleadv is incorrect because receiving a 1099 means she will be taxed self employment tax on top of federal income taxes your employer will automatically withhold 7.65 of payroll taxes as they pay you each paycheck and then they 'll automatically pay the other half of your payroll tax an additional 7.65 to bring it to a total of 15.3 in other words because your wife is technically self employed she will owe both sides of payroll tax which is 15.3 of $ 38k = $ 5,800 on top of your federal income tax which is the only thing the w-4 is instructing them about what amount to withhold the huge advantage to a 1099 however is that she 's essentially self employed which means all of the things she needs to run her business are deductible expenses this includes her car computer home office supplies sometimes phone gas maintenance travel expenses sometimes entertainment etc which can easily bring her income down from $ 38k to lets say $ 23k reducing both her federal income tax and self employment tax to apply to $ 15k less saving lets say 50 of $ 15k = $ with federal and self employment because your income is so high she is actually supposed to pay quarterly taxes to make up for all of this the easy way to do this is each quarter plug your total salary + bonus and the tax you have paid so far check your into turbotax along with her income so far and all of her expenses this will give you how much tax you can expect to have left to owe so far this would be your first quarter when you calculate your other quarters do it the exact same way and just subtract what you 've already paid so far that year from your total tax liability

is right if a halt is in place then no trading will occur simple as that but in the practice of risk management it is a little different want to remind you that you are assuming that trading is halted immediately upon the drop in price that does n't always happen so if there is any time between the actual price drop and halt of trading then it is possible that your order will be filled depending on how liquid your security is also not every security has circuit breakers in place and the exact requirements to trigger a breaker is not public information   in some cases trades are ordered to be rolled back reversed by the exchange but this is usually reserved for institutional traders who make some sort of mistake   this article below mentions day traders who bought at or near the bottom of the may 6 2010 flash crash this was before circuit breakers but i think it 's a good story for someone looking to understand the finer workings of the electronic market

first of all i am sorry for your loss at this time worrying about money is probably the least of your concerns it might be tempting to try to pay off all your debts at once and while that would be satisfying it would be a poor investment of your inheritance when you have debt you have to think about how much that debt is costing you to keep open since you have on your student loan it does not make sense to pay any more than the minimum payments you may want to look into getting a personal loan to pay off your other personal debts the interest rates for a loan will probably be much less than what you are paying currently this will allow you to put a payment plan together that is affordable you can also use your inheritance as collateral for the loan getting a loan will most likely give you a better credit rating as well you may also be tempted to get a brand new sports car but that would also not be a good idea at all you should shop for a vehicle based on your current income and not your savings i believe you can get the same rates for an auto loan for a car up to 3 years old as a brand new car it would be worth your while to shop for a quality used car from a reputable dealer if it is a certified used car you can usually carry the rest of the new car warranty the biggest return on investment you have now is your employer sponsored 401(k account find out how long it takes for you to become fully vested being vested means that you can leave your job and keep all of your employer contributions if possible max out or at least contribute as much as you can afford to that fund to get employee matching you should also stick with your job until you become fully vested the money you have in retirement accounts does you no good when you are young there is a significant penalty for early withdrawal and that age is currently 59 1/2 doing the math it would be around when you would be able to have access to that money you should hold onto a certain amount of your money and keep it in a higher interest rate savings account or a money market account you say that your living situation will change in the next year as well take full advantage of living as cheaply as you can do n't make any unnecessary purchases try to brown bag it to lunch instead of eating out etc save as much as you can and put it into a savings account you can use that money to put a down payment on a house or for the security and first month 's rent try not to spend any money from your savings and try to support yourself as best as you can from your income make a budget for yourself and figure out how much you can spend every month do n't factor in your savings into it your savings should be treated as an emergency fund since you have just completed school and this is your first big job out of college your income will most likely improve with time it might make sense to job hop a few times to find the right position you are much more likely to get a higher salary by changing jobs and employers than you are staying in the same one for your entire career this generally is true even if you are promoted at the by the same employer if you do leave your current job you would lose what your employer contributed if you are not vested even if that happened you would still keep the portion that you contributed

i think that memoryless in this context of a given stock 's performance is not a term of art imo it 's an anecdotal concept or cliche used to make a point about holding a stock sometimes people get stuck they buy a stock or fund at 50 it goes down to 30 then hold onto it so they can get back to even by holding the loser stock for emotional reasons the person potentially misses out on gains elsewhere

i believe temp agencies get a payout if the employer decides to hire on the temp full time usually so it would be to prevent a temp from quitting and going to work for the employer as a way around that payment the idea is to set a term long enough not to make it worthwhile for the employer to wait rather than paying the fee

as others have addressed the legality in their answers i want to address the idea of the dealership being a middleman a dealership serves more of a purpose than just a car to a consumer actually they consume a great deal of risk let 's remember that a dealership is really an extension of the oem albeit independently owned and operated the dealership must still answer to the brand they represent if people have a bad experience with a dealership a customer might go to another of the same brand but more often than not they will go to the competition out of spite therefore it 's in the dealership 's best interest to represent the brand as best as possible but unfortunately that does n't always happen   while the internet has made a certain part of a salesman 's role null and void and since this is a finance read money q a site let 's take a moment to consider the risk assume and therefore the value added by a dealership test drive a car is a huge purchase and while it 's okay to buy a pair of shoes online without trying them on a car is a bit different of course we want to make sure it fits before we shell out several thousand dollars yes you meaning consumers can look at car pictures and specs online but if you want to see how that vehicle handles on your town 's roads if it fits in your garage and/or driveway then you need to take it for a test drive it 's not feasible for to have millions of people showing up to car plants for a test drive right scalability aside some business that is handled in automotive plants are confidential and not for the general public to know about a dealership provides an opportunity for those who live locally to see and experience the car without flying or driving wherever the car was assembled they provide this at a risk banking on the fact that a good experience with the vehicle will lead to a sale service a car is a machine and no machine is perfect neither will it last forever without proper service a dealership provides a place for people to bring their vehicles when they need to be serviced let 's set aside the fact that the service prices are higher than we 'd like because the fact remains most of it is skilled and labor that the majority of people do n't want to do themselves trade ins it is not in an best interest to accept a vehicle just to sell you another vehicle especially if that vehicle is from another brand dealership 's assume this risk and often offer incentives to do so hoping it will lead to a sale that trade in was an asset to you but is a liability to them because they now have to liquidate that trade in just so that you can purchase a car sure you could sell your car yourself and now you would assume that risk what if your car is not in perfect shape or has a lot of miles for it 's age would it do well in the used car market what if it takes too long to sell and you miss that memorial day car sale at the dealer this might be okay for some but generally speaking most people would rather avoid the risk and trade it in at the dealer toward the purchase of a new car rather than the headache of selling it themselves i 'm sure there are more but those are the one 's that immediately sprung to mind just like starbucks there are terrible dealerships out there and there are great ones and very few of us venture to farms and just for fresh coffee beans

there is no limit on the output maximum in one year the strength of the hsa is that if you do n't spend all the money in the account it rolls over to the next year the benefit is that if a few years down the road you get a huge medical bill you are protected because you can pull it out of the hsa   the goal for me was to build up the account to a level that even if i had to may the maximum out of pocket for my insurance policy the money game from previous years deposits and current year deposits even you ever have the situation where the employer does n't offer a high deductible plan the money for co payments and medicines can still be pulled from the pre existing hsa   if the government did limit you to withdraws not exceeding current year deposits the roll over feature would be worthless

$ for every $ 1000 per year are you kidding me these are usually hidden within the expense ratio of the plan funds but > 1 seems to be quite a lot regardless fund x 1 year return 3 3 year return 6 10 year return 5 what does    that exactly mean this is the average annual rate of return if measured for the last 3 years the average annual rate of return is 6 if measured for 1 year it 's 3 what it means is that out of the last 3 years the last year return was not the best the previous two were much better does that mean that if i hold my mutual funds for 10 years i will get    5 return on it definitely not past performance does n't promise anything for the future it is merely a guidance for you a comparison measure between the funds you can assume that if in the past the fund performed certain way then given the same conditions in the future it will perform the same again but it is in no way a promise or a guarantee of anything since my 401 k plan stinks what are my options if i put my money in a    traditional ira then i lose my pre tax benefits right wrong ira is pre tax as well but the pre tax deduction limits for ira are much lower than for 401k   you can consider investing in the 401k and then rolling over to a ira which will allow better investment options after your update just clearing up the question my current employer has a 401k. most of    the funds have the expense ratio of 1.20 there is no matching    contributions ouch should i convert the 401 k of my old company to traditional ira and    start investing in that instead of investing in the new employer 401 k    plan with high fees you should probably consider rolling over the old company 401k to a traditional ira however it is unrelated to the current employer 's 401k if you 're contributing up to the max to the roth ira you ca n't add any additional contributions to traditional ira on top of that the $ 5000 limit is for both and the agi limitations for roth are higher so you 're likely not able to contribute anything at all to the traditional ira you can contribute to the employer 's 401k you have to consider if the rather high expenses are worth the tax deferral for you

one way of looking at this just expanding on my comment on dheer 's answer if the funds were in eur in germany already and not in the uk would you be choosing to move them to the uk or a gbp denominated bank account and engage in currency speculation betting that the pound will improve    if you would great that 's effectively exactly what you 're doing leave the money in gbp and hope the gamble pays off    but if you would n't do that well you probably should n't be leaving the funds in gbp just because they originated there bring them back to germany and do whatever you 'd do with them there

the major bureaus use the fair isaac scoring model for the most part   here 's an excerpt from a web site versions of the fico scoring model to explain one of the first things a to this board learns is the difference between fico and scores refers to the non fico scores offered by various companies scores have little value since few of them are used by lenders and they do not match closely to fico scores     but even when you stick with fico scores confusion can ensue because fico scores have many different editions versions and variations on a single day a consumer could theoretically have dozens of different fico scores depending on which version and credit agency is used to produce the score    this post provides a summary of the various fico versions please offer any corrections or updates and they will be edited in    the fico scoring model with its familiar range of 300 to 850 was first introduced in 1989 since then fico has released five major revisions    1995 1998 2004 2008 and 2014   each edition uses a different formula and produces a different score    when a new fico edition is released many lenders continue using an older version for years before upgrading the 1995 revision is no longer in common use but later editions are still used by lenders    most fico editions are commonly known by the year of introduction   fico 98 fico 04 and fico 08 although fico now calls it fico score 8 without the zero    the most recent edition is fico score 9 introduced in 2014    as of 2014 fico score 8 is the most commonly used however most mortgage lenders use fico 04 for equifax and transunion and fico 98 for experian    in addition to the classic version fico offers industry option versions customized for auto loans credit cards installment loans personal finance loans and insurance these have a score range of 250 to 900 so the scores are not fully comparable with classic versions as of 2015 auto and scores are available from myfico as described here   citibank provides the equifax fico 8 score free each month to credit cards holders    each credit agency transunion equifax and experian uses a customized version of each fico edition as a result a consumer 's fico scores from each agency may differ even when all credit information is identical among the agencies    because there are many fico versions when a score is received it 's helpful to know which version it is if a lender provides a credit score ask for details such as which credit agency was used which fico edition was used and whether the score is an industry option version the lender may not always be willing or able to provide the answers but it does n't hurt to ask   transunion    official name    fico risk score classic 98     common name      available directly to

850 scores from all three credit agencies as described in this post     in june 2014 a poster named received 850 scores from all three credit agencies as described in this post    this 2011 press

called fico score 9   more info here as of february 2016 the score is now available directly to consumers as described here this new york times article   says fico 9 includes two important changes     unpaid debts that result in collection actions will no longer have a negative effect on a score if the debt has been paid     unpaid medical debts will have less negative effect on scores in 2001 fico released a new scoring model called    it is claimed to be an improvement over classic fico models because it tracks more factors   but it has failed to catch on with lenders because its score range of 150 to 950 is incompatible with the familiar 300 to 850 range requiring lenders to recalculate cutoff scores and revise many rules and policies   only a small percentage of lenders reportedly use transunion    official name    precision    available directly to consumers     no    equifax    official name    pinnacle    available directly to consumers    in 2014 pentagon federal credit union began to provide this score free to its credit card holders as discussed in this post    experian    official name    fico advanced risk score    available directly to consumers     no i included all of this to make the point that there are many variations of the scoring models and all of them are customized to one degree or another by each of the major bureaus as a means of giving their models more credibility as far as they 're concerned to your question about coming up with a fair scoring model can you propose what makes current scoring models unfair   i think it 's a safe assumption to make that the financial community has already had a substantial amount of input into how the current scoring models work   to think otherwise implies that the credit bureaus are just kinda it with whatever they think is best   their models are designed to give their client creditors the best scoring model possible based on what those creditors have stated is important to them there is n't a unified single scoring model out there and the bureaus definitely wo n't share the details of their modifications   you can always come up with your own custom model but how it compares to what 's widely used that 's anyone 's guess i hope this helps good luck

us sanctions are usually very nuanced and you should look them up yourself   it may be widely reported that us sanctions x country and it may be widely understood that it means all funds from anybody in that country are blocked that usually is n't the case or many times is n't the case i 'm not going to bother quantifying that many times it is a comprehensive list of certain individuals and businesses that are blocked the us treasury publishes a list of these organizations this can trickle down to companies you would think big financial companies understand regulations but they typically just react to how things are reported and have no uniform understanding of the financial regulations they are subject to private companies create unique and arbitrary company policies in reaction to the spirit of a regulation so could it be that all can not interact with the us financial system sure that s possible could it be a lot more nuanced sure does it matter if the broker will actually investigate your ssn with uscis maybe maybe not does it matter if you disclose you are a dual citizen if they claim they can just check your ssn   the financial institution is the one liable for sanctions let the consequences guide your actions

you are forgetting one crucial point regarding the money supply   the us federal reserve increases the money supply meaning some of the money is not really loaned it just appears out of nowhere   at first glance this seems even worse over the short term the fed changes the money supply to help the economy in whatever way it sees fit   but over the long term the money supply increases to reflect economic growth   as new technology is introduced more can be accomplished with the same labor and resources and thus the money supply needs to be increased   money is really just a convenient replacement for the barter system so if there are more things to barter for goods and services then there should also be more things to barter with money also keep in mind inflation   the cost of goods and services goes up over time due to the inflation of currency and so the money supply must also be increased so that those goods and services do not artificially increase in value which would be very bad

disclaimer i am not a tax specialist you probably need a sales tax permit if you 're going to sell goods since just about every state taxes goods though some states have exemptions for various types of goods   for services it gets there is a database here that lists what services are taxed in what states in wyoming for example cellphone services and diaper services are taxed while insurance services and barber services are not   for selling over the internet it gets even there 's a guide on that claims to be comprehensive it states that the default rule of thumb is that if you have a physical presence in a state such as a warehouse or a retail shop or an office you must collect tax on sales in that state given your situation you probably only need to collect sales tax on customers in wyoming probably   in any event i 'd advice having a chat with an accountant in wyoming who can help walk you through what permits may or may not be needed

when you initiate a chargeback the merchant has the right to dispute the chargeback   if they can provide proof that the purchase actually took place the chargeback will fail we do n't know all the details of your situation of course but it appears from what you have said that the tax chain probably has documents that you signed agreeing to the charges   they prepared your return even if they did a poor job and so from their perspective they have decided that they deserve to be paid   whether or not they did a good job is a matter of opinion of course their position might be that they did it correctly and the second business did it poorly    the chargeback is a powerful tool but it is not a magic button that makes a charge disappear   if the merchant can show that a sale did indeed take place and show that the proper amount was charged the chargeback will fail   for a service it is n't enough usually to simply state that you were unsatisfied if you received the service at the agreed upon price the charge is valid a chargeback is sort of a nuclear option when it comes to getting a refund   there are negative ramifications and expenses every time a merchant gets a chargeback even if they ultimately win and so often they will be willing to work something out to avoid a chargeback   you should go to the merchant first if you can and ask for a refund before considering the chargeback option   if you file a chargeback without even giving them the opportunity to work it out with you the merchant will usually want to fight back

stop loss orders are the exact opposite of what you should be doing if you are implementing a long term buy and hold strategy the motivation of a buy and hold strategy is that in the long term the market rises even despite the occasional crash or recession setting a stop loss simply increases the probability that you will sell for a low price in a temporary market downturn unless you are likely to need near term liquidity in which case you 're not a long term investor that makes no sense

to answer length validity and security implications of draft checks issued and negotiated within the united states i am heavily addressing the common erroneous assumptions of where the funds sit while they 're in a draft check and how to get them out tl;dr the existing answers are incomplete and in some ways dangerously misleading jerry can still be potentially defrauded by tom and even if the check is legitimately drawn and negotiable jerry may still experience delayed access to the funds the funds sit in an account held by the issuing bank as long as the bank has sufficient funds the check does however there are significantly more factors that go into whether a check will be returned unpaid bounce if i hand you $ 5000 in cash will you give me $ 5000 in cash probably and you 'd probably be pretty safe how about i give you a $ 5000 draft check will you give me $ 5000 in cash without doing anything except looking at it to verify the check i hope not cash america sure would n't but people sell expensive goods with the same as cash attitude remember the only non cash form of payment which can not somehow be held reversed or returned unpaid in the u.s. without consent of the receiving party is a payment order a.k.a wire transfer the draft check is as good as cash in the sense that the money for a draft check is withdrawn from your account before the check is negotiated deposited this does not mean that a draft check will not bounce so jerry is not as secure in handing the goods to tom as if tom had handed him cash as it is still a check jerry 's bank will not receive the funds for tom 's draft check for an average 3 to 5 business days same as a personal check jerry will probably have access to the first $ 5000 within two business days provided that he deposits the draft check in person at his bank 's branch or in a bank owned atm in the united states regulation cc governs funds availability regarding official draft or tellers checks if the customer desires next day availability of funds from these checks your bank may require use of a special deposit slip   mobile deposit availability in the u.s. is not regulated in this way and will likely be subject to a longer hold on more if not all of the check draft checks do n't as a habit bounce in the sense of returned for insufficient funds this is because they are prepaid and drawn upon a financial institution 's account banks are insolvent far less frequently than other businesses or individuals draft checks tellers checks official checks bank checks etc can however be returned unpaid if one of the following is true as an aside an institution is not obligated to honor a stale dated check but may do so at its discretion if you have a personal check outstanding for over 6 months it may still clear and potentially overdraw your account in this case contact your bank asap to process a reversal the depositing bank mis scans the check and the issuing bank refuses the resulting data i have seen systems mis read which data field is which or its contents also there is the possibility the image if the check will be to the issuing bank the draft check has been cancelled stop paid this can happen if   a the check was fraudulently bought from the issuing bank using tom 's account   b tom has completed an agreement that the check was lost or otherwise not used for its intended purpose without fraud having occurred against tom c the draft check is paid to the state as unclaimed property this case is a subset of case 1 but will lead to a different return reason stamped on the image replacement document of the check the draft check was never any good in the first place because of the perception that draft checks are as good as cash they 're not but are a lot better than personal checks forgery and attempted fraud is shockingly common these are n't actually underwritten by a real bank even if they appear to be the only money in them is what the fraudster can get out of you jerry did not properly endorse the check before presenting it for deposit or otherwise negotiating it in my time in banking i most commonly saw cases 3 and 4 unlike most counterfeit cash case 3 will fool jerry and jerry 's teller tom gets an immediate payout a car a wire transfer a payday loan etc and jerry 's bank does n't know the check is n't valid until they call the alleged issuing bank to verify its or in the case of smaller checks into lower risk accounts it is simply returned unpaid as fraudulently drawn to conclude call the alleged issuing bank 's verification line before handing over the goods always properly endorse your deposits and address what happens if one does not receive or collect on prompt payment in your contracts

none taken good thoughts it would be making the same mistake to blindly accept my criticism as many will make blindly accepting this journalist 's graphs let 's see if i can address your concerns   the reason the scale is problematic to me is exactly what you said   gt i hope people would be looking at more than just a line   and i do n't think that they do the scales were adjusted so that the lines were nearly identical on someone 's computer screen but that implies a false equivalency between the debts of households corporations state and local gov and the fed i think the author has left leaning read the accompanied article that outlines who you will vote for link on the last slide not necessarily a bad thing but he frames all of this from the idea that his statistics can not be skewed and he is therefore presenting central to the left 's argument is that the federal government 's size is not of the biggest concern and if you got the average american thinking that 15 trillion is no big deal because households have a huge debt too or corporations do too or states do too i believe that to be dangerous i think i identified his bias and that his graphs are slightly manipulated to coerce less individuals to his side happens all the time but all of those facts are dead on in regards to the data again trying to keep my politics out of this simply criticizing the graphs and the subtle message they are sending under the guise of being neutral   i would agree with your point normally since contractors are temporary and often as you pointed out cost efficient from a benefits standpoint they also tend to be more efficient but this is not central to our point the problem is that the government has the longest war in our history going but we are n't really fighting anyone for the scale of our spending trillions of dollars have gone into this effort and one of the results has been the development of a quasi economy in iraq and now the numbers are staggering of how many of these people are employed or make a living off of this war effort but this is not like most contractors where you would add them to the dod 's budget as you pointed out and the difference i would is the permanent status of the employment after what length of time would you say a contractor for the dod working on computer programs in the pentagon is the equivalent of an employee and therefore must be counted in statistics such as the one the graph in question purports to 2 years 5 years certainly after a decade right remember the graph is trying to show that the number of government employees is not a problem or at least not a significant but calling an apple a banana does n't make it yellow i think political slight in hand with statistics as important as these should be criminal   sorry i got long winded but i hope i addressed your concerns it sounds like you are one of the few people who thinks critically when presented with data such as that which is in these 64 slides but remember for every one of you there may be a thousand people who are brainwashed by any data you put in front of them

thanks for your question dai the circumstances under which these buyouts can occur is based on the us takeover code and related legislation as well as the laws of the state in which the company is incorporated it 's not actually the case that a company such as dell needs to entice or force every shareholder to sell what is salient is the conditions under which the bidder can acquire a controlling interest in the target company and effect a merger this usually involves acquiring at least a majority of the outstanding shares methods of acquisition the quickest way for a company to be acquired is the one step method in this case the bidder simply calls for a shareholder vote if the shareholders approve the terms of the offer the deal can go forward any legal or other to the deal in the two step method which is the case with dell the bidder issues a tender offer which you mentioned where the current shareholders can agree to sell their shares to the bidder usually at a premium if the bidder secures the acceptance of 90 of the shares they can immediately go forward with what is called a short form merger and can effect the merger without ever calling for a shareholder meeting or vote any stockholders that hold out and do not want to sell are squeezed out once the merger has been effected but retain the right to redeem their outstanding shares at the valuation of the tender offer in the case you mentioned if shareholders controlling 25 of the shares not necessarily 25 of the shareholders were to oppose the tender offer there would be alternatives if the bidder did not have at least 51 of the shares secured they would likely either increase the valuation of the tender offer or choose to abandon the takeover if the bidder had 51 or more of the shares secured but not 90 they could issue a proxy statement call for a shareholder meeting and a vote to effect the merger or they could increase the tender offer in order to try to secure 90 of the shares in order to effect the short form merger if the bidder is able to secure even 51 of the shares either through the proxy or by way of a controlling interest along with a consortium of other shareholders they are able to effect the merger and squeeze out the remaining shareholders at the price of the tender offer majority rules some states laws specify additional circumstances under which the bidder can force the current shareholders to exchange their shares for cash or converted shares but not delaware where dell is incorporate there are also several special cases with a top up provision if the company 's board management is in favor of the merger they can simply issue more and more shares until the bidder has acquired 90 of the total outstanding shares needed for the short form merger top up provisions are very common in cases of a tender offer if the board management opposes the merger this is considered a hostile and they can effect poison pill measures which have the opposite effect of a top up and dilute the bidders percent of outstanding shares however if the bidder can secure 51 of the shares they can simply vote to replace the current board who can then replace the current management such that the new board and management will put into place whatever provisions are amenable to the bidder in the case of a short form merger or a vote to effect a merger the shareholders who do not wish to sell have the right to sell at the tender price or they can oppose the deal on legal grounds by arguing that the valuation of the tender offer is materially unfair however there are very few cases which i 'm aware of where this type of challenge has been successful however they do not have the power to stop the merger which has been agreed to by the majority of the shareholders this is similar to how when the president is elected the minority voters ca n't stop the new president from being or how you can be affected if you own a condo and the condo owners association votes to change the rules in a way you do n't like tough luck for you if you do n't like it if you want more detail i 'd recommend checking out a web guide from 2011 here as well as related articles from the harvard law blog here i hope that helps

the australian tax office website shows tax rates for individuals based on the income earned in the financial year calculating what you 'll be taxed for instance it show that every dollar you earn up to $ you are not taxed every dollar over that up to $ is taxed at 19 cents and so on example 1 so as an example if your income for the year is $ 25,000 you will be taxed $ working here 's how it 's look if you were doing it in a spreadsheet using the tax rates table on the ato website as a guide   example 2 if you income is $ 50,000 it 'd look like this   withholding your employer is obligated to remove the taxable part from your wage each time your paid they do that using the calculation above   if at the end of the financial year the ato determines that too much as been withheld ie you 've claimed deductions that 've reduce your taxable income to less than what your actual income is that 's when you may be eligible for a refund if your employer did n't withhold enough or you had income from other sources that have n't been taxed already then you may actually need to pay rather than expecting a refund your question if you earn $ in the year and for some reason your employer did withhold tax from your pay say $ 2,000 then yes you 'll get all that $ 2,000 back as a refund since the tax rate for income up to $ is $ 0.00 if you earned $ and your employer withheld $ 2000 you 'd get $ back as a refund $ 2000 you have to pay tax on that $ 1 over $

a public company should have a link for investor relations which should help provide a trail of basis if this is a matter of company buyout takeover etc   this gets you close but if you do n't have an exact date it will just be close not exact   one clean way out of this assuming the goal is to get rid of the stock and move on is to donate the shares to charity you will take the present value as a deduction and be done you can use a charitable gift fund such as those offered by schwab or fidelity so if say the shares are worth $ 20 k and you typically donate $ 5 k per year the fund lets you do this transaction at once then send to the charities you wish over the next few years

so like any market the housing market will on average trend upward but the extreme prices we 're seeing in toronto or san francisco are not part of the normal market growth there 's a lot of factors that can affect housing outside of just increased demand here 's a few of the big ones   1 low interest rates since 2008 i think interests rates have been really low meaning mortgages are really low if you can borrow money at 4 and the inflation rate is 8 you 've borrowed expensive dollars and are paying back in cheap dollars   not in my back yard if you have enough land to build 10 houses or one 100 apartment building what do you build theoretically the apartment building but in reality the people that already paid for their million dollar house do n't want a giant apartment complex bringing down the value of the neighborhood and ruining their views so they pass laws preventing new and bigger buildings meaning higher prices for the homes that already exist and as a bonus it 's easier on the city to have 10 people who make a million dollars a year than a 100 people who make 100,000 a year   foreign investment so there 's a lot of places where people have money but because of corruption or shaky economies it 's not safe to hold it there so you buy properties in the u.s. or canada because you know no one 's going to seize it and it 's generally not going to lose value so you end up with foreign dollars competing with the local markets for housing driving the price up

anyone who suggests unions are anti capitalist has their head completely up their ass   and this whole ban collective bargaining thing which people have been trying to do in certain places confuses the hell out of me   collective bargaining is n't even a right it 's a natural consequence of having more than 2 people in any given system   it 's inherent   it might as well be a physical law   it 's impossible to ban   and it 's the very epitome of what a free market system stands for   if the free market allows corporations to form i.e. people coming together for mutual benefit in industry then they certainly allow labor unions to form i.e. people coming together for mutual benefit in industry   they 're the same fucking thing

really you should only use words you understand particularly if you 're going to throw one single word into an argument and act as if that 's all you need to say   if the price were perfectly elastic then for every increase in cost in airline flights people would spend exactly enough less on flights to counteract that     what you mean is that price will mitigate this   but in fact since the elasticity of the market is almost certainly negative like almost all markets the airlines will in fact lose some money for every such tax put on them   less money than the cost of the tax yes because of the of the market but some   wiki

the hard and fast rule is to pay off high interest loans first but each individual 's situation is different so there are some things to consider student loan interest is tax deductible up to $ 2,500   will your student loan interest exceed $ 2,500 for the year   if so i would try to pay down the student loan first to bring down the total interest for the year so that you get as much interest back as possible on your tax return   also it may be beneficial to pay off the car first to close that account so that you are only left with the 1 loan   once you have the car loan payment out of the way you can dedicate that amount to paying off the student loan i 'm in almost the same situation as you   i currently have a mortgage and car payment   in 6 months my grace period will be over and my student loan payments will start   i have $ 100k in student loan debt   so i will have a $ 1,100 mortgage payment $ 1,100 student loan payment and $ 700 car payment car loan is 0   i do n't want to have 3 loans active so i will pay off my car loan in a 2 3 months to get that out of the way   then i will pay down my student loan by paying $ 700 extra every month

great topic as interest rate swaps are one of the most commonly used derivatives by bank in the simplest form an interest rate swap is an exchange of payments between two parties    say party a has a $ 100 loan with a fixed 4.25 interest rate and party b also has a $ 100 loan with a variable rate lets say prime plus 1 prime is 3.25 so b is also paying 4.25    party a thinks interest rates are going to go lower and wants to lower his interest expense while party b is a small company and does n't want to be exposed to variable interest rates and needs to have a steady cash flow to project his budget   party a and b agree to enter into an interest rate swap for a notional amount of $ 100 where party a agree to pay b prime plus 1 fixed for floating and party b agrees to pay a 4.25 floating for fixed for some period of time they agree upon usually the maturity of the loan   now from the start the swap has a market value of $ 0 since a and b both receive the same as they are paying as interest rates move the value of the swap moves say interest rates fall and prime is now 2 b still pays 4.25 to a he agreed to pay a fixed 4.25 no matter what and a only pays 3 prime plus 1 to b. remember the terms of the individuals loans did not change so a owes $ 4.25 to his bank and b owes $ 3 to his bank party a uses the $ 4.25 from b to pay his bank and pays $ 3 to b. party a has lowered his interest expense by $ 1.25 and his position is considered in the money which means he is benefitting from the transaction party b gets $ 3 from a but still owes his bank $ 4.25 in reality the transaction nets out to b paying a $ 1.25 rather than both a and b paying each other different amounts b is out of the money because in aggregate he is paying a. the market value of the swap would be the present value of that $ 1.25 benefit a receives discounted using expected future interest rates the same number but negative is the value to b   please ask if you have additional questions or need

wiki consumer surplus consumer surplus is the difference between the maximum price a consumer is willing to pay and the actual price they do pay the aggregate consumers surplus is the sum of the consumer 's surplus for all individual consumers   efficient production provides more product at lower prices thus the difference between willing to pay amount and actual price is increased plus as more product is produced more people enjoy the benefit so the aggregate consumer surplus is increased simply by increasing the number of consumers

that sounds about right however and this is just a quibble it 's not 90 m notional of swap or at least i 've not heard it expressed quite that way for a total return instrument generally i hear the word exposure in this case the of shares purchased at a specific index level so 90 mm exposure in s&amp;p 500 at today 's closing price is = a swap on 37 shares   if you want to maintain the 90 mm exposure month to month you will structure the instrument with a variable notional at each reset the swap 's of shares will vary inversely with the index level to maintain the 90 mm exposure   you rightly point out that the financing is based on the 90 mm figure   as a final note the dealer may also guarantee some profit by quoting a spread between the swap 's initial index levels depending on whether the portfolio wants to go long or short the index

treat each transaction as separate with its own principal its own gain and its own number of days   then the total annualized return is just a weighted average of each annualized return with the weighting related to the number of shares in that transaction

i 'm a debt guy hence the bias i guess   's answer is relevant   as for considering alternatives in a given situation it sometimes happen is often done through a combination of equity and debt for example    mostly issuing equity dilutes control and potential dividend returns while debt pushes your interest charges up and adds pressure to or refinance later balancing the two will depend on the company 's intentions it 's capacities servicing debt requires a more stable cash flow generation capacity while equity is more rewarded by strong growth potential and a host of other factors

your question is one of semantics   etfs and mutual funds have many things in common and provide essentially the same service to investors with minimal differences   it 's reasonably correct to say an etf is a mutual fund that and then follow up with some stuff that is not true of a typical mutual fund   you could do the same with for example a hedge fund   a hedge fund is a mutual fund that does n't comply with most sec regulations and thus is limited to accredited investors as a matter of practice when people say mutual fund they are talking about traditional mutual funds and pretty much never including etfs   so is an etf a mutual fund as the word is commonly used   no

for example started an animation studio and production developing company to produce something in the ballpark of $ and he had a $ 12k yearly salary i have no clue what you mean as others have mentioned i 'm not sure what the 12 million refers to   do you mean total cost of created by the company in a year or   if so 12 million would amount to say 5 to 20 major brand name tv commercials for example   do you mean the cost of plant so for a tv commercial production company you mean purchasing desks drawing pads and so on your specific example of a film or tv commercial production company is a bad example it 's not really a business that is to say it does not rely on capital and return on capital the way famous film or tv commercial production companies happens is precisely like this a young guy girl g perhaps a designer or is working just as you say for a menial wage at a film company g got that first job perhaps out of art school   g gets a chance at doing a photo shoot animation or helping direct a tv commercial   g does a fantastic job later that year a large important animation or commercial job arrives at the company due to the earlier excellent result g is allowed to work on the new one g again he does a fantastic job   soon within that company g is a highly regarded or director and has attracted fame amongst colleagues and clients eventually g hears of a company xyz hotel that needs a tv ad made or an animation or whatever g says to xyz look you could spend $ 230,000 with a production company and in reality they 'd have me direct it anyway i 'm leaving to work independently so i will do your job for only $ 190,000 in a word xyz says yes and hands over a cheque for $ 190,000   g spends $ 160,000 on the usual actors editing etc and uses 2 months of g 's own time and pockets $ 5000 after tax g then does n't get a job for a couple months and then gets three more in the new year because the commercial for xyz was so good xyz gave him another couple to do for another product line eventually g has just enough money coming in that he hires a few freelance people for a few weeks here and there a and so on   eventually g has enough tv ads solidly booked g can risk actually hiring long time friend p as a producer   p spends most of her time actually bringing in more work and it builds from there eventually you have a very busy well known in the industry tv commercial production company with many staff and endless clients example say it might be at some point in there say around year three g would like to borrow the odd million bucks to basically help with cashflow the answer to that is nothing more than through business contacts g knows a wealthy dentist whoever who is prepared to do that but note carefully that at that point g 's company is already very firmly established famous for doing 20 spectacular commercials and so on   note too that 999 times out of 1000 when this happens the money evaporates and the dentist d never sees a penny back in that case g only much much later once the company has many many staff and great cashflow could the production company actually borrow from a bank or perhaps from actual investors which is more what you have in mind regarding your four categories   numbers 1 and 3 are totally wrong they do not work at all like you are asking indeed the very simple answer is borrow money to start a category 1 or 3 type of business it 's totally the only exception would be if you literally just have an extremely rich uncle who loans you a few million to start an animation studio which would be completely   because in that example company xyz could not care less if you have an animation studio ie your uncle has given you a platinum card and you bought a building some drawing pads and a few dozen macs   xyz just could n't care less   all they care about is your folio of work   in this example rsa would get the job     my guess is you 're thinking people somehow magically go around borrowing money to get businesses like that started   your examples 1 and 3 the simple answer is they do n't and ca n't   your fears are

utilization is near real time what that means is that what is reported is what is taken in terms of debt to income dti ratios when a mortgage broker pulls your credit they will pull the latest balances with the minimum payments this is what is taken to determine dti along with your gross monthly income if you do not pay your account in full before the statement date then you more than likely will have to wait an additional statement cycle before it reports to the credit bureaus therefore your utilization is dynamic and the history of your utilization month to month is not recorded forever only the current balance what is maintained and reported is your payment history so you want to never be late if you want to be approved anytime soon for a mortgage a lower dti will not help your interest rate as long as you stay away from the maximum dti for the mortgage vehicle you are attempting to be approved for va fha conventional etc then your dti should not be a concern if you are borderline at the time of underwriting you can take the opportunity and pay off the balances the mortgage company can then do what is called a credit supplement which entails contacting those lenders where you have proven you have a zero balance and manually input the zero balance cards that have not yet reported to the bureaus in your final application to the mortgage company for underwriting approval

the home owner will knock 20 off the price of the house if the house is worth $ k then 20 is just a discount your landlord is offering   so your actual purchase price is $ 237 k and therefore a bank would have to lend you $ since the house is worth more than the loan you have equity   20 to be more accurate   another way to say is the bank only wants to loan you 80 of the value of the item securing the loan if you default on day one they can sell the house to somebody else for $ k and get a 20 return on their loan so this 20 you are worried about is n't actually money that anybody gives anybody else it is just a concept

all you have to do is ask warren buffet that question and you 'll have your answer grin   he is the very definition of someone who relies on the fundamentals as a major part of his investment decisions investors who rely on analysis of fundamentals tend to be more long term strategic planners than most other investors who seem more focused on momentum based thinking there are some industries which have historically low p e ratios such as utilities but i do n't think that implies poor growth prospects   how often does a utility go out of business    i think oftentimes if you really look into the numbers there are companies reporting higher earnings and earnings growth but is that top line growth or is it the result of cost cutting and other measures which artificially imply a healthy and growing company   a healthy company is one which shows year over year organic growth in revenues and earnings from sales not one which has to continually make new acquisitions or use accounting tricks to dress up the bottom line is it possible to do well by investing in companies with solid fundamentals   absolutely   you may not realize the same rate of short term returns as others who use momentum based trading strategies but over the long haul i 'm willing to bet you 'll see a better overall average return than they do

as long as you paid 90 of the taxes you owed you are good and there will be no negative consequences these calculations are supposed to help you find the right amount not to bind you to it so you do n't need to worry too much about the most common problem is that people underpay and not come up to the 90 limit and do n't have the cash to pay when tax day comes if you happen to come in under 90 which will come out when you file taxes you will owe interest for the underpayment as you should have paid it some time ago typically 0.5 per month also up to 10 in addition depending on the situation this is expensive so you should avoid it and playing to hit is dangerous better try to hit about 100 and use the 90 limit as safety margin as intended

in general you are allowed to deduct up to $ 50/month per student see page 4 but only if you are n't reimbursed in your case since you are receiving a stipend the full $ 2000 will be treated as taxable income but the question of is it worth it really depends on how much you will actually spend and also what you 'll get from the experience suppose you actually spend $ 1000/month to host them and if your combined tax rate is 35 you 'll pay $ 700 in additional taxes each month but you 'll still profit $ 300 each month if your primary motivation for hosting students is to make a profit you could consider creating a business out of it if you do that you will be able to deduct all of your legitimate business expenses which in the above example would be $ 1000/month keeping with that example you would now pay taxes on $ 1000 instead of $ 2000 which would be $ 350 meaning your profit would now be $ increasing your profit by $ 350/month you will only need to keep spending records if you plan to go the business route my advice assume you wo n't be going the business route and then figure out what your break even point is based on your tax rate the formula is max you can spend per month without losing money = 2000 2000 t e.g. if t = 35 the break even point is $ 1300 side note my family hosted 5 students in 5 years and it was always a fantastic experience but it is also a very big commitment teenagers eat a lot and they drive cars and go on dates and play sports and need help with their homework especially english papers and they do n't seem to like bed times or imho it 's totally worth it even without the stipend

term life insurance is just that life insurance that pays out if you die just like car insurance pays out if you have an accident like car insurance it 's easy to compare amongst term life insurance policies you can even compare quotes online   whole life insurance is life insurance plus an investment component the money that you pay goes to pay for your life insurance and it also is invested by the insurance company insurance companies love whole life because it is not a commodity they can come up with a large variety of variants and that fact plus the fact that it combines insurance and investment means that is very difficult to compare policies not to mention that fact that none of the companies as far as i can tell publish their whole life insurance rates so it is very difficult to shop around

yes you can make a direct hsa contribution and deduct it on your 1040 to see an immediate tax benefit for the tax year you can even make a contribution for the previous tax year all the way through tax day of the following year if you opt to do this be sure to contact your financial institution before making the contribution to make sure they apply it to the appropriate tax year just be careful not to exceed the yearly caps so long as you have had coverage all year this is easy to do if you 've only had coverage for part of the year and it 's not your first year with an hsa plan you may need to do some math to make sure you are n't breaking the contribution rules

if they leave the extra funds in the account the irs will consider it as employer match they were n't funds from your paycheck they were from the employers profits because they do n't have a formal matching program the extra funds will still keep then under the max match   there is one other explanation that needs to be considered if the last paycheck from 2011 was near the end of the year the last friday of 2011 was december 30th the 401 k funds from that final paycheck may not have been deposited into your 401 k until early january 2012 if you count contributions when looking at your 401 k statement it will look like one two many for 2012 but the irs only cares when it was deducted from your paycheck not when it was deposited into your account the department of labor only requires they be deposited by the 15th of the following month

there are two reasons for incorporating a business in canada limiting liability and providing some freedom in structuring your taxes since you are asking about taxes i will restrict myself to that topic first of all remember that if you do n't make much money there is n't much tax to save by clever structuring of your affairs and if you do incorporate you will pay taxes as a corporation and pay taxes again on your salary paid from that corporation it can still be advantageous because the small business tax rate is less that the higher tax brackets of personal taxes and you do n't have to pay out all of the profit as salary if you do n't incorporate you still must pay taxes on your net income from the business see brian 's answer definitely keep track of your income and expenses even if you do n't plan on making money in case you get audited if the cra wants to call your hobby a business you will need to show that you have n't made any profit i am just giving you a few bits of advice because this subject is complicated too complicated for an answer on this site if you are still interested go to your local library and get some books on the subject

taking out your equity when refinancing means that you take out a new loan for the full value of your house perhaps less 20 as a down payment on the new mortgage otherwise you 'll be paying insurance pay off your old lender and keep the rest for yourself the result is much the same as using as a heloc or home equity loan or a second mortgage except it 's all rolled into a single new mortgage the advantage is that the interest rate on a first mortgage is going to be lower than on heloc or equivalent and the equity requirements may be lower e.g. a heloc may only let you borrow against the amount of equity that exceeds 25 or 30 while a new mortgage will require you only to have 20 equity   this is especially attractive to those whose homes have appreciated significantly since they bought them especially if they have a lot of high interest debt e.g. credit cards they want to pay off of course rolling credit card debt into a 30-year mortgage is n't actually paying it off but the monthly payments will be a lot lower and if you 're lucky and your home appreciates further you can pay it off fully when you sell the property and still have paid a lot less interest the downside is that you have turned unsecured debt into secured debt which puts your home at risk if you find yourself unable to pay in your case you do n't yet have even 20 equity in your home so i would n't recommend this   equity is simply the difference between the amount you still owe on your home and the amount you 'd get if you were to sell it until you do sell it this amount is tentative based on the original purchase price and perhaps an intervening appraisal that shows that the property has appreciated that is really all that it is and there 's nothing magic about it except that since you own your home you have equity in it while as a renter you would not it used to be decades ago when you needed 20 down to get a mortgage that selling was the only time you 'd be able to do anything with the equity in your home now you can take it out as described above or borrow against it thanks to various financial products it is sometimes tempting to consider equity roughly equivalent to profit but some of it is your own money contributed through the down payment your monthly principal payment and improvements you have made so cashing out is n't all profit it 's partly just you getting your own money back and there are many additional expenses involved in owning a home such as interest property taxes maintenance utilities and various fees not to mention the commissions when you buy or sell which the equity calculation does n't consider increasing equity reflects that you own a desirable property in a desirable location that you have maintained and maybe even improved it that you are financially responsible i.e. paying your mortgage taxes etc and that your financial interests are aligned with your neighbors all those things feel pretty good and they should otherwise it is just a number that the banks will sometimes let you borrow against

just to clarify in wikipedia when it says   it is defined as a market in which money is provided for periods longer than a year they are referring to the company which is asking for money so for example the stock market provides money to the issuing company of an ipo indefinitely meaning the company that just went public is provided with money for a period longer than a year the definition in investopedia basically says the same thing wikipedia does it is just phrased slightly different and leaves out the for periods longer than a year   for example wikipedia uses the term business enterprises and governments while investopedia uses the term private sector and public sector in this context business enterprise is private sector and governments is public sector   so in the sense of the length debt is issued yes money market would be the opposite of a capital market but both markets still offer a place for governments and companies to raise money and both are classified as financial markets

you mentioned you have a bunch of credit cards with no balance while others have fairly high balances i would not recommend you to close the 0 balance credit cards if they have lower apr you can transfer the balance to those cards with lower apr now if those 0 balance cards do not have lower apr closing them will reduce my overall balance and hurt my credit rating and that is true assume that you mean overall credit line instead of overall balance but to my understanding if you keep the payments good and on time that effect is only temporary and therefore you can definitely close them   do n't forget paying off your balance can also lower your utilization rate and therefore increase your credit ratings and you can focus more on that instead also larger number of accounts with amounts owed can indicate higher risk of over extension therefore you should pay off your low balance accounts first and do not open new credit accounts until you have paid off the current balance

the market is not stupid it that a company is worth less after paying out dividends than before paying them it 's obvious since that company has just given out part of its earnings so after a company pays out dividends its stock price normally drops approximately by the amount paid therefore if you buy get the dividend and immediately sell under normal conditions you wo n't make any profit

insert usual disclaimer that i 'm just a random guy on the internet not any kind of certified tax professional but once i withdraw the money how is that money taxable if i 'm understanding your situation correctly you want to look at the instructions for form 8889 under excess employer contributions it simply says if the excess was not included in income on form w-2 you must report it as other income on your tax return there does n't look to be any particular wording beyond that so i 'd just put it on form 1040 line 21 other income and label the line really specifically like excess employer contributions distributed from hsa also there is no mention of whether any fica taxes social security and medicare apply to these amounts you say that this was entirely contributed by the employer but even for cases where one contributes directly through payroll with an optional pre tax deduction this is usually implemented as a salary reduction agreement where the company is actually paying less money in salary and thus less showing up on the w-2 and just contributing to the hsa account instead it 's listed on the 8889 as an employer contribution even if in fact one sees it as a deduction on one 's pay stub in either case since the company did n't pay you the money as salary and merely contributed to the hsa instead i would n't expect any fica taxes to be owed on it the fact that the irs wants it listed under other income instead of wages also implies to me that it does n't count as salary that needs fica taxes presumably if people abused this in some way like getting their employer to deliberately over contribute each year and getting a refund in some sort of crazy scheme to try to reduce their ss taxes the government would get rather upset and probably call it some sort of tax evasion but for the amounts involved here particularly as you 're following the instructions listed i just would n't worry about it assuming that i withdraw excess contribution and report everything on form 8889 and form 1040 is there any further action required from my previous employer it 's your hsa so i would n't think so since the eligibility for hsas is based on what you do and not what they do you could for instance get covered by a different hdhp and they would n't be notified nor really care i do n't think they have anything more to do with it also i am not sure how to calculate amount of interest attributable to excess contribution i have only around $ 0.20 of total interest this year the bank holding the hsa could probably help with that as i 'd expect it to be a normal part of the excess contribution withdrawal process if not i 'd just make a reasonable effort based on the interest rate amount involved and number of days that the excess was in the account also keep in mind that in general when filing taxes anything under $ can round to $ 0 at some point one can only be as honest as the law allows

here is another way to look at it does this debt enable you to buy more car than you can really afford or more car than you need if so it 's bad debt let 's say you do n't have the price of a new car but you can buy a used car with the cash you have you will have to repair the car occasionally but this is generally a lot less than the payments on a new car the value of your time may make sitting around waiting while your car is repaired very expensive if like me you can earn money in fine grained amounts anywhere between 0 and 80 hours a week and you do n't get paid when you 're at the mechanic 's in which case it 's possible to argue that buying the new car saves you money overall debt incurred to save money overall can be good compare your interest payments to the money you save if you 're ahead great and the fun or joy or potential of your new car is simply gravy now let 's say you can afford a $ 10,000 car cash there are new cars out there at this price but you want a $ 30,000 car and you can afford the payments on it if there was no such thing as borrowing you would n't be able to get the larger car and some people suggest that this is bad debt because it is helping you to waste your money you may be getting some benefit such as being able to get to a job that 's not served by public transit or being able to buy a cheaper house that is further from your job or saving time every day from the first $ 10,000 of expense but the remaining $ 20,000 is purely for fun or for showing off and should n't be spent   certainly not by getting into debt well that 's a philosophical position and it 's one that may well lead to a secure retirement think about that and you may decide not to borrow and to buy the cheaper car finally let 's say the cash you have on hand is enough to pay for the car you want and you 're just trying to decide whether you should take their cheap loan or not generally if you do n't take the cheap loan you can push the price down so before you decide that you can earn more interest elsewhere than you 're paying here make sure you 're not paying $ 500 more for the car than you need to since your loan is from a bank rather than the car dealership this may not apply in addition to the money your cash could earn consider also liquidity if you need to repair something on your house or deal with other emergency expenditures and your money is all locked up in your car you may have to borrow at a much higher rate as much as 20 if you go to credit cards and ca n't get it paid off the same month which will wipe out all this careful math about how you should just buy the car and not pay that 1.5 interest more important than whether you borrow or not is not buying too much car if the loan is letting you talk yourself into the more expensive car i 'd say it 's a bad thing otherwise it probably is n't

it 's my understanding that deferred revenue will be included as income as the services are rendered in this way gains originating from deferred revenue are not recognized until they are actually earned   it 's a formality so the accounting adheres to the matching principle it may help to view a dr as an advance payment say like what an airline may do with ticket purchases that occur before the flight    it sounds like you 're wanting to penalize the business for having to eventually provide a service but i do n't know if that would be accurate i mean from the business 's perspective is n't it always preferable to be paid in advance are you concerned the company may not have any recourse should the customer try to back out or something   i do n't think i 'm understanding your question could you come at it from another angle to explain it

ever wonder why certain businesses wo n't accept certain credit cards the sign above the register saying sorry we do n't accept it 's because they do n't want to pay that credit card company 's transaction fees one of the roles of the credit card company is to facilitate the transaction process between the customer you and the store and now that using credit cards over cash or check is so ingrained in our culture it creates extra work for the customer to make purchases at an establishment that is cash only credit card companies know this and so do businesses so businesses will partner with credit card companies so that customers can use their cards this way everything is handled electronically this can also benefit the business since there 's added security as they 're not dealing with cash directly and they do n't have to manually count as much cash later however a business may only budget a certain amount of their profits they want taken by credit card transactions so if a company 's fees are too high say for example and they are banking on you already having a visa card the company is n't going to go out of its way to provide the option for you if it were free for the business to use a credit card company 's service at their stores then they would all just provide the option for every card so the credit card company making money is all contingent on you spending your money by using their credit card you use the card and the store pays the company for the transaction

to answer the heart of your question it would be illegal for any credit bureau or creditor to somehow penalize you just for trying to make sure that what 's being reported about you is accurate   that 's why the fair credit reporting act exists that 's where the rights and mechanisms come from for letting you learn about and request accurate reporting of your credit history every creditor is responsible for reporting its own data to the bureaus using the format provided by those bureaus for doing so a creditor may not provide all of the information that can be reported and it may not report information in as timely a manner as it could or should e.g. payments made may not show up for weeks or even months after they were made etc the bottom line is that the credit bureaus are not of the data they report   they simply report   they do n't draw conclusions they do n't make decisions on what data to report   if a creditor provides data that is within the parameters of what the bureaus ask to be provided then the bureaus report precisely that nothing more nothing less if there is an or mistake on your report it is the fault and responsibility of the creditor and it is therefore up to the creditor to correct it once it has been brought to their attention   federal laws spell out the process that the bureau has to comply with when you file a dispute and there are strict standards requiring the creditor to promptly verify valid information or remove anything which is not correct the credit bureaus are simply automated clearinghouses for the information provided by the creditors who choose to subscribe to each bureau 's system   a creditor can choose which or none of the bureaus they wish to report to which is why some accounts show on one bureau 's report on you but not another 's what i caution is just because a credit bureaus reports on your credit does n't mean they have anything to do with the accuracy or detail of what is being reported   that 's up to the creditors

i recently needed to compute a better balance that let us pick and choose what to include in the computed sum without losing information so i this topic and i 'm pleased to say that i 've found a solution that works at least for our data you may have transactions that this code does n't recognize but you can always modify it to match my solution was written for ms sql server 2008 or later it uses a a view and a aggregate sum over order by which means it should be almost syntax compatible with mysql does not support over but you can perform a running sum using a variable with arithmetic addition directly in the select clause create a database table with this feel free to exclude columns you 're not interested in such as create a unique index on you could use it as a primary key i suppose you might be tempted to create a foreign key relationship between and however this will fail if you enforce it we have many transactions where points to a transaction that does n't exist this is usually in the case of type = web accept payment received and status = canceled we also have some values longer than 17 characters some start with all pending money requests i suspect this indicates the transaction is unfinished re download your entire paypal history csv files so that you have the latest retroactive updates import these csv files into this table do a simple test to see how bad paypal 's default data is to find out where the differences are coming from run this query the order by is to ensure consistent ordering when multiple transactions share the same timestamp as you scroll through the results you 'll see how the naive sum is thrown off from the official paypal computed balance column so as you can see the net column value can not always be trusted what we need is to generate our own value which is accurate that is the value is 0.00 for rows which do not affect the balance instead of being what they are right now the problem is given a single row of data such as any single row from the example table in my original question we have no way of inherently knowing what its is i have devised two functions to help solve this problem the first function only looks at the type and status column values and generates accurate values for the vast majority of rows indeed in our dataset we only had one row for which this approach did not work i recommend you try this one first and compare the running sum value to ensure it works for your data you can use this function in the query like so below hopefully it should give you an accurate running sum and balance figure at the end 8 and here 's the view that ties it all together used like so i hope this helps anyone else wanting to do accurate bookkeeping with paypal transaction history files

off the top of my head i do n't know of any publicly traded companies that routinely earmark distributions as return of capital but theoretically it 's certainly applicable to any publicly traded company the wikipedia article gives one situation in which a publicly traded company may use return of capital public business may return capital as a means to increase the debt equity ratio and increase their leverage risk profile since return of capital is a distribution it shrinks the firm 's equity thus increasing its leverage investopedia also has an article dividend facts you may not know that gives an example of when return of capital might be used sometimes especially in the case of a special large dividend part of the dividend is actually declared by the company to be a return of capital in this case instead of being taxed at the time of distribution the return of capital is used to reduce the basis of the stock making for a larger capital gain down the road assuming the selling price is higher than the basis for instance if you buy shares with a basis of $ 10 each and you get a $ 1 special dividend 55 cents of which is return of capital the taxable dividend is 45 cents the new basis is $ and you will pay capital gains tax on that 55 cents when you sell your shares sometime in the future a company may choose to earmark some or all of its distribution as return of capital in order to provide shareholders with a more beneficial tax treatment the irs describes this different tax treatment distributions that qualify as a return of capital are not dividends a return of capital is a return of some or all of your investment in the stock of the company a return of capital reduces the basis of your stock these distributions do n't necessarily count as taxable income except in some instances once the basis of your stock has been reduced to zero any further non dividend distribution is capital gain the irs also states a distribution generally qualifies as a return of capital if the corporation making the distribution does not have any accumulated or current year earnings and profits in this case the firm is lowering its equity because it 's paying distributions out of that equity instead of accumulated earnings profits a company may use return of capital to maintain a distribution even in times of financial difficulty   in the context of closed end funds however return of capital can be much more complicated and can affect the fund 's performance and reputation in numerous ways also jb king is correct in you that return of capital is not the same thing as return on the latter is a method for valuing a company and determining how efficient a company is where it comes to using its resources to quote jb king 's comment again

a subsidy is a payment made by a group usually the state to individuals or corporations in order to shift the balance if the rational economic decision for the individual would be detrimental to the group as a whole otherwise for example if there are different quality kinds of crops that can be planted for example a gm that brings in high yields but can only be processed to high corn syrup or a naturally bred corn that brings lower yields but tastes well enough for direct consumption then if demand for both exceeds supply the economic choice for the individual farmer is to plant the former if the claims that contribute to obesity are founded then it is in the public interest to produce less of it and more alternative foods given that a market rather than a planned economy is desired this can not be achieved by decree but rather money is used as an incentive in the long term this investment may very well pay off through reduced health care costs so it is a rational economic decision from the state 's point of view in a world where all actors make decisions that are fully in their self interest in principle subsidies would not be needed as consumers would demand healthy rather than cheap foods and market mechanisms would provide these

espp is common among us companies often with a framework similar to your outline   in the us some allow sales of shares to be considered qualifying subject to capital gains rather than ordinary income tax if they are sold at least 2 years after the enrollment date and at least 1 year after the purchase date   these details can vary from one plan to another and will be stated in the company 's espp enrollment documents    do look at the high and low values of the stock over the last year   if it swings up and down more than 15 or whatever the discount is then that risk should be a factor in your decision   if the stock is trending upward over the long term and you are confident in the durability of the company then you might favor holding

many answers here have given what look to be useful perspectives on your question   i want to point out an interesting technical issue if an employer contracts with an insurer it agrees to cover all employees or all that fill some pre specified definition and no one else and to offer only a limited range of options if you buy insurance directly you obviously have a huge range of choices including the technically illegal one of no insurance at all your first thought is probably hey that 's great more options more chances to pick the plan that 's right for me sorry no   yes you have more options but so does everyone else if you are working for some large company you get insurance period if you suspect you have an expensive health condition you can not buy more insurance if you believe yourself to be healthy as a horse you can not get insurance and pocket the difference   healthy people and sick people are all in the same predictable pool if you buy insurance freely the insurer knows that the you are the more likely you are buy insurance a phenomenon called adverse selection   as a result the premiums fees a person buying his own insurance pays are much higher because most of his fellow policy holders are even if he himself is just risk averse on the other hand if you are risk neutral if you can survive a $ 10,000 bill if it happens to arise you can save big by finding the imaginable insurance where all your fellow policy holders will be and healthy people like yourself

you should start by making a written complaint to the insurance company itself you have two angles of attack what was discussed when she was sold the policy make sure you set out exactly what you believe you were told and highlight that they did n't ask about commuting assuming that 's the case ask them to preserve any recordings they have of the call and to send you a copy the nature of the journey where the accident happened from the description unless it was part of a journey to and from work there 's no good reason for them to classify it as commuting make sure you make good written notes now of anything that happened verbally phone calls etc and keep doing this as the process goes along if that written complaint does n't work your next step is to go to the financial ombudsman who are a neutral service if the ombudsman does n't support your case you could go to court directly but it 'll be expensive and a lot of effort and by this stage it 'd be unlikely you would win the ombudsman 's rejection would n't count against you directly but it 'd be a strong indication that your case is weak see for a more detailed walk through

before anything else read up on the basics of economics after that there a few things you need to ask yourself before you even think about investing in anything if you have an answer to those questions once you answered those questions i could make a simple first suggestion confident in handling it yourself and low maintenance with uncertain horizon look up an online bank that offers etfs such as accumulation dividend is not payed but reinvested or is payed out and maybe a few more specific ones then buy and hold for at least 5 years confident and high maintenance with long horizon maybe stock picking but you 'll probably never be able to beat the market unless you invest 10 's of hours in research per week however this will also cost a bit and given your initial amount not advisable to do be sure that you also have a very close look at the prospectus of an investment especially if you go with a retail bank and they recommend you certain actively traded funds they tend to charge you quite a bit yearly management fees of 2 3 which is a lot if you are maybe yearly are n't unheard of etf 's such only have for example a yearly cost of 0.20 personally i have one portfolio of many only consisting of that etf so and one global small cap it 's one of the best and most ones to date in the end the amount you start with does n't really matter so much as long as it 's enough to buy at least a few shares of what you have in mind if you can then increase your portfolio over time and keep the expenses in check compounding interest should do the rest

you can invest more that 20,000 in infrastructure bonds however the tax benefit is only on 20,000 further the interest earned is taxable the best guaranteed post tax returns is on ppf so invest a substantial sum in this as your age group low you can afford to take risk and hence could also look at investing in elss mutual fund    a note on each of these investments   if you have taken any of the endowment money back plan remember the returns are very low around 5 6 it would make more sense to buy a pure term plan at fraction of the cost and invest the remaining premium into even ppf or fd that would give you more return   nsc postal savings they are a good option however the interest is taxable there is a locking of 6 years   ppf the locking is large 15 years although one can do partial withdrawals after 7 years the interest is not taxable   ulip these are market linked plans with insurance and balance invested into markets the charges for initial few years is quite high plus the returns are not comparable to the normal mutual funds invest in this only if one needs less paper and does n't want to track things separately   elss mutual fund these offer good market returns but there is a risk of market as you are young you can afford to take the risk most of the elss have given average results that are still higher than fd or ppf   pension plan this is a good way to accumulate for retirement invest some small amount in this and do not take any insurance on it go for pure equity as you can still take the risk this ensures that you have a kit for retirement check out the terms and conditions as to how you need to purchase annuity at the term end etc

yes and no   almost everybody wants to own their own business and they would gladly piss away an investor 's money trying to make it happen it 's not just funds that are required i 'm sure we both know some people that should not start a business of their own no matter how it 's financed   one of the big barriers to starting a business is regulation we all want products that are safe to use and produced responsibly but if the regulations are such that only a handful of the largest companies are capable of compliance then those companies can be assured they will never have any credible competition regulation is a very careful balancing act   but your question was n't what stops new businesses new businesses from forming you asked what creates more business owners   a lot of that is actually cultural to be a business owner you have to have a lot of specific personality traits that most people do n't have you have to be motivated to work hard passionate about what you want to do organized enough to approach it consistently analytical enough to create a solid business plan that makes sense and rational enough to know when to quit if it 's not working finally and this is a big one you have to be able to sell that passion to investors prospective customers and your first employees the best widget in the world wo n't sell if it 's being marketed by someone who does n't know how to market things   what we need to do is find a way to provide consulting and resources to people who are developing those skills

both models understand that the value of a company is the sum total of all cashflows in the future discounted back to the present they vary in their definition of cash the gordon growth model uses dividends as a proxy for cashflow under the assumption that this is the only true cash received by shareholders in theory counting cash is meaningless if there 's no eventual end game where the accumulated cash is up amongst the owners the gordon model is best used to value companies that have an established reliable dividend the company should be stable and the payout ratio high will underestimate the value of firms that consistently maintain a low payout ratio and instead accumulate cash there are multiple dcf models a firm valuation measures all cash available to both equity and debt holders a traditional equity valuation measures all cash that can be claimed by shareholders while the latter seems most intuitive and pertinent to a shareholder the former is very good at showing what a company can do regardless of their choice of capital structure a small add on to a firm valuation is the concept of eva or economic value add where the return on capital all capital both debt and equity is compared to the blended cost of capital the dcf model is more flexible optimistic than the gordon in its approach to cash the approach can be applied to many types of companies at every stage in their maturity even if they do n't pay a dividend a simplistic or single stage dcf is similar to the gordon the assumption is that the company is fully mature growing at a rate perhaps just slightly above inflation forever for younger companies a multi stage dcf can be employed where you forecast fairly confident numbers for the next 3 5 years then 3 5 years beyond that the forecast is less certain but assumed to be slowing growth and a generally maturing stabilizing company and then the steady state stage is tacked on to the end you 'll want to check out professor damodaran 's website he addresses all this and so much more and has a big pile of spreadsheets freely downloadable to get you started i also highly recommend his book investment valuation it 's the bible on the topic

i will just try to come up with a totally made up example that should explain the dynamics of the hedge consider this completely made up relationship between usd eur and gold now lets say you are a european wanting to by 20 grams of gold with eur equally lets say some american by 20 grams of gold with usd their investment will have the following values see how the europeans return is while the american only has a return now lets consider that the european are aware that his currency may be against him with this investment so he decides to hedge his currency he now enters a currency swap contract with another person who has the opposite view locking in his eur usd at t2 to be the same as at he now goes ahead and buys gold in usd knowing that he needs to convert it to eur in the end but he has fixed his so that does n't worry him now let 's take a look at the investment see how the european now suddenly has the same return as the american of instead of it is hard in real life to create a perfect hedge therefore you will most often see that the are not totally the same as per answer but they do come rather close

the most common usage of interest rate swaps is by corporates who issue bonds   most us investors e.g. insurance companies amp pensions want fixed rate bonds so that they know what their interest income will be for the life of the investment   many financial issuers prefer to have their liabilities be floating rate so that they will benefit if the fed keep interest rates at zero for a long time   so the financial issuer issues the fixed rate bond the insurance company buys it and the issuer converts the obligation to floating with an interest rate swap

gt first off that is n't today 's version of socialism or anything like it today 's version of socialism is democratic socialism as seen in scandinavia to great affect   the idea that people have to give up the fruits of their labor to serve the greater good just because people vote for it to happen does n't mean it 's not socialism i ca n't say i 'm a huge fan of the idea that i 'll have more of my money taken based on voting patterns of the general public    the reason scandinavia is doing so well is because of the free market systems they had before they went socialist did n't work so hot for venezuela as well as their culture there 's a reason denmark made a point to tell bernie that they 're not socialist it 's not sustainable i 'll use a source that is biased the other direction since you seem to have a pretty hard reaction against anything right leaning     gt secondly you may not read 4chan or fox but that phrase is being repeated ad on both sites as a way to push the narrative away from the racist hate that happened which means you 're doing exactly what they want and becoming their parrot   again just because bad people say something does n't make it incorrect   just as an aside are you aware of the banning that happens in order to stifle dissent in the main subreddits i 'm not talking about the racist and i 'm definitely not denying that they exist they do and should be downvoted accordingly but there have been many instances of people being banned which causes moderate conservatives for what it 's worth i 'm not a conservative to avoid those subreddits in general this has a snowball effect that keeps diversity of thought from existing in those places and makes it seem like everyone is on board with certain ideas then when the larger society behaves differently people are blindsided and scrambling for answers usually the culprit will be decided as a mix of morons uneducated and i 've experienced that more than once when i used to push for democratic socialism

sometimes i think a question like this is one of moral versus legal   the reality is that you know you owe the money because you received the services   you 're right that the bill should have been sent to you and the natural urge for many people is to just count it in the win column when things like this happen and there 's the chance to avoid paying i suppose my question for you is are you comfortable with the notion that you are not paying something that your heart of hearts tells you should be paid   if roles were reversed and you as a business owner had forgotten to bill something for which you were rightfully due payment would n't you hope they 'd have the integrity to pay you anyway the legal side of this can be a bit trickier and much depends on the state you 're in assuming you 're in the u.s. because some have consumer collection and protection laws than others   the rehab center could when doing an audit of its accounts discover that you did n't pay for these   they could take the polite course of action and call you with a gentle reminder or send a bill or they could be not so nice about it   either way they ca n't send anything to collections for which you have n't been presented a bill and demonstrated an unwillingness to pay   there 's a process in place regardless of the state so they ca n't just automatically put it into collections i will close with this question for you did the rehab center help you with what you needed and are you healthier and better because of their care   if so pay the bill   that 's my advice   keep in mind that unpaid medical costs just raise the prices for everyone else because these providers will make up for the loss somewhere i hope this helps good luck

keep in mind that credit takes time to build    your best short term solution is to save enough cash to put enough of a down payment that the lower loan to value ratio outweighs the lack of credit history   if there 's enough equity to ensure that the bank will get their money back if they have to foreclose you will have a better chance of securing financing in addition the stability and consistency of your employment may also be a factor that makes it difficult for you to get a loan without a substantial down payment finally do n't ignore the risk present in resting a property that you have a loan on   make sure you have a plan in place to pay your payments if the other half goes for several months or you risk losing the entire property my advice is to rent somewhere else for enough time that you can save up a lot of cash to purchase a duplex rather than getting in a rush and doing something unwise like apply for a bunch of credit cards you do n't need

perhaps i can my city is full of towers of chinese investor owned condos that were purchased to gain visas   these visas require a $ 500k investment in the us in an economically depressed area   the census were together to make a nice part of town qualify   they were sold with 30 year property tax and at the end of that period they will likely have to pay something like 50k yr in taxes which is likely about what they will be renting for   these condos do not exist to be lived in but have manufactured a huge bubble in property value because of the visa program   is a primary investor in this vehicle   these will crash if there are changes to this program or any change that forces more units on the market   otherwise they 'll crash in 25 30 years when nobody wants a with massive expenses incoming     the other bubble is of course the huge real estate bubble china is creating within its own borders which rivals the real estate bubble within us borders both of which are driven by unsustainable low interest rates

gt that there are more jobs today is n't a convincing argument   you yourself said that automation means there is a net loss in jobs   if that were true there would be less jobs now than in 1900   but the opposite is true   products are more efficiently reaching the consumer   this means more people are buying more things   this means producers have to hire more people or buy more raw materials   lets go with a real classic example   lets say that you and myself make sewing needles   we both do it by hand because in this example we are at the dawn of the industrial revolution making a needle at a time   now lets say i figure out a way to make a machine that makes 100 needles in the time it took me to make 1 and because less of my time is going into each needle i can sell them cheaper   i am now able to reach more stores than before to sell my sewing needles   i have to hire some more people to make deliveries because i can only do so much by myself   now i also grow to the point of having to buy another machine because my business is booming   people love my sewing needles   but i ca n't man 2 machines so i hire in another person   now i have more people making deliveries and i no longer deliver myself because i am better at making needles than delivering them   the guys supplying me with the metal to make the needles also had to hire some people to keep up with my demand   and the people mining the metal for my needles also had to hire another miner   this may sound like a made up story but this sort of thing was going on at this time     the argument that automation kills jobs has been around since before the industrial revolution   how much would your cell phone be if we were still using horse and cart to deliver goods   would your mother sister girlfriend wife yourself if you are a girl be able to have a full time job if they did not have a washing machine iron vacuum cleaner other appliances   what kind of selection in the grocery store would you have if the tractor was never used

do you have the raw data   do you know how they selected the sample   did they discover perfect random   i would guess not so that probably would mean 100 is nt correct in this context   i 'm non partisan i would also just ask how did that election turn out again with the numerous polls and other research of 1000 + repeatedly at different times over a campaign that seemed to have been like 2 + years long   further i do nt even know why we are talking about a study of 100 when there s glassdoor with more than 10,000 reviews though it is nt normalized or in an actual study format the thing to note is that if you compare the types of employees to another tech company like lets say google alphabet or facebook you have a different distribution in the type of people recruited and that might effect their experience amazon does a lot of retail support and call centers as compared to a lot of engineers with a more educated background both are people but there s definitely a difference in the type of person as well as their temperament you get if you go to lets say an urban wal mart as compared to an alphabet or facebook engineer

the president does n't have a magic that automatically makes his will the law of the land    the president is the chief executive over a complicated bureaucratic system we call the us government with many branches and departments some of which are legally separated by the us constitution and not directly under the president 's control   no things are n't going to get better because the issues this country faces are beyond the office of the president maybe if congress would get serious about america we would see a little traction on the recovery as we would have 2/3 branches of the government moving in in the same direction currently the us government is a with 2/3rds of its legs busted   edit i do n't mean to give the impression that the judicial branch is dysfunctional so much as i wanted to illustrate that it tends to follow the legislative and executive branches not lead them the legislative branch creates the laws that the executive branch office of the president enforces the judicial branch oversees these two branches to make sure they create laws that abide by and operate within the constitution

it would be better to use a bank account and have the refund deposited directly to it but you said you never had a bank account so that may be a problem another option is to have the refund check mailed to you and you deposit it in your local bank converting to your home currency or not depending on local laws generally for another person to cash a check made out to you you need to endorse it first physically on the back of the check that means you have to see the check specifically with tax refund checks there 's much more scrutiny since there 's a lot of fraud going on with regards to tax refunds thus i doubt a bank would allow a third party cash a check made out to you without you actually being present there

in theory the trust admin the trustee custodian should have filed the each year the trust should have either a paid tax on any gains or b distributed the gains to her along with a nice schedule k-1 showing that she had income from the trust and was responsible for the tax on that income in effect the trust took that distribution to her as a deduction against its own income thus negating the need to pay tax at the trust rate yes if under $ 600 it could retain the income and still pay no tax   now when she gets this money and it seems it 's all being distributed by your choice of the money not some money it 's not taxable or at least should n't be the corpus of a trust is already post tax money unless of course it 's somehow pretax ira or 401(k money which is not so common

the hire a pro is quite correct if you are truly making this kind of money that said i believe in a certain amount of self education so you do n't follow a pro 's advice blindly first i wrote an article that discussed marginal tax rates and it 's worth understanding it simply means that as your income rises past certain thresholds the tax rate also will change a bit you are on track to be in the top rate 33   next solo 401(k you did n't ask about retirement accounts but the combined situations of making this sum of money and just setting it aside leads me to suggest this since you are both employer and employee the solo 401(k limit is a combined $ seems like a lot but if you are really on track to make $ 500 k this year that 's just over 10 saved    then whatever the pro recommends for your status you 'll still have some kind of social security obligation as both employer and employee so that 's another 15 or so for the first $   last some of the answers seemed to imply that you 'll settle in april not quite you are required to pay your tax through the year and if you wait until april to pay the tax along with your return you will have a very unpleasant tax bill i mean it will have penalties for underpayment through the year this is to be avoided   i offer this because often a pro will have a specialty and not go outside that focus it 's possible to find the guy that knows everything about setting you up as an llc or sole proprietorship yet does n't have the 401(k conversation   good luck please let us know here how the pro discussion goes for you

has mentioned this in a comment but i think it ought to be expanded upon companies that are n't already penny stocks really do n't stand to gain anything from trying to prevent short interest   short selling does not inherently lower the stock price not any more so than any other kind of selling   when somebody shorts a stock it 's simply borrowed from another investor 's margin as long as it 's not a naked short resulting in an failure to deliver then it does not add any artificial selling pressure in fact shorting can actually drive the price up in the long term due to stops and margin calls   not a guarantee of course but if a rally occurs then a high short interest can cause a cascade effect from the short squeeze resulting in an even bigger rally than what would have occurred with zero short interest   many investors actually treat a high short interest as a bullish signal compare with margin buying essentially the opposite of short selling which has the opposite effect   if investors buy stocks on margin then if the value of that stock decreases too rapidly they will be forced to sell which can cause the exact same cascade effect as a short interest but in the opposite direction   shorting is in a sense evening out the odds by inflating the buying pressure at lower stock prices when the borrowers decide to cover and take profits bottom line is that aside from illegal insider trading it does n't do businesses any good to try to manipulate their stock price or any trading activity   yes a company can raise capital by selling additional common shares but a split really has no effect on the amount of capital they 'd be able to raise because it does n't change the actual market cap and a dilution is a dilution regardless of the current stock price   if a company 's market cap is $ 1 billion then it does n't matter if they issue 1 million shares at $ 50.00 each or 10 million shares at $ 5.00 each either way it nets them $ 50 million from the sale and causes a 5 dilution to which the market will react accordingly they do n't do it because there 'd be no point

chip and signature cards do not substantially alter the paradigm you mention in your question the chip alters how the machine obtains your account number and it for authentication but it does not significantly alter the interaction with the clerk   it is solely intended to reduce skimming and similar card number stealing and card forging attacks specifically a clerk is still welcome to ask to see the card to verify the signature if they wish and/or to ask to see an id to use the card   some changes occurred around the same time as introducing chip and signature that meant that clerks will be less likely to ask for signatures for certain purchases raising the dollar amount for no signature required purchases mostly but those changes are distinct from the introduction of emv chip authentication

i think this question has more to do with the business model of cinema if i remember correctly most of the money from ticket sales goes back to the studios something like the newer a movie is the greater percentage goes back to the movie studios and the older a movie is the greater percentage of ticket price goes to the cinema so high priced popcorn and candy is often the only place where the individual theaters make any money this may not be true for every movie but i believe it was the case for films like   james cameron 's

if you 're talking about an etf trading on arca it 's probably because of the opening auction the match price is the price that maximizes the volume that can be executed within the auction collars the core open auction will use the match price closest to the closing price of the previous trading day based on normal market hours if more than one indicative match price is valid the core opening auction does n't really take the opening session activity into account as you can see the market runs an auction and whatever price clears the most volume within certain limits is the opening print

if you are paid by foreigners then it is quite possible they do n't file anything with the irs all of this income you are required to report as business income on schedule c.   there are opportunities on schedule c to deduct expenses like your health insurance travel telephone calls capital expenses like a new computer etc you will be charged both the employees and employers share of social security medicare around or so and that will be added onto your 1040    you may still need a local business license to do the work locally and may require a home business permit in some cities   in some places cities subscribe to data services based on your irs tax return and will find out a year or two later that someone is running an business   this could result in a fine or perhaps just a nice letter from the city attorneys office that it would be a good time to get the right licenses generally tax treaties exist to avoid or limit double taxation for instance if you travel to norway to give a report and are paid during this time the treaty would explain whether that is taxable in norway   you can usually get a credit for taxes paid to foreign countries against your us taxes which helps avoid paying double taxes in the usa    if you were to go live in norway for more than a year the first $ or so is completely wiped off your us income   this does not apply if you live in the usa and are paid from norway if you have a bank account overseas with more than $ 10,000 of value in it at any time during the year you owe the us government a fincen form 114 fbar   this is pretty important there are some large fines for not doing it   it could occur if you needed an account to get paid in norway and then send the money here if the norwegian company wires the money to you from their account or sends a check in us$ and you do n't have a foreign bank account then this would not apply

fyi i 'm not a lawyer i would not try to reverse the transfer   you need to create a paper trail as to what happened to this money and why   be sure to document whatever you do reach out again reach out to the company again and see if you can transfer the money back to their account   a wire transfer is $ 20 usually be sure to negotiate the company covering this and every other fee if you can not reach them you could probably move the money to an escrow account at your new bank   the new bank will likely be able to advise you on the best way do this   you should probably also send a letter via certified mail to ensure they received it informing them you 've done this and how to get in touch with you by putting the money in an escrow account you 've proven that you have n't used it and if the company wants it back its very obvious who 's money it is   sending the certified mail someone must sign for it will also create a paper trail that will help you if things get ugly finally do n't spend it

roth is currently not an option unless you can manage to document income at 6 this would be difficult but not impossible my daughter was babysitting at 10 that 's when we started her roth   the 529 is the only option listed that offers the protection of not permitting an 18 year old to blow the money but only if you maintain ownership with the child as beneficiary the downside of the 529 is the limited investment options extra layer of fees and the potential to pay tax if the money is withdrawn without child going to college as you noted since it 's his money already you should not be the owner of the account that would be stealing   the regular account a ugma is his money but you have to act as custodian a minor ca n't trade his own stock account in that account you can easily manage it to take advantage of the kiddie tax structure the first $ 1000 of realized gains go untaxed the next $ 1000 is at his rate 10 above this is taxed at your rate with the chance for long capital gains at a 15 rate   when he actually has income you can deposit the lesser of up to the full income or $ 5500 into a roth this was how we shifted this kind of gift money to my daughter 's roth ira $ 2000 income from sitting permitted her to deposit $ 2000 in funds to the roth the income must be documented but the dollars do n't actually need to be the exact dollars earned this money grows tax free and the deposits may be withdrawn without penalty the gains are tax free if taken after age 59 1/2   please comment if you 'd like me to expand on any piece of this answer

atm to atm transfer is not possible do you mean to say account to account transfer using an atm machine    online transfer between account or between an account and credit card is possible almost every bank offers online transfers using internet banking    the person wishing to initiate a debit must subscribe to internet banking once you login to internet banking you would need to add beneficiary account account where you need to transfer funds adding of beneficiary at times takes a day for the beneficiary to be activated once the beneficiary is activated you can transfer funds the funds are credited to beneficiary account within 2 hrs if the both the accounts are in same bank then some bank 's atm 's hdfc citi etc allow you to transfer funds between account using the bank 's atm

why only long term investments what do they care if i buy and sell    shares in a company in the same year simple your actually investing when you hold it for a long term if you hold a stock for a week or a month there is very little that can happen to change the price in a perfect market the value of a company should stay the same from yesterday to today so long as there is no perfect market can not exist when you hold a stock for a long term you really are investing in the company and saying this company will grow short term investing is mostly speculation and speculation causes securities to be incorrectly valued so when a retail investor puts money into something like facebook for example they can easily be burned by speculation whether its to the upside or downside if the goal is to get me to invest my money then why not give apply    capital gains tax to my savings account at my local bank or a cd    account i believe your gains on these accounts are taxed not sure at what rate if the goal is to help the overall health of business how does it do    that during an ipo the business certainly raises money but after    that i 'm just buying and selling shares with other private    shareholders why does the government give me an incentive to do this    and then hold onto it for at least a year there are many reasons why a company cares about its market price a companies market cap is calculated by price shares outstanding a market cap is basically what the market is saying your company is worth a company can offer more shares or sell shares they currently hold in order to raise even more capital a company can offer shares instead of cash when buying out another company it can pay for many things with shares many executives and top level employees are payed with stock options so they want to see there price higher these are some basic reasons but there are more and they can be more complex

we need a new kind of economy that is actually economic that saves rather than the one we have now that is largely based on waste   we need more jobs and higher wages so that everyone can work a little less hours and have the time to go back to doing a few things for themselves like gardening or even walking their own dog instead of paying someone to do it   we need to include the to grave costs of products into the price so that someone can get paid to take it apart and actually recycle it instead of land filling it and we need to build products better in the first place so that each item lasts longer before needing to be recycled   the last 2 3 decades we have been so focused on getting a lot of stuff as cheap as possible we need to reverse that and buy less individual items of a higher quality so that they last a while i am willing to spend more to buy a tv that will last 30 years like my parents tv did today 's flat screens seem to be doomed at 2 years   we also need to focus on rebuilding and repairing what we were given by our parents and grandparents the nations roads bridges pipelines water systems and landmark building all of these things need to be repaired before they are beyond hope   unfortunately none of these things are going to happen

my taxable income was roughly $ 230,000 in 2012 indeed it is relevant the highest agi limit for deductible ira contributions is so no ira contribution will not help you reducing your tax bill this year the deduction phases out starting from agi limits of $ 10 k in certain cases for married filing separately and phases out entirely for anyone at agi of 112 k for 2012 the table linked describes the various deduction phase out parameters depending on your filing status and will probably be updated yearly by the irs however this is only relevant if your company provides a retirement plan as joe mentioned if your company does n't provide a retirement plan but your spouse 's does then the agi phase out limit is $ if neither you nor your spouse if you have one is covered then there 's no agi limit and you can indeed make an ira contribution before april 15th that would be attributed to the previous year and reduce your tax bill note that provides means the plan is available even if you do n't participate in it any time during the year

if you are in the us you legally must file taxes on any income whatsoever   how much you will pay in taxes if any will depend on your total taxable income now for small transactions the payments are often not reported to the irs so some people do not file or pay   the threshold at which they payer is required to send a 1099 to the irs is $ 600   patreon considers each donation a separate transaction and therefore does not send a 1099 to the irs unless you make more than $ 20,000 in a calendar year   if they do not report it the irs will not know about it unless they audit you or something   however you are technically and legally responsible to report income whether the irs knows about it or not edit note that the payer files a 1099 not the recipient in order to report your patreon income you will either use schedule c or add it to the amount on 1040 line 21 other income depending on whether you consider this a business or a hobby   if it 's a business and it 's a lot of money you should consider sending in quarterly payments using a 1040-es in order to avoid a penalty for too little withholding

in the theater it 's a person who can afford to buy expensive pop corn cause he can buy the expensive movie ticket too also sitting at one place will make him feel hungry and buy something to eat so maximum chances are that in the theater that guy is your potential customer otherwise if the popcorn seller is somewhere outside the theater they may charge you less that 's because of a different target audience they would be targeting anyone who comes near the theater who would not be willing to pay for expensive snacks or movie tickets so very few customers around will be actually potential customers to maximize their profits they will keep the prices low and supply as much as they can i know this is going against the normal price elasticity of demand and supply graph but if the prices are low there will be high demand so if the is more than 1 the supplier should supply as much as they can to maximize profits its all based on the target audience that 's what i think should be the case of expensive popcorn in movie theaters

yes when exercising a stock option you will be buying the stock at the strike price so you will be putting up your money if you lose that money you can declare it as a loss like any other transaction so if the stock is worth $ 1 and you have 10 options with a strike at $ 0.50 you will spend $ 500 when you exercise your options if you hold those shares and the company is then worth $ 0 you lost $ 500 i have not verified my answer so this is solely from my understanding of accounting and finance please verify with your accountant to be sure

many partnership agreements include a shotgun clause one person sets a price the other can either buy at that price or sell at it it 's rather brutal you can make offers that you know are less than the company is worth if you 're sure the other person will have to take that money from you say if you know they ca n't run the company without you   he has asked for $ x to be bought out and failing that he would like to keep owning his half and send his wife who may very well be competent but who among other things has a very ill husband to deal with to take his place if he can occasionally contribute to the overall vision and she can do the day to day then keeping things as they are may be the smart move but if that 's not possible it does n't mean you have to buy him out for twice what you think it 's worth   in the absence of a partnership agreement it 's going to be hard to know what to do but one approach might be to pretend there is a shotgun clause ask him if he thinks half the company is worth $ x if he 's willing to buy you out for that price and have his wife run it without you he is likely to out that it is n't worth that and she ca n't do that   and at that point you 'll actually be negotiating

disclaimer i do n't work in the finance industry and simply took a few classes in corporate finance and management during my undergrad   it depends on what type of investing you 're talking about if you 're talking about building a portfolio of securities then capm is the basis for most valuation models generally capm will have you discount based on your best available risk free rate usually t bills or some other fixed income source with a reliable even after your valuation the basic theory of risk management for an investment portfolio is still to maintain a diverse basket of poorly correlated products   if you 're talking about corporate finance where a firm is considering an investment such as a new project then a determining a wacc and using it as a discount rate for your cash flow is a basic strategy    this is a basic strategy but there are better ones depending on the specifics of the investment this is where evaluating exposures is important to hedge counterparty risk you might discount by the estimated probability of non payment or buy trade insurance to hedge currency risk you might buy forwards options or look into a money market hedge to hedge political risks like repatriation or changes in tax laws or regulation you might buy political risk insurance to hedge exposure to a particular commodity price you can trade futures

i 've investigated this and banks are willing to offer a deal similar to what you ask you would take out a securities backed loan which provides you with the down payment on the property for the remainder you take out a regular mortgage   jaganalyst wonders why banks would accept this simple because there 's money to be made both on the securities backed loan and the mortgage both parts of the deal are financially sound from the banks perspective now the 20 number is perhaps a bit low having 20 of the value in shares means you 'd be able to get a loan for 50 of that so only a 10 downpayment

an option gives you an option   that is you are n't buying any security you are simply buying an option to buy a security   the sole value of what you buy is the option to buy something an american option offers more flexibility i.e. it offers you more options on buying the stock   since you have more options the cost of the option is higher of course a good example makes sense why this is the case   consider the vix   options on the vix are european style   sometimes the vix spikes like crazy tripling in value in days   it usually comes back down pretty quick though within a couple of weeks   so far out options on the vix are n't worth just a whole lot more because the vix will probably   be back to normal   however if the person could have them right when it got to the top they would have made a fortune many times what their option was worth   since they are style though they would have to wait till their option was redeemable right when the vix would be about back to normal   in this case an american style option would be far more valuable especially for something that is difficult to predict like the vix

this should be posted in /r personalfinance   also do not do what /u is suggesting     1 if it is an ira simply do an transfer   no taxes will be incurred if the paperwork is filed correctly   additionally there is a 60 rollover provision for ira accounts another way to get out of a tax penalty for an ira account   2 check the internal fees for your mutual funds   you may have purchased a shares which i am guessing is the case since your advisor was an ed jones advisor   the ongoing internal expense ratio should be rather low so you might want to consider keeping these funds   an will allow you to transfer your investments to your new account if you want to keep them   a shares have a high upfront charge but low ongoing fee   if you 've already paid for the fund why ditch it for another fund that charges a higher ongoing fee but not an upfront fee evaluate your costs   3 if this is a non ira account still file an   it is the easiest way to transfer your account     edit   silly me this is clearly a question regarding an ira   in that case there is no tax penalty for selling anything and buying within your ira as long as you do not take the money out   like i said please file an with the new company otherwise you will have to prove to the irs that you completed the rollover in 60 days   if not you will pay income tax and a 10 penalty

two of the main ways that investors benefit financially from a stock are dividends and increases in the price of the stock   in the example as described the benefits came primarily from dividends leaving less benefits to be realized in terms of an increase in the value of the company another way to put that is that the company paid its profits to shareholders in the form of a dividend instead of accumulating that as an increase in the value of the company   the company could have chosen to take those profits and reinvest them in growing the business which would lead to lower dividends but hopefully an increase in the valuation of the stock but they chose to pay dividends instead   this still rewards the investors but   share prices stay low

is it difficult to ask the credit card issuer for two cards even if the account belongs to one person you can most definitely get two cards for one account people do it all the time you just have to add her on as an authorized user   would it be better for me to apply for the card on my own or would there be an advantage to having her co sign it depends if she co signed then that means she is also responsible for the credit card payments which can help her credit score if its is just you applying then you are the only one responsible if you do n't want her lower credit score to impact what you could be approved for then only you should apply however if you are the sole account holder then you are responsible for the payments which means if in the event you guys break up and she maxes out the card before you cancel it then you are on the hook for what she spend   as for improving her credit score i do know that some banks report to the credit bureaus for the authorized user as well so that could help her out too

your ignorance of global finance and business is showing through   conspiratorial just standard tax optimization scheme as shown by   google amp apple   the tech industry is fundamentally different from   that you ca n't see this is mind boggling   there is nothing standard about the tax optimization schemes done by apple and google that can be copied by grocers   apple and google have vast international operations with revenue coming from multiple countries   they are asset light and have very high profit margins   grocery stores have very small negligible international operations and are asset heavy   try also have very low profit margins   the point of supply and demand they are actually overpaid lots of desperate people that agree to the minimum allowed by law and below that if you include illegal aliens still does n't mean they are paying the living wage   mentioning living wages in an argument about supply and demand tips off that you have no clue what you are talking about   living wage is irrelevant to the supply and demand for labor   what you call desperation for a job dismissed many of the perfectly logical reasons why somebody may choose to work for a low wage   you assume that the equilibrium wage for grocery store workers is below the minimum wage falsely   walmart workers make more than minimum wage on average before benefits are taken into account   illegal aliens ca n't do most grocery store jobs because 1 they ca n't speak english and 2 they probably ca n't do the math needed to be a cashier   teenagers the vast majority of minimum wage workers are increasingly choosing not to work   the supply of people that are able to do these types of jobs is probably not much bigger than it is already   are imported   and they do n't have to set up a supply chain just the bare minimum to legally siphon funds into another company they own be it via interest on credit rent intellectual property i.e. franchise or trademark payments or anything else   this is laughable do you really believe this   grocery stores have absolutely massive supply chain risk   arguably their entire value proposition is in supply chain   you seem to think there 's an evil cabal moving money around to screw people over   this is left wing bullshit conspiracy stuff   you sound like a left wing version of alex jones   show me clear evidence that a grocer is doing this including references in their actual financial statements

in addition to evaluating the business great answer consider the potential payoff if bonds pay off in the 5 10 range the s&p500 has 10.5 you should be expecting a payoff of 15 20 to invest in something riskier than the stock market   that means that if you invest $ 10k then in 5 years you 'll need to get out $ 25 k 20 returns over 5 years    if you get less than this much in 5 years the risk to reward ratio probably rules this out as a good investment

one more scenario is when the company already has maturing debt   e.g company took out a debt of 2 billion in 2010 and is maturing 2016 it has paid back say 500 million but has to pay back the debtors the remaining 1.5 billion it will again go to the debt markets to fund this 1.5 billion maybe at better terms than the 2010 issue based on market conditions and its business the debt is to keep the business running or grow it the people issuing debt will do complete research before issuing the debt it can always sell stock but that results in dilution and affects shareholders debt also affects shareholders but when interest rates are lower companies tend to go to debt markets although sometimes they can just do a secondary and be done with it if the float is low

when you say donate it usually assumes charitable donation with in this context tax benefit that is not what happens in your scenario giving someone money with the requirement of that someone to spend that money at your shop is not donation it is a grant you can do that but you wo n't be able to deduct this as charitable donation but the money paid to you back would be taxable income to you i respectfully disagree with joe that its a wash it is not you give them money that you can not deduct as an expense as it is not business expense or donation as strings are attached but you do give them the money it is no longer yours when they use the money to pay you back that same money becomes your taxable income end result you provide service and you 're the one paying taxes for it why would you do that

while from a money saving standpoint the obviously right course of action is to make only the minimum payment on the 0 loan there are potentially legal reasons to try to pay off a car loan early with a mortgage you are the legal owner of the property and any action by the lender beyond imposing fees e.g. foreclosure requires going through the proper legal channels on the other hand in most jurisdictions you are not the legal owner of a car purchased on a loan and a missed or even lost payment can result in repossession without the lender even having to go to court so from a risk aversion standpoint there 's something to be said for getting rid of car loans as soon as you can

most bond etfs have switched to monthly dividends paid on the first of each month in an attempt to standardize across the market   for etfs but perhaps not bond mutual funds as suggested in the above answer interest does accrue in the nav so the price of the fund does drop on ex date by an amount equal to the dividend paid a great example of this dynamic can be seen in a bond etf holding floating rate corporate bonds   as you can see in this screenshot the nav has followed a sharp up and down pattern almost like the teeth of a saw this is explained by interest accruing in the nav over the course of each month until it is paid out in a dividend dropping the nav sharply in one day the effect has been particularly pronounced recently because the floating coupon payments have increased significantly benchmark interest rates are higher and mark to market changes in credit spreads of the constituent bonds have been very muted

gt the 20 million people added to healthcare is a number they boast and brag about when they do nt realize from a study i m having a hard time so take it with a grain of salt roughly 65 of those people could afford health insurance prior to the aca just chose not to buy and because of the mandate were forced to    yes that is one of the reasons i supported the aca the problem of rising health care costs as one of the sources i linked to showed is the free rider problem too many people walk into the emergency room uninsured or they get emergent care that they are not covered for and the hospitals jack up the prices greatly in the hopes of getting a larger portion reimbursed by medicare now who pays for that medicare reimbursement you and i of course the taxpayers do and we pay a heavily artificially inflated version of that price this is the most jacked up form of universal health care but that is what the gop if fighting to    gt i also know that for me health insurance prior to the aca was significantly lower roughly 50 cheaper and that does nt even begin to touch the hikes a lot of people i know saw    i have no doubt this is true and another reason that i support the aca not because it equates to higher prices for you but because for the first time it made younger adults actually responsible for their medical bills when the aca was enacted we had a guy in our company who was about 23 years old he saw his insurance costs go up by 50 we covered is insurance increases because we supported him however what we found when we went back and compared the insurance that he had with the insurance that he has is that the first policy did n't cover anything but the most extreme circumstances it was a junk policy that left the taxpayer liable for a lot of stuff response x rays medicine etc there was nothing in there for preventative care which as the study i linked showed greatly impacted health for the worse    gt they have some of the lowest income tax rates in the world   again switzerland has lower tax rates than the us but they do n't even crack the top 20 when it comes to countries with low countries with the lowest tax rates in the edges out the regions other oil rich state to come in second place but still loses out to one other most of the countries in that list are relatively poor countries to the average citizen with weak infrastructure many of those countries are in which the ruling family controls the number one source of income oil so there is no taxes they just skim their money right off the top these are not countries that we would want to live retire in    switzerland succeeds with low taxes because they have a very efficient universal health care system and they have almost no military to fund    gt while i do not own my own company or have anything to do with r&amp;d i can for a fact disprove your theory   again speaking in this denotes that you can disprove every situation possible to show that government is worse than commercial as i said if you thought that before you entered my industry you quickly see the flip side of that coin    your example is a perfect example of that so you work in construction an industry in which commercial is notorious for a contract whether to government or to private and then running into unexpected that cause the job to go over schedule over budget these companies succeed because there are a very small number of providers that can accomplish certain jobs so they tend to stick around just like the big banks even though they are n't the best    its not like the government just sits around and takes it i know of at least one federal contractor who went to federal archive id for fraudulently winning contracts in my part of the country    gt the private sector will always have a need to innovate and that need will always be filled with or without the government the only difference is the private sector wo nt keep throwing money at an unsustainable rate like the government does because if they do nt see results its not worth funding   and this is why the government can succeed in areas that commercial can not this is why government got the first people on the moon not commercial this is why we have already sent missions to mars whereas musk is going to make those trips more efficient it is because government has tremendous resources that they can throw at a problem even the richest man in the world will run out of money before he can solve the big problems as i told a poster earlier spent over $ 1 t working on the problem in iraq afghanistan this was the number one killer of our troops there were many inventions that came out of this there is no company in this world that had the resources to tackle this problem solely what the government does a great job in is the troops and assembling resources to tackle a major task that would be by the individual    gt i d also like to add you are near the same age as my father who also served in the military and i thank you for your service    thank you i just hope that the navy got as much out of me as i learned and earned from serving it is the basis of

yes it 's a good idea to have a separate business account for your business because it makes accounting and bookkeeping that much easier you can open a business checking account and there will be various options for types of accounts and fees you may or may not want an overdraft account for example or a separate business credit card just so you can more easily separate those expenses from your personal cards when i started my business i opened a business checking account and met with my banker every year just to show them how the business was doing and to keep the relationship going eventually when i wanted to establish a business line of credit it was easier to set up because i they were already familiar with my business its revenue and needs for a line of credit you can set up a solo 401k with your bank too and they 'll be very happy to do so but i recommend shopping around for options i 've found that the dedicated investment firms schwab fidelity etc tend to have better options fees and features for investment accounts just because a specific bank handles your checking account does n't mean you need to use that bank for everything lastly i use completely different banks for my personal life and for my business maybe i 'm paranoid but i just do n't want all my finances in the same place for both privacy reasons and to avoid having all my eggs in the same basket just something to consider i do n't really have a completely sane reason for using completely different banks but it helps me sleep

something that introduces the vocabulary and treats the reader like an intelligent individual it 's a bit overkill for retirement but yale has a free online course in financial markets it 's very light on math but does a good job establishing jargon and its history it covers most of the things you 'd buy or sell in financial markets and is presented by nobel prize winner robert schiller this particular series was in 2007 so it also offers a good historical perspective of the start of the subprime collapse there 's a number of high profile guest speakers as well i would encourage you to think critically about their speeches though if you research what 's happened to them after that lecture it 's quite entertaining one a private equity firm that underperformed the market as a whole another hedge fund manager bought an airline with a partner firm that was arrested for running a ponzi scheme six months later   the reading list in the syllabus make a pretty good introduction to the field but keep in mind they 're for institutional investors not your 401(k

from a long term planning point of view is the bump in salary worth not having a 401(k   in this case absolutely at $ 30k year the 4 company match comes to about $ 1,200 per year   to get that you need to save $ 1,200 yourself so your gross pay after retirement contributions is about $    now you have an offer making $ 48,000   if you take the new job you can put $ 2,400 in retirement to get to an equivalent retirement rate and now your gross pay after retirement contributions is $    now if the raise in salary were not as high or you were getting a match that let you exceed the individual contribution max the math might be different but in this case you can effectively save the company match yourself and still be way ahead note that there are many other factors that may also be applicable as to whether to take this job or not do you like the work the company the coworkers the location is there upward mobility are the benefits equivalent but not taking a 67 raise just because you 're losing a 4 401(k match is not a wise decision

when you buy shares you are literally buying a share of the company   you become a part owner of it companies are not required to pay dividends in any given year   it 's up to them to decide each year how much to pay out the value of the shares goes up and down depending on how much the markets consider the company is worth   if the company is successful the price of the shares goes up   if it 's unsuccessful the price goes down   you have no control over that   if the company fails completely and goes bankrupt then the shares are worthless dilution is where the company decides to sell more shares   if they are being sold at market value then you have n't really lost anything   but if they are sold below cost perhaps as an incentive to certain staff then the value of the company per share is now less   so your shares may be worth a bit less than they were   you would get to vote at the agm on such schemes   but unless you own a significant proportion of the shares in the company your vote will probably make no difference in practice you ca n't protect yourself   buying shares is a gamble   all you can do is decide what to gamble on

note specific to uk i ca n't recommend anything higher than crunch they act as your accountant and have their own cloud accounting software so it 's more expensive than just using cloud accounting software but if you use an accountant to do your year end anyway then they cost about the same as using cloud accounting software plus using an accountant to do your year end the thing i like as a software development contractor is that i do n't have to know or worry about different ledger accounts or journal entries or any of the other weird accounting things etc most cloud accounting software claim to simplify accounting so that you can concentrate on running your business whereas the reality is that you still have to spend ages learning how to be an accountant just to fill it in correctly with crunch that 's actually true it does actually make it simple i 've used crunch sage and xero so my sample set is n't very big just thought i 'd share my experiences if you value your time and get annoyed by having to create multiple internal transfers between different ledgers just to do something simple it 's for you this probably sounds like a sales pitch but i have nothing to do with them and nothing to gain by recommending them the only reason i 'm so passionate is i started a new business to do an online shop and tried to use crunch but they do n't do retail businesses only contractors freelancers or simple service based businesses their software is geared up specifically for that which i guess is why it 's more simple than the others anyway so now i 'm annoyed at having to use the more complicated ones

wikipedia says the canadian securities course csc offered by the canadian securities institute csi is the initial course required for becoming licensed to work within the canadian securities industry outside quebec as a securities dealer or securities agent securities course canada adds you require it and further courses for other jobs in the investment industry generally some work experience is also required all of this is governed by various self regulatory agencies the material in the course is strong on money making products and fairly weak on material that would actually protect a consumer from harm passing the course is very little indication that you understand what 's important about investing for example you wo n't be taught much of anything about the theory of investment or the markets or things like the efficient market hypothesis on the csc so it appears that the csc is necessary to work as certain types of financial agencies that being said i doubt it will be enough to get your foot in the door this seems more like a prerequisite rather than a true qualification so you 'll be competing with mbas finance students and other people who either have experience or training in the financial industry i 'd recommend you look into the chartered financial analyst cfa certification as that will provide you with a rigorous knowledge of financial theory as well as asset management which seems more appropriate for what you 'd like to do from there you 'll have to network like crazy and leverage your experience to get in at a canadian financial firm and eventually wealth management so yes i suppose a csc is a good first step but more will certainly be required and i doubt it will be enough to land you a full time position   another important factor is age nobody expects undergrads to have extensive certifications or experience but it 's harder for a 35 year old to enter a new industry especially finance

at one point in my life i sold cars and from what i saw three things stick out   unless the other dealership was in the same network eg abc ford of city a and abc ford of city b they never had possession of that truck so no real application for a loan could be sent in to a bank just a letter of intent if one was sent at all with a letter of intent a soft pull is done most likely by the dealership where they then attached that score to the that the bank has an automated program send back an automatic decline an officer review reply or a tentative approval eg tier 8 the tentative approval is just that tentative sometime after a lender has a loan officer look at the full application something prompts them to change their offer they have internal guidelines but lets say an app is right at the line for 2 3 of the things they look at they chose to lower the credit tier or decline the app the dealership then goes back and looks at what other offers they had let 's say they had a chase offer at 3.25 and a capone for 5.25 they would say you 're approved at 3.5 they make their money on the .25 but after chase looks into the app and sees that let 's say you have been on the job for actually 11 months and not 1 year and you said you made $ 50,000 but your 1040 shows $ and you have moved 6 times in the last 5 years they comeback and say no he is not a tier 2 but a tier 3 5.5 they switch to capone and say your rate has in fact gone up to 5.5 ultimately you never had a loan to start with only a letter of intent the other thing could be that the dealership finance manager looked at your credit score and guessed they would offer 3.5 when they sent in the it came back higher than he thought or he was you so if you price shopped while they looked for a truck you would n't get far they did n't find that truck or it was not what they thought it would be if a dealership sees a truck in inventory at another dealer they call and ask if it 's available if they have it and it 's not being used as a demo for a sales manager they agree to send them something else for the trade a car or truck or whatever a transfer driver of some sort hops in that trade drives the 30 minutes 6 hours away and comes back so you can sign the real application today while you 're excited about your new truck and willing to do whatever you need to do to get it because they said it would take 2 5 days to ship it tells me it was n't available time kills deals and dealerships know this they want to sign you today some dealerships want honest money or a deposit to go get the truck but reality is that that is a trick to test you to make sure you are going to follow through after they spend the gas and add mileage to a car but if it takes 2 the truck is n't out there or the dealer does n't have a vehicle the other dealership wants back or no other dealership likes dealing with them the only way it would take that long is if you were looking for something very rare an odd color in an unusual configuration   like a top end model in a low selling color or configuration you had to have that would n't sell well like you wanted all the options on a car except a cigarette lighter you get the idea 99.99 of the time a good enough truck is available deposits are bs they do n't setup any kind of real contract notice most of the time they want a check because holding on to a check is about as binding as making you wear a chicken suit to get a rebate all it is is a test to see if you will go through with signing the deal as an example of why you do n't let time pass on a car deal is shown in this one time we had a couple want us to find a cadillac hybrid in red with every available option total cost was about $ 85 90k only two new red hybrids were for sale in the country at the time one was in new york and the other was in san and our dealership is in texas and neither was wanting to trade with us so we ended up having to buy the suv from one of the other dealerships inventory that is a very rare thing to do by the way we took a 25 down payment around $ 20,000 in a check we flew a driver to wherever the suv was and then drove it back to texas about 4 days later the couple came back and hated the color they would not take the suv the general manager was pissed he spent around $ 1000 just to bring the thing to texas not to mention he had to buy the thing the couple walked and there was nothing the sales manager gm or salesman could do we had not been able to deliver the car and ultimately the dealership ate the loss but it shows that deposits are useless you ca n't sell something you do n't own and dealerships know it   long story short you ca n't claim a damage you never experienced not having something happen that you wanted to have happen is not a damage because you ca n't show a real economic loss one other thing when you sign the paperwork that you thought was an application it was an authorization for them to pull your credit and the fine print at the bottom is boiler plate defense against getting sued for everything imaginable ours took up about half of one page and all of the back of the second page i know dealing with car dealerships is hard working at them is just as hard and i 'm sorry that you had to deal with it however the simplest and car deals are the ones where you pay full price

a lease is a rental plain and simple   you borrow money to finance the expected depreciation over the course of the lease term   this arrangement will almost always cost more over time of your ownership   that does not mean that a lease is always a worse deal    cars are almost always a losing proposition save for the oddball porsche or ferrari that is too scarce relative to demand   you accept ownership of a car and it starts to lose value   new cars lose value faster than used cars   typically if you were to purchase the car then sell it after 3 years the total cost over those three years will work out to less total money than the equivalent 36 month lease   but you will have to come up with a lot more money down or a higher monthly payment and/or sell the car after 36 months assuming the pretty standard 36 month lease   with this in mind some cars lease better than others because the projected depreciation is more favorable than other brands or models    personally i bought a slightly used car certified pre owned with a agreeable factory warranty extension   my next car i may lease   late model cars are getting so unbelievably expensive to maintain that more and more i feel like a long term rental has merit just understand that for the convenience for the freeing up of your cash flow for the of maintenance to not bother with resale or trading the car in a lease will cost a premium over a purchase over the same time frame

ask for documentation proving the amount they say you were overpaid and ask for time to review their claim if it is a large amount that they can prove you owe and if you were staying then you could ask for the repayment to be spread over multiple pay checks this would avoid the situation where you could get a very small check or even a check for zero because you are leaving you could ask for time to reimburse them but do n't count on them agreeing to that deal   the lesson is to save all time cards especially ones in which your hours are not consistent also save all pay stubs for the year what you should do now is download all the time card and pay info on the website before you lose access to it these should be saved on your home machine or printed and kept at home check to see if they made any time card adjustments many systems keep track of all changes made by the employee and by management both before and after the employee signs the time card if there are change you should be able to ask them to explain the changes

you have to realize that you 're trying to have your cake and eat it too   you want to do things unofficially by not reporting the accident to insurance companies and/or police but you want to do it officially in that you want to have legal recourse if they try to hit you up for more money   the only way to have it both ways is to trust the other person from a financial perspective ultimately you need to decide if the monetary cost of your raised insurance premiums etc outweighs the cost of whatever money the other party in the accident will try to squeeze out of you factoring in the likelihood that they will do so   you also would need to factor in the likelihood that rather than trying to scam you they 'll pursue legal action against you in short from a purely monetary perspective if the legitimate cost of repairs is $ 700 and the cost to you of doing it by the book via insurance is $ 2000 you should be willing to be scammed for up to $ 1300 because you 'll still come out ahead   of course there are psychological considerations like whether someone unscrupulous enough to scam you will stop at $ 1300   but those numbers are the baseline for whatever outcome calculations you want to do on the more qualitative side of things it is possible they 're trying to scam you but also possible they 're just trying to hustle you into doing everything quickly without thinking about it   they may not be trying to gouge you monetarily they just want to pressure you so they get their money   i agree with other here that the ideal way would be for them to send you an actual bill after repairs are complete   however you could ask them to send you a written copy of the repair shop estimate along with a written letter in which they state that they will consider payment of that amount to resolve the issue and wo n't pursue you further   the legal strength of that is dubious but at least you have some documentation that you did n't just try to stiff them   if they wo n't give you some form of written documentation i would read that as a red flag bite the bullet and contact your insurance company
