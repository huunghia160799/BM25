i ca n't give you a specific answer because i 'm not a tax accountant so you should seek advice from a tax professional with experience relevant to your situation this could be a complicated situation that being said one place you could start is the canada revenue agency 's statement on investment income which contains this paragraph interest foreign interest and dividend income foreign income    foreign non business income and certain other income are all amounts    you report on your return they are usually shown on the following    slips to avoid double taxation canada and the us almost certainly have a foreign tax treaty that ensures you are only taxed in your country of residence i 'm assuming you 're a resident of canada also this page states that if you received foreign interest or dividend income you have to    report it in canadian dollars use the bank of canada exchange rate    that was in effect on the day you received the income if you received    the income at different times during the year use the average annual    exchange rate you should consult a tax professional i 'm not a tax professional let alone one who specializes in the canadian tax system a professional is the only one you should trust to answer your question with 100 accuracy

here 's one reason that 's being overlooked in answers so far this is for your comment on 's answer how do credit card companies make money sure there 's interest charges but those are offset significantly by the cost of borrowing money and by people defaulting on their debt entering bankruptcy the other way they make money is by processing transactions they get a cut of whatever you buy if you 're a high income person and you 're going to process a lot of expenditures with this credit card your business is worth more they will be willing to bribe you with things like cash back frequent flier miles and insurance on your auto rentals so that they can be your 1 go to card   this works in concert with the way that some credit card vendors with richer clientele overall american express get to charge higher merchant fees for access to these customers wallets but that was mentioned in other answers if you 're not a high income person your business is worth less if you go somewhere asking for credit they 're going to try and give you a card which will earn them the most money which probably is n't the one where they give you back 50 of their transaction fee in rewards it 's a calculated risk since they still have to compete against cash debit cards and all the other credit card companies so they do n't have you totally over a barrel but you should n't expect as many freebies either

i 'm going to start with your title question how can home buying be considered a sound investment with all of that interest that needs to be paid if taken literally this is a loaded question because if you pay cash for a home you do n't pay any interest furthermore if your interest rate is 3 for 10 years you wo n't pay nearly as much interest as you will if your rate is 10 for 30 years so all of that interest is relative to your personal situation having said that of course i understand what you mean most people pay interest and interest is expensive so how do you calculate if it 's worth it that question has been asked and answered but for your particular situation you really have two separate questions i believe you should answer these questions independently if you move far away it 's probably the case that you can save a lot of money by either renting or buying in that location so you should first consider if it 's worth it to move and then if it is decide if it 's worth it to rent or buy if you decide not to move far away then decide if maybe you can save money by renting somewhere near your current home since it sounds like if you move you may have to become a landlord living close by to your tenant may also make it easier to deal with problems when they arise

that does n't make it the perfect medium for theft the system makes it okay to make non controversial items because its not like someone is going to put in the effort to track you for that    yet if you are buying something illicit a large part of the blockchain can already be analyzed to see where stuff is coming from and they can start work from there    for example let 's say you buy off local bitcoin well even if the fbi does n't know your address or who it belongs to they monitor the site and know that the funds came from a certain account they know this because that certain someone bought coins from a regulated company    its not the perfect medium for theft at all do you actually research bitcoin or are you just looking for any reason not to like it its really much more complex grand than most make it out to be

an employer can decide that the employee funds are automatically vested the new company could have had a more aggressive vesting schedule and grandfathered in all the employees of the company they acquired this could have been part of the purchase    i would be surprised if they did it for employees that left years ago especially if they were beyond the return period i would n't keep money in a plan with a former employer just in case it happens check the plan documents to see all the verbiage regarding vesting here is a paragraph from one you will receive one year of vesting service for each calendar year    during which you complete 850 or more hours of service once you have    five years of service your account is fully vested and any future    company contributions made to your account will be immediately vested    full vesting also occurs at age 59½ total disability or death while    employed by the company if you leave the company prior to 100    vesting any unvested portion of your plan account will be forfeited

life strategy funds are more appropriate if you want to maintain a specific allocation between stocks and bonds that does n't automatically adjustment like the target retirement funds which have a specific date   thus it may make more sense to take whichever life strategy fund seems the most appropriate and ride with it for a while unless you know when you plan to retire and access those funds in theory you could use vanguard 's total market funds i.e total stock market total international and total bond and have your own allocations between stocks and bonds be managed pretty easily and do n't forget that the fees can come in a couple of flavors as betterment does n't specify where the transaction fees for buying the etfs are coming out just as something to consider

what i do not get is why does the author choose to buy an itm put if    the goal was to not lose more than 5.6 he could have chosen a out of    money put where the strike is ~6 otm the reason why he is buying a itm put instead of a put 5 6 below the atm price is because he wants to only lose 5 6 after all fee 's   a put at 5 6 below atm is not free so it will not actually provide a 6 cushion more likely maximum loss after it 's cost is accounted for you can not rely on the strike alone to determine the level of protection you are buying   real world example   spy dec 2017 strike put costs $ it 's about 6 otm but it costs roughly 10 of spy $ at best it would protect 85 of your net worth    strike costs = protection   did he choose an itm put because he does not want to pay any time    premium does he not lose in wide bid ask spreads what he gains by not    paying time premium nope you were just misunderstanding how he calculated his protection he wanted to protect 5 6 after the cost of the hedge he needed to select an itm put because time premiums are so high that an otm put would n't suffice

it 's important to distinguish between speculation and investing buying something because you hope to make money on market fluctuations is speculation buying something and expecting to make money because your money is providing actual economic value is investing   if person a buys 100 shares of a stock with the intent of selling them in a few hours and person b buys 100 shares of the same stock with the intent of holding on to it for a year then obviously at that point they both have the same risk the difference comes over the course of the year first person b is going to be making money from the economic value the company provides over the whole year while the only way person a can make money is from market fluctuation the economic value the company provides over the course of an hour is unlikely to be significant person b is exposed to the risk of buying the stock but that 's by the profit from holding the stock for a year while person a just has the risk second if person a is buying a new stock every hour then they 're going to have thousands of transactions so even though person b assumed just as much risk as person a for that one transaction person a has more total risk

exchange a has 100 shares of a stock at $ 10 the next 100 shares cost $ 10.01 exchange b has the same pricing structure   a fund manager wants to buy 200 shares of the stock and decides that buying 100 shares at $ 10 from each exchange will be cheaper than staying in one exchange and paying $ 10.01 for the second half of his order   the manager places two separate orders let 's say the first order reaches exchange a and the trade executes at $ 10 traders algorithms on exchange b see this happen and adjust their price up to $ 10.01 accordingly now when the manager 's order reaches exchange b there will no longer be any shares trading at $ 10   some people say that this is front running but if the manager only wanted 100 shares the price would have still shifted some say this creates a more efficient market with tighter spreads due to the decreased risk to the market maker but it also means the aggregate bid ask offers across multiple exchanges are not necessarily accurate creating a false liquidity you can decide for yourself whether or not this is a good thing

the simplest way is to invest in a few etfs depending on your tolerance for risk assuming you 're very short term risk tolerant you can invest almost all in a stock etf like voo or vti   stock market etfs return close to 10 unadjusted over long periods of time which will out earn almost any other option and are very easy for a non finance person to invest in you do n't trade actively you leave the money there for years   if you want to hedge some of your risk you can also invest in bond funds which tend to move up in stock market downturns but if you 're looking for the long term you do n't need to put much there otherwise try to make sure you take advantage of tax breaks when you can iras 401ks etc most of those will have etfs whether vanguard or similar available to invest in   look for funds that have low expense ratios and are fairly diversified ie do n't just invest in one small sector of the economy as long as the economy continues to grow the etfs will grow

you have some good points but get this it will certainly come a point of time where say 80 of the working population can provide 100 of the goods services everyone needs then this will get to 70 60 this can result in two things either huge unemployment problem or overproduction and all that comes with it spoilage lower prices cost cutting i.e. again unemployment it may not be soon but i think it 's inevitable the problem with that is so far employment is a great way to redistribute wealth a fair way let 's say which is the actual problem at hand jobs would n't matter if we had another efficient mechanism to do that in fact it would be better if humans did n't have to work at all and focus on leisure science art w e but we do n't have such a mechanism unfortunately and as the need for a labor force shrinks things are going to get ugly even than now since the supply of labor will grow with human population the price of labor inevitably will go down which means even more transfer of wealth from middle lower class to the capital owners

gt if you accept the thesis that white people are better nation builders than black people you must accept the idea that white people and black people are fundamentally different   and if you accept the idea that black people are statistically better than white people does that make you racist too or just somebody who has looked at an olympic lineup in the past ten years if we 're to be consistent should n't we be enacting affirmative action in the nba until the demographics match the general population if not why is that behaviour acceptable desirable and lauded in other fields   maybe it 's just a stupid word that a political special interest group have tried to turn into a weapon to use against anyone who does n't pay sufficient to their agenda

i was merely trying to be helpful conceptually you have dump this idea that something is skewed it is n't firm a sold for $ 500 equity value aka purchase price to shareholders + debt zero cash 50 for 450   enterprise value is the cash free debt free sale price   the implied ev multiple is on a that is the answer the other business sold for a higher multiple of 5x   if you would pile on more cash onto a the purchase price would increase but the ev would n't       the idea is to think hard about the difference between equity value and enterprise value when examining a transaction

the truth is anyone can sue anyone for anything   so yes you could be sued but the more important part to measure is the probability of success    while this is probably more of a legal stack exchange question in order for a successful suit there has to be proven at least some negligence on your part in the situation you cite   the very fact that the landlord is not willing to turn on the heat is probably enough to absolve you from any liability   once you go down to a local store and purchase a certified heater then a suit would have a very low probability of success    perhaps a case could be made if you made your own heater and it burned down the house   but that would require finding a jury that is sympathetic to landlords that will not provide heat for their tenants highly unlikely could the landlord sue the heater company   yes and would likely receive an out of court settlement    even in the case that liability can be proven on your part it is very unlikely you would be targeted   these type of suits target deep pockets or those with wealth   unless something is specifically known about you having a high level of net worth a civil suit will not be brought against a room renter because of the lack of funds   people in your demographic tend not to have a lot of money   no offense intended i was there myself once   in the case that you do have a high net worth then get renters insurance and possibly an umbrella policy   it is a small price to pay to protect a significant amount of assets    if i was in your shoes here is what i would do

i would tell the former owner that you will sell him the house for you current loan balance he wants the home he may be willing to pay what you owe you ca n't really do a short sale unless you are behind on your payments banks only agree to a short sale when they think they are going to have to foreclose on the property not to mention a short sale is almost as bad as a foreclosure and will wreck your credit if the former buying is not willing to buy the house for what you owe your only real option is to come up with the difference if he offers you say $ 50 k less than you owe you will have to give the mortgage holder the remaining balance $ 50 k in this example for them to release the property   another problem you will face if the former owner is willing to pay more than what the house is worth and he is going to finance it he will have to have enough cash to put down so that the loan amount is not more than the property is worth finally if none of that works you can just hold on to the property until the value comes up or you mortgage is payed down enough to make the balance of the mortgage less than the value of the house then offer the property to the former owner again

now i want to get this money in my new uk bank account does this mean that gov will take taxes from this money as well yes that is income and you have to pay tax on that but it might be a bit complicated than that so i would ask you to call up hmrc or visit an accountant or maybe ask the finance people of your employer also one of my family members send us money every few months and will send to this bank from now on does taxes also apply on this see the hmrc page about capital gains tax on gifts you wo n't have to pay capital gains tax when you give a gift to your    husband wife or civil partner as long as both of the following    apply it 's useful to keep a note of what the asset cost you your spouse or    civil partner may need this to work out their capital gains tax when    they dispose of the asset example mr b lives with his wife and gives her an antique table that    he bought for £ 12,000 in 2003 mrs b spends £ 500 restoring the table    eventually selling it for £ 20,000   her total costs are £ 12,500 £ 500 plus mr b 's original cost £ 12,000 mrs b 's    gain is £ 7,500 £ 20,000 less £ 12,500 when you make a gift to a family member or other person you 're    connected with you 'll need to work out the gain or loss this does n't    apply to gifts you make to your spouse or civil partner this also applies if you dispose of an asset to them in any other way    for example you sell it to them for a low price a connected person in this context is someone such as your brother    sister child parent grandparent mother in law or business partner    follow the link below for more information about connected people and    capital gains tax you must get a valuation of the asset at the time you made the gift    use this value in place of any amount you received for the asset to    work out your gain or loss if you gave the asset away then of course    the amount you received for it will be nothing if you make a loss you can only deduct the loss from gains you make on    gifts or other to the same person

i think you have already outlined for yourself most of the pros and cons of each method of giving it sounds to me like you have some desire to control how the money is spent or at least reserve the right not to give it to a child who will waste it according to your definition   if you set up an utma ugma account or just give the money directly each year as a birthday gift you are control of the money it 's a gift and is no longer yours to direct   if you set up a 529 you at least restrict the money to a particular useful purpose moreover if you retain ownership of the 529 you can take the money back albeit with a tax penalty to yourself   if you do hold a 529 in your name but for a child 's benefit there are a couple of things to consider with respect to future financial aid this is from recent experience my in laws have 529s for our children both of whom are currently in college a 529 not owned by the student or the student 's parent is not reported as an asset of the child or the parent on the free application for federal student aid fafsa however once such a 529 is used to pay college expenses the amount of those payments does get reported on the following year 's fafsa and counts as untaxed income for the purposes of figuring the expected family contribution efc untaxed income is assessed towards the efc at 50 in contrast parental assets are assessed at around 7 if i recall correctly and student assets at around 35 student owned 529s are assessed at the rate of parental assets which is an advantage if the amount you will set aside is less than the cost of one year of college you can avoid the disadvantage of the untaxed income assessment by just using the entire 529 for the final year of school since there will be no fafsa for the following year it occurs to me that there is one other way you can give to them that you did not mention and may make you more comfortable in terms of encouraging some positive behavior namely save the money in a self owned account then when they are old enough to get a job that provides a w-2 showing declared earned income you can use the savings to fund a traditional or roth ira for them up to the limit allowed each year until the money you set aside is exhausted the roth is a better long term savings vehicle but the traditional would carry bigger penalties for early withdrawal and would therefore be less tempting to draw on

go on a website that has real estate listings   find similar homes in the same neighborhood and list out the prices   once you have prices pick out two with different prices and call the realtor of the more expensive listing   tell that realtor about the other listing and ask why their listing is more expensive   compare their answer to the home that you are considering buying    for example they may say that their house has a newly remodeled kitchen   does the house you are considering have a newly remodeled kitchen   if so then use the higher priced listing and throw out the cheaper one   if not use the cheap listing and throw out the expensive one    or they might say that the expensive house is in a better location than the cheaper house   further away from traffic   easier to get to the highway or public transportation   if so ask how the location compares to the house you are actually considering   the realtor will tell you if the listings are comparable    when i talk about similar homes i mean homes that are similar in square footage number of bedrooms and number of bathrooms   generally real estate sites will allow you to search by all of these as well as location    after all this the potential seller may still turn you down   if he really wanted to sell he 'd have suggested a price   he may just be seeing if you 're willing to overpay   if so he could turn down an otherwise reasonable offer   how much he is willing to take is up to him    note that this would all be easier if you just bought a house the normal way   then the realtors would do the comparables portion of the work   you might be able to find a realtor or appraiser who would do the work for a set fee   perhaps your bank would help you with that as they have to appraise the property to offer a mortgage    you asked if you can buy out a mortgaged house with a mortgage   yes you can   that 's a pretty normal occurrence   normally the realtors would make all the necessary arrangements   i 'm guessing that a title transfer company could handle that

they said the expected returns from the stock market are around 7   emphasis added the key word in your quote is expected   on average the market gains in the 7 9 range more if you reinvest dividends but there 's a great deal of risk too meaning that in any given year the market could be down 20 or be   up 30 your student loan on the other hand is risk free   you are guaranteed to pay lose 4 a year in interest   you ca n't directly compare the expected return of a risk free asset with the expected return of a risky asset   you can compare the risks of two assets with equal expected returns and the expected returns of assets with equal risks but you ca n't directly compare returns of assets with different risks   so in two years you might be better off if you had invested the money versus paying the loan or you might be much worse off   in ten years your chances of coming out ahead are better but still not guaranteed what 's confusing is i 've heard that if you 're investing you should be investing in both stocks and bonds since i 'm young i would n't want to put much in bonds though so how would that factor in   bonds have lower risk uncertainty than stocks but lower expected returns   if you invest in both your overall risk is lower since sometimes not always the gain in stocks are offset by losses in bonds   so there is value in diversifying since you can get better expected returns from a diversified portfolio than from a single asset with a comparable amount of risk   however there it no risk free asset that will have a better return than what you 're paying in student loan interest

you can only contribute up to 5 of your salary odd usually 401(k contributions are limited to some dollar amount in the vicinity of $ 15,000 or so a year normal retirement guidelines suggest that putting away 10 15 of your salary is enough that you probably wo n't need to worry much when you retire 5 is n't likely to be enough employer match or no i 'd try to contribute 10 15 of my salary i think you 're reading the rules wrong i 'm almost certain it 's definitely worth checking if you 're not you should seriously consider this saving with a roth ira or just an after tax account   so if you 're with fidelity and do n't know what to do look for a target date fund with a date near your retirement e.g. target retirement 2040 and put 100 in there until you have a better idea of what going on all fidelity funds have pretty miserable expense ratios even their token s&p500 index fund from another provider so you might as let them do some leg work and pick your asset allocation for you alternatively look for the fidelity retirement planner tools on their website to suggest an asset allocation as a very rough rule of thumb as you 're saving for retirement you 'll want to have n% of your portfolio in bonds and the rest in stocks where n is your age in years your stocks should probably be split about 70 us and 30 rest of world give or take and your us stocks should be split about 64 large cap 28 mid cap and 8 small cap that 's basically how the us stock market is split

i 'm not sure you can get a refund in the us companies are n't required by law to offer one you could contact godaddy 's customer service and ask them but i would guess that they 'll agree with the contents of the legal agreement unless there is another part of the agreement that does allow you to get a refund there might be i have n't read it you 're probably out of luck and yes this is legitimate it 's a legal agreement and by checking the box if there was one going through with the purchase etc you indicated that you read and agreed to the legal agreement and therefore accepted that you would n't be offered a refund godaddy is n't responsible if someone purchases something from them without reading the agreement before agreeing to it furthermore the legal agreement is n't the only place where the refund policy is stated godaddy 's page what is domain buy service says your purchase is non refundable and non transferable this is a help page not something you explicitly agree to and therefore not legally binding but as a lesson for the future always read the description of what you 're purchasing before you purchase it for general reference if for some reason you were the victim of fraud e.g. a company offered a refund in their legal agreement but refused to give it you and you paid with a credit card you have more options because you could work with your credit card company to potentially get your money back in this case however the agreement was clear so this is n't an option

nobody here really answered your question   the custodian of the 401k determines what funds and investment options are available within that 401k   so if they 're eliminating company stock as an option then they can absolutely make you sell out of it     you may be able to do an in service rollover and transfer your funds to an individual ira but that 's not particularly common among 401k administrators    aside from that i 'd ask why do you want to hold company stock anyway   generally i 'd advise against this as its imposing a ton of risk on your financial future   if your company tanks you 're out of a job which sucks   but it sucks even more if your company tanks and your 401k loses a ton of value at the same time    edit i see you asked who benefits as well   it may just be a situation of no benefit at all   perhaps the plan did n't have enough people investing in company stock to make the option cost effective   maybe the administrator decided that allowing people to take on that amount of risk was not in their best 's not   could be a ton of reasons but it 's unlikely the company did so out of greed   there is n't a lot of financial benefit for them there

the following is based on my experian credit scoring feedback and experience here in the uk over many years   and for further information i currently hold a credit score of 999 the highest possible with 6 credit cards   now i 'm assuming that while there may be some differences in particulars in your case due to the difference in locality nevertheless the below should hopefully provide some broad guidelines and reasonable conclusion in your situation having a large number of active credit accounts may be seen as a negative   however having a large number of settled accounts should on the contrary have a positive effect on your score   as you keep your accounts mostly settled i think having another card will not be to your detriment and should in time be beneficial a large total credit balance outstanding may count against you   but see the next point    having your total outstanding debt on all credit accounts be a smaller proportion of your total available credit counts in your favour   this means having more cards for the same amount of credit in use is net net in your favour   it also has the effect of making even larger outstanding credit balances as in point 2 to be a lower percentage of your total available credit and consequently will indicate lower risk to lenders    it appears from my experience the higher the highest credit limit on a single card you are issued and are managing responsibly e.g. either paid off or used responsibly the better needless to say any late payments count against you   the best thing to do then is to set up a direct debit for the minimum amount to be paid like clockwork every month   lenders really like consistent payers new credit accounts initially will count against you for a while   but as the accounts age and are managed responsibly or settled they will eventually count in your favour and increase your score making many credit applications in a short space of time may count against you as you may be seen to be credit reliant   conclusion on balance i would say get the other card   your credit score might be slightly lower for a couple of months but eventually it will be to your benefit as per the above     having another card also means more flexibility and more more options if you do end up with a credit balance that you want to finance and pay off over a period as cheaply as possible    in the uk the credit card companies are falling over themselves trying to offer one interest free or 0 balance transfer offers   of course they 're not truly 0 since you typically have to pay a transfer fee of a couple of percent still this can be quite cheap credit much much cheaper than the headline apr rates actually associated with the cards   the catch is that any additional spending on such cards are paid off first and attract interest at the normal rate until paid off   usually also if you miss a payment the interest rate reverts to the normal rate   but these pitfalls are easily avoided pay by direct debit and do n't use card you 've got a special deal on for day to day expenses so having more cards available is then very useful because you then have choice   you can roll expensive debts to the cheapest lender at your disposal for as long as they 'll offer and then simply not use that card for any purchases while paying off the balance as cheaply as possible meanwhile using another card for day to day expenses

regarding auto insurance you have to look at the different parts in the united most states do require a level of specific coverage for all drivers that is to make sure that if you are at fault there is money available to pay the victims that payment may be for damage to their car or other property but it also covers medical costs many policies also cover you if the other driver does n't have insurance the policy that covers the loss of the vehicle is required if you have a loan or are leasing the car somebody else owns it while there is a loan so they can and do require you to pay to protect the vehicle   if there i no loan you do n't have to have that portion of a policy other parts such as towing assistance and rental cars replacement may be required by the insurance standards for your state or might be almost impossible to drop because all insurance companies include it to stay competitive with their competition   dropping the non required parts of the coverage is acceptable when you do n't have a loan some people do drop it to save money but that does mean you are self insuring if you can afford to self insure a new car great the interesting thing is that some people have more than enough assets to self the non required part of auto insurance but then they realize that they do need to up their umbrella liability insurance this is to protect them from somebody deciding that their resources make them a tempting target when they are involved in a collision

i have a related issue since i have some income which is large enough to matter and hard to predict start with a best guess check what tax bracket you were in last year and withhold that percentage of the expected non withheld income adjust upward a bit if desired to reflect the fact that you 're getting paid more at the new job adjust again either up or down to reflect whether you were over withheld or under withheld last year whether the irs owed you a refund or you had to send a check with your return repeat that process next year after next tax season when you see how well your guess worked out you could try pre calculating the entire tax return based on your expected income and then divide any underpayment into per paycheck additional withholding but i do n't think it 's worth the effort i do n't worry about trying to get this exactly correct i do n't stress about lost interest if i 've over withheld a bit and as long as your withholding was reasonably close and you have the cash float available to send them a check for the rest when it comes due the irs generally does n't grumble if your withholding was a bit low   it would be really nice if the irs paid us interest on over withholding to mirror the fact that they charge us interest if we 're late in returning our forms oh well despite all the stories the irs really is fairly reasonable if you are n't deliberately trying to get away with something the process is annoying but should n't be scary the one time they mail audited me it was several thousand dollars in my favor i 'd forgotten to claim some investment losses and their computers noticed the error though i still say the motto of the next revolution will be no taxation without proper instructions

sorry in advance but this will be long   also it sounds like your friend is a tool i hope this friend is not also your financial advisor they would be encouraging you to make a very poor investment decision they also do n't know how to do financial math   for what it 's worth i am not wrong i have correctly answered a set of changing questions as you have asked them your friend is answering based on a third completely different investment model which you proposed in the edit to your last post if that 's what you meant all along then you should have been more clear in the questions you were asking   please let me layout the following how the previous proposals were built how to analyze this current proposal what your other option is why the other option is best in a real world market the first question my understanding of the initial proposal was to take out a $ 10,000 loan invest the proceeds and expect to not have any money of your own tied up in this because that op did not specify that this is an interest only loan you still have n't in any of your questions the bank will require you to make payments back to them each month that include principal and interest   your friend is talking about the total interest paid being the only cost of a loan while that is almost true regardless of what your friend says significantly more cash is involved in making sure that all the payments are made on time unless you set up an interest only loan but with the set up laid out in this post and with the assumptions i specified there the principal payments must be included because the borrower has to pay back the bank and is n't not tying up any of their own money   in that case my initial analysis is correct your breakeven is in the low teens for an annual required return   the second proposal your second proposal before any edits refined things a little bit to try to capture the any possible returns by not selling something as i indicated there with what was an exaggerating assumption the lack of clarity makes for an outlandish required return   the second proposal with edits or the one proposed above i will get to the one proposed above in a second but first let me highlight a few problems with your friend 's analysis   simple interest the only place in the us at least that will lend with simple interest is student loans any loan that you actually take out will be compound interest   not an interest only loan your friend is not calculating interest correctly since this is n't an interest only loan the principal balance will reduce every time you make a payment by each month this substantially reduces the total interest paid to $ over the total 24 months   returns i do n't know what country or what business your friend works in but returns are a very ambiguous concept investopedia defines returns as gains or losses i wish i could the land that your friend lives in when returns are always positive defines a return for finance as the change in the value of a portfolio over an evaluation period including any distributions made from the portfolio during that period   when you have not made it clear that any other money is being used in this investment plan as was the case in scheme 1 and scheme 2a the loan still has to be paid so clearly the principal must be included in the return calculations   how to evaluate this proposed investment scheme key dimensions loan $ 8,000 24 months 0.27 monthly rate monthly compounding no loan origination fees monthly payment pmt in excel yields $ investment capital starting = $ 8,000 monthly return investment yields we hope it 's positive   your monthly contribution from your salary taxes = 10 transaction fees = $ 20   go and lookup how to build an amortization table for a loan in excel your life will be infinitely better for it   now you get this loan set up and invested into something it costs $ 20 to buy the assets   so you 've got $ chugging away earning interest i calculate that your break even with you paying in $ of your own money each month is annually or over the 24 month life of this scheme that is using monthly compound interest for the payments because that 's what the real world would use and using monthly compounding of the investments returns   your total interest expense would be $   this seems feasible but let 's talk about what your other option is given that you 're ready to spend $ each month on an investment   your other option   i understand the appeal of getting $ 8,000 right away to invest in something but the risk behind this is that if the market goes down and markets do you 're stuck paying a fixed amount for your loan that is now worth less money   your other option is to take your $ and invest it step by step you would want to skip a month or two buying assets in the market so that you can lessen transaction costs this has two advantages 1 you save yourself $ in interest 2 when the market goes down you still win   with this strategy you still win when the market goes down because of what is commonly called dollar cost averaging when the market is up your investments are also up when the market goes down your previous investments decrease in value but you can invest new money at the lower rates   why the step by step invest your own money strategy is better at low rates when you 're looking for your break even the step by step model outperforms the loan at higher rates of return ~4 + per year you get the benefit of having the borrowed money earning more gains   in fact for every continuous meaning set not changing month to month interest rate that you can dream up that is greater than about 4 per year the borrowed money earns more   at 10 per year the borrowed money will earn about $ 500 more over the 2 years than your step by step investment would   but i recognize that you might feel like the market will always go up that 's what everyone thinks and that 's alright   but have one really bad month or a couple of just not great months and your fixed loan portfolio will underperform have a few really bad months and your portfolio could be substantially reduced in value but you would still be paying the same amount for it each month   and if that happened say your assets declined -3 in 3 of the 24 months you 'd be losing money relative to the step by step portfolio

lack of demand   there is no such thing as a lack of demand   people will always demand stuff they want and need   if you 're saying people are lacking demand of the goods and services that have been overly inflated and then yes i agree and therefore this lack of demand is the right medicine to signal to the market that we need to reallocate supply and production to create products services that people want and can afford to buy   more stimulus and propping up failed industries services will only mean that we will just continue the failed path that brought us here in the first place

none of that is filtered my way as a part owner sure it is it 's just not always obvious when a company makes money it either other then the fourth option the first three all increase the total value of the company   if you owned 1 of a company that was worth x and is now worth x+1 the value of that 1 ownership should go up as well one model of the value of a share of stock is the present value of all future cash flows that the company produces for its shareholders which would be either through dividends earnings provided that they are invested back into the company or through liquidation sale   so as earnings increase or more accurately as projected future earnings increase so does the value of a share of the company also note that the payment of dividends causes the price of a stock to go down when the dividend is paid since that 's equity cash that 's leaving the company reducing the value of the company by an equivalent amount of course there 's also something to be said for the behavioral aspect of investing meaning that people sometimes invest in companies that they like and sell stock of companies that they do n't like or disagree with e.g. 's

no we did not apply for the loan so this is why we thought it was a bit strange a company just sending you a real check for $ it does not say anywhere in big red letters that it is a loan probably something in very small letters on a back of a paper   this is really horrible especially if your customers do pay you by check and small business relies on online statement to determine who paid what i can easily imagine a small outfit that just takes all the checks to the bank cash them and then use online statement to update their books    i do not see how it is helpful to businesses to receive pre approved credit that is so poorly marked especially in the age of electronic transfers   i am trying to understand why i feel so offended by this and i guess it all comes down to disgust i refuse to believe that any serious company would use these sort of tactics and instead of us spending more time developing a better product we have to put more time and effort into ensuring we do not fall victim to this

i ca n't give you proper legal advice but if i called their customer service and used half an hour of my time to wait and explain the situation in detail and their official response was just use the points i would do just that of course you would have stronger legal standing if you had recorded their answer or had it in writing from them but i do n't think spending these points will come crashing down on you and morally i see absolutely no problem with spending these points it is not as if you are stealing from someone else these points can usually be given away in any kind of crazy manner sometimes there are lotteries or events where they give away 100,000 points for new customers who open up an account on a specific weekend sometimes they give points to customers who want to terminate their contracts as an attempt to them into staying they have given you a lot of points and do n't really care as a result you are probably staying their customer forever and will most likely tell this story to many friends this is free advertising for them heck maybe they would even make a news story out of this some day it could be good publicity everyone is essentially getting these points for free but in fact the company has a business case by improving their image and customer retention with these points so you can spend these points with a sound mind morally legally you would have to contact a lawyer but i think chances for legal repercussions are small if you have done your duty informed them and their customer service basically said it 's ok

here 's a little different perspective i 'm not going to talk about the quality of the investment the expected return or any of the other things you normally talk about when evaluating investments this is about family and the most important thing here is the relationships   what you need to do here is look at the different possible scenarios and figure out how each of these would make you feel only you can evaluate this for example here are some questions to ask yourself i know how i would answer these questions but that would n't help you any but the advice i would give you is assuming you have this money to lose and are also investing elsewhere evaluate this solely on the basis of the effect on your family relationships   the only other piece of advice i would give you is to knock out that student loan and car loan debt as fast as you possibly can minimize your investments until that debt is gone so you can get rid of it even faster

the vast majority of individual taxpayers in the united states operate on a cash basis of accounting this means that the assignment of deductions or income to tax year is based on the date of the paycheck   so the money in that early january 2016 paycheck has been correctly assigned to the 2016 tax year this is unfortunate for you because you will receive a w-2 for 2016 showing that you had a retirement account knowing exactly how many paychecks there are in a year can be very import to know when trying the reach or avoid some thresholds even quitting the previous pay period might not have helped i have seen some companies payout unused vacation sick and severance over several paychecks they did n't give you it all in one lump sum they did it 80 hours a paycheck until the balance owed to the employee was zero

i kind of hate piling on with another opinion but this is too long for a comment i did what you are thinking of doing i would at least try renting it for a couple years so long as the primary risks of renting are mostly related to unexpected costs and bad tenants you 've got a very healthy income so as long as you maintain a nice emergency fund it does n't sound like keeping this property as a rental will be too much risk if the rental market is strong where your house is then you have a better chance of avoiding bad tenants i like to keep my rent a little lower than the max i think it could go for to attract more applications and hopefully find someone who will be a good longer term tenant tax free gains so long as you lived in your house 2 of the last 5 years you can sell without paying capital gains tax on your profit so you could try renting it for 2 years and then sell that was a key for me when i converted my first house to a rental i liked that flexibility there 's still the typical renting risks associated but it 's not a lifelong commitment you can get 2 years of increased equity appreciation tax free or you could find you enjoy it and keep it for the long haul

my suggestion is that you speak with a financial adviser that specializes in islamic investing for the long term there are islam approved mutual funds that only invest in non banking organizations and i would assume there are more conservative options for the short term as well 3 4 years although you may not feel the effects of inflation all that much in just a few years it would still be beneficial to utilize programs that allow you to earn a return on your money i may not have said that for $ 2,500 but for $ 25,000 i think it 's worth looking into also some scholars suggest that it is even allowed to invest in mutual funds that deal with banks as long as you calculate the portion of your return that came from the bank charging interest and donate that amount to charity

when you start investing makes a very large difference to the outcome but that is on the time scale of what generation you were born into not what week you choose to open your 401(k   as you note in your last sentence there is nothing that you can do about this so there is no point in worrying about it if you could successfully market time successfully then that would make a difference even at smaller time scales   but you probably ca n't so there is no point in worrying about that either as points out your statement about not their net worth until 2013 applies to someone who invested a lump sum at the 2007 peak not to someone who invested continuously throughout    by my calculation if you started continuously investing in a broad market index at the peak around jun 4 2007 you would have recovered your net worth relative to investing in a safe instrument that merely kept up with inflation a hard thing to find these days around april 12 2010   i 've done the computation on each business day because that is easier so it might be slightly worse if do the periodic investment on each payday which is much more realist for a 401(k and of course if you need to preserve recover you net worth in 3 years you should n't be in stocks in the first place

gt;it can be argued that the economy was a major goal of the fed in the first place to prevent the unrestrained runs that 1913 1929 saw which resulted in thousands of investors losing everything    the fed was the underlying cause of the 1913 29 era    the panic of 1907 was really just a rich man 's panic few people in the general population were invested in the stock market at that time and few businesses were listed either the vast majority were privately owned operated on a cash i.e. not leveraged debt basis and were substantially unaffected   the whole point of the fed was to save the rich men 's from their own to socialize their losses   which is exactly and only what it is doing   about the general welfare of the overall population they could n't give a rat 's tail other than some minimal concern over whether and how they will be able to milk amp the population again

it might some but i 'd wager it pushes the short term rental pricing down like hotels while pushing the long term rental and housing market prices up     if landlords can make way more in short term rentals they are going to do that and limit the supply of long term   the tourism sector may have increased revenue but by what extent i do n't know   i 'd wager that exploding rent and housing prices will negate any benefits for most residents and may end up costing them much more   this is why i think you should only be able to do it on your primary residence   unless you want to be regulated like a hotel because if you have short term rentals that you do n't reside in that is effectively what you are   not being regulated the same as a hotel at that point only gives you an unfair loophole advantage to other short term rentals

i had an internship and they hired me afterwards honestly sounded like a good way to break in i also learned a whole new language for the internship and wanted to continue using it instead of any of the languages taught in school   not sure if the company would be considered good or bad i ended up being solo for a long time but also building three applications ground up i felt like i was improving a lot especially on projects they gave me lots of leeway on because they were low priority they just wanted features no emergency bug tickets etc but no peers for most of my work and all the software was privately made and privately licensed sold   i also had difficulties leaving because i 'm an idiot with no backup me leaving basically meant they would be fucked and they were my only reference i was fine taking that salary because i had zero experience no job ever not even volunteering my mother would n't let me because of however once i was more valuable to this company and they even praised me for it in the assessments they gave out 2 raises later my bonuses decreased as my hours and responsibilities increased too   i asked to be taken off the stressful project thinking i could salvage this and they hired a replacement for me to train 3 months later i got the high leeway project again for 6 months and my job satisfaction was phenomenal by comparison so i stayed however then my replacement was fired so they asked me as a favour to work on the stressful project again and said they would replace me in a month and a half they did n't i worked on it for 8 months i kept asking about it too their job posting was also terrible and they me in on it   at the end and i gained the responsibility of recruiting and vetting yay for that one actually we hired another replacement for me i trained them too and left immediately   actually i regret staying there as long as i did they me and i should n't have tried to make up for their incompetence they actually made me a contractor at the end so i was getting paid half of what i originally was before i left i asked for a competitive raise and the company owner basically lied about details and tried to tell me what a fuss i was trying to talk about my happiness and what i want once a year it was but they agreed to bump my pay in the end however i was furious by their treatment and reply which btw came after i suddenly did not show up despite and clearly stating i would cease work with them and informing the people i worked with on the last day that i heard nothing back from the owner about a new extended contract so i said no   i do n't know how to negotiate i am too humble selling oneself or seeing someone sell themselves makes me physically uncomfortable it is completely unnatural and sets off my bullshit alarms actually i seem to have some from that job now too

the article best stock fund of the decade focus from the wall street journal in 2009 describe the highest performing mutual fund in the usa between 2000 and 2009 the investor return in the fund what the shareholders actually earned was abysmal why because the fund was so volatile that investors panicked and bailed out locking in losses instead of waiting them out the reality is that almost any strategy will lead to success in investing so long as it is actually followed a strategy keeps you from making emotional or knee jerk decisions btw beware of anyone selling you a strategy by telling you that everyone in the world is a failure except for the few special people who have the privilege of knowing their secrets link removed as it 's gone dead

you can find a lot of information at the website at   if you do n't want to work as an employee you can register as self employed basically a one man band which is quite simple you can start your own company which is more work but can have tax advantages or you can find umbrella companies which will officially employ you while in reality you are a freelancer and only do your billing through them   umbrella companies can be anywhere from totally legal to extremely dodgy if they promise you that you pay only five percent tax on your income through tricks that 's only until the tax office finds out and they will make you pay   between self employed and your own company the big difference is whether you are actually working independently or not if you work like an employee take someone else 's orders and claim you are a company the tax office does n't like that and if you pay very little taxes they do n't like that either so self employed is the safer choice but you will pay more taxes close to what a normal employee would pay obviously you will have to pay tax on your income and nhs insurance   obviously you are required to tell the government actually hmrc about your income not doing so would be tax evasion and get you into deep trouble when you are caught   i do n't think you have to tell them the source of your income but not telling them might look very suspicious and might get your accounts checked carefully and unless you design a website for the mafia why would n't you tell them the bill payer will try to deduct your bill from their profits anyway so it 's no secret   most important to remember when you send out a bill and receive payment you 'll have to pay tax on it when self employed as a rule of thumb put one third away into a savings account for your tax bill do n't spend it all or you will find yourself in deep trouble when your taxes need paying plus put some more away for times when you ca n't find work

i really like value investing by bruce it 's not a textbook so you can probably pick it up for about $ 20 while it is dense i think with some patience you might be able to understand it at the undergrad level the process outlined in the vi book is very different from the conventional corp finance way of valuing a company   a typical corp finance model would probably have you model cash flows 5 or 10 years out and then assume some sort of terminal growth the vi book argues that it 's nearly impossible to predict things that far out accurately so build your valuation on what we know start with the balance sheet then look at this year 's earnings is that sustainable   this is a simplification of course but i describe it only so you can get the idea i think it 's definitely a worthwhile read

i absolutely agree with the other answers   no contest you should keep getting the match   but just for completeness i 'll give a contrarian opinion that is generally not very popular but does have some merit    if you can focus on just one main financial goal at a time and throw every extra dollar you have at that one focus i.e. getting out of debt in your case you will make better progress than if you 're trying to do too many things at once   also there something incredibly freeing about being out of debt that has other beneficial impacts on your life so if you can bring a lot of focus to the credit card debt and get it paid off quickly it may be worth deferring the 401(k investing long enough to do that even though it does n't make as much mathematical sense   this is essentially what dave ramsey teaches btw

regarding the usefulness of the bare number itself it is not useful unless for example an employer uses that average in the computation of how many options the employer grants to the employee as part of the compensation paid one of my employers used just such an average what is far more common is to use two or more moving averages of different periods plotted on a chart   my original response continues below assuming there are trading days a year the following chart does what you have done but with a moving average aapl on   edit btw i looked up the number of federal holidays there are 9 the average year has days × = subtract 9 and you get trading days in the average year so is a better number for the sma than 250 if you want to average a year   edit2 here is the same chart with more than one average included aapl chart w indicators

the difficulty with investing in mining and gold company stocks is that they are subject to the same market forces as any other stocks although they may whether those forces better in a crisis than other stocks do because they are related to gold which has always been a flight to safety move for investors some investors buy physical gold although you do n't have to take actual delivery of the metal itself   you can leave it with the broker dealer you buy it from much the way you do n't have your broker send you stock certificates   that way if you leave the gold with the broker dealer someone reputable of course like or then you can sell it quickly if you choose just like when you want to sell a stock if you take delivery of a security share certificate or commodity gold oil etc then before you can sell it you have to return it to broker which takes time   the decision has much to do with your investing objectives and willingness to absorb risk   the reason people choose mutual funds is because their money gets spread around a basket of stocks so if one company in the fund takes a hit it does n't wipe out their entire investment   if you buy gold you run the risk low in my opinion of seeing big losses if for some reason gold prices plummet   you 're all in on one thing which can be risky it 's a judgment call on your part but that 's my two cents worth

not long after college in my new job i bought a used car with payments i have never done that since i just do n't like having a car payment i have bought every car since then with cash you should never borrow money to buy a car there are several things that come into play when buying a car when you are shopping with cash you tend to be more conservative with your purchases look at this study on credit card purchases    a bradstreet study found that people spend 12 18 more when using credit cards than when using cash and mcdonald 's found that the average transaction rose from $ 4.50 to $ 7.00 when customers used plastic instead of cash   i would bet you if you had $ 27,000 dollars cash in your hand you would n't buy that car you 'd find a better deal and or a cheaper car when you finance it it just does n't seem to hurt as bad even though it 's worse because now you are paying interest   a new car is just insanity unless you have a high net worth at least seven figures your $ 27,000 car in 5 years will be worth about $ 6500 that 's like striking a match to $ 340 dollars a month you ca n't afford to lose that much money pay cash if you lose your job get hurt or any number of things that can cost you money or reduce your income it 's no problem with a paid for car they do n't repo paid for cars you have so much more flexibility when you do n't have payments you mention you have 10k in cash and a $ 2000 a month positive cash flow i would find a deal on a 8000 9000 car i would not buy from a sell the car you have put that money with the positive cash flow and every other dime you can get at your student loans and any other debt you have keep renting cheap keep the college lifestyle broke until you are completely out of debt then i would save for a house   finally i would read this dave ramsey book if i would have read this at your age i would literally be a millionaire by now i 'm 37 do n't buy from a dealer find a private sale car that you can get a deal on pay less than kelly blue book pay a little money $ 50 75 to have an automotive technician to check it out for you and get a car fax to make sure there are no major problems i have worked in the automotive industry for 20 + years and you rarely get a good deal from a dealer everything popular is wrong

currencies that are pegged or fixed require that foreign currencies are held by the central issuer at a proportional amount this is analogous to having a portfolio of currencies that the central bank issues shares from in the form of its own currency we will continue with this analogy if the central bank says these shares are worth $ 1 but the underlying components of the portfolio are worth $ 0.80 and decreasing then it is expensive for the central bank to maintain its peg and eventually they will have to disregard the peg as people start questioning the central bank 's solvency people will know the $ 1 they hold is not really worth what the central bank says it is because of the price changes people experience in buying goods and services especially when it comes to imports shadow economies will also trade using a currency more reflective of labor which happens no matter what the government 's are for doing so swiss national bank central bank did this in early 2015 as it experienced volatility in the euro which it had previously been trying to keep it 's currency pegged to it became too expensive for it to keep this peg on its own the central bank can devalue its currency by adjusting the proportions of the reserve such as selling a lot of foreign currency x buying more of currency y. they can and do take losses doing this swiss national bank is maintaining a large loss they can also flood their economy with more of their currency diluting the value of each individual 1 dollar equivalent this is done by issuing bonds or monetizing goods and services from the private sector in exchange for bonds people colloquially call this printing money but it is a misnomer in this day and age where printers are not relevant tools the good and service goes onto the central bank 's balance book and the company entity that provided the service now has a bond on its book which can be immediately sold to someone else for cash another reading is that the bond is as good as cash the bond did n't previously exist until the central bank said it did and central banks can infinitely exchange goods and services for bonds bond monetization also called quantitative easing is practiced by the federal reserve in the united states bank of japan european central bank and now the central bank of the republic of china

for example started an animation studio and production developing company to produce something in the ballpark of $ and he had a $ 12k yearly salary i have no clue what you mean as others have mentioned i 'm not sure what the 12 million refers to   do you mean total cost of created by the company in a year or   if so 12 million would amount to say 5 to 20 major brand name tv commercials for example   do you mean the cost of plant so for a tv commercial production company you mean purchasing desks drawing pads and so on your specific example of a film or tv commercial production company is a bad example it 's not really a business that is to say it does not rely on capital and return on capital the way famous film or tv commercial production companies happens is precisely like this a young guy girl g perhaps a designer or is working just as you say for a menial wage at a film company g got that first job perhaps out of art school   g gets a chance at doing a photo shoot animation or helping direct a tv commercial   g does a fantastic job later that year a large important animation or commercial job arrives at the company due to the earlier excellent result g is allowed to work on the new one g again he does a fantastic job   soon within that company g is a highly regarded or director and has attracted fame amongst colleagues and clients eventually g hears of a company xyz hotel that needs a tv ad made or an animation or whatever g says to xyz look you could spend $ 230,000 with a production company and in reality they 'd have me direct it anyway i 'm leaving to work independently so i will do your job for only $ 190,000 in a word xyz says yes and hands over a cheque for $ 190,000   g spends $ 160,000 on the usual actors editing etc and uses 2 months of g 's own time and pockets $ 5000 after tax g then does n't get a job for a couple months and then gets three more in the new year because the commercial for xyz was so good xyz gave him another couple to do for another product line eventually g has just enough money coming in that he hires a few freelance people for a few weeks here and there a and so on   eventually g has enough tv ads solidly booked g can risk actually hiring long time friend p as a producer   p spends most of her time actually bringing in more work and it builds from there eventually you have a very busy well known in the industry tv commercial production company with many staff and endless clients example say it might be at some point in there say around year three g would like to borrow the odd million bucks to basically help with cashflow the answer to that is nothing more than through business contacts g knows a wealthy dentist whoever who is prepared to do that but note carefully that at that point g 's company is already very firmly established famous for doing 20 spectacular commercials and so on   note too that 999 times out of 1000 when this happens the money evaporates and the dentist d never sees a penny back in that case g only much much later once the company has many many staff and great cashflow could the production company actually borrow from a bank or perhaps from actual investors which is more what you have in mind regarding your four categories   numbers 1 and 3 are totally wrong they do not work at all like you are asking indeed the very simple answer is borrow money to start a category 1 or 3 type of business it 's totally the only exception would be if you literally just have an extremely rich uncle who loans you a few million to start an animation studio which would be completely   because in that example company xyz could not care less if you have an animation studio ie your uncle has given you a platinum card and you bought a building some drawing pads and a few dozen macs   xyz just could n't care less   all they care about is your folio of work   in this example rsa would get the job     my guess is you 're thinking people somehow magically go around borrowing money to get businesses like that started   your examples 1 and 3 the simple answer is they do n't and ca n't   your fears are

leverage here is referring to financial leverage this is the practice of levering ie increasing like the use of a lever to increase the amount of weight you can lift the value of your investment by taking on debt   for example if you have 100k in cash you can buy a 100k rental property assume the property makes 10k a year net of expenses 10 now assume the bank will also give you a 100k mortgage at 3 you could take the mortgage plus your cash and buy a 200k rental property this would earn you 20k from the rental property less 3k a year in interest costs the 3 your total income would be 17k and since you only used 100k of your own money your rate of return would now be 17 instead of 10 this is financial leveraging note that this increases your risk because if your investment fails not only have you lost your own money you now need to pay back the bank beta riders appears to be negative commentary on investors who use beta to calculate the value of a particular stock without regard to other quantitative factors therefore leveraged beta riders are those who take on additional risk by taking on debt to invest and invest in a manner that the author would perhaps considered blindly following beta however i have never seen this term before and it appears tainted by the author 's views on quants a quant process driven discipline appears to be positive commentary on investors who use detailed quantitative analysis to develop rules which they rigorously follow to invest i have never seen this exact phrasing before and like the above it appears tainted by the author 's views on quants i am not providing any opinion on whether beta riding or quant processes are good or bad things this is just my attempt to interpret the quote as you presented it note that i did not go to the article to get context so perhaps something else in the article could skew the language to mean something other than what i have presented

no they are n't they either ca n't afford fast food burgers anymore or they are willing to pay a little extra because they are ashamed of eating at mcdonald 's   all fast food is roughly equivalent the differences are just perception and marketing   we probably all share the same concept of what taco bell and chipotle represent taco bell 's are dirty and filled with while chipotle 's are for younger people who enjoy fresh food that wo n't make you shit yourself   they both sell fake mexican food with ingredients that come from god knows where and are hastily assembled by surly teenagers   is one better than the other   that 's entirely subjective   is one more likely to make your sick   probably not both companies probably have roughly equivalent quality control procedures   does one have a better atmosphere   personally i think that can be up to confirmation bias   you see taco bell 's at gas stations and highway rest stops in poorer neighborhoods and taco bell has also been around for almost 40 years longer than chipotle so of course some of the stores are a bit more run down   americans are n't over fast food at all there is just more competition and the competition has great marketing

the fact that your ex is on the mortgage limits their ability to get more loans while you have been making the payments on time if you had any problems making those payments it would have also impacted their credit score it is understandable that they would like to be released from the mortgage the options that they have are limited you would have to refinance the mortgage lenders do n't just drop borrowers from a mortgage unless they have determined that the remaining people on the mortgage can make the payments besides the mortgage ownership documents were probably filed with the local government the refinancing process will require a signature by your ex unless the earlier agreement documents removed your ex as an owner and those were filed with the authorities regarding an exchange of funds it can be negotiated an attempt was done with the earlier agreement if the documents that were signed are proof of the agreement ca n't be determined by the internet how this is settled is outside the scope of this site it depends on what documents have been signed in the past the jurisdiction involved and the state of the relationship at the time of the purchase and at the time of the refinancing

what i think warren means is that people like him are really good at making money and setting things up to continue being rich in warren 's case he 's very good at evaluating businesses and if they would be good investments in the micro this is n't really a problem instead the problem is on the macro level when enough potential market participants i.e. people businesses are n't enabled to participate in the economy in the same way this feeds into a growing wealth inequality the people who have the resources to continue playing the game can also continue with more chances it 's a principle situation no opportunity to play little to improve and a continually disadvantaged population add time into the soup rich get richer the poor poorer the gap widens more add inflationary mechanics and the fact that being poor is more expensive add debt and an inability to purchase for long term solutions you get a situation where 99 of the money is cycling around in the top 1 of players   the other 99 of potential market participants are poorly utilized up to the point where their wealth is something they have trouble spending for things like healthcare   the idea of poorly utilized market participants is key a growing economy wants more bandwidth it wants more agents or market participants contributing to the flow get rich enough and you 'll find you ca n't spend more than the interest on investments on the contrary if you do n't have very much money it 's easy as hell to spend it quickly it 's straightforward to say that if more of the global population were n't in debt if they were n't in a state where they ca n't participate in economic growth then maybe the economic growth of human society would n't be so bottle

generally interest only mortgages are a bad idea because a lot of people get them so that they can buy more house than they could otherwise afford lower payment = affordable in their minds   if the house continues to go up in value they probably get away with it because when the balance becomes due they can refinance   however the last few years has shown how risky that strategy can be and this kind of things is what cost a lot of people their houses in your case if the house is something you could afford on a regular 15 or 30-year mortgage and you really are as disciplined as you say you are you might get away with it   but you have to take into account the risk and consider what happens if there is a job loss or similar difficulty in the future another thing to consider is the term of the mortgage   how many years will you get this lower interest rate   interest rates are at historic lows right now and pretty much everyone thinks they 're going up soon   you might be better off locking in a higher rate for 15 years

if you are disputing the size of the charge for specific services like you think that they overcharged for lab work you can try disputing it with the business office staff at the doctor 's office if on the other hand you just think that the overall bill is too expensive then you really only have one option you can ask if they will reduce the bill for you most hospitals and clinics i 've dealt with have programs set up for this but you usually access them by filling out paperwork demonstrating financial hardship along with supporting documents it never hurts to ask but with the services already rendered the only person with an interest in reducing the bill is you the reduction if any will probably depend on what the clinic thinks your ability to pay is compared with the cost to them of pursuing you for payment as well as the amount of funding they have for bill reduction when i worked in the financial services office of a hospital a $ 400 bill would not even have been reviewed for the balance would be too low to devote staff time to reviewing it 's frustrating and even asking in advance might not have given you accurate or any information on what the cost of the visit would be so your ability to shop around is limited unfortunately that does n't give you any additional options in this case

that is a loaded question but i 'll give it a shot   first things first you need to determine if you are ready to invest in stocks   if you have a lot of high interest debt you would be much better served paying that off before investing in stocks   stocks return around in the long run so you 'd be better off paying off any debt you have that is higher than most people get their start investing in stocks through mutual funds in their 401k or a roth ira   if you want to invest in individual stocks instead of mutual funds then you will need to do a lot of reading and learning you will need a brokerage account or if you have a stock in mind they might have a dividend reinvestment plan drip that you could invest in directly with the company you will have to compare the different brokerage firms to determine which is best for you   since you seem to be internet savvy i suggest you use a discount brokerage that let 's you buy stocks online with cheaper commissions   a good rule of thumb is to keep commissions below 1 of the amount invested once you have your online brokerage account open with money in there the process of actually buying the stock is fairly straightforward   just place an order for the amount of shares you want   that order can be a market order which means the purchase will occur at the current market price   or you can use a limit order where you control at what price your purchase will occur there are lots of good books out there for beginners   personally i learned from the motley fool and last but not least is to have fun with it   learn as much as you can and welcome to the club

one advantage of paying down your primary residence is that you can refinance it later for 10 15 years when the balance is low refinancing a rental is much harder and interest rates are often higher for investors this also assumes that you can refinance for a lower rate in the nearest future the question is really which would you rather sell if you suddenly need the money i have rental properties and i 'd rather move myself than sell the investments because they are income generating unlike my own home so in your case i 'd pay off primary residence especially since the interest is already higher on it would be a harder decision if it was lower

first of all it 's quite common place in gnucash and in accounting in general i believe to have accounts that represent concepts or ideas rather than actual accounts at some institution   for example my personal gnucash book has a plethora of expense accounts just made up by me to categorize my spending but all of the transactions are really just entries in my checking account as to your actual question i 'd probably do this by tracking such savings as negative expenses using an expense account and entering negative numbers   you could track grocery savings in your grocery expense account or if you want to easily analyze the savings data for example seeing savings over a certain time period you would probably want a separate grocery savings expense account edit regarding putting that money aside here 's an idea   let 's say you bought a $ 20 item that was on sale for $ 15   you could have a single transaction in gnucash that includes four splits one for each of the following actions decrease your checking account by $ 20 increase your expense account by $ 20 decrease your discount savings expense account by $ 5 and increase your savings account where you 're putting that money aside by $ 5

this sounds very like disguised employment you act like an employee of the company but your official relationship with them is as a contractor you gain none of the protection you get from being an employee and this may make you cheaper less risky and more desirable for the company who is hiring you   depending on your country you may also pay corporation tax rather than income tax which may represent a very significant saving also the company hiring you may not have to pay paye national insurance stakeholder pension etc this arrangement is normal and legal providing you genuinely are acting as a subcontractor however if you are behaving as an employee desk at the company company email have to work specific hours in a specific location no ability to subcontract etc you may be classified as a disguised employee in the uk it used to be common practice for highly paid employees to set up shell companies to avoid tax this will now get you into hot water google it sounds like your relationship in this case is directly with the recruiter you will have to consider if the recruiter is acting as your employer or if you remain a genuinely independent agent the duration of your contract with the recruiter will have a bearing on this in the uk there are a whole series of tests for disguised employment this is a good arrangement provided you go in with your eyes open and an awareness of the legislation   however you should absolutely check the rules that apply in your country before entering into this agreement you could potentially be very badly indeed

i have some experience with this   i have had fraudulent charges appear on my credit card statement and had to change my card number several times despite i believe no on my part   every time that this has happened i have never lost a penny due to fraud on my credit card   the bank has ultimately removed the fraudulent charges in every instance given this you 'd think the consumer does n't need to worry about this at all   but it seems like credit card companies beg to differ yes because although i have never lost a penny to fraud the bank or the merchant loses money every time it happens   the $ 0 liability protects you the card security measures protect the bank but why should a consumer ever bother worrying about these in the first place when he knows he legally ca n't be held responsible for fraudulent charges what exactly is this new peace of mind that he supposedly gets by say using features like virtual account numbers that he does n't already have although you should n't end up out any money when this happens it is an inconvenience   the bank will cancel your card and issue you a new number   it may take a few days for you to receive your new card   if you have another card to use this is n't a big deal   if you are out of state the day before you need to check out of a hotel and return a rental car with no backup credit card as i have been it is a big deal   in my case i had to have the credit card company talk to the hotel to give them the new card number and they were able to overnight me a new credit card so i could get home   i now make sure i carry a backup credit card should a consumer put any effort into worrying about this at all why in my opinion it makes sense to be careful what you do with your credit card number if only to avoid the inconvenience   do n't type your credit card number into an e mail message for example and only use it on websites that you trust   that having been said it is not worth it to be paranoid about it either   no matter how careful you are eventually you will probably use it at a store that gets hacked or your card will get skimmed somewhere and you 'll need to get a new credit card number the best way to protect yourself is to make sure that you go over your credit card statement each month and look for any fraudulent charges that the bank did n't catch

its different because at least with both stock options and futures the product is going to eventually get that money   the difference is that you do n't have to spend that money directly on that product right now allowing you to invest far more then you can afford since you are going to cover that option or sell that contract long before you are ever going to be on hook for actually buying all those stocks or barrels of oil you were trading   it 's actually a good way for a middle class investor to become really wealthy because if he is good all he needs is to save only about 10,000 to invest and he can invest like he 's investing 100,000   obviously there 's more risk too but give and take i guess

is n't it true that on the ex dividend date the price of the stock goes down roughly the amount of the dividend that is what you gain in dividend you lose in price drop yes and no it depends generally stocks move up and down during the market and become more volatile on some news so one ca n't truly measure if the stock has gone down by the extent of dividend as one can not isolate other factors for what is a normal share movement there are time when the prices infact moves up now would it have moved more if there was no dividend is speculative secondly the dividends are very small percentage compared to the shares trading price generally even if 100 dividend are announced they are on the share capital on share prices dividends would be less than 1 hence it becomes more difficult to measure the movement of stock note if the dividend is greater than a said percentage there are rules that give guidelines to factor this in options and other area etc lets not mix these exceptions why is everyone making a big deal out of the amount that companies pay in dividends then why do some people call themselves dividend investors it does n't seem to make much sense there are some set of investors who are passive i.e. they want to invest in good stock but do n't want to sell it i.e. more like keep it for long time at the same time they want some cash potentially to spend similar to interest received on bank deposits this class of share holders it makes sense to invest into companies that give dividends as year on year they keep receiving some money if they on the other hand has invested into a company that does not give dividends they would have to sell some units to get the same money back this is the catch they have to sell in whole units there is brokerage fees etc there are tax events some countries have taxes that are more friendly to dividends than capital gains thus its an individual choice whether to invest into companies that give good dividends or into companies that do n't give dividends   giving or not giving dividends does not make a company good or bad

i call bs glass steagall was an important firewall preventing investment in securities that commercial banks have no business being in even with 100 reserve when required returns continuously increase due to shareholder expectations it is only a matter of time before riskier and riskier positions are taken to meet these expectations this is a risk that depositors fdic in reality never knowingly signed up for at some point it only takes one really bad derivatives trade to bring it all down    in the long run decent interest rate spreads should be enough to keep commercial bankers happy at the very least some limitation on certain types of heavily levered trading should be established   i do n't buy the idea that if you remove one extremely risky way to make money people will just find another that is true to an extent but at least those people wo n't be doing it on average joe 's dime

it 's so that your total mortgage payment stays the same every month obviously the interest due each month decreases over time as part of the principal is paid off each month and so if the proportion of interest and principal repayments were to stay the same then your first payment would be very large and your last payment would be almost nothing

there are just too many variables here will you legally be considered a permanent resident from the moment you move will you work from home as a contractor or as an employee those are not questions you can answer yourself they really depend on your circumstances and how the tax authorities will look at them i strongly encourage you to speak to an advisor very generally spoken at your place of residence you pay taxes for your worldwide income at the place of your work base which is not clear if this really would be turkey you pay taxes on the income generated there if it 's one and the same country it 's simple if not then theoretically you pay twice however most countries have double taxation treaties to avoid just that this usually works so that the taxes paid abroad in turkey would be deducted from your tax debt at your place of residence   but you might want to read the treaty to be sure how this would be in your specific case all treaties are publicly available and you should really consider speaking to a professional

when you pay cash for a car you do n't always necessarily need to pay cash you just are n't using credit or a loan is all a few options you have are obviously no dealer expects anyone to just have the cash laying around for a car worth a few thousand dollars nor would you bother going to your bank or credit union for the cash you can simply get a cashier 's check made out for the amount note that dealers may not accept personal checks as they may bounce   after negotiations at the dealer you would explain you 're paying cash likely pay a deposit depending on the price of the car but $ 500 would probably be enough again the deposit can be a check or bank deposit and then come back later on with a cashier 's check or deposit into a bank account you would be able to do this later that day or within a few days but since you 've purchased a new car you would probably want to return asap

i agree that best is subjective and will not give investment advice however the tax deductible part can be dealt with quite swiftly if you need tax deductibility right now at the expense of later put it into an rsp account if you do n't need tax deductibility right now put it into a tfsa assuming you have room in either of these vehicles i would suggest using just an rsp or tfsa cash savings account for now at ing direct three reasons you get the immediate benefit of having put it somewhere and in the case of the rsp an immediate tax deductibility you do n't have to worry about rushing into a specific investment and can give yourself time to figure out your goals and portfolio composition read about the couch potato portfolio for a starting point you can transfer your money from them for free and still keep it registered in whichever plan it is in the last point is the most important for my suggestion the ability to quickly park the cash in a registered account and to move it for free using the appropriate form at a later date most places have a sneaky transfer out fee ing may not be the only place that does n't but i have n't looked into many other places about this you might find something else that works the same way and please do n't ever use gic and high return in the same sentence

if all of the money needs to be liquid t bills from a broker are the way to go treasury direct is a little onerous i 'm not sure that you could actually get money out of there in a week if you can sacrifice some liquidity i 'd recommend a mix of treasury cds agency and municipal securities   the government has implicitly guaranteed that too big to fail entities are going to be backed by the faith credit of the united states so investments in general obligation bonds from big states like new york california and florida and cities like new york city will yield you better returns come with significant tax benefits and represent only marginal   additional short term risk

now asking if college is worth it   that 's not the question that should be asked   higher education and extended training are always a benefit at any point in life when it 's of high quality   the question that should be asked is why is the cost of college as high as it is   when i went to college to get my bachelors a semester at my state university cost $ bucks us this was in the early to mid 90s   twenty years later that same education cost $ 6,500 per semester   the main difference between these periods is that borrowing for school is now standard practice much less so in the 90s   any time you need to borrow to pay for something you 're going to overpay just because you have access to credit and can keep borrowing when someone hands you a bill   today kids borrow for college because they do n't have much choice if their parents did n't save enough or stopped supporting them right out of high school   and if you have this level of debt right out of college your hands will be tied for decades it affects things like first home buying and disposable income spending   the only way to drive the cost of college down is to plan ahead and pay with cash and to do that you need to have enough luck to be born to parents who care enough to help with your future   if schools know you ca n't or wo n't borrow to pay for an education they adjust

advantages of buying with every mortgage payment you build equity while with rent once you sign the check the money is gone eventually you will own the house and can live there for free you can or remodel to your own liking rather than being stuck with what the landlord decides is attractive cost effective etc here in the u.s. there are tax breaks for homeowners i 'm not sure if that 's true in u.k. advantages of renting if you decide to move you may be stuck paying out a lease but the financial penalty is small with a house you may find it difficult to sell you may be stuck accepting a big loss or having to pay a mortgage on the empty house while you are also paying for your new place when there are maintenance issues you call the landlord and it 's up to him to fix it you do n't have to come up with the money to pay for repairs you usually have less maintenance work to do with a house you have to mow the lawn clear snow from the driveway etc with a rental usually the landlord does that for you not always depends on type of rental but you can often buy a house for less than it would cost to rent an equivalent property but this can be misleading when you buy you have to pay property taxes and pay for maintenance when you rent these things are included in the rent how expensive a house you can afford to buy is not a question that can be answered objectively banks have formulas that limit how much they will loan you but in my experience that 's always been a rather high upper bound much more than i would actually be comfortable borrowing the biggest issue really is how important is it to you to have a nice house if your life long dream is to have a big luxurious expensive house then maybe it 's worth it to you to pour every spare penny you have into the mortgage other people might prefer to spend less on their house so that they have spare cash for a nice car concert tickets video games cocaine whatever bear in mind that if you get a mortgage that you can just barely afford what do you do if something goes wrong and you ca n't afford it any more what if you lose your job and have to take a lower paying job what if some disaster strikes and you have some other huge expense etc on the flip side the burden of a mortgage usually goes down over time most people find that their incomes go up over time between inflation and growing experience but the amount of a mortgage is fixed or if it varies it varies with interest rates probably bouncing up and down rather than going steadily up like inflation so it 's likely not at all certain but likely that if you can just barely afford the payment now that in 5 or 10 years it wo n't be as big a burden

there are a few major risks to doing something like that first you should never invest money you ca n't afford to lose an emergency fund is money you ca n't afford to lose by definition you may need to have quick access to that money if you determine that you need for example $ 3000 in emergency savings that means that you need to have at least $ 3000 at all times if you lose $ 500 then you now only have $ 2500 in emergency savings imagine what could 've happened if you had invested your emergency savings during the 2008 crash for example you could easily have been in a position where you lost both your job and a good portion of your emergency savings at the same time which is a terrible position to be in if the car breaks down you ca n't really say now 's a bad time wait until the stock market bounces back second with brokerage accounts there may be a delay before you can actually access the money or transfer it to an account that you can actually withdraw cash from or write checks against but some of this depends on the exact arrangement you have with your bank this can be a problem if you 're in a situation where you need immediate access to the money if your furnace breaks in the middle of winter you probably do n't want to wait a few days for the sale and transfer to go through before you can have it fixed third you can be forced to sell the investments at an unfavorable price because you 're not sure when you 're going to need it you 'd also likely incur trading fees and/or early withdrawal penalties when you tried to withdraw the money think about it this way if you buy a bond that matures in 5 years you 're effectively betting that you wo n't have an emergency for the next 5 years if you do you 'll have to either sell the bond or if you 're allowed to get the money back early you 'll likely forfeit a good amount of the interest you earned in the process which kind of kills the point of buying the bond in the first place edit as pointed out in the comments you may also have to pay taxes on the profits if you sell at a favorable price in the u.s. at least capital gains on stuff held for less than a year is taxed at your ordinary income tax rate and stuff held longer than a year is taxed at the long term capital gains tax rate so if you hold the investment for less than a year you 're opening yourself up to the risks of short term stock fluctuations as well as potential tax penalties so if you put your emergency fund in stocks you 're essentially betting that you wo n't have an emergency that year which by definition you ca n't know the purpose of an emergency fund is just that to be an emergency fund its purpose is n't really to make money

the other answers have touched on amortization early payment computation of interest etc which are all very important but i think there 's another way to understand the importance of knowing the p i breakdown the question mentions the loan payment as cash outflow that is true but from an accounting perspective disclaimer i am not an accountant but i know enough of the basics to be dangerous the outflow needs to be directed to different accounts the loan principal appears as a liability on your personal balance sheet which you could use for example in determining net worth the principal amount in your payment should be applied to reduce the liability account the interest payment goes into the expense account   another way to look at it is that the principal while it does reduce your cash account can be thought of as an internal transfer to the liability account thus reducing the size of the liability the interest payment can not aside from this perspective the value of the home is an asset and the difference between the asset account and the loan liability account is the equity in the house as pointed out in different language by the accepted answer of course precisely determining the value of an illiquid asset like a house at any given moment pretty much requires you to actually sell it so those accounts are hard to maintain in real time the liability of the loan is much easier to track

capitalism assumes people are selfish   or it accounts for both sides   capitalism actually does none of the above   capitalism simply says that capital is the means of trade and financial growth   pure capitalism would mean that capital is used for every transaction that can influence trade and growth   that is impossible   capitalism neither adjusts for nor makes rules about whether people are selfish or somewhere in between     capitalism does promote selfishness but is n’t based on selfishness   it is based on capital   to give capitalism any other extraordinary properties is to fail to see it for what it is   i ’ve been hearing people associate capitalism as the cause for tons of modern things   roads medicine even the space program   but capitalism did n’t do any of those   where did this foolishness come from people made roads medicine and the space program   capitalism was the market style they used because it is the prevalent style in america   but it is just a tool a method and not some gift of amazing abilities   it simply makes capital the standard for exchange and financial growth

john bensin 's answer covers the math but i like the plain english examples of the theory from william   bernstein 's fine book the intelligent asset allocator   at the author 's web site you can find the complete chapter 1 and chapter 2 though not chapter 3 which is the one with the multiple coin toss portfolio example i want to highlight i 'll summarize bernstein 's multiple coin toss example here with some excerpts from the book   another top user @joetaxpayer has also written about the coin flip on his blog also mentioning bernstein 's book bernstein begins chapter 1 by describing an offer from a fictitious uncle fred imagine that you work for your rich but eccentric uncle fred he    decides to let you in on the company pension plan you must pick    ahead of time one of two investment choices for the duration of your    employment certificates of deposit with a 3 annualized rate of return or a most peculiar option at the end of each year uncle fred flips a coin heads you receive a 30 investment return for that year tails a    minus 10 loss for the year this will be referred to as    uncle fred ’s coin toss or simply the coin toss in effect choosing option 2 results in a higher expected return than option 1 but it is certainly riskier having a high standard deviation and being especially prone to a series of bad   chapters 1 and 2 continue to expand on the idea of risk and take a look at various assets markets over time   chapter 3 then begins by introducing the multiple coin toss example time passes you have spent several more years in the employ of your    uncle fred and have truly grown to dread the annual coin toss    sessions he makes you another offer at the end of each year    he will divide your pension account into two equal parts and conduct a    separate coin toss for each half there are four possible    outcomes    being handy with numbers you calculate that your annualized return    for this two coin toss sequence is which is nearly a full    percentage point higher than your previous expected return of    with only one coin toss even more amazingly you realize that your    risk has been reduced with the addition of two returns at the    mean of 10 your calculated standard deviation is now only as    opposed to 20 for the single coin toss dividing your portfolio between assets with uncorrelated results increases return while decreasing risk    if the second coin toss were perfectly inversely correlated    with the first and always gave the opposite result hence outcomes    1 and 4 above never occurring then our return would always be 10    in this case we would have a 10 annualized long term return with zero risk i hope that summarizes the example well   of course in the real world one of the tricks to building a good portfolio is finding assets that are n't well correlated and if you 're interested in more on the subject i suggest you check out his books including the four pillars of investing and read more about modern portfolio theory mpt

businesses are free to decide what payment methods they accept for their goods and services businesses sometimes advertise what credit cards they accept by posting some stickers at their door when your credit card is n't among them and you do n't have enough cash with you ask about your card before you order if a business does n't accept your credit card your best recourse is to take your business elsewhere when you already ate there and got into an awkward situation because you assumed that they would accept your card you might also want to write an online review of the place and warn others to bring cash for their visit but please be fair in the review when the food and service are decent a restaurant does n't deserve a one star rating just because they do n't take credit cards note that businesses have good reasons to not accept credit cards it often means additional cost for them in form of but there is also a more shady reason taking payment in cash means that there is no electronic trail of the transaction that makes it far easier for an establishment to their income they might under report it to evade taxes or over report it to launder money both are illegal of course

the best thing to do is to completely pay off one credit card then apply the left over to the highest interest card after that all of your expenses that can be put on a credit card should be put on the one that you just paid off at the end of the month pay off a different credit card and the highest interest and move all your purchasing to that card keep going around the circle until you are able to pay them all off doing this will be good for your credit score as the debt on the cards will now be new   if you 're really desperate to increase your credit score e.g. refinancing a house you can use balance transfers to temporarily make it appear that you have zero debt but it will cost you some money typically balance transfers cost something like $ 35 + 2

your question reminds me of a will rogers quote buy some good stock and hold it till it goes up then sell it if it do n’t go up do n’t buy it there 's no way to prevent yourself from buying a stock that goes down   in fact all stocks go down at some times   the way to protect your long term investment is to diversify which increases the chances that you have more stocks that go up than go down   so many advisors will encourage index funds which have a low cost which eats away at returns and low rick because of diversification   if you want to experiment with your criteria that 's great and i wish you luck but   note that historically very few managed funds meaning funds that actively buy and sell stocks based on some set of criteria outperform the market over long periods   so do n't be afraid of some of your stocks losing if you diversify enough then statistically you should have more winners than losers it 's like playing blackjack   the goal is not to win every hand the goal is to have more winning hands than losing hands

one reason is because car insurance is mandated mandated insurance means the government is forcing people to purchase it which also means that everyone must have the opportunity to purchase it at a reasonable cost even if the insurer would normally not choose to insure them in mandated industries risk pools are formed which means that as a whole lower risk members partially subsidize higher risk members in mandated industries that have a large risk variance the insurance system would break down if everyone was charged their fair share because high risk members would be unable to afford a policy this is even more prominent with health insurance than car insurance because the difference in risk is vastly greater on a positive note perhaps you may get a warm and fuzzy feeling knowing that you are helping out others in need

from what i understand they basically hold on to your money while you stop paying your debt   they keep it in an account and negotiate on your behalf the longer you go without paying the less the debt collector is willing to take and at some point they will settle   so they take the money you 've been putting into their account and pay it down   repeat the process for all your accounts i basically did this without using a service i had $ 17,000 on one card and they bumped the interest rate to 29 and i had lost my job i did n't pay it for 7 months   i just planned on filing bankruptcy   they finally called me up and said if you can pay $ 250 a month until it 's paid off we will drop the interest to 0 and forgive all your late fees i did that and five years later it was paid off similar situation happened on my other cards   it seems once they realize you ca n't pay is when they 're willing to give you a break   it 'd be nice they just never jacked up your rate to 30 though so forget the service just do it yourself   call them up and ask and if they do n't budge do n't pay it of course your credit will be shot   but i 'm back in the so anything is possible over time

due to the issues in the eurozone many foreign investors were buying swiss francs as a hedge against a euro devaluation they were in effect treating the franc like gold silver or some other commodity with perceived intrinsic value this causes huge problems from the swiss as the value of the franc increased and their exports became more expensive for foreigners to purchase things were getting bad enough that the swiss in some places were travelling to germany to buy groceries to enforce this fixing of the franc the swiss central bank announced that they would buy foreign currency in unlimited quantities by printing francs in reality just announcing that they were going to do this was sufficient to discourage foreign investors from loading up on francs npr 's planet money did a really good job covering this topic

based on the additional comment you gave i would recommend that you keep the capital from the businesses separate as much as possible   it sounds like you wo n't get into any trouble legally if you make loans or transfers of capital from one business into the other but i would suggest that you keep detailed records of any transfers that you do make   the reason why is that in any business it is important to know the economics of how your business makes money if you find yourself making transfers repeatedly then your business model may be bad even if your transfers are only to deal with the cost of poor customers it could still mean that your business model needs to be adjusted   but if it 's a question of the timing of cash flows then there 's really nothing wrong with taking some of the money from your successful pants operation and building up more working capital in your shop

aaa bonds are safe as far as the principal goes if you buy long term bonds today at very low rates and the interest rate goes up to 10 in 5 years the current value of the bonds will decrease but if you hold the bonds till maturity you will almost certainly barring mbs scenarios get the expected principal and interest on the bonds if you decide to sell a long term bond before it matures it will probably be worth less than you paid for it if interest rates have risen since you bought it

as in most anti living wage   editorials there is a lot of here   first the workers are not minimum wage in the sense that increasing the minimum wage will not increase their wages   second the article cites that one worker claimed to be making $ 2 and hour less in tips before the law was enacted with wages unchanged that seems like pretty strong evidence that tipping behavior is ultimately independent of the minimum wage   finally the article cites studies that show that workers that rely on tips have higher poverty levels than those that do n't   so while the article appears to be an editorial opposed to increasing minimum wage a more objective look at the evidence presented suggests that the minimum wage should be increased and that is either a bit of an idiot or he recognizes that as a non minimum wage earner he benefits from the inequality of a lower minimum wage

generally by limiting imports you are forcing increased production in your own economy that is not as efficient as just buying it from outside may make sense if it were actual war but as an economic it just makes russia more inefficient germany can just lower production or find new buyers for the long term ttip could move forward a bit faster and germany would n't even notice   this is stupid for russia but putin is just riding on nationalism more than any particular policy at this point

basically you either borrow money or get other people to invest in your business by buying stock or something analogous   sometimes you can get people to park money with you for example many people deposit money in a bank checking account they do n't get any interest or other profit from this they just do it because the bank is a convenient place to store their money the bank then loans some percentage of this money out and keeps the interest i do n't doubt that people have come up with more clever ways to use other people 's money borrowing money for an investment or business venture is risky because if you lose money you may be unable to pay it back on the other hand investors expect a share of the profit not just a fixed interest rate

do n't forget inflation    with a roth 401k or ira you do n't pay any taxes on inflationary or real gains   you pay taxes at the beginning and then no more taxes unless you invest money after you distributed from it    with a regular taxable investment account not a 401k or ira you pay taxes on the initial amount   and then you pay taxes on the gains both inflationary and real   so you effectively pay taxes on the inflated principal twice   once at initial earning and once when it shows up as inflationary gains   i 'll give an example later    with a traditional 401k or ira you pay no taxes on the initial amount   you pay taxes on the distributed amount   that includes taxes on gains but it only taxes them once not twice   all the taxes are paid at distribution time    here 's a example   this is not a real example with real numbers but the numbers should n't be ridiculously off   they could happen   i 'm going to ignore variation and pretend that all the numbers will be the same each year so as to simplify the math    so you pay a 25 marginal tax rate and want to invest $ 12,000 plus any tax savings    roth   $ 12,000 principal traditional ira trad   $ 16,000 principal with $ 4000 in tax savings taxable investment account tia   $ 12,000 principal let 's assume that you make an 8 rate of return and inflation is 3   both numbers are possible although higher and lower numbers have occurred in the past   that gives you returns of $ for the roth and tia cases and a return of $ for the trad case   pay no annual taxes on the roth or trad cases   pay 25 marginal tax on the tia case that 's $ 240    balances after one year    roth   $ trad   $ tia   $ inflation decreases the value of the roth and tia cases by $ 360 in the roth and tia cases   and by $ 480 in the trad case    ten years of inflationary gains cumulative    roth   $ trad   $ tia   $ net buildup including inflationary gains roth   $ trad   $ tia   $ real value minus inflation to maintain spending power    roth   $ trad   $ tia   $ now take out $ 3000 per year after taxes   that 's $ 3000 in the the roth and tia cases as you already paid the taxes   in the trad case that 's $ 4000 because you have to pay 25 tax which will cost $ 1000    do that for five years and the new balances are   roth   $ trad   $ tia   $ the tia will run out in the 8th year   the roth and trad will both run out in the 9th year    so to summarize   the traditional ira initially grows the most   the tia grows the least   the tia is tax advantaged over the traditional ira at that point but it still runs out first   the roth ira grows about the same as the traditional after taxes are included    note that i left out the matching contribution from a 401k   that would help both those options   i assumed that the marginal tax rate would be 25 on the traditional ira distributions   it might be only 15 which would increase the advantage of the traditional ira   i assumed that the 15 rate on capital returns would still be true for the entire period   if that is increased the tia option gets a lot worse    inflation could be higher or lower   as stated earlier the tia account is hit the worst by inflation

something like this sort of thing happened to me but with chase bank   the county made a mistake on our taxes and forgot to give us the right deductions and we got a whopping high property tax bill since we did have an escrow account the bank just paid the taxes and raised our mortgage by a nearly unaffordable 60 or so even though we called the bank and told them not to pay the tax bill as it was being disputed by the time we got the tax issues sorted out chase refused to adjust the mortgage the only way we were able to get out of it was to refinance with another bank and opt out of the escrow account and handle taxes on our own   which fixed the whole problem it seemed an awful lot like an attempt to force us into a foreclosure if we did n't have the money to refinance we would have barely been able to afford the mortgage payment   why they would want to do that i have no idea it really sucked though

is it safe to invest in a portfolio of dividend stocks yielding 7 9 with the money borrowed at 3 4 from one of these brokerages yes and no it depends on your risk profile any investment has its risks of losing your capital but not investing is a guaranteed risk as you will be guaranteed to fall behind the rate of inflation regarding investing on margin this can increase your gains but can also increase your loses regarding the stock market when investing in stocks you should not only look at the dividend rate but also the capital gain or loss potential remember in regards to investing on margin if the share price drop too much you can get a margin call no matter how much dividend you are getting it is no use gaining 9 in dividend yield per year if you are losing 15 or more in capital each year also what is the risk of the dividend rate being cut back or dividends not being paid at all in the future these are some of the risks you should consider before investing and derive a risk management plan as part of your investment plan before you invest no investment is totally safe or risk free but it is less risky than not investing at all as long as you understand the risks involved and have a risk management plan in place as part of your overall investment plan

scenario 1 is typically the better description if commercial banks were allowed to simply create money they would n't be in the mess they 're in now in the u.s. the central bank is the federal reserve or fed and is the only entity not the government not the banks not the people that is allowed to create money out of thin air it does this primarily by buying government debt the government spends more than it takes in and so to come up with the deficit it issues bonds the fed buys a certain amount of these bonds and simply prints the money or more realistically authorized the electronic transfer of $ x to the treasury which the government then spends that places money in the hands of corporations and the people who turn around and spend it however long term the interest charges on money borrowed from the fed will actually remove money from the economy the central banks therefore have to constantly make marginal changes to various monetary policy tools they have when the economy is just along if they do nothing then too much of a short term increase in money supply will result in there being too much money which makes an individual monetary unit worth less inflation while making money too hard to get will reduce the rate at which it 's spent reducing gdp and causing recessions the exact scenario you describe is typically seen in cases where the government is running with a balanced budget and the central bank thus ca n't give its new money to the government to spend when it wants to increase the money supply in that situation the central bank instead lowers its lending rate the percentage interest that it will charge on loans made to other banks thereby encouraging those banks to borrow more of the money created by the central bank those banks will then use the money to make loans invest in the market etc etc which puts the money in the economy   in the u.s. the fed does have this tool as well but increases or decreases in the federal funds rate are typically used to influence the rate that banks charge each other to borrow money thus encouraging or discouraging this lending a lowering in the interest rate makes banks more likely to borrow from each other and from the fed but the amount of money created this way is a drop in the bucket compared to current quantitative easing and thus increases the turnover of the existing money in the economy how many times a theoretical individual dollar is spent in a given time period

there could be a few reasons for this my first guess is that you did n't report the distribution on your return indicated on line 15 of your 1040 below the irs got a copy of the 1099-r and assumes it 's all taxable or maybe the 1099-r indicates the full amount is taxable if a 1099-r does n't have an amount populated for taxable amount it does n't mean the distribution is n't taxable and without any indication that it 's not taxable the irs assumes it is it 's not taxable if it 's a withdrawal of your contribution here 's a from how to calculate the taxable amount of an ira withdrawal withdrawals from a roth ira since roth ira contributions are made on    an after tax basis qualified withdrawals are completely tax free a    qualified roth withdrawal includes the following if your 1099-r indicates a taxable amount then you might need to contact the issuer to understand why if it does not indicate a taxable amount and you failed to record the distribution on your return you just need to file an amended return that shows the distribution on line and shows no taxable amount on 15b along with a completed form 8606   you may not need additional documentation to support of your claim that it 's not taxable but if you do it would be any statement showing that your contributions over the years exceed your withdrawal what a 1040 with a non taxable ira withdrawal would show   note there 'd also be a completed form 8606 the 1040 lines above just show if it was entered in the easiest path forward is probably to file an amended return using turbotax since you filed with them originally i have n't dealt with an irs letter in a few years i ca n't recall if you need to contact them or simply file the amended return but they 're pretty good about including instructions so the letter probably indicates what you need to do do n't delay in taking action as the irs can and will garnish wages if they are owed or think they are owed money   update op contacted irs and they did n't even want an amended return just the completed form 8606 so it 's worth calling the irs first with these letters

there is an element of hiring a new person is expensive to do and involves various commitments with respect to that person space for them to work equipment healthcare etc which can make it more sensible to pay employees overtime instead of hiring extra staff   on the other hand if it really is running like that for years someone 's an idiot

in terms of building the initial investment using some kind of mutual fund i 'd suggest you see my answer to this similar question for buying individual stocks later you could look at sharebuilder or a low cost broker however most of them charge between $ per trade and if you are doing small dollar value trades then that can really really eat into things if you try to trade a lot

no it actually is very real      you pay $ 340 for a single room and are talking about rents     at nebraska 's minimum wage of $ 9/hr or $ 18k year $ 700 for two bedrooms is just barely affordable if you take a standard rule of keeping monthly rent less than of your annual gross salary     it is unaffordable at the federal minimum wage which was the point of the article

if your business is a sole proprietorship and meets the criteria then you would file form schedule c. in this case you can deduct all eligible business expenses regardless of how you pay for them credit debit check cash the fact that it was paid for using a business credit card is n't relevant as long as it is a true business expense the general rules apply yes if you sustain a net loss that will carry over to your personal tax return note even though it is n't necessary to use a business credit card for business expenses it 's still an extremely good idea to do so for a variety of reasons

i think you 're missing simon moore 's point his point is that due to low inflation the returns on almost all asset classes should be less than they have been historically so we should n't rebalance our portfolio or withdraw from the market and hold cash based on the assumption that stocks or any other asset seem to be underperforming relative to historical trends   his last paragraph is written in case someone might misunderstand him he is not advocating to hold cash just that investors should not expect as good returns as has happened historically since those happened in higher inflation environments to explain if the inflation rate historically has been 5 and now it 's 2 and the risk free market return should be about 2 then historically the return on a risk free asset would be 7 and now it should be expected to be 4 so if you have had a portfolio over some time you might be concerned that the rate of return is worsening but simon 's point is that before you sell off your stocks switch investment brokers you should try to figure out if inflation is the cause of the performance loss on the subject   of cash cash always loses value over time from inflation since inflation is a measure of the increase in prices over it 's a part of the definition of what inflation is   that said cash holdings lose value more slowly when inflation is lower so they are relatively less worse than before the future value of cash does n't go up in low inflation you 'd need deflation for that it just decreases at a lower rate that is it becomes less expensive to but there still is a price as an addendum unless a completely new economic paradigm is adopted by world leaders we will always see cash holdings decrease in value over time since modern economics holds that deflation is one of the worst things that can happen to an economy

neither i nor the greater study of economics disputes the emotions of the individual in making their decisions   short term non cooperative decision making is a classic very common example of where people make decisions in the short run that do not benefit them in the long run based on their emotional reaction to the situation at hand that s why we compensate people for the value of their labor and not our interpretation of their needs   i also have disputed the generosity of individuals in making their decisions which you have failed again and again and again to   i have also disputed the use of false morality in state level judgements of what people should do

because google recently decided that they will not provide maps for free to partners who use the data and apple was the largest maps user    cutting the apple created maps app that used google data and forcing google to release their own app basically means google goes from cashing checks from apple to having to create and support an app all on their own dime   also do you want to guess why apple maps w/ google data did n't have features like turn by turn navigation if you guessed google did n't allow apple to have it you guess right    apple had to do it not only to try and reach feature parity but to prevent themselves from having to pay their biggest competitor to use maps data

because the stock still has the same value as the money paid for it you are just exchanging one asset for another of course the stock value starts to change immediately but for the accounting the fictional value is the buying price for the accounting it is similar to changing a 100 $ bill in five 20 $ bills same value still assets

from your profile i see you are in israel the process is probably different from in the us   in the us an agent is usually happy to work with a buyer after all when i list a house there are potential buyers all over my state and elsewhere the best thing you can do is first have your financing in order a bank will be able to tell you how much you can afford and how much they 'll lend you if you approach an agent and tell them the exact range of price area you 're interested in and other specifics such as number of bedrooms etc that agent should be happy to find houses to fit your request   obviously an agent listing million dollar homes busy with those all day is not going to want to handle a buyer looking for a $ 200 k home but in the end the real estate agents are n't all listing high end and someone is moving the smaller houses as well often an office will have a call center where agents who are less busy will answer the phone hoping to get a client that will bring a sale that 's one way to go the other is word of mouth just ask others who you work with or socialize with if they know a good agent in my case i 'd be happy to get such a referral

this will be unpopular but no limiting liability is very important in many industries think of it this way if doctors screw up they face malpractice however if we decide that instead doctors should face jail time who would want to become a doctor but we need doctors so we limit their liability likewise if investors or c level executives are held accountable with jail time instead of fines who would want to invest in businesses
