in this case a futures contract is n't like an options contract it 's simply a method of entering into an agreement for delivery at a future date   while the speculators appear to have taken over there are practical examples of use of the futures market   i am a gold miner and i see that my cost is $ given my quality of ore i see the price of gold at $ 1600 and instead of worrying that if it goes too low i run at a loss i take advantage and sell contracts to match my production for the next year or as long as the contracts go i forget how far out gold futures are   of course i give up the higher price if gold goes higher but this is n't speculation it 's a business decision   the bread maker on the other hand might buy wheat futures to guarantee his prices for the next year

pre enron many companies forced the 401 k match to be in company shares that is no longer allowed becasue of changes in the law therefore most employees have only a small minority of their retirement savings in company shares i know the esop and 401 k are n't the same but in my company every year the number of participants in the company stock purchase program decreases the small number of participants and the small portion of their new retirement funds being in company shares would mean this spike in volume would be very small   the esop plan for my employer takes money each paycheck then purchases the shares once a quarter this delay would allow them to manage the purchases better i know with a previous employer most esop participants only held the shares for the minimum time thus providing a steady steam of shares being sold

tl;dr my understanding of the rules is that if you are required to register for gst earning more than $ 75k per annum you would be required to pay gst on these items to clarify firstly taxable income and goods and services tax are two different things any income you receive needs to be considered for income tax purposes whether or not it ends up being taxable income would be too much to go into here but generally you would take your expenses and any deductions away from your income to arrive at what would generally be the taxable amount an accountant will help you do this income tax is paid by anyone who earns income over the tax free threshold by contrast goods and services tax is a tax paid by business of which you are running one of course this is passed on to the consumer but it 's the business that the payment to the tax office however gst is n't required to be charged and paid in all cases the key in your situation is first determining whether you need to register for gst or whether indeed you already have if you earn less than $ 75,000 per year no need to register if you do earn more than that through your business or you have registered anyway then the next question is whether your items are gst free the ato says that some education courses and course materials are gst free whether this applies to you or not i 'm obviously not going to be able to comment on so i would advise getting an accountant 's advice on this or at the very least call the ato or browse their legal database thirdly are your sales connected with australia the ato says that a sale of something other than goods or property is connected with australia if the thing is done in australia or the seller makes the sale through a business they carry on in australia both of these appear to be true in your case so in summary if you are required to register for gst you would be required to pay gst on these items i am not a financial advisor or a tax accountant and this is not financial advice

right but the point is that some professions such as attorneys can be paid hourly yet still not be eligible for overtime i was responding to the blanket response that all hourly employees who are skilled are eligible for overtime this is not always true    and you are incorrect as to agreeing to being exempt on a contractual basis if a non skilled worker goes to an employer and agreed to work as an exempt dishwasher at $ 7.50 an hour the employer will have trouble with flsa whether or not it was agreed to say otherwise would be counterintuitive to the purpose of the labor protections and would just be an unconscionable loophole to necessary worker protection laws

i expected a word or two on the price elasticity of demand here your question needs slight revision in its current form rising prices actually do not mean increased profitability for a company the quantity they sell also pays a huge part and actually is correlated to the price at which they sell the goods and other factors such as the price at which their competitor sells the goods etc but we will ignore it for simplicity   the net profit of sales for any firm is equal to   qty x sale price cogs taxes other expenses where cogs means cost of goods sold means sales general and admin costs e.g. cleaning the inventory storage area daily so that the goods stay fresh etc other expenses include any miscellaneous other costs that the firm incurs to make the sale now if everything in that equation remains same cogs taxes and other expenditures rising prices will only translate into a higher profit if the quantity does not fall by the same margin prices may also rise simply as a response to risking cogs or other expenditures latter may be observed in inflationary environments in such a case the supplying firm can end up losing its profit margin if the quantity falls by more than the price rise

i was a school board member and district negotiator for the teacher contract   i came off the board in the last couple years   in this case it does n't seem like tenure is the issue   this is a seniority issue   teacher unions like most unions are strict seniority shops   that is basically the only thing that matters   tenured teachers can be let go without cause essentially only for budget reasons   districts schools will identify which grade level for elementary or what program subject the reduction in staffing will occur   the lowest senior person is let go first regardless of skill or past performance   interestingly if a teacher is certified to teach in more than 1 subject area this can also cause chaos   if that same teacher is the one who is reduced from a given department and they have higher seniority than the department where they also have certification they will bump that other teacher thus taking their job   let 's say you have a teacher who is certified in science and math in the high school setting   they are number 90 out of 200 on the seniority list   this teacher may have been teaching science for 10 years but the other teachers in that department are all higher on the seniority list   the lowest senior teacher in the math department is number 100 out of 200   if the district identifies that a reduction of 1 science teacher is necessary that teacher gets to bump the math teacher out of the job thus getting laid off so that they can fill the math slot even though they have n't taught math in over 10 years     while not in all cases often the teachers union negotiators set the stage for these type of layoffs   usually districts have only so many resources to go around   their funding is set for them by the state and any local operating levy needs to be voted into place which can be difficult   also recognize that the teachers at the table in the negotiating session are the more senior teachers in the district since they have been around longer and are much less likely to lose their jobs due to staff reductions   if the teachers union negotiates a raise that is higher than the district can support with the same number of teachers the number of teachers must be reduced   if you think the negotiators are there for all the teachers you are wrong   one of the teachers i negotiated with once said the following we would rather a higher compensation package at the expense of teacher reductions   the system is designed to defend teacher compensation and provide job security as the first priority not to provide the best education for our kids   as with this teacher they are losing a great asset because an outdated and terrible system was being upheld

my first thought was that it must be due to inflation which causes such differences in many cases since a creditor needs to make back more than the rate of inflation in order not to effectively lose money but it seems that currently has only a very modest rate of inflation about 3 other possible reasons for different credit rates the latter is most likely it means that if debtors are generally poor and are often completely unable to pay back the loan or if there is no effective way to force debtors to pay e.g. when there are weak laws or overworked courts then creditors will lose a lot of money to defaults and have to raise rates to compensate for this

the main difference between a bull market and a bear market is due the the leverage effect the leverage effect refers to the observed tendency of an asset ’s    volatility to be negatively correlated with the asset ’s returns    typically rising asset prices are accompanied by declining    volatility and vice versa the term leverage refers to one possible    economic interpretation of this phenomenon developed in black 1976    and 1982 as asset prices decline companies become    mechanically more leveraged since the relative value of their debt    rises relative to that of their equity as a result it is natural to    expect that their stock becomes riskier hence more volatile more volatile assets in a bear market are not such good investments as less volatile assets in a bull market

however is it a risk that they may withhold liquidity in a market panic crash to protect their own capital   two cases exist here one is if you access the direct market then they can not secondly if you are trading in the internal market created by them yes they can do to save their behind but that is open to question they do n't make money on your profit or loss their money comes from you trading so as long as you maintain the required margin in your accounts you can go ahead i had a mail exchange with ig index regarding this and they categorically refuted on this point will their clients be unable to sell at a fair market price in a panic crash no also do cfd providers sometimes make an occasional downward spike to cream off their clients cut loss order   need proof regarding this not saying it can not happen they would n't the people bringing them business without any reason they would be putting their money at risk but you should know their traders are also in the market which might look skimming your money it would be their traders making money in the free market after all google facebook etc also sell your personal data for profit why should n't the cfd firm also since they are market makers what is to prevent them from attempting these tricks are these concerns also valid for forex brokers serving the retail public what you consider as tricks are legitimate use of information to make money

a lot of there e.g. comfortable selection bias etc but regardless this is a bit of a strawman i 'm not at all arguing that success is n't correlated with effort it 's a question of the degree of correlation and the amount of attribution i 'm in a engineering startup myself and i would hardly be motivated in any commercial endeavor if i believed there was n't a correlation between effort and outcome   i would actually grant you that engineering is probably one of the better examples of meritocracy out there today but there 's a lot of caveats to that and many engineers i know in large corporate environments are an underclass to much less technical much less hard working superiors    and from personal experience high level academia breaks down rapidly beyond the undergraduate level

according to the link you provided these inflation numbers are the year over year inflation amounts for a given month   for example the february number of 7 means from february 2015 to february 2016 the annual inflation rate was 7   it 's difficult to nail down the impact of inflation at a micro level from month to month   you need to understand what 's in the basket of goods   as an example the price of a widget wo n't move from $ 1 to $ in one month because of a 4 inflation rate but considering the incremental price changes of a large number of consumer items over a long time period you can get to an inflation rate   the price of an apple might not have changed but maybe the price of aspirin did

the cpa 's mention of $ 2,500 is probably referring to the recently increased de minimis safe harbor under the final tangible property regulations used to be $ 500 without an applicable financial statement the irs will not challenge your choice of expense or capitalization on amounts on or below $ 2500 if you elect the de minimis safe harbor election on your return however you must follow whatever you 're doing for your books so if you are capitalizing your laptops for book purposes you would also need to capitalize for tax purposes section 179 allows you to expense property that you would have otherwise have had to capitalize and depreciate section 179 can be annoying especially if your llc is treated as a passthrough because there are recapture provisions when you dispose of the asset too early for the tax return preparer it makes the return preparation much more simple if there are no fixed assets to account for in the first place which is quite possible if you are expensive all items invoices less than $ 2,500

i 'm a little confused on the use of the property today   is this place going to be a personal residence for you for now and become a rental later after the mortgage is paid off   it does make a difference if you can buy the house and a 100 ltv loan would cost less than 125 of comparable rent then buy the house put as little of your own cash into it as possible and stretch the terms as long as possible   scott w is correct on a number of counts   the cost of the mortgage is the after tax cost of the payments and when that money is put to work in a well managed portfolio it should do better over the long haul   do n't try for big gains because doing so adds to the risk that you 'll end up worse off if you borrow money at an after tax cost of 4 and make 6 after taxes you end up ahead and build wealth a vast majority of the wealthiest people use this arbitrage to continue to build wealth   they have plenty of money to pay off mortgages but choose not to   $ 200,000 at 2 is an extra $ 4000 per year   compounded at a 7 rate it adds up to $ 180k after 20 years not exactly chump change money in an investment account is accessible when you need it   money in home equity is not has a zero rate of return before inflation and is not accessible except through another loan at the bank 's whim   if you lose your job and your home is close to paid off but is n't yet you could have a serious liquidity issue now if a 100 mortgage would cost more than 125 of comparable rent then there should be no deal   you are looking at a crappy investment   it is cheaper and better just to rent   i do n't care if prices are going up right now   prices move around   just because canada has n't seen the value drops like in the us so far does n't mean it ca n't happen in the future   if comparable rents do n't validate the price with a good margin for profit for an investor then prices are and can not be trusted and you should lower your monthly costs by renting rather than buying   that $ 350 per month you could save in rent adds up just as much as the $ 4000 per year in arbitrage for rentals you should only pull the trigger when you can do the purchase without leverage and still get a 10 cap rate or higher rate of return after taxes insurance and other fixed costs   that way if the rental rates drop and again that is quite possible you would lose some of your profit but not all of it   if you leverage the property there is a high probability that you could wind up losing money as rents fall and you have to cover the mortgage out of nonexistent cash flow i know somebody is going to say but john 10 cap on rental real estate   that 's just not possible around here   that may be the case   it is possible somewhere   i have clients buying property in arizona new mexico alberta michigan and even california who are finding 10 cap rate properties   they do exist   they just are n't everywhere if you want to add leverage to the rental picture to improve the return then do so understanding the risks   he who lives by the leverage sword dies by the leverage sword   down here in the us the real estate market is littered with of people who thought they could handle that leverage sword   it is a gory ugly mess

this is a simple solution because you do n't have to monitor a person 's trades over time or even their frequency implementing this in the modern computer exchanges seems trivial to me asking an exchange to monitor each trader 's trades to ensure no hfts seems full of loopholes ask a computer to execute hfts across multiple trader ids for example and i think is a distraction suggestion   the reason that i think these taxes do n't get is as correctly states these taxes empower the government which is something that a lot of political players republicans libertarians and anarchists do n't want i have always wondered what would happen if these fees were imposed by the government implemented by the exchanges but all money went to say the american red cross i think that that would be a pretty good idea   finally i also want to mention that the government plays a large role in markets already for example enforcing contracts managing and preventing fraud are all things that the government does to ensure that markets work well this is another simple thing the the government can do to reduce market uncertainty and make our financial markets work better

great so we agree it 's not a fraud and the title of the bloomberg article is grossly misleading   even still to call it a bubble you 'd need to first agree to what the non bubble valuation of bitcoin would be the consensus among those who use the word tulip frequently when talking about bitcoin is that the non bubble valuation of bitcoin is zero 0   this of course means that bitcoin has been in a bubble ever since the first exchange of good was made with it which tells us was a purchase of 2 pizzas for 10,000 bitcoins establishing a price of under $ 0.01 per bitcoin ever since for the past 7 years bitcoin has been in a bubble    furthermore for as long as bitcoin 's market value remains at or above $ 0.01 per bitcoin it will still be in a bubble if me and a few hundred thousand of my closest friends have anything to say about it that will never happen and therefore bitcoin will remain in a bubble indefinitely   now that to me seems like a very unusual bubble if that strikes you as a stretch of the concept too then maybe we need to revisit an assumption or two here   for one is the non bubble valuation of bitcoin really zero is there perhaps something about bitcoin that might give it some intrinsic value that say tulips or babies may not have and if there is is there a way to estimate what that value may be does that value change over time is it perhaps possible that the value of bitcoin correlates in some fashion with its reach and its network effect    those are harder questions to answer and their answers is certainly not as neat and precise as zero or bubble but maybe it 's useful to think about them when trying to reason about what bitcoin is and is n't

with 1 it 's rather confusing as to where interest refers to what you 're paying and where it refers to what you 're being paid and it 's confusing what you expect the numbers to work out to be if you have to pay normal interest on top of sharing the interest you receive then you 're losing money if the lending bank is receiving less interest than the going market rate then they 're losing money if the bank you 've deposited the money with is paying more than the going market rate they 're losing money i do n't see how you imagine a scenario where someone is n't losing money for 2 and 3 you 're buying stocks on margin which certainly is something that happens but you 'll have to get an account that is specifically for margin trading it 's a specific type of credit with specific rules and you if you want to engage in this sort of trading you should go through established channels rather than trying to convert a regular loan into margin trading if you get a personal loan that is n't specifically for margin trading and buy stocks with the money and the stocks tank you can be in serious trouble if you do it through margin trading it 's still very risky but not nearly as risky as trying to game the system in some cases doing this makes you not only but criminally liable the lending bank absolutely can lose if your stocks tank since then there will be nothing backing up the loan

you 're missing the concept of systemic risk which is the risk of the entire market or an entire asset class diversification is about achieving a balance between risk and return that 's appropriate for you your investment in vanguard 's fund although diversified between many public companies is still restricted to one asset class in one country yes you lower your risk by investing in all of these companies but you do n't erase it entirely   clearly there is still risk despite your diversification you may decide that you want other investments or a different asset allocation that reduce the overall risk of your portfolio over the long run you may earn a high level of return but never forget that there is still risk involved bonds seem pretty worthless at least until i retire according to your profile you 're about my age our cohort will probably begin retiring sometime around 2050 or later and no one knows what the bond market will look like over the next 40 years we may have forecasts for the next few years but not for almost four decades writing off an entire asset class for almost four decades does n't seem like a good idea also bonds are like equity and all other asset classes in that there are different levels of risk within the asset class too when calculating the overall risk return profile of my portfolio i certainly do n't consider treasuries as the same risk level as corporate bonds or high yield or junk bonds from abroad   depending on your risk preferences you may find that an asset allocation that includes us and/or international bonds fixed income international equities real estate and cash to make rebalancing your asset allocation easier reduces your risk to levels you 're willing to tolerate while still allowing you to achieve returns during periods where one asset class e.g. equities is losing value or performing below your expectations

this is n't the movies killing someone 's family to pressure them into doing something for you is one thing but that tactic does n't work when you 're trying to get someone to give you something they do n't have let 's say they kill his daughter or brother or parents what then how is he going to magically raise $ 3 m go to a bank ask a friend tell the police btw i find it interesting that his partner in that company was a police chief it 's not like he had the money but was just hiding it either he simply had no way of paying and they knew it they probably worked with him for a while to get paid back and he could n't get it done maybe even tried gambling as the last option some other loan shark sure as hell is n't going to give you a loan to cover the loan you already ca n't pay back they basically got fed up and decided to punish him by taking his life   keep in mind him being killed bc of debt is purely my suspicion it could 've just been some random murder is n't the safest of places

from a stats perspective a sample of 100 should be more than enough to grab a normalized distribution while the tail end less than 1 percent might not have granularity the article is supposed to capture the experience of the majority of candidates which a sample of 100 should do fine that said knowing plenty of some   love it some do n't the article probably has bias in the people who chose to respond but the sample size is fine

this is a partial answer   coverdell esa must be withdrawn when the beneficiary turns 30 the 529 has no such age restriction a decent comparison is at coverdell education savings accounts a wiki entry at the bogleheads site   to add another point the coverdell limit is $ 2000 per year deposit the 529 is subject only to the rules of gift taxation so a couple can deposit up to $ 140 k this year taking advantage of the ability to gift ahead and while paperwork is due to declare the gift no tax is assessed

gt the article is dead on that cable is grossly overpriced   cable is n't grossly overpriced if it were more people would be canceling their subscriptions and/or the cable fiber dish networks would be offering discounted à la carte plans to steal subscribers   i would pay what i pay now to get what i watch now that 's true of most people or they 'd stop subscribing   à la carte is n't popular with the cable companies not because they 'd have to charge less but because it would artificially limit their window into your living room obviously they can technically provide you with hundreds of channels since they do today take amc for example which has gone from a third or fourth tier channel to at worst a second tier channel on the strength of mad men breaking bad etc how much would the audience of those shows have been limited and thus your cable company 's ability to sell ads been limited if people had to call up to add $ to their bill rather than just flip the channel when they heard about a cool new show   even in a purely on demand world how do you build a show 's brand offer the first four episodes for free then start charging that 's a big cliff to fall off   i can assure you that when we are living in an on demand world you 'll be paying at least what you 're paying now my guess is that around the time apple gets into the tv business your cable plan will become a smart tv plan with a unified data video cost just like your smartphone plan then the cable companies wo n't care so much where you 're getting your content whether it 's traditional channels or streaming

to me this is a tax structure that is working as it should the tax code is providing strong incentives for starbucks to expand during the initial breakthrough period they are incurring significant expenses these huge costs are being offset somewhat by the provisions in the tax code the government in this case has provided a system by which starbucks is encouraged to grow their volume of future taxable revenue    simple    edit   after further review of the article it 's not quite as simple as i made it out to be in my above comment i think the point is still valid however

valuation by definition is what an item is worth not what you paid for it net worth should be market value for fixed assets or capital goods i would consider this cars real property furniture jewelry appliances tools etc   everything else can be valued by liquidation value you can use valuation guides for tax deductions as a way to guide your valuation insurance companies usually just pick a percentage of your home 's value as a for content value i could see doing this as a way to guide purchase decisions for appliances cars or the like but if you are trying to figure out the market value of your socks and underwear i would argue that you 're doing something that 's a little silly

this is such a common question here and elsewhere that i will attempt    to write the world 's most answer to this question hopefully    in the future when someone on asks how to split up    the ownership of their new company you can simply point to this    answer the most important principle fairness and the perception of    fairness is much more valuable than owning a large stake almost    everything that can go wrong in a startup will go wrong and one of    the biggest things that can go wrong is huge angry shouting matches    between the founders as to who worked harder who owns more whose    idea was it anyway etc that is why i would always rather split a new    company 50 50 with a friend than insist on owning 60 because it was    my idea or because i was more experienced or anything else why    because if i split the company 60 40 the company is going to fail    when we argue ourselves to death and if you just say to heck with    it we can never figure out what the correct split is so let 's just    be and go 50 50 you 'll stay friends and the company will    survive thus i present you with joel 's totally fair method to divide up the    ownership of any startup for simplicity sake i 'm going to start by assuming that you are not    going to raise venture capital and you are not going to have outside    investors later i 'll explain how to deal with venture capital but    for now assume no investors also for simplicity sake let 's temporarily assume that the founders    all quit their jobs and start working on the new company full time at    the same time later i 'll explain how to deal with founders who do    not start at the same time here 's the principle as your company grows you tend to add people in    layers the top layer is the first founder or founders there may be 1 2 3    or more of you but you all start working about the same time and you    all take the same risk quitting your jobs to go work for a new and    unproven company the second layer is the first real employees by the time you hire    this layer you 've got cash coming in from somewhere investors or    customers doesn't matter these people did n't take as much risk    because they got a salary from day one and honestly they did n't    start the company they joined it as a job the third layer are later employees by the time they joined the    company it was going pretty well for many companies each layer will be approximately one year long    by the time your company is big enough to sell to google or go public    or whatever you probably have about 6 layers the founders and    roughly five layers of employees each successive layer is larger    there might be two founders five early employees in layer 2 25    employees in layer 3 and 200 employees in layer 4 the later layers    took less risk ok now here 's how you use that information the founders should end up with about 50 of the company total each of the next five layers should end up with about 10 of the    company split equally among everyone in the layer example two founders start the company they each take 2500 shares there are    5000 shares outstanding so each founder owns half they hire four employees in year one these four employees each take    250 shares there are 6000 shares outstanding they hire another 20 employees in year two each one takes 50 shares    they get fewer shares because they took less risk and they get 50    shares because we 're giving each layer 1000 shares to divide up by the time the company has six layers you have given out 10,000    shares each founder ends up owning 25 each employee layer owns 10    collectively the earliest employees who took the most risk own the    most shares make sense you do n't have to follow this exact formula but the basic    idea is that you set up stripes of seniority where the top stripe    took the most risk and the bottom stripe took the least and each    stripe shares an equal number of shares which magically gives    employees more shares for joining early a slightly different way to use the stripes is for seniority your top    stripe is the founders below that you reserve a whole stripe for the    fancy ceo that you recruited who insisted on owning 10 the stripe    below that is for the early employees and also the top managers etc    however you organize the stripes it should be simple and clear and    easy to understand and not prone to arguments now that we have a fair system set out there is one important    principle you must have vesting preferably 4 or 5 years nobody    earns their shares until they 've stayed with the company for a year a    good vesting schedule is 25 in the first year 2 each additional    month otherwise your co founder is going to quit after three weeks    and show up 7 years later claiming he owns 25 of the company it    never makes sense to give anyone equity without vesting this is an    extremely common mistake and it 's terrible when it happens you have    these companies where 3 cofounders have been working day and night for    five years and then you discover there 's some jerk that quit after    two weeks and he still thinks he owns 25 of the company for his two    weeks of work now let me clear up some little things that often complicate the    picture what happens if you raise an investment the investment can come from anywhere an angel a vc or someone 's dad basically the    answer is simple the investment just dilutes everyone using the example from above we 're two founders we gave ourselves    2500 shares each so we each own 50 and now we go to a vc and he    offers to give us a million dollars in exchange for 1/3rd of the    company 1/3rd of the company is 2500 shares so you make another 2500 shares    and give them to the vc he owns 1/3rd and you each own 1/3rd that 's    all there is to it what happens if not all the early employees need to take a salary a lot of times you have one founder who has a little bit of money    saved up so she decides to go without a salary for a while while the    other founder who needs the money takes a salary it is tempting    just to give the founder who went without pay more shares to make up    for it the trouble is that you can never figure out the right amount    of shares to give this is just going to cause conflicts do n't    resolve these problems with shares instead just keep a ledger of how    much you paid each of the founders and if someone goes without    salary give them an iou later when you have money you 'll pay them    back in cash in a few years when the money comes rolling in or even    after the first vc investment you can pay back each founder so that    each founder has taken exactly the same amount of salary from the    company should n't i get more equity because it was my idea no ideas are pretty much worthless it is not worth the arguments it would cause to    pay someone in equity for an idea if one of you had the idea but you    both quit your jobs and started working at the same time you should    both get the same amount of equity working on the company is what    causes value not thinking up some crazy invention in the shower what if one of the founders does n't work full time on the company then they 're not a founder in my book nobody who is not working full    time counts as a founder anyone who holds on to their day job gets a    salary or ious but not equity if they hang onto that day job until    the vc puts in funding and then comes to work for the company full    time they did n't take nearly as much risk and they deserve to receive    equity along with the first layer of employees what if someone contributes equipment or other valuable goods patents domain names etc to the company great pay for that in    cash or ious not shares figure out the right price for that computer    they brought with them or their clever word processing patent and    give them an iou to be paid off when you 're doing well trying to buy    things with equity at this early stage just creates inequality    arguments and unfairness how much should the investors own vs. the founders and employees that depends on market conditions realistically if the investors end    up owning more than 50 the founders are going to feel like    and lose motivation so good investors do n't get greedy    that way if the company can bootstrap without investors the founders    and employees might end up owning 100 of the company interestingly    enough the pressure is pretty strong to keep things balanced between    investors and founders employees an old rule of thumb was that at ipo    time when you had hired all the employees and raised as much money as    you were going to raise the investors would have 50 and the    founders employees would have 50 but with hot internet companies in    2011 investors may end up owning a lot less than 50 conclusion there is no one size fits all solution to this problem but anything    you can do to make it simple transparent straightforward and    above all fair will make your company much more likely to be    successful the above awesome answer came from the stack exchange beta site for startups which has now closed i expect that this equity distribution question which is strongly tied to personal finance will come up more times in the future so i have copied the content originally posted   all credit for this excellent answer is due to joel a for the startups se beta site and co founder of stack exchange

is this legal   if the purpose of the sale at that price is to defraud somebody else you could have a legal issue for example if the purpose was to make yourself appear poorer to make you eligible for government aid or to increase your chances of getting a college grant or to not have to pay money to your spouse as part of a divorce settlement or if there is an part of the transaction for the sibling to sell the house back to in a few years when you no longer need to appear poor   the answer by @littleadv covers the tax complications   i do have one additional point the sale ca n't be a short sale the bank will never approve the short sale can only be approved when the bank is convinced that there are no viable purchasers at a level to get all their money back your sibling is not an arms length transaction

you will lose out on your spread you always pay a spread also if you are looking at a strategy for using stop losses try taking into account the support lines if you are going long so if the stock is on an upward trend but is dropping back from profit taking your best best is to take a position closest to the next support line you place your stop just below the support this will give you the best chance of a winning position as most technical analysts will have looking towards the support as a buy back area obviously in a bear market the opposite is true   if you have taken your position and the market move past the first resistance line then bring your stop to just below that line as once resistance is broken it then becomes support you then have a profitable position with profit locked in leave the position to break the next resistance and repeat

unless you have the storage and transportation facilities for it or can come up with the money needed to rent or build those no or not in any significant quantity   buying oil futures is essentially an on paper version of the same bet futures prices are already taking into account both expectations about price changes and the fact that there 's cash tied up until they come due but storage costs also adjust to follow those expectations

i 'm curious so i 'm going to calculate it for my area i 'm in an average priced metro and a 2 bedroom apartment out here is going to cost you at least $ 1400 700 each with a and that 's if you go minutes from downtown it does n't really drop off any more than that the further you go out you 'll also still need renters insurance and to cover half the utilities lets tack on another $ 75 here conservatively at that far out you need a car and the insurance gas and maintenance costs that go with it assuming you go with something cheap say $ 5k with a payment around $ 120 a month + $ 60 a month for insurance another $ 60 for gas and accruing $ 30 a month for maintenance you 're going to need a cell phone and if you 're on a plan alone it 's not cheap with the big 4 providers so you 'll go with someone smaller for $ 50 a month even though the service is mediocre you 'll need to eat so being cheap and buying store brands and sale items you get your groceries down to $ 120 a month so that should cover the bottom level of 's pyramid which is far from glamorous that puts your living costs at $ a month being that it is a major metro minimum wage within the city is $ assuming you have a job that 's 40 hours a week that puts you at $ a month before taxes are withheld since you make so little taxes would only be around $ a month that leaves $ 49 for saving spending emergencies i live in a state that has very good support for the aca as well so the $ 300 credit roughly covers the cost of the monthly premium the deductible is obviously still impossible to pay but you do n't get hit with the penalty at year end and the hospital still gets mostly paid and you might just be able to avoid bankruptcy if the hospital is willing to negotiate the payment plan with you   so what are the conclusions here it 's possible to skate by for a short while assuming you can live without any social life stay healthy and have no emergencies   you also need the self discipline of a monk and to live in an area that supports a minimum wage relative to living costs and the aca

not at all whenever demand growth outstrips supply growth prices rise driving innovation discovery and allowing more of the population if not the entire population to sustain itself and eventually thrive the very process which has held off the problem for centuries from that perspective the headline is a bit hyperbolic because the answer is simple even if not necessarily easy adapt odds are egypt will start seeking new trade deals with other countries in an effort to bolster growth in available necessities this will drive food producers to become more efficient and more productive which will have benefits for years to come assuming there are any there 's a good chance we 'll see tariffs start declining as a result at first egypt will probably seek bilateral free trade deals and if those prove insufficient they 'll probably just cut drop tariffs on their own

i do n't know anything about australian tax law the australian real estate market or your parents ability to repay the loan however no matter what the answers to those questions are i do not recommend that you go through with this   the reason is the risk usually with an investment you are risking the money that you invest however with this investment you are not only risking the money you are also risking both you and your fiancé 's relationship with your parents   if your parents have trouble paying back this money in a few years when you need it for your house how will that affect how you feel about your parents how will that affect how your fiancé feels about them it will make family gatherings very awkward for everyone at least do n't put family harmony at risk for the sake of an extra 2.8 return there are other ways to invest that risk only money

from the other point of view company use it makes sense to segregate expenses incurred on the company 's behalf away from an employee 's personal expenses   this way if there were any requirement to prove that certain expenses were for the company 's benefit it is not intermingled with an employee 's personal expenses    from an ethical point of view   to avoid these types of confusing and conflicting issues most employer 's prefer to have a segregated expense process especially if an employee is regularly incurring expenses on the company 's behalf   as mentions you should check with your employer about their expense policy

going into a business with the potential to grow is the high risk high reward option if it pans out you could do but there 's a very real chance you 'll work like a dog for years and have nothing to show for it at the end other than debt even if the business is successful if you are n't careful with the structure you might not benefit   do all the research you can so you can understand the risks and opportunities as much as possible then you can evaluate whether it 's worth it   welding is something you can always go back to if the business does n't pan out if you go with the business plan have some criteria for success or failure do n't end up caught in the sunk costs fallacy if the business is n't going to provide a better life than working pull the plug early

are all bonds priced in such a way so that they all return the same amount on average after accounting for risk in other words do risk premiums only compensate for the amount investors might lose no ge might be able to issue a bond with lower yield than say a company from china with no previous records of its presence in the u.s. markets a bond price not only contains the risk of default but also encompasses the of the bond by the issuer with a specific stream of income location of main business any specific terms and conditions in the prospectus or not insurances against default etc else for the same payoff why would you take a higher risk the payoff of a higher risk not only default but term structure e.g. 5 years or 10 years coupon payments bond is more to compensate for the extra risk it entails for the bondholder the yield of a high risk bond will always be higher than a bond with lower risk if you travel back in time to 2011 2012 you would see the yields on greek bonds were in the range of 25 30 to reflect the high risk of a greek default some hedge funds made a killing by buying greek bonds during the eurozone crisis if you go through the efficient frontier theory your argument is a counter statement to it same with individual bonds or a portfolio of bonds you always want to be compensated for the risk you take the higher the risk the higher the compensation and vice versa when investors buy the bond at this price they are essentially buying a risk free bond logically yes but no it is n't and you should n't make that assumption

regarding auto insurance you have to look at the different parts in the united most states do require a level of specific coverage for all drivers that is to make sure that if you are at fault there is money available to pay the victims that payment may be for damage to their car or other property but it also covers medical costs many policies also cover you if the other driver does n't have insurance the policy that covers the loss of the vehicle is required if you have a loan or are leasing the car somebody else owns it while there is a loan so they can and do require you to pay to protect the vehicle   if there i no loan you do n't have to have that portion of a policy other parts such as towing assistance and rental cars replacement may be required by the insurance standards for your state or might be almost impossible to drop because all insurance companies include it to stay competitive with their competition   dropping the non required parts of the coverage is acceptable when you do n't have a loan some people do drop it to save money but that does mean you are self insuring if you can afford to self insure a new car great the interesting thing is that some people have more than enough assets to self the non required part of auto insurance but then they realize that they do need to up their umbrella liability insurance this is to protect them from somebody deciding that their resources make them a tempting target when they are involved in a collision

we aim to keep 6 months of expenses the rationale is that its enough time to recover from most serious illnesses that you can recover from or a redundancy or pay for a large unexpected problem not covered by the insurance e.g. the boiler dying it also gives us enough time to finances if needed for example we could get out of contracts like mobile phones sky tv sell the car and maybe even find a cheaper house if needed in that time it will take a good chunk of time to build up that amount and it 's worth considering how many commitments you have kids wife mortgage car as the fewer you have the less you need if you have fewer commitments you can be comfortable with much less contingency when i lived in rented and did n't run a car or have many possessions i just maintained enough cash to cover my bills for about 6 weeks this would give me enough time to find another job and if i did n't get one i could always crash round a friend 's house

the real answer why the government is allowed to do something is because they are the government and they make the rules there are lots of laws that i think make no sense i ran into a similar situation to yours i bought a house during a time when the market in my area was way down the previous owner had paid $ 140,000 but i got it for only $ 80,000 the government appraised it for i forget the exact number but over $ 100,000 i appealed and the argument i made to the appeal board was that the law says it is supposed to be appraised for fair market value the definition of fair market value is the amount that a willing buyer would pay to a willing seller absent special conditions like a sweetheart sale to a relative the house had been advertised for a higher price and the seller had to drop the price several times before getting an offer and finally accepting mine this is pretty much the definition of fair market value the appeals board replied that it was not fmv because the market was bad at this particular time and so i got a good deal i said that that 's the definition of market value it goes up and down as market conditions change if the market happened to be up when someone bought a house and they had to pay a high price would the government assess the house at a lower value because that was an unusually high price i doubt it they ended up reducing the assessed value but not to what i actually paid all that said arguably a foreclosure sale might be considered special conditions prices at a foreclosure sale tend to be lower than ordinary sales in a foreclosure the bank is usually trying to get rid of the property quickly because they do n't want to be in the property management business they want to be in the money lending and management business of course you could say that sort of thing about conditions surrounding many sales maybe the price is low because the seller needed cash now to start a business maybe the price is high because the buyer was too lazy to shop around maybe the price is low because the buyer is a very skilled negotiator etc etc   my watch just broke and while i was shopping for a new one i found two listings for the exact same watch i mean exact same manufacturer and model number identical picture on the same web site one giving the price as $ 24 and the other as $ 99 what is the market value of that watch i presume anyone who saw both listings would pick the $ 24 one but i presume some number of people pay the higher price because they never see the lower price in real life there is n't really one exact fair market value that 's an abstraction

i debated whether to put this in an answer or a comment because i 'm not sure that this can be answered without a lot more information which actually would then probably make it a candidate for closing as too localized at the very least we would need to know where which jurisdiction she is located in so speaking in a generic way the options available as i see them are contact the mortgage companies and explain she ca n't continue to make payments they will likely foreclose on the properties and if she still ends up owing money after that if you are in the us this also depends on whether you are in a non recourse state then she could be declared bankrupt this is rather the nuclear option and definitely not something to be undertaken lightly but would at least wipe the slate clean and give her some degree of certainty about her situation look very carefully at the portfolio of properties and get some proper valuations done on them depending on where she is located this may be free also do a careful analysis of the property sales and rental markets to see whether property prices rental rates are going up or down then decide on an individual basis whether each property is better kept or sold you may be able to get discounts on fees if you sell multiple properties in one transaction this option would require some cold hard analysis and decision making without letting yourselves get emotionally invested in the situation difficult i know depending on how long she has had the properties for and how she came to own them it might be an option to pursue action against whoever advised her to acquire them clearly a large portfolio of decaying rental properties is not a suitable investment for a relatively elderly lady and if she only came by them relatively recently on advice from an investment consultant or similar you might have some there   another option could she live in one of the properties herself to reduce costs if she owns her own home as well then she could sell that live in the one of the rentals and use the money saved to finance the sale of the other rentals aside from these thoughts one final piece of advice do n't get your own finances tangled up in hers so do n't take out a mortgage against your own property for example obviously if you have the leeway to help her out of your budget then that is great but i would restrict that to doing things like paying for grocery shopping or whatever if she is heading for bankruptcy or other financial difficulties it wo n't help if you are too

situation 1 i keep playing and eventually earn 1000 i withdraw    this will i get taxed if so by how much this is probably considered an award so whatever your country taxes for lottery gambling winnings would be applicable if there 's no specific taxation on this kinds of income then it is ordinary income situation 2 i deposit $ 5000 play the game lose some money and    withdraw equal to $ 4000 will i get taxed if so by how much since it is a game it is unlikely that deducting losses from your income would be allowed   however the $ 4000 would probably not be taxed as income since you are getting your own money back situation 3 i deposit $ 5000 and use this to buy in game items i    later sell these items for massive profits this can happen    over the course of 2 years for sure i withdraw $ 10000 will i get    taxed if so by how much either the same as 1 i.e. ordinary income or as capital gains although tax authority may argue that this was not a for profit investment and capital gains treatment should n't be applicable will i get taxed on withdrawals from real cash economy games and do    the taxes apply to the full withdrawal or only on the profits or    only on the profits above a certain amount generally income taxes only apply on income so if you paid $ 10000 and got back $ 12000 only the $ 2000 is considered income however some countries may tax full amounts under certain conditions such taxes are called franchise taxes for a proper tax advice consult with the locally licensed tax adviser

government purchases of mortgages simply transfers the debt burden from households to the sovereign taxes pay sovereign debt 65 of whom are homeowners anyway no debt has been restructured it 's now paid via taxes instead of monthly mortgage payments and those paying include persons who responsibly avoided housing speculation the u.s. has a debt to gdp ratio just shy of the critical point of 90 purchasing $ 10 trillion in mortgage debt about a year of gdp would put the u.s. on an path towards insolvency and inflation there are all sorts of other risks loss of a risk free asset moral hazard nationalization of the housing industry etc but this should make the point clear that it 's not a good idea there are only three ways to reduce debt 1 default 2 restructure or 3 lower the real debt burden by de valuing currency in which the debt is denominated

residents pay tax on all of the income they receive during the calendar year from all sources so you 'll at least need to file and pay new york state income taxes on this money regardless i ca n't answer whether you 'll need to file and pay colorado state income tax on this money as well generally speaking you need to file a return for each state in which you live receive income or have business interests if you are required to file a colorado state income tax return however you can claim a credit for taxes paid to another state on your new york state income tax return using form see the form and instructions

well the author could be right but not necessarily for the reasons cited     several states including california and nevada recently changed their laws to slow down the foreclosure process and protect borrowers   it took lenders awhile to figure out how to work within the new legal structure so foreclosure starts fell during that time   now they 've got it figured out so filings went up   it does n't mean the sky is falling   if the economy keeps improving that will temper potential defaults due to well unemployment and heloc expirations causing higher mortgage payments     there 's not a lot of available inventory right now investors have been converting short sale and foreclosed properties to rentals so there is some up demand   if credit availability is increased by the fico score reducing the hit for and defaults on medical expenses more people will be eligible to buy a house and that will reduce foreclosure rates     there 's a lot of moving parts here and this story only focused on a small section so take it with a grain of salt   and remember   if the author could really predict the future he would n't be making a living as a writer for the new republic   edit for clarity

in how much trouble can i get exactly if the irs finds out i    understand that there 's a 6 year statute of limitations on criminal    charges and no limitation at all on fraud is this considered fraud    i 'm assuming not there 's no statute of limitations for fraud which is a criminal charge the statute of limitations is for failure to report income which is not fraud in your case since you willingly decided to not report it knowingly that you should it can most definitely account for fraud so i would n't count on statute of limitations in this case i should amend my taxes for those years that would be the easiest way to go would the irs go all the way and file criminal charges considering the amount of money i owe they have the legal right to and if you do get caught likely they will easy money for them since you obviously have income and can pay all the fines and penalties practically speaking what 's the worst case scenario theoretically can be jail as well being charged in a criminal court even if the eventual punishment is just a penalty is a punishment of its own you 'll have troubles finding jobs passing security checks getting loans approved etc for $ 3200 when you 're in 25 bracket as an individual for years i 'd say not worth it

i 'm fairly convinced there is no difference whatsoever between dividend payment and capital appreciation   it only makes financial sense for the stock price to be decreased by the dividend payment so over the course of any specified time interval without the dividend the stock price would have been that much higher were the dividends not paid   total return is equal i think this is like so many things in finance that seem different but actually are n't if a stock does not pay a dividend you can synthetically create a dividend by periodically selling shares    doing this would incur periodic trade commissions however   that does seem like a loss to the investor   for this reason i do see some real benefit to a dividend   i 'd rather get a check in the mail than i would have to pay a trade commission which would offset a percentage of the dividend does anybody know if there are other hidden fees associated with dividend payments that might offset the trade commissions   one thought i had was fees to the company to establish and maintain a dividend payment program   are there significant administrative fees banking fees etc to the company that materially decrease its value   even if this were the case i do n't know how i 'd detect or measure it because there 's such a loose association between many corporate financials e.g. cash on hand and stock price

would the net effect really be worse though   if everyone stopped paying back loans and banks stopped lending people would have to live within their means   prices would fall and nobody would be in debt slavery for the rest of their lives   as for allocating capital to new businesses there would still be the option of a kickstarter like model plus both private and public equity and the rules could be changed so there could be more than 500 investors without being forced public   a lot of options currently on the table would disappear sure but on balance would it actually be worse   as both government and wall street say it 's bad that seems to automatically suggest the opposite   there has been a push to make it a crime to walk away from a mortgage even though banks get the house back   the fact that they desperately tried to paint it as morally wrong to walk away from a mortgage is a big red flag   in any case this is all going to be in the near future because of automation   there wo n't be a need to borrow when your material needs are automatically met and there wo n't be much of a point to promising your labor when machines are doing the jobs already   the transition to a post scarcity economy over the next 20 years is going to be interesting

california is very aggressive about enforcing llc franchise taxes   the only correction i 'd make to 's answer is that the fee is $ 800 minimum or some percentage of the llc 's total business volume in the state   what 's killer about it is that the tax is dependent not on what your llc 's profit is but what its revenues are   here 's a good link explaining how the tax is calculated california llc franchise tax rates be very careful about making sure you comply with every dot in the california codes or else you really wo n't like what happens   it 's one of the reasons so many companies avoid locating operations in california if at all possible i hope this helps good luck

reading stuff like this makes me want to go into the debt collection business just send letters to random people demanding money sounds like an easy way to make a living what 's your name and address just kidding if they are sending stuff to a virginia po box close the box with no forwarding address and consider it case closed if they are you personally in new hampshire the best thing to do is to sue proactively before it goes to collection new hampshire has strict anti debt collection laws basically what you do is go to small claims court and fill out a one page form sue them for $ 2000 $ 3000 or whatever is convenient do not hire a lawyer you can do this in 2 hours of your own time your grounds are 1 violation of the creditor of nh laws according to the laws the creditor has to put all kinds of specific stuff in their threat letters since they are not doing this they have violated nh read the so you know which specific items they are violating 2 extortion since you do not owe them any money demanding money from you is extortion which is both criminally and actionable you sue them for mental anguish due to extortion   the validity of your claims is irrelevant you just need to get them in court there are two possibilities a they fail to show up in this case you win and they owe you $ 3000 or whatever not only that if they later try to collect from you send a copy of the judgement to the credit bureau or collector or whatever and that is proof you owe them no money b they hire some local lawyer who appears accept the court 's offer for arbitration when you go into arbitration with the lawyer tell him you will drop the lawsuit if they send you a check for $ 500 and a hand written guarantee from him that you will never hear from his client again either way you come out ahead by the way it is absolutely guaranteed that the enemy lawyer will accept your offer in b above because the seo company is already paying him $ 5000 to show up to answer your lawsuit and the lawyer does not want to hang around all morning in court waiting for the case to be heard if he can get out of there in half an hour for only $ 500 he will do it if all you are getting is calls and the caller refuses to identify then it is definitely an illegal scam it is illegal in new hampshire to make collection calls and refuse to full identify who is calling the phone company has methods for dealing with illegal calls first you have to file a police report then you call verizon security at 1 800 or whatever your phone company is they will trace the call and identify the caller they you can make a criminal complaint in their jurisdiction unless the call is from pakistan or something

first is population density you did n't say where exactly but for example here in tampa wells fargo has 25 branches in the area   though that is a bit larger then what i would think of the tampa area as a local second we can mix in service expectation i expect that in addition to good online service great phone service great email service that when i have a problem do n't understand something or want to talk about my options for investing or choosing account types that i am able to go into a branch that i can walk in and see someone quickly or schedule an appointment and see some one right away at my appointment time   together these two options means that on a busy day the nearest wells fargo branch to me has at any one time 50 60 people in it smaller branches of course have less and larger branches exist so it just takes that many branches to address the number of people and their expected needs   as to why there are so many different brands banks well that 's just the usa we believe in capitalism we have believed in it much stronger in the past but banks are the central to capitalism so why should n't they serve as an example   at it 's core a very simplistic look capitalism and a free market means that we as customers are better served by having lots of different brands fighting for our business it should drive more consumer desired features   like lower prices higher interest rates better fee schedules etc while forcing those brands to operate better just ignore the bail out that 's a loaded topic so for some of us we want a big bank like wells fargo because we want the rates structure and service they can provide as a big bank for others they want the more personal touch of a small bank there are benefits both ways   for example there may be a bank that only allows people with excellent credit to open accounts that allows they to have lower over all mortgage rates but means their checking accounts have higher minimums while the next bank may be more inclusive and have smaller minimum balances but as a result charge more for loans   we like our options and rest assured all those brands offer products that have differences that attract customers

stock values are generally reflective of a company 's overall potential and to some extent investor confidence in the prospect of a continued growth of that potential sales over such a short period of time such as a single weekend do not noticeably impact a stock 's valuation   a stock 's value has more to do with whether or not they meet market expectations for sales over a certain period of time generally 1 quarter of a year than it does that they actually had sales or profits on any given day of course catastrophic events major announcements or new product releases do sometimes cause significant changes in a stock 's value   for this reason you will often see stocks have significant volatility in periods around earnings announcements merger rumors or when anything unexpected happens in the world that might benefit or hurt their potential sales and growth but overall a normal average weekend of sales is already built into the price of a stock during normal trading

it is measured in us dollars   the us can not just print the money because that would cause inflation   remember that money is really just a convenient placeholder for the barter system   creating more money regardless of whether there is more value in the economy work resources etc is a very bad idea and doing so has collapsed the economies of many countries debt increasing means that the us owes other countries more money   so yes they are receiving more money from other countries but the us has to pay it all back with interest eventually the us government spends more money than it receives in taxes   to decrease the debt spending needs to decrease and/or taxes need to increase many countries lend to the us   one of the biggest is china   these countries do so because of interest the us pays back more money than it gets lent so the lending countries make a profit if china suddenly called in all its debt to the us this would severely damage the world economy   china 's biggest trading partner is the us so it has no interest in harming the us this way it would harm itself   additionally the us would probably refuse to pay it not to mention that it ca n't and then china would lose all the money it invested in the us   it would benefit no one

basically you have 4 options use your cash to pay off the student loans put your cash in an interest bearing savings account invest your cash for example in the stock market spend your cash on fun stuff you want right now the more you can avoid 4 the better it will be for you in the long term but you 're apparently wise enough that that was n't included as an option in your question to decide between 1 2 and 3 the key questions are   what interest are you paying on the loan versus what return could you get on savings or investment   how much risk are you willing to take how much cash do you need to keep on hand for unexpected expenses what are the tax implications basically if you are paying 2 interest on a loan and you can get 3 interest on a savings account then it makes sense to put the cash in a savings account rather than pay off the loan you 'll make more on the interest from the savings account than you 'll pay on interest on the loan if the best return you can get on a savings account is less than 2 then you are better off to pay off the loan however you probably want to keep some cash reserve in case your car breaks down or you have a sudden large medical bill etc how much cash you keep depends on your lifestyle and how much risk you are comfortable with i do n't know what country you live in at least here in the u.s. a savings account is extremely safe even the bank goes bankrupt your money should be insured you can probably get a much better return on your money by investing in the stock market but then your returns are not guaranteed you may even lose money personally i do n't have a savings account i put all my savings into fairly safe stocks because savings accounts around here tend to pay about 1 which is hardly worth even bothering you also should consider tax implications if you 're a new grad maybe your income is low enough that your tax rates are low and this is a minor factor but if you are in say a 25 marginal tax bracket then the effective interest rate on the student loan would be more like 1.5 that is if you pay $ 20 in interest the government will then take 25 of that off your taxes so it 's the equivalent of paying $ 15 in interest similarly a place to put your money that gives non taxable interest like municipal bonds gives a better real rate of return than something with the same nominal rate but where the interest is taxable

i assume you 're talking about a sell order not a buy order when you place a limit sell order your order is guaranteed to be placed at that price or higher   if the market is currently trading much higher than the price of your sell order then your mistakenly low limit order will be essentially a market order and will be filled at   the current bid price so the only way this is a problem is if you want to place a limit sell that is much higher than the current market but mistakenly place a limit lower than the current market

one major concern with moving out on your own is can you afford rent each month be it an apartment or a house payment you 'll hear people say that anywhere from 25 to 40 of your monthly after tax income should go to housing 40 seems very high to me and quite risky i 'd go for closer to 30 of your monthly after tax income and not any higher but that 's just my opinion   i had a friend that moved out of his parents house about the same time that i did he bought himself a house and then he immediately started looking for roommates to help pay for his house it really was a good idea and i wish that i 'd been in a position to do the same because i 'm sure that it saved him a lot of money for the first couple of years apart from that my only advise would be to get a house if you can afford it 1 interest rates are very low right now and 2 if you 're paying rent to someone for an apartment or whatever then you 're just throwing your hard earned money away good luck

it would be worth looking at their details as they will outline clearly what the 2 is on having said that the 2 will probably be on the value of the portfolio at the time the charge is calculated it might be that they do n't levy this on the cash section of portfolio it might be that they do they will usually make you sign a direct debit form so that they can take the fees straight from you there are much better deals around than this 2 is a huge fee if you had an portfolio that is worth £ 100,000 after some years the fees they would be charging you would be £ 2,000 a year it 's worth shopping around for a better deal as it can prove costly to change isa provider at later date

probably the easiest way for individual investors is oil etfs   in particular uso seems to be fairly liquid and available   you should check carefully the bid ask spreads in this volatile time   there are other oil etfs and leveraged and inverse oil etfs exist as well but one should heed the warnings about leveraged etfs oil futures are another possibility though they can be more complicated and tough to access for an individual investor   note that futures have a drift associated with them as well   be careful close or roll any positions before delivery of course unless you have a need for a bunch of actual barrels of oil finally you can consider investing in commodities etfs or energy stocks or stock etfs that are strongly related to the price of oil   as keshlam mentions care is advised in all these methods   many people thought oil reached its bottom a few weeks back then opec decided to do nothing and the price dropped even further

this can be best explained with an example bob thinks the price of a stock that alice has is going to go down by the end of the week so he borrows a share at $ 25 from alice the current price of the shares are $ 25 per share bob immediately sells the shares to charlie for $ 25 it is fair it is the current market price a week goes by and the price does fall to $ 20 bob buys a share from david at $ 20 this is fair it is the current market value then bob gives the share back to alice to settle what he borrowed from her one share now in reality there is interest charged be alice on the borrowed value but to keep it simple we 'll say she was a friend and it was a zero interest loan so then bob was able to sell something he did n't own for $ 25 and return it spending $ 20 to buy it settling his loan and making $ 5 in the transaction it is the selling to charlie and buying from david or even charlie later if he decided to dump the shares without having invested any of your own money that earns the profit

yeah i was a libertarian until they said they want to end the federal reserve i 'm more of a conservative    your point that a minimum wage at a major metropolitan area is often not a livable wage is irrelevant wages are a   fee given to employees for their work the way an employee earns a high wage is by providing value that is greater than that wage if the value an employee brings to an employer is less than the wage he 's paid an employer will lay off that individual because the employee costs the employer money therefore setting a minimum wage simply means you ban certain individuals usually first time workers or otherwise unskilled from the workforce because they currently do not have the skills and/or experience to justify that wage furthermore the higher you set the minimum wage the more people you deprive of jobs

yes i have done this and did not feel a change in cash flow but i did n't do it a the age of 23   i did it at a time when it was comfortable to do so   i should have done it sooner and i strongly encourage you to do so    another consideration   is your companies program a good one   if it is not among the best at providing good funds with low fees then you should consider only putting 6 into your employer account to get the match   above that dollar amount start your own roth ira at the brokerage of your choice and invest the rest there   the fee difference can be considerable amounting to theoretically much higher returns over a long time period if you choose to do the max you would not want to max out before the end of the year   calculate your deferral very carefully to make sure you at least put in 6 deferral on every paycheck to the end of the year   otherwise you may miss out on your company match   it is wise to consider a roth but it is extremely tough to know if it will be good for you or not   it all depends on what kind of taxes payroll vat etc you pay now and what you will pay in the future   on the other hand the potential for tax free capital accumulation is very nice so it seems you should trend toward roth

some adrs have standardized options that trade on us exchanges   if your stock adr is one of those then you find the put option through most brokerages that deal with stock options and trade the option like you would on a regular stock   if your adr does not have standardized options then your options will depend on where the adr trades   if it 's otc you might not even be able to short it   if it trades on a major exchange the shorting the adr may be a viable choice

the previous answers make valid points regarding the risks and why you ca n't reasonably compare trading for profit loss to a roll of the die this answer looks at the math instead your assumption i have an equal probability to make a profit or a loss is incorrect for the reasons stated in other answers however the answer to your question can i also assume that probabilistically speaking a trader can not do worst than random is yes but only because the question is flawed consequently it 's throwing people in all directions with their answers but quite simply in a truly random environment the worst case scenario no matter how improbable is that you lose over and over again until you have nothing left this can happen in sequential rolls of the dice and in trading securities bonds whatever you could guess wrong for every roll of the die and all of your stock picks could become worthless both outcomes result in $ 0 assuming you do not gamble with credit tell me which $ 0 is worse given the infinite number of plays that random implies the chance of losing your entire bankroll exists in both scenarios and that is enough by itself to make neither option worse than the other of course the opposite is also true you could only pick winners with an unlimited upside potential but again that could happen with either dice rolls or stock picks it 's just highly improbable my chances can not be worse than random and if my trading system has an edge that is greater than the percentage of the transaction that is transaction cost then i am probabilistically likely to make a profit nope this is where it all falls apart just because your chances of losing it all are similarly improbable does not make you more likely to win with one method or the other regression to the mean when given infinite truly random outcomes makes it impossible to have an edge also probabilistically is n't a word but probably is

as dheer pointed out the top ten mega cap corporations account for a huge part 20 of your s&p 500 portfolio when weighted proportionally this is one of the reasons why i have personally avoided the index fund etf craze i do n't really need another mechanism to buy ibm and wal mart on my behalf i like the equal weight concept if i 'm investing in a broad sector large cap companies i want diversification across the entire sector and avoid concentration the downside to this approach is that there will be more portfolio turnover and expense since you 're holding more shares of the lower tranches of the index where companies are more apt to churn ie 500 on the index gets replaced by an up and so you 're likely to have a higher expense ratio which matters to many folks

you ca nt there is the risk that between the time you get the check and the time you get to the bank that you will be murdered have a heart attack stroke or too   and they are probably more likely than the bank going out of business between the time you deposit the money and get access to it prior to accepting the check i would do the following get a lawyer that specializes in finance and tax law   there are some steps you can take to minimize your tax exposure   there is little you can do about the immediate tax on the winnings but there are things you can do to maximize the return of your money     you will want to do what you can to protect that money for yourself and your family   also create or revise your will   this is a lot of money and if something happens to you people from your family and friends will come out of the woodwork trying to claim your money   make sure your money goes where you want it to in the event something happens to you get a financial planner   this money can either make you or break you   if you plan for success you will succeed   if you trust yourself to make good decisions with out a plan in a few years you will be broke and wondering what happened to your money even at 1 at dollars that is 200k a year in interest a pretty good income by itself   you do not have to save every penny but you can plan for a nice lifestyle that will last if you plan and stick to your plan do research and know what bank you are going to deposit the money in   talk to the bank let them know of your plans so they can be ready for it   it is not every day that they get a 20 million dollar deposit   they will need to make plans to handle it   if you are going to spread the money out among several banks they can prepare for that too when choosing that bank i would look for one where their holdings are significantly more than you are depositing   i would not really go with one of the banks that was rescued   they have already shown that they can not handle large sums of money and assuming they will not screw it up with my money is not something i would be comfortable with   there were some nice sized banks that did not need a bail out   i would choose one of them

while you want it to grow faster than inflation there are things like i bonds that can carry some inflation protection with them for an idea that may make sense for part of this there are now some more details and i 'd think this seems alright initially though i would suggest considering having some kind of on going plan to handle periodically seeing how much more to invest here and what kind of taxes will this generate for you as taxable accounts can carry a mix of dividends interest and capital gains that you may have to pay even though you did n't see the gain yourself keep in mind that if you do go with a big name investment bank this could well add more fees as well as other stuff   lehman brothers was a big name investment bank once upon a time and they went broke   while you may want to be hands off i 'd still suggest having some kind of timeline for how often are your investments to be reviewed and things re allocated   each quarter semi annually or annual   there is n't so much a right or wrong answer here as much as i 'd point out that one should be aware of the trade offs in each case   if you take annual and wonder each week how it is doing then something a bit more frequent may make sense   on the other hand some people may well set it and forget it which can work as long as there is something to know about where to go if something does go broke   as these are managed investments the sipc check i 'd make may not hold though this would be the equivalent of fdic for deposits when dealing with securities the reit can be useful for diversification sure   you do realize that there may be some interesting taxes for you in the next few years given the nature of a reit investment right   the return of capital that a reit may pass through as a reit to maintain its tax status must distribute 90 of its net income each year that can be quite a off shoot of funds   where would those proceeds be invested   this is n't mentioned in your post and thus i 'm curious as if the reit passes out a dividend yield of say 5 then this is $ that could go somewhere

stocks represent ownership in a company their price can go up or down depending on how much profit the company makes or is expected to make   stocks owners are sometimes paid money by the company if the company has extra cash   these payments are called dividends bonds represent a debt that a company owes   when you buy a bond then the company owes that debt to you   typically the company will pay a small amount of money on a regular basis to the bond owner then a large lump some at some point in the future assuming the company does not file bankrupcy and you keep the bond until it becomes worthless then you know exactly how much money you will get from buying a bond because bonds have a fixed payout assuming no bankrupcy they tend to have lower average returns   on the other hand while stocks have a higher average return some stocks never return any money in the usa stocks and bonds can be purchased through a brokerage account examples are etrade tradeking or    before purchasing stocks or bonds you should probably learn a great deal more about other investment concepts such as diversification volatility interest rates inflation risk capital gains taxes in the usa ira 's 401k 's the mortgage interest deduction   at the very least you will need to decide if you want to buy stocks inside an ira or in a regular brokerage account you will also probably want to buy a low expense ration etf e.g. an index fund etf unless you feel confident in some other choice

there is n't really a generic options strategy that gives you higher returns with lower risk than an equivalent non options strategy there are lots of options strategies that give you about the same returns with the same risk but most of the time they are a lot more work and less tax efficient than the non options strategy when i say generic i mean there may be strategies that rely on special situations analysis of market inefficiencies or fundamentals on particular securities that you could take advantage of but you 'd have to be extremely expert and spend a lot of time a generic strategy would be a thing like write such and such sort of spreads without reference to the particular security or situation as far as strategies that give you about the same risk return for example you can use options collars to create about the same effect as a balanced fund gateway fund does this balanced does stuff like it i think but you could also just use a balanced fund you can use covered calls to make income on your stocks but you of course lose some of the stock upside you can use protective puts to protect downside but they cost so much money that on average you lose money or make very little you can invest cash plus a call option which is equivalent to stock plus a protective put i.e on average again you do n't make much money options do n't offer any free lunches not found elsewhere occasionally they are useful for tax reasons for example to avoid selling something but avoid risk or for technical reasons for example a stock is n't available to short but you can do something with options

futures are an agreement to buy or sell something in the future   the futures price is the price at which you agree to make the trade   this price does not indicate what will happen in the future so much as it indicates the cost of buying the item today and holding it until the future date   hence for very liquid products such as stock index futures the futures price is a very simple function of today 's stock index value and current short term interest rates   if the stock exchange is closed but the futures exchange is open then using the futures price and interest rates one can back out an implied fair value for the index which is in essence the market 's estimate of what the stock index value would be right now if the stock market were open   of course as soon as the stock exchange opens the futures price trades to within a narrow band of the actual index value where the size of the band depends on transaction costs bid ask spread commissions etc

dividends are paid based on who owns the security on a designated day   if a particular security pays once per year you hold days and sell on the day before the critical day you get no dividend   this is not special to 401(k or to drip   it 's just how the system works the critical day is the day before the posted ex dividend date for the security if you own at the end of that day you get the dividend   if you sell on that day or before you do not your company changing providers is not in itself relevant   the important factor is whether you can still hold your same investments in the new plan   if not you will not get the dividend on anything that you currently hold but sell due to the change in providers   if you can then you potentially get the dividend so long as there 's no glitch in the transition incidentally it works the other way too   you might end up getting a dividend through the new plan for something that you did not hold the full year

starting and running a business in the us is actually a lot less complicated than most people think you mention incorporation but a corporation or even an s corp is n't generally the best entity to start a business with most likely you are going to want to form an llc instead this will provide you with liability protection while minimizing your paperwork and taxes the cost for maintaining an llc is relatively cheap $ a year depending on your state and you can file the paperwork to form it yourself or pay an attorney to do it for you generally i would avoid the snake oil salesman that pitch specific out of state llcs nevada delaware etc unless you have a specific reason or intend on doing business in the state   with the llc or a corporation you need to make sure you maintain separate finances if you use the llc funds to pay personal expenses you run the risk of loosing the liability protection afforded by the llc piercing the corporate veil with a single member llc you can file as a pass through entity and your llc income would pass through to your federal return and taxes are n't any more complicated than putting your business income on your personal return like you do now if you have employees things get more complex and it is really easiest to use a payroll service to process state and federal tax with holding   once your business picks up you will want to file quarterly tax payments in order to avoid an under payment penalty   generally most taxpayers will avoid the under payment penalty if they owe less than $ 1,000 in tax after subtracting their withholdings and credits or if they paid at least 90 of the tax for the current year or 100 of the tax shown on the return for the prior year whichever is smaller even if you get hit by the penalty it is only 10 of the amount of tax you did n't pay in time if you are selling a service such writing one off projects you should be able to avoid having to collect and remit sales tax but this is going to be very state specific if you are selling software you will have to deal with sales tax assuming your state has a sales tax one more thing to look at is some cities require a business license in order to operate a business within city limits so it would also be a good idea to check with your city to find out if you need a business license

the value will certainly fluctuate up and down but on average gain more than a savings account but so long as you have enough liquid assets for emergencies then yes it 's a perfectly good alternative to savings accounts how risky in general are index income funds how are you defining risk if you mean probability that i 'll lose it all then it 's virtually zero   if you mean how much the value can fluctuate then it 's certainly not risk free but it has less volatility that individual stocks   if you take the s&p 500 as a proxy you might expect the change in value over any given year to fluctuate between -30 like 2008 and + 40 with an average change of around 8 there will be funds that have less volatility but produce less return and funds that have more volatility but higher average returns

i also have approx £ 6000 in debt just a note you 're guaranteed to get a return on whatever debt you pay off quickly   even if your debt is only 2 you get a guaranteed return of 2 which is higher than most of the savings here in the us not sure about the uk you mention saving for a house which is also a good idea but with debt i 'd recommend eliminating that if you 're paying any interest at all   this wo n't be popular to write but markets are high right now so even though you may feel that you 're missing out the return on paying off debt is guaranteed markets are n't

the best ask is the lowest ask and the best bid is the highest bid   if the ask was lower than the bid then they crossed and that would be a crossed market and quickly resolved so the bid will almost always be cheaper than the ask a heuristic is that a bid is the revenue of the stock at any given time while the ask is the cost so the market will only ever offer a profit to itself not to the liquidity seeker if examining the book vertically all orders are usually sorted descending since the best ask is the lowest ask it is on the bottom of the asks and vice versa for the best bid the best bid best ask will be those closest since that 's the spread and price time priority will promise that a bid that crosses the asks will hit the lowest ask the best possible price for the bidder and vice versa for an ask that crosses the best bid

first of all there are some differences between the retirement accounts that you mentioned regarding taxes   traditional ira and 401(k accounts allow you to make pre tax contributions giving you an immediate tax deduction when you contribute   roth ira roth 401(k are funded with after tax money and a non retirement account is of course also funded with after tax money   so if you are looking for the immediate tax deduction this is a point in favor of the retirement accounts roth ira roth 401(k accounts allow the investment to grow tax free which means that the growth is not taxed even when taking the investment out at retirement   with traditional ira and 401(k accounts you need to pay tax on the gains realized in the account when you withdraw the money just as you do with a non retirement account   this is a point in favor of the roth retirement accounts to answer your question about capital gains yes it is true that you do not have a capital gain until an investment is sold   so discounting the contribution tax deductions of the retirement accounts if you only bought individual stocks that never paid a dividend and never sold them until retirement you are correct that it really would n't matter if you had it in a regular brokerage account or in a traditional ira   however even people dedicated to buy and hold rarely actually buy only individual stocks and hold them for 30 years there are several different circumstances that will generally happen in the time between now and when you want to withdraw the money in retirement that would be taxable events if you are not in a retirement account if you sell an investment and buy a different one the gains would be taxable if you want to rebalance your holdings this also involves selling a portion of your investments   for example if you want to maintain an 80 bond ratio and your stock values have gone up to 90 you might want to sell some stock and buy bonds   or if you are getting closer to retirement you might decide to go with a higher percentage of bonds   this would trigger capital gains inside a mutual fund anytime the management sells investments inside the fund and realizes capital gains these gains are passed on to the investors and are taxable   this happens more often with managed funds than index funds but still happens occasionally with index funds dividends earned by the investments are taxable   any of these events in a non retirement account would trigger taxes that need to be paid immediately even if you do n't withdraw a cent from your account

to answer your first two questions according to irs pub contributions to an hsa section rollovers a rollover contribution is not included in your income is not    deductible and does not reduce your contribution limit archer msas and other hsas    you can roll over amounts from archer    msas and other hsas into an hsa you do not have to be an eligible    individual to make a rollover contribution from your existing hsa to a    new hsa rollover contributions do not need to be in cash rollovers    are not subject to the annual contribution limits    you must roll    over the amount within 60 days after the date of receipt you can make    only one rollover contribution to an hsa during a 1-year period note if you instruct the trustee of your hsa to transfer funds directly to    the trustee of another hsa the transfer is not considered a rollover    there is no limit on the number of these transfers do not include the    amount transferred in income deduct it as a contribution or include    it as a distribution on form 8889 line mine so if you transfer the money yourself you can only do it once per year but there are no limits to when or how many times you can instruct the old hsa trustee to transfer funds directly to the new trustee

the interest in your account is usually calculated based on the average monthly balance what the bank will do is try to figure out how much money did you have on average over the month and give you interest on that amount for example if you had 10k on deposit and took it out half way through the month you will still receive interest on about 5k based on a monthly rate what i would do is read in detail your agreement with the bank to figure out if your interest is based on an average annual balance and is paid at the end of the year or if it is based on a different measurement also i would be very careful if this is a cd account since they will have early withdrawal fees hope this helps

gt could you discuss why the lack of restrictions on these subjects would make hedge funds more attractive to wealthy investors as opposed to mutual funds   well just think about it this way    you have two soccer players they both know the game extremely well they both have similar styles of plan and similar strategies they 're very good players    now you change the rules for one of the players he has to wear a 20 pound weight vest on him at all times and can only kick the ball with his right foot when shooting but his left when passing    who do you think would win in a one v. one     mutual funds are offered to the general public most of them anyways which works under certain assumptions about possible investors while investments with these funds are still considered risky the restrictions placed on mutual funds are designed to promote safety of principle for instance mutual funds are restricted in short selling and trading on margin mutual funds must also clearly state what securities they 're going to get into what strategy they 'll follow etc and deviations from this can get them into trouble   hedge funds have no such restrictions therefore they can pursue any type of investment they want hedge funds have invested or tried to invest in everything from stocks to private equity to bitcoin to art to rare to property to contracts to get boats to and from the statue of liberty to water rights to lawsuit settlements to    this relative freedom gives them much more flexibility and thus they can earn above average returns these lack of restrictions also makes them much riskier and additionally the way they 're legally set up means only a specific type of investor called an accredited investor in the u.s. can invest    what does it take to be an accredited investor basically either be rich in income $ 200k a year if single $ 300k if married or be rich in wealth net worth of $ 1mm not counting primary house

do you guys think it 's a good idea to put that much down on the car in my opinion it depends on a lot of factors   if you have nothing to pay and are not planning to invest in something that cost a lot soon i.e an house etc then i see no problem in put that much down on the car remember that the more you pay at first the less you will pay interest on however if you are planning on buying something big soon then you might want to pay less and keep moneys for your future investment i would honestly not finance a car with the garage as i find their interest rate to high possibilities depends a lot of your bank accounts but what i would personally do is pay it cash using my credit margin with the bank which is only 2.8 interest rate garage where i live rarely finance under 7 interest rate you may not have a credit margin but maybe you could get a loan with the bank instead many bank keep an history of your loan which will get you a better credit name when trying to buy an home later on the other side having a good credit name is not really useful in a garage what interest rate is reasonable based on my credit score i do n't think it is possible to give a real answer to this as it change a lot around the world however i would recommend to simply compare with the interest rate asked when being loan by the bank

i do n't believe most do it on purpose its a function of two things   1 markets are relatively efficient so generating profits off of publicly available information is rare   2 analysts can not ethically nor legally make   recommendation based on material non public information   that leaves them with using public information and building out s model to estimate earnings and therefore share price as best as possible the problem is that estimating earnings is notoriously difficult every model is subject to garbage in garbage out all analysts start with some of the same basic assumptions and then tweak them based on their best guess take enough analysts and you 've now replicated roughly what all investors are doing in the marketplace meaning as a whole analysts wo n't be more accurate than the market   the only way to generate above market returns is for you to consistently pick the analyst with the right recommendation if only it were so easy   furthermore analysts tend to make similar recommendations due to biases their initial model may have said buy for ge but they realize no other analysts have a buy rating on the stock they 're more likely to go back and revise their guesses to something more inline with their peers its less risky to be with the crowd   tl;dr   security selection is hard and outperformance without is unlikely over the long term   i am no longer in the industry after as an analyst and going through the cfa curriculum i 've learned that there are very few opportunities for out performance especially so on a risk adjusted basis

your entire post is incorrect from your understanding of the processes to random sampling to what models represent to facts in and of themselves    it 's crazy to me how much ignorance and misunderstanding is the baseline for these conversations it 's almost as if being ignorant and disregarding facts as my above post is as political propaganda is a badge of honor among so many every time it 's hey look at all these facts well researched figures and data that gets someone to this conclusion and the response is always along the lines of fake news with your head in the air as if being anti intellectual is something to be proud of    we 're off topic now but the descent into the literal definition of idiocy and ignorance has become baffling but about the above education point i guess

when purchasing a condo in a university town it is almost guaranteed that the prices will be inflated as a result   this is because you are competing not only with single home primary residence homeowners but also with a multitude of investment buyers and landlords who want to purchase a rental property   universities are popular rental markets due to their stability there will always be students looking for a place to live and as a result the areas attract investors more than other markets this can work in your favor however   if you do n't mind sharing your residence with other students and you do n't mind the part time work that being a landlord requires you can live much cheaper and even make money over the next few years as your roommates pay your bills   owning a primary residence rental property also brings a lot of tax benefits because you can claim expenses and depreciation against your income   this could benefit your father who could be a co owner and would certainly benefit from the write offs against his higher tax bracket the real trick that makes or breaks the experience is finding mature responsible roommates who will cause the minimum amount of headache   if this part of the equation is missing it can lead to distractions from school and even legal worries when you have to think about things like unpaid rent and/or

the interest rate will probably be better for your primary residency however the risk is higher too in the event you ca n't pay it off you probably would rather lose the second home and not the primary home re the tax benefit it will be attached to the rental you 're buying since that 's what the loan is for however if you have a heloc on your primary residency you can deduct interest on up to $ 100 k on your schedule a regardless of what you 're doing with the money this can be useful if the rental is losing money and you do n't want to accumulate the interest deduction as passive loss

the answer is to your question is somewhat complicated you will be unable to compete with the firms traditionally associated with high frequency trading in any of their strategies most of these strategies which involve marketing making latency arbitrage and rebate collection the amount of engineering required to build the infrastructure required to run this at scale makes it something which can only be undertaken by a team of highly skilled engineers indeed the advantage of firms competing in this space such as tradeworx and comes from this infrastructure as most of the strategies that are developed are necessarily simple due to the latency requirements now if you expand the definition of hft to include all computerized automated trading you most certainly can build strategies that are profitable it is not something that you probably want to tackle on your own but i know of a couple of people that did go it alone successfully for a couple of years before joining an established firm to run a book for them in order to be successful you will most likely need to develop a unique strategies the good news is because that you are trying to deploy a very tiny amount of capital you can engage in trades that larger firms would not because the strategies can not hold enough capital relative to the firms capital base   i am the co founder of a small trading firm that successfully trades the us equities and equity derivatives markets a couple of things to note is that if you want to do this you should consider building a real business having some more smart brains around you will help you do n't need exchange for all strategies many firms including ours in a data center that simply has proximity to the exchanges data centers you will need to keep things simple to be effective   do n't except all the group think that this is impossible it is possible although as a single individual it will be more difficult it will require long long hours as you climb the algorithmic trading learning curve good luck

the other issue you could run into is that each deferred account is going to be subject to its own rmd 's required minimum distributions when you 've retired or hit 70.5 years of age   roth 's do n't generally care about rmd 's at first but are still subject to them once the person that created the roth has passed   having fewer accounts will simplify the rmd stuff but that 's really only a factor in terms of being forced to sell something in each account in order to make the rmd    other than that it 's just a matter of remembering to check each account if you come to a decision that it 's time to liquidate holdings in a given security lest you sell some but forget about the rest of it in another account   and perhaps as chris pointed out maybe having to pay fee 's on each account for the sale   where this really can come into play is if you choose to load up each individual account with a given kind of investment instead of spreading them across the accounts   in that case rmd 's could force you into selling something that is currently down when you want to hold onto it because that is your only choice in order to meet rmd 's for account x.   so if you have multiple accounts it 's a good idea to not particular vehicles into a single account but spread similar across multiple accounts so you always have the choice in each account of what to sell in order to meet an rmd if you have fewer accounts it 's thus a lot easier to avoid the effect

yes many hedge funds for example did not survive 2008 2009   but hedge funds were failing both before and after that period and other hedge funds thrived   those types of funds are particularly risky because they depend so much on leverage i.e. on money that is n't actually theirs more publically visible funds like those of the big name index fund companies tended not to close because they are not leveraged   you say that a great many companies failed during the recession but that 's not actually true   i ca n't think of more than a handful of publically traded companies that went bankrupt   so since the vast majority of publically traded companies stayed in business their stocks kept some most of their value and the funds that owned those stocks stayed afloat i personally did not see a single index fund that went out of business due to the recession

you can hold a wide variety of investments in your tfsa account including stocks such as but if the stocks are being purchased via a company stock purchase plan they are typically deposited in a regular margin account with a brokerage firm a few companies may issue physical stock certificates but that is very rare these days that account would not be a tfsa but you can perform what 's called an in kind transfer to move them into a tfsa that you open with either the same brokerage firm or a different one there will be a fee for the transfer check with the brokerage that currently holds the stock to find out how costly that will be assuming the stock gained in value while you held it outside the tfsa this transfer will result in capital gains tax that you 'll have to pay when you file your taxes for the year in which the transfer occurs the tax would be calculated by taking the value at time of transfer minus the purchase price or the market value at time of purchase if your plan allowed you to buy it at a discounted price the discounted amount will be automatically taxed by your employer 50 of the capital gain is added to your annual income when calculating taxes owed   normally when you sell a stock that has lost value you can actually get a capital loss deduction that is used to offset gains that you made in other stocks or redeemed against capital gains tax paid in previous years or carried forward to apply against gains in future years however if the stock decreased in value and you transfer it you are not eligible to claim a capital loss i 'm not sure why you said tfsa for a family member as you can not directly contribute to someone else 's tfsa account you can give them a gift of money or stocks which they can deposit in their tfsa account but that involves that extra step of gifting and the money stocks become their property to do with as they please now that i 've hopefully answered all your questions let me offer you some advice as someone who also participates in an employee stock purchase plan holding stock in the company that you work for is a bad idea the reason is simple if something terrible happens to the company their stock will plummet and at the same time they may be forced to lay off many employees so just at the time when you lose your job and might want to sell your stock suddenly the value of your stocks has gone way down so you really should sell your company shares at least once a year and then use that money to invest in your tfsa account you also do n't want to put all your eggs in one basket you should be spreading your investment among many companies or better yet buy index mutual funds or etfs which hold all the companies in a certain index there 's lots of good info about index investing available at canadian couch potato the types of investments recommended there are all possible to purchase inside a tfsa account to shelter the growth from being taxed edit here is an article from that talks about transferring stocks into a tfsa it also mentions the importance of having a diversified portfolio

no you will generally speaking not see a decrease in your net earnings from crossing a tax bracket this means that your highest marginal rate the top bracket you fall into only applies to the portion of your income that is in that bracket not your total income this helps ensure that your total tax burden does not increase from crossing a tax bracket be aware that you can still see measurable changes in your total taxes due if increases in income make you no longer eligible for certain deductions and/or benefits that were otherwise reducing your tax burden but this is not the same as how changes in your highest marginal rate affect your overall average tax rate note that when you see a rate table such as the one on federal income tax rates page or on wikipedia 's income tax in the united states page the rates listed are for each segment of income not for your overall income in other words the 15 rate below for 2014 filing single only applies to the portion of your income falling between the listed numbers not to income below it or above it that would be calculated under the respective rates given you can use the tax tables to gain a sense of how this works in practice the linked resource is for 2014 taxes the threshold in 2014 for the 25 rate vs 15 was $ using the linked table if you were single and made between and in gross income your tax liability before other considerations was $ if you made between and your base tax liability was $

it sounds like the kinds of planners you 're talking to might be a poor fit because they are essentially selling investments for a commission some thoughts on finding a financial planner the good kind of financial planner is going to be able to do a comprehensive plan look at your whole life goals and non investment issues such as insurance you should expect to get a document with a monte carlo simulation showing your odds of success if you stick to the plan for investments you should expect to see a recommended asset allocation and an emphasis on low cost no commission commission is load funds see some of the other questions from past posts for example what exactly can a financial advisor do for me and is it worth the money a good place to start for a planner might be there 's also a franchise of planners providing hourly advice called the planning network i helped my mom hire someone from them and she was very happy though i do think your results would depend mostly on the individual rather than the franchise anyway see they do require planners to be fee only and working on their cfp credential you should really look for the certified financial planner cfp credential there are a lot of credentials out there but many of them mean very little and others might be hard to get but not mean the right thing some other meaningful ones include chartered financial analyst cfa which would be a solid investment expert though not necessarily someone knowledgeable in financial planning generally and irs enrolled agent which means someone who knows a lot about taxes a cpa accountant would also be pretty meaningful a law degree and estate law know how is very relevant to many planning situations too some not very meaningful certifications include certified mutual fund specialist which is n't bogus but it 's much easier to get than cfp or cfa registered investment adviser ria which mostly means the person is supposed to understand securities fraud laws but does n't mean they know a lot about financial planning there are some pretty bogus certifications out there many have retirement or senior in the name a good question for any planner is are you a fiduciary which means are they legally required to act in your interests and not their own most sales oriented advisors are not fiduciaries they would n't charge you a big sales commission if they were and they are not on your side legally speaking it 's a good idea to check with your state regulators or the sec to confirm that your advisor is registered and ask if they have had any complaints small advisors usually register with the state and larger ones with the federal sec if they are registered they may still be a salesperson who is n't acting in your interests but at least they are following the law you can also see if they 've been in trouble in the past when looking for a planner one firm i found had a professional looking web site and did n't seem sketchy at all but the state said they were not properly registered and not in compliance other ideas a good book is it 's very and you 'd feel more confident talking to someone maybe with more background information for companies to work with stick to the ones that are very consumer friendly and sell no load funds vanguard is probably the one you 'll hear about most but t. rowe price fidelity usaa are some other good names fidelity is a bit of a mixture with some cheap consumer friendly investments and other products that are less so avoid companies that are all about charging commission pretty much anyone selling an annuity is probably bad news annuities have some valid uses but mostly they are a bad deal not knowing your specific situation in any detail it 's very likely that 60k is not nearly enough and that making the right investment choices will make only a small difference you could invest poorly and maybe end up with 50 k when you retire or invest well and maybe end up with 80 90k but your goal is probably more like a million dollars or more and most of that will come from future savings this is what a planner can help you figure out in detail it 's virtually certain that any planner who is for real and not a ripoff salesperson will talk a lot about how much you need to save and so forth not just about choosing investments do n't be afraid to pay for a planner it 's well worth it to pay someone a thousand dollars for a really thorough fiduciary plan with your interests foremost the free planners who get a commission are going to get a whole lot more than a thousand dollars out of you even though you wo n't write a check directly be sure to convert those mutual fund expense ratios and sales commissions into actual dollar amounts to summarize find someone you 're paying not someone getting a commission look for that cfp credential showing they passed a demanding exam maybe read a quick and easy book like the one i mentioned just so you know what the advisor is talking about and do n't rush into anything and btw i think you ought to be fine with a solid plan you and your husband have time remaining to work with good luck

i do n't believe there is such a process   my observation i.e. my opinion is that banks will have a level of security walls appropriate to the cost vs risk they experience since as says your liability is limited for this type of fraud you personally bear little if any risk   if this fraud were common enough that the cost of your proposal outweighed the expense they would implement it   on a similar note credit card fraud can be reduced ten fold if a pin were required for all purchases the 3 digits on the back helps prove the card is there and you just did n't steal the from 16 digits but a 6 8 digit pin required at point of sale would be tough for the thief to guess how much software to do this would cost i do n't know but the idea is brilliant even if it 's mine 10 fold reduction if not 100 fold any bank guys reading

one of the other things you could do to improve your score would be along the lines of what pete said in his answer but using the current financial climate to your advantage i 'm not sure what interest rates are available to you in the uk but i currently have 4 lines of credit aside from my house one is a credit card i use for every day purchases and like you pay off immediately with every statement the other three are technically credit cards however all three were used to make purchases with 0 financing the one was for a tv i bought that even gave me 5 off if i pay it off within 6 months that cash has been sitting in my savings since the day i bought it i 'm making regular payments on all three but not having to pay any interest my credit score dropped 25 points with the one as it was an elective medical expense eye surgery so for the time the balance is near my credit limit however that will bounce back up as the balance lowers my score was also able to take that hit and still be very high if you do n't have 0 or very close available your better bet would be to follow the other suggestions about saving for a sizable down payment or other every day expenses like a cell phone

i think jb king 's answer is interesting from the point of view of is this good for me but the op 's question boils down to why would a company do this the company buys back shares when it thinks it will better position the company financially a simple scenario if company a wants to open a new store for example they need to buy the land build the store stock it etc etc and this all costs money   the company can get a loan use accrued capital or raise new capital by issuing new stock   each method has benefits and drawbacks one of the drawbacks of issuing new stock is that it dilutes the existing stock 's value   previously total company profits were split between x shares   now the profits are shared between x+y shares where y is the number of new shares issued to raise the capital this normally drives the price of the stock down since the expected future dividends per stock have decreased now the company has a problem the next time they go to raise money by issuing stock they will have to issue more shares to get the same value leading to more dilution   to break out of this cycle the company can buy back shares periodically   when the company feels the the stock is sufficiently undervalued it buys some back   now the profits are shared with a smaller pool and the stock price goes up and the next time company a needs to raise capital it can issue stock so it probably has little to do with rewarding shareholders and more to do with lowering the cost of capital for the company in the future

your credit score is concerned with your current credit accounts credit cards heloc loans mortgage et cetera your current checking bank account is not a credit account so it is not reported to the credit agencies granted being overdrawn is effectively the same as having a very expensive loan from the however banks do not routinely report these to the credit agencies and of course if you fail to pay overdraft fees in a timely manner then your bank will take it to collections or possibly even get a judgement against you and that will be reported in your credit report under the derogatory remarks section i can not find any sources as to whether repeated but always paid overdrafts will be reported but certainly your bank is n't complaining because they 'll be making lots of money from you via

is it worth it that is for you to judge the risks are having it in your face and you having to pay a penalty or go to jail the issue is how you keep it secret and who you keep it secret from if you have money in a secret account and keep it hidden even though you you are taking a big risk if the knowledge of the contents of the secret stash would cause a judge or government agency to make a different decision you could face penalties ranging from monetary to jail time the government could also decide that they need to determine the source of the funds they may want to know if the money was earned through illegal means they will want to determine if the funds should haven taxed not just on the interest but if the original income tax was ever collected   if the amounts are large enough the taxing authority   and police will have a lot of fun pulling apart your entire financial history oh and the lawyers you pay to keep you out of jail will also have their fun why do some people do it they are greedy or paranoid or they do n't trust others or they are criminals

yes this is related to our economy   you see israel is basically a jewish state and has spent the last 50 years killing unarmed women and children in palestine and building illegal settlements they as a part of government policy deny their own arab citizens rights and as such are not a democracy they are an apartheid state   now jews are jews first and then any thing else like for instance american citizens they are jews first and will always put first   well that s all fine but jews also control the us economy and exert a great deal of control on the us politics via their control of the purse strings   but america is supposed to be the of democracy and human rights and is forced to publicly   support israel which is now known to the world as an apartheid state and a of and strife and the root cause of terrorism and therefor by aligning with the israeli 's and giving them weapons and military aid america shows it self as a hypocritical liar and a shallow state and grow in its isolation   all the while israel keeps about war and iran and syria and now russia and forcing america to its own destruction while siphoning off all the fat from the us economy into jewish pockets   that village is the death of the us economy

yes a diversified portfolio can generate greater returns than the s&p 500 by going outside it for instance small stocks on average generate higher returns than the large caps found in the s&p 500 so if you own a diversified portfolio of stocks some of which are smaller in market cap than the typical s&p 500 stock you have a chance to outperform you might also outperform by owning other asset classes than stocks such as gold real estate and timber among others at appropriate times you may also be able to get the relevant exposure by owning gold and timber stocks and reits this was a lesson that david of the yale endowment taught us

there are a few of ways to do this ask the seller if they will hold a vendor take back mortgage or they essentially hold a second mortgage on the property for a shorter amortization 1 5 years with a higher interest rate than the bank held mortgage the upside for the seller is he makes a little money on the second mortgage the downsides for the seller are that he does n't get the entire purchase price of the property up front and that if the buyer goes bankrupt the vendor will be second in line behind the bank to get any money from the property when it 's sold for amounts owing look for a seller that is willing to put together a lease to own deal the buyer and seller agree to a purchase price set 5 years in the future a monthly rent is calculated such that paying it for 5 years equals a 20 down payment at the 5 year mark you decide if you want to buy or not if you do not the deal is if you do the rent you paid is counted as the down payment for the property and the sale moves forward find a private lender for the down payment this is known as a hard money lender for a reason they know you ca n't get it anywhere else expect to pay higher rates than a ask your mortgage broker and your real estate agent about these options

this is because short term debt needs to be rolled over to finance the long term project and so when interest rates rise they will be refinanced at a higher interest rate this means that it will end up costing more than if the company had taken out a long term loan at the lower rate a long term project implies that the beneficial incoming cashflows will be long term but with short term financing the debt will come payable sooner which is why it needs rolling over any beneficial cashflows are not   enough to cover the debt

how is that possible the mutual fund does n't pay taxes and passes along the tax bill to shareholders via distributions would be the short answer your basis likely changed as now you have bought more shares but i gained absolutely nothing from my dividend so how is it    taxable the fund has either realized capital gains dividends interest or some other form of income that it has to pass along to shareholders as the fund does n't pay taxes itself did i get screwed the first year because i bought into the fund too    late in the year perhaps if you do n't notice that your cost basis has changed here so that you 'll have lower taxes when you sell your shares   is anyone familiar with what causes this kind of situation of    receiving a taxable dividend that does n't actually increase the    account balance yes i am rather familiar with this the point to understand is that the fund does n't pay taxes itself but passes this along the shareholders that hold funds in tax advantaged accounts like 401ks and iras still get the distribution but are shielded from paying taxes on those gains at that point at time is it because i bought too late in the year   no it is because you did n't know the fund would have a distribution of that size that year some funds can have negative returns yet still have a capital gains distribution if the fund experiences enough redemptions that the fund had to sell appreciated shares in a security this is part of the risk in having stock funds in taxable accounts or is it because the fund had a negative return that year   no it is because you do n't understand how mutual funds and taxes work along with what distribution schedule the fund had do i wait until after the distribution date this year to buy i 'd likely consider it for taxable accounts yes however if you are buying in a tax advantaged account then there is n't that same issue

there is little difference between buying shares in your broker 's index fund and shares of their corresponding etf   in many cases the money invested in an etf gets essentially stuffed right into the index fund i believe vanguard does this for example   in either case you will be paying a little bit of tax   in the etf case it will be on the dividends that are paid out   in the index fund case it will additionally be on the capital gains that have been realized within the fund which are very few for an index fund   not a ton in either case   the more important tax consideration is between purchase and sale which is the same in either case i 'd say stick it wherever the lowest fees are

if you 're exchanging cash then the rule of thumb is generally that it 's better to buy currency in the country that issues the currency   in your case that would mean buy inr in india and buy usd in the u.s.   the rationale is that supply of foreign currency is generally smaller so you get a little better price if you 're holding the foreign currency   there are of course exceptions like if you 're going to a country with little foreign trade that would n't seem to apply to the u.s. or india if you are doing an electronic transfer through a bank however i doubt that it matters which end initiates the transfer   you 're going to get their wholesale exchange rate plus fees   it seems more likely to matter what fees are charged and that may vary more by bank than by country

quick pay off the student loans you have 140 k in savings with a combined salary of you are looking to make money with the 140 k so just pay off the loans it will turn your monthly loan payments in to a stream of money that can be used to save money for the next house   assume the rest of the 700 k needed for a 1.5 million dollar house has to come from savings and the profit from selling the first house if the house sells for loan balance + 300 k you still need 400 k in savings   turning 140 k into 400 k in 5 years will funneling a large amount of your income into savings or excellent returns of course there is no way to predict return or what will happen to the market if you do n't sell the first home you can rent the house you either hope that the rental you charge allows you a positive cash flow or you hope that the house appreciates in value so you hold on to it even if the rental income is a little below break even of course some keep the house because they ca n't sell it in your case the equity might be more important for you to purchase the next house

the first issue is if the stock has returned 8 since you purchased it that could be either very good 8 in two days or very bad 8 over 20 years   even just measured over the past year it could be relatively very good up 8 and the market is down 5 or very bad up 8 and the market is up 16 either way the good rule of thumb is that you should n't choose your positions using the returns of the stock in the past but only on your view of the future returns of the stock   for instance if the stock has gone up 8 in two months but you think it has another 8 to go in the next two months you probably should n't take your earnings as for the $ 5k at first glance that is not an unreasonable amount   if you use a discount broker the fees should n't be so large that you will eat up any return on a $ 5k amount   also from what you describe it is not such a large amount that mistakes will put your retirement in danger

you 're not proving anything by showing me the job specs i 'm completely aware that there are n't high requirements for getting the job what you do n't understand since live in a world where your resume gets you in the door is that the difficulty of a job the skill required to do it well and the pay required to keep a guy doing it day in and day out for 30 years does n't always depend on any kind of credential that would show up on paper   and just for the record boeing 's thousands of union professional and technical engineers would like to have a word with you about lack of credentials required to get a union job at boeing if we 're going to split hairs

you said all public employees should be required to fly coach i never claimed more than that in my response i simply pointed out why this was a silly thing to get worked up over   you did n't explain what you did nor does it matter   again tax dollars and union dues are two very different things just like private company profit is different   you can have an opinion on tax dollars   union practices are none of your business unless you 're paying dues

according to intuit you can not claim the $ 50 charitable contribution so the entire $ 2000 month will be taxable instead of $ 1900 that 's only an extra $ 35 if your combined tax rate is 35 as mentioned do this for the experience not for the money my wife and i have been hosting international students for 10 years now

look at how much tax you paid last year including withholding and any additional amount that might have been due with the tax return look at the instructions for the w-4 form which sets how much tax you want your employer to withhold adjust the numbers on that form until the total withheld during the year is close to what you expect this year 's total to be remember though that there 's no penalty for over withholding but could be for under withholding submit the w-4 form to your employer   remember that we 're a few weeks into the year so even if you adjust withholding now there will have been several paychecks at the prior setting you can try to build that into your of how to reset the withholding or just not worry about it do the same with your state 's withholding adjustments form repeat on a yearly basis to account for raises changes in other income changes in filing status etc until it 's close enough that you 're satisfied with it then reconsider if when your financial situation changes personally i find that exercise more effort than it 's worth and have simply set my withholding at close enough i usually get some money back from the feds and owe some to the state but either is handled happily by my normal bank account balance

the 25 is an utterly meaningless statistic absent the age demographic breakdown   one would easily expect the 18 to ~30 year age group to have little in the way of savings and the 18 to 30 year age group is gt 20 of the population by itself   this is like the upper x% have more net worth than the lower yet another one of these idiotic inane misleading abuses of aggregate statistics   also this really is n't news in that it is n't anything new for the majority of americans savings pretty much disappeared a couple of decades ago

you are right it is a ponzi scheme unless it pays all of the profits as dividends here 's why today 's millenials are saving a lot less and instead they choose to be spenders it 's just that their mentality is different if the trend continues there will be more spenders and less savers   that means that in 20 years from now a company might sell more and make more profits but because there are less investors on the market it will worth less judging by supply and demand this has to be true   does n't that seem like a disconnect to you guys does n't that just prove that all those profits are not really yours but instead you 're just sitting on the side making bets about them if i own a company from the point where it goes public and while the value goes up i hold on to it for 50 years let 's say for 45 years it made tons of profits but never paid a cent in dividend and then in 5 years it goes out of business what happened to all the profits they made throughout the 45 years   if you owned a restaurant that made a profit for 45 years and then went bankrupt you are fine you took your profits every year because why on earth would you reinvest 100 of the profit forever but what if you could sell of that restaurant on the stock market get all of that ipo money and still keep all of the profits while claiming that you reinvest it forever that 's exactly what they do they just buy expensive things for personal use from fancy cars to private jets they just write it down as an investment and you ca n't see what the money was spent on because you are not a majority stakeholder you have no power it was not like this forever companies used to pay all of their profits in dividends and be valued according to that not anymore now they are just in it for the growth it will keep growing as long as people keep buying into it and that 's the exact definition of a ponzi scheme

moving average is mere average line based on historical period broadly use to view the trend but it has no relation to price action in due future course if price is going below 20 sma then in near future even the sma will start directing toward south in your case if price has fallen below all the short period average lines and long period average line then it is bearish in nature soon in few days you may find 20 sma leading downwards followed by closest period and then long also sma and ema can best be observed in charting software in candlestick mode because these moving averages can also be adjusted and viewed based on opening price high prices low price or closing price in you case i guess the data is of closing price data overlapping of averages may be sign of reversals so if you want to buy this stock you may have to wait till all the average lines cross over and when new trend begins with sma of shortest avg period 20 leading above the long avg period 90 days in your case then you can buy and just follow the trend i hope it answers you question

we do n't make enough to really consider it a salary but i 've heard    using a draw without a salary is a bad idea as any other illegal action not paying yourself a   reasonable salary when being a corporate officer is indeed a bad idea i have no idea what i need to do to actually get some money in our    pockets the answer is simple you need to earn more money since it is s corp it does n't matter if you keep the profits on the corporate account or distribute the profits will be taxed to you you are also as i said above required by law to pay yourself a reasonable salary reasonable meaning corresponding to market rates paying a cpa or a software engineer a minimum wage will not be reasonable that is of course if you 're profitable you 're not required to pay yourself more money than the corporation actually has just to be clear my answer refers to the question asked and the confusing answer above that made a claim that has no in the law i do not intend to write a thesis about pros and cons of using s corp every time a question about reasonable salary is asked

from your question it seems your problem is that you have a company that wants to make a deal but does not currently have enough money to go through with it therefore it needs to raise capital assuming that you can not get a loan from a bank and you do not want to seek funding from other sources the two owners must provide the funds themselves somehow option a the easiest and fairest way to do this is for the two shareholders to provide 75 and 25 of the funding as a loan to the company they will provide this loan knowing it may not be paid back if the company goes under note that it would not be fair for one of the shareholders to provide more as that shareholder would be taking all the risk while the other still the rewards although you could add a large interest rate to account for this option b but say one of the shareholders can not provide additional funds in that case the company should issue new shares and each shareholder can purchase however many of the new shares he she wants each shareholder is entitled to purchase at least 75 or 25 respectively but does not have to the result of this may be that company ownership percentages have changed after the capital raising this is more complex as it require valuing the company accurately to be fair and probably requires reporting to a government depending on the jurisdiction

i take some offense to your statement that i 'm clearly jealous of the rich   that honestly sounds like a really douchey statement someone out of touch with reality would make someone who is either naive or has had everything handed to them for most of his her life i was stating facts not making some attack on my buddies achievements   i live very comfortably   i just have something called empathy and i can understand that things are n't as simple as you lay it out for everyone     even the example you provide is idealistic   that kid had everything fall into order for him not to mention his situation was ideal   i too had my own business when i was living at my parents and in middle school and high school   i also had my own employees 8 in fact   in fact i wrote my college application essay all about it   but you know what not everyone has the time people might have families mortgages debt to pay off and that extra time you speak of after work that could be spent working a 2nd job taking care of kids or hell relaxing   i know in my present job if i did n't have the time to relax after work i would go insane   you need to understand that your solution is n't an adequate solution for everyone   even hard working people who pull way more demanding hours than yourself often times can not afford to pursue the path you suggest   it 's also not as simple as having an idea   idea 's are cheap   execution takes patience and lets be honest a lot of luck

generally etfs work on the basis that there exists a pair of values that can be taken at any moment in time a net asset value of each share in the fund and a trading market price of each share in the fund   it may help to picture these in baskets of about 50,000 shares for the creation redemption process if the nav is greater than the market price then arbitrageurs will buy up shares at the market price and do an in kind transaction that will be worth the nav value that the arbitrageurs could turn around and sell for an immediate profit if the market price is greater than the nav then the arbitrageurs will buy up the underlying securities that can be exchanged in kind for shares in the fund that can then be sold on the market for an immediate profit what is the etf creation redemption mechanism would be a source on this though i imagine there are others now in the case of vxx there is something to be said for how much trading is being done and what impact this can have from a july 8 2013 yahoo finance article at big option trade in the s&p 500 vix short term futures note    is looking for another jump in volatility   more than 250,000 vxx options have already traded twice its daily    average over the last month systems show that a trader    bought august 26 calls for the ask price of $ in volume    that was 6 times the strike 's previous open interest clearly    indicating new activity now the total returns of the etf are a combination of changes in share price plus what happens with the distributions which could be held as cash or reinvested to purchase more shares

depends on your time scale but generally i do n't think it would work what you 'd really be betting on in this case is mean reversal which does not hold true in the equity universe atleast not in the long run if you look at the historical prices of the s&p you 'll notice it increases in terms of absolute dollar value on the short term however if you feel the market has significantly undervalued or overvalued a security then mean reversal might be a reasonable bet to make in that scenario however it seems to me that you are really looking for a volatility trade in which case you might want to consider a straddle position using options here the bet you 'd be making is that the price at expiration will be inside a certain band or outside the band depending on your position
