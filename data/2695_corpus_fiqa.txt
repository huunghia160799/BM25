from strictly a gross revenue point of view the parking spot is going to yield a higher rate 5.4 versus a 3 savings account assuming you have it rented all year your break even point not considering other expenses is 7 8 months of rent per year so what are things to consider here 's a few to start with the parking spot is a nice investment in that you get a decent return and the potential for appreciation the savings account cd will give you a fixed return with no risk   to support your decision make sure you understand all of the costs and understand all of the downside risk if you 're 50 and this is alot of money to you be conservative if you 're 25 and have a good job you can afford to chase the yield

the general difference between high dividend paying stocks and growth stocks is as follows 1 a high dividend paying stock company is a company that has reached its maximum growth potential in a market and its real growth that is after adjustment of inflation is same more or less as the growth of the economy these companies typically generate a lot of cash cash cow and has nowhere to really invest the entire thing so they pay high dividends typically fast moving consumer goods power utility companies textile in some countries come into this category if you invest in these stocks expect less growth but more dividend these companies generally come under defensive sector of the market i.e. whose prices do not fall drastically during down turn in a market 2 growth stocks on the other hand are the stocks that are operating in a market that is rapid growth for example technology aerospace etc these companies have high growth potential but not much accumulated income as the profit is re invested to support the growth of the company so no dividend you will be typically never get any much dividend from these companies these companies usually for some years grow or at least has potential to grow more than the economy and provide real return usually these companies are very sensitive to results good or bad and their prices are quite volatile as for your investment strategy i can not comment on that as investment is a very subjective matter hope this helps

i believe the answer is that to protect yourself it is good to get credit protection so you will be notified when new credit is taken in your name    also you can use to look at your credit report hint   while you do that and while you are in the transunion report you will have the option to dispute adverse items    i always suggest that people dispute everything adverse   that puts the onus on the other parties to produce evidence to transunion within 30 days to the validity of the adverse item    you would be surprised how many will simply drop off your report after doing that   everybody should do this here is a direct address for transunion = = >   once the disputes are finalized the results get communicated to the other two bureaus it is amazing how well it works   it can raise your credit score significantly it really helps to watch your credit report yourself and also to get whatever protection is offered that may help protect you against others opening new accounts in your name

i was in that same situation years ago with my parents one way she could apply for a loan in her name without her parents is if she is not currently living with them she should n't need them to cosign if she does n't have bad credit but if she is n't living with them and they are n't financing her room and board they ca n't claim her as a dependent so if she really wants to stick it to them she can go and try to politely explain how the loans work and tell them if they do n't cosign for her then she will apply on her own which she can only do while not living with them i believe but not sure and they will have to stop claiming her as a dependent on their taxes if they do n't agree she can put her foot down and force them to stop claiming her and tell them she will file her own application anyway and if they continue claiming her and get in trouble for it it 's their own fault cause she warned them to stop first they may agree to cosign rather than lose her as a dependent if it makes that big of a difference on their taxes if they do n't then she can forcefully punish them financially and their taxes will go up those were my choices when my parents refused to cosign for me to live at school but that was back in 1999 2000 and things may have changed since then things also change state by state and i live in pa

sell 200 at 142 what does that mean i have n't seen the movie so i wo n't try to put anything in story context   sell 200 at 142 means to sell 200 units usually shares but in this case it would likely be gallons or barrels of orange juice or pounds or tons of frozen juice    in general this could mean that you have 200 units and want to sell what you have   or you could borrow 200 units from someone and sell those this is called a naked short   in this case it seems that what they are selling is a futures contract   with a futures contract you are promising to obtain orange juice by some future date and sell it for the agreed price   you could own an orange and plan to turn your oranges into juice   or you could buy a futures contract of oranges to turn into juice   or you could arbitrage two futures contracts such that one supplies the other what they 're doing here    in general people make profits by buying low and selling high   in this case they did so in reverse order   they took the risk of selling before they had a supply   then they covered their position by purchasing the supply   they profited because the price at which they bought was lower than the price at which they sold    the reason why this is necessary is that before buying the oranges the orange juice makers need to know that they can make a profit   so they sell orange juice on the futures market   then they know how much they can afford to pay for oranges on a different market   and the growers know how much they can get for oranges so they can pay people to water and pick them    without the futures markets growers and orange juice makers would have to take all the risk themselves   this way they can share risks with each other and financiers   combined with insurance this allows for predictable finances   without it growers would have to be wealthy to afford the variation in crop yields and prices

i agree with joe that you seem to have your stuff together however i ca n't disagree more otherwise   you are getting a loan at such a cheap rate that it would be almost impossible to not substantially beat that rate over the next 15 20 years   you paying off your home early might give you warm fuzzy feeling but would make me   this is a money website   make money for our purposes let 's say your home is worth 500k you can get a fixed rate loan at 3 over 30 years and you can earn 7 on your investments per year   note that i have earned 12 on mine the past 15 years so i am being pretty conservative so let 's not get into your other stuff because that is fine   let 's focus just on that 500k your house interest only loan for the whole   the flip side is you pay off your house   your house could be worth 400 k in 30 years   probably not but neighborhood could decline house not kept up or whatever   your house is not a risk free investment   and it fluctuate in many areas more than the stock market   but let 's just say your area stays ok or normal   in 30 years you can expect your house to be worth somewhere between 700k to 1.5 million   let 's just say you did great with your house   guess what   at 1.5 million selling price you still lost 1.5 million because of your decision plus sunk your money into a less liquid option    let the bank take the risk on your house price   the warm fuzzy feeling will be there when you realize you could rebuy your house two times over in 6 7 years note i know my example does n't use your exact numbers   i am just showing what your true cost is of making a decision in the most extreme way   i am guessing you have great credit and might be able to find an all interest loan at 3   so not doing this is costing you 1.5 million over 30 years   given a lower home price after 30 years or a higher rate of return this easily be much more   if you earned 12 over the 30 year period you would be costing yourself 16 million do the math   now you are talking about doing something in between   which means you will basically have the same risk factors with less return

no spdr etfs are not a good fit for a novice investor with a low level of financial literacy   in fact there is no investment that is safe for an absolute beginner not even a savings account   an absolute beginner could easily overdraw his savings account leading to fees and collections i would say that an investment becomes a good fit for an investor as soon as said investor understands how the investment works   a savings account at a bank or credit union is fairly easy to understand and is therefore a suitable place to hold money after a few hours to a day of research   even after 0 hours of research however a savings account is still better than a sock drawer money market accounts through a bank certificates of deposit through a bank and money market mutual funds through a mutual fund provider are probably the next easiest thing to understand   this could take a few hours to a few weeks of research depending on the learner equities corporate bonds and government bonds are another step up in complexity and could take weeks or months of schooling to understand well enough to try   equity or bond mutual funds or the etf versions of those which is what you asked about are another level after that also important to understand along the way are the financial institutions and market infrastructure that exist to provide these products   banks credit unions public corporations brokerages stock exchanges bond exchanges mutual fund providers etf providers etc

the statistic you cited comes from the federal reserve board 's survey of consumer finances a survey that they do every three years most recently in 2013   this was reported in the september 2014 issue of the federal reserve bulletin   they list the percentage of americans with any type of debt as in 2013 down slightly from in 2010 the bulletin also has a table with a breakdown of the types of debt that people have and primary residence mortgages are at the top of the list   so the answer is yes the 75 statistic includes americans with home mortgages the bigger question is are you really in debt if you have a home mortgage   the answer to that is also yes   when you take out a mortgage you really do own the house   you decide who lives there you decide what changes you are going to make to it and you are responsible for the upkeep   but the mortgage debt you have is secured by the house   this means that if you refuse to pay the bank is allowed to take possession of the house   they do n't even get the whole house though they will sell it to recoup their losses and give you back whatever equity you had in the house after the loan is satisfied is it good debt   many people think that if you are borrowing money to purchase an appreciating asset the debt is acceptable   with this definition a car loan is bad credit card debt is very bad and a home mortgage might be okay   even dave ramsey radio host and champion of the debt free lifestyle is not opposed to home mortgages   home mortgages allow people to purchase a home that they would otherwise be unable to afford interestingly according to the bulletin credit card balances were only included as debt for the survey purposes if there was a balance after the most recent bill was paid not including purchases made after the bill   so people that do not carry a balance on their credit card were not considered in debt in this statistic

@littleadv has said most of what i 'd say if they had not gotten here first i 'd add this much it 's important to understand what debt collectors can and can not do because a lot of them will use intimidation and any other technique you can think of to get away with as much as you will let them i 'd start with this pdf file from the ftc and then start googling for info on your state 's regulations also it would be a very very good idea to review the documents you signed or get a copy when you took out the loan to see what sort of additional penalties etc you may have already agreed to in the event you default   the fee 's the collector is adding in could be of their own creation making them highly negotiable or it might be something you already agreed to in you little recourse but to pay them do keep in mind that in many cases debt collectors are at the very least to charge you simple interest of around 10   on a debt of your size paid off over several years that might amount to more than the $ 4 k they are adding   otoh you can pretty much expect them to try both tacking on fees and then trying to add interest if the fees are not paid    another source of assistance may be the department of education ombudsman if you need help with a defaulted student loan contact the department of education 's ombudsman at or visit its website at but first you must take steps to resolve your loan problem on your own there is a checklist of required steps on the website or the ombudsman will not assist you

from your question it seems your problem is that you have a company that wants to make a deal but does not currently have enough money to go through with it therefore it needs to raise capital assuming that you can not get a loan from a bank and you do not want to seek funding from other sources the two owners must provide the funds themselves somehow option a the easiest and fairest way to do this is for the two shareholders to provide 75 and 25 of the funding as a loan to the company they will provide this loan knowing it may not be paid back if the company goes under note that it would not be fair for one of the shareholders to provide more as that shareholder would be taking all the risk while the other still the rewards although you could add a large interest rate to account for this option b but say one of the shareholders can not provide additional funds in that case the company should issue new shares and each shareholder can purchase however many of the new shares he she wants each shareholder is entitled to purchase at least 75 or 25 respectively but does not have to the result of this may be that company ownership percentages have changed after the capital raising this is more complex as it require valuing the company accurately to be fair and probably requires reporting to a government depending on the jurisdiction

the economy stinks because the government targets a straight line rate of ngdp growth that is ever diverging from the rate of sustainable economic growth which has been flattening since the 1970s when the cost of energy sustained significant rises in price and never looked back the only way to make the economy not stink is to find a miraculously cheap energy source that is as cheap as fossil fuels were before the 1970s   since the possibility of this is practically zero the best we can do is make the economy stink less in the long run by intentionally flattening the rate of ngdp growth by gradually pulling back on massive debt spending and tightening loose monetary policies if we do n't do this we are just setting ourselves up for a future economic correction whose will not only be bigger than the great recession but will also be relatively bigger than the great depression

the main thing is the percentage of the company represented by the shares number of shares is meaningless without total shares if you compute percentage and total company value you can estimate the value of the grant or perhaps more useful for a startup is to multiple the percentage by some plausible exit value such as how much the company might sell for or ipo for many grants expire when or soon after you leave the company if you do n't cash out vested shares when you leave this is standard but do remember it when you leave   the other major thing is vesting in the tech industry vesting 1/4 after a year and then the rest quarterly over 3 more years is most common

offset against taxable gains means that the amount $ 25 million in this case can be used to reduce another sum that the company would otherwise have to pay tax on suppose the company had made a profit of $ 100 million on some other investments at some point they are likely to have to pay corporation tax on that amount before being able to distribute it as a cash dividend to shareholders however if they can offset the $ 25 million then they will only have to pay tax on $ 75 million this is quite normal as you usually only pay tax on the aggregate of your gains and losses if corporation tax is about 32 that would explain the claimed saving of approximately $ 8 million it sounds like the plaintiffs want the stock to be sold on the market to get that tax saving presumably they believe that distributing it directly would not have the same effect because of the way the tax rules work i do n't know if the plaintiffs are right or not but if they are the difference would probably come about due to the stock being treated as a realized loss in the case where they sell it but not in the case where they distribute it it 's also possible though this is all very speculative that if the loss is n't realised when they distribute it directly then the cost basis of the shareholders would be the price the company originally paid for the stock rather than the value at the time they receive it that in turn could mean a tax advantage for the shareholders

perhaps you can track your vat amounts in a liability account   using a tax liability account is a common thing in accounting to do this when you receive money split the transaction such that your actual revenue which you will keep after vat remittance goes into an asset account and the amount you will eventually have to pay back to the state goes into a liability account   later when you pay the vat back to the state your transaction will effectively pay back the liability with one end of your double entry decreasing the funds in your checking account and the other end decreasing the funds in your tax liability account having said that i 've found that there are many shortcomings in the cash flow report and i 'm not sure that using a tax liability account which i think is the right thing to do will necessarily solve this problem for you

there 's a concept in retail called a loss leader and essentially it means that a store will sell an item intentionally at a loss as a way of bringing in business in the hope that while consumers are in the store taking advantage of the discounted item they 'll make other purchases to make up for the loss and generate an overall profit many times it only makes sense to carry items that enhance the value of something else the store sells   stores pay big money to study consumer behaviors and preferences in order to understand what items are natural fits for each other and the best ways to market them    a good example of what you 're talking about is the fact that many grocery stores carry private label products that sell for higher margins and they 'll stock them alongside the name brands that cost much more   as a consequence and since consumers often do n't see a qualitative difference between store brands and name brands much of the time to rationalize spending more the store 's own brands sell better i hope this helps good luck

every situation is possible it depends on what the contract states according to nolo   your ability to withdraw from a home purchase depends on two things 1 the exact point at which you are in contract to buy the house    and   2 after you 're in contract what the contract says about terminating    the transaction therefore you need to be 100 ready for anything to happen after you sign the contract it is binding and you must adhere to what the contract states buying a home is a big purchase arguably the biggest of your life you need to be comfortable with every aspect of this experience

when getting a mortgage it always depends on the bank and each bank may be more or less strict with that being said there are rules and general guidelines which can help you understand how you fit in the world of mortgage approvals if you can provide the same paper work as an employee of your company that you would normally provide from any other company then a bank may just accept that alone however to me it seems like you will be looking at a new variation of what was known as a self certification mortgage a self certification mortgage is basically a mortgage for those who    can not prove their income as a result of the housing collapse the rules on a traditional self cert mortgages have changed as someone who is self employed it is more difficult today to get a mortgage but is still possible this article provides some good information can the self employed still get a mortgage i advise doing some research on this topic and speaking with a professional mortgage broker   some resources compare self cert mortgages how to beat the mortgage famine in 2012 can the self employed still get a mortgage

yea but the market has almost built up an immunity to the back and forth of this thought over the past couple months there 's essentially too much talk and not enough action but it will be interesting to see the effect this investigation news has over the next couple days cause i 'm assuming the media will push the story although the dow broke new highs today it was essentially flat    personally i think the markets being propped up also the dollar is being artificially pushed down because the fed needs it weak for inflation rises but who knows it 's just a thought and i will keep trading with the trends

rather than rolling the 401(k to a new employer 's plan you should roll it into a traditional ira   you get more options for the money there 's no limit on how much you can roll over and you have more control over the money   if you do a direct rollover there 's no taxes or penalties involved i 'd recommend against taking any money out of the 401(k   with the numbers you give above it 's like borrowing money at interest which is pretty high and you 're sacrificing your future retirement   if you leave that money alone to grow with compounding you 'll have a lot more when you retire   if you 're not familiar with the concept of compound interest it 's worth reading up on the numbers will blow you away at the very least if you desperately need to get $ 3000 out of it take out just enough to net $ 3000 after taxes and penalties not quite $ using the numbers you give and do a rollover with the rest   at least that way you 're keeping more in the ira just over $ vs the $ 5000 in your proposed scenario overall i really recommend you find a way to accomplish your goals without touching your retirement savings

the typical case would be as you expected that the interest goes down equally dramatically and you would pay much less interest note that that does not remove your obligation to pay the full 1000 every month even though you could argue that you are 90 months ahead in paying you still need to deliver 1000 a month until it is fully paid some mortgages are made differently they do not allow that basically if you pay a large amount at once it is considered a pre payment for the next x month as a result you are now x months ahead and could stop paying for that much time but your interest stays high the latter type protects the bank against losing the interest income they already planned for as a balance those type of mortgages are typically slightly cheaper because the bank is in a better position you did not specify a country in germany typically all mortgages are of the second type but you can get 1.35 mortgages in the us most are the first   you need to check which type you have best before you pay a large amount in the latter case it is better to invest that money and use it to pay off as soon as you reach the threshold in the first case any extra payoff is to your advantage

there are a few loan programs that grant exceptions to bankruptcy requirements in the event of extenuating circumstances that can be proven to be outside of your control i.e. massive medical bills that you used bankruptcy to settle etc however in order to make the case for this exemption you would need to make a strong case for your solvency shown the ability to re establish your credit reputation since the discharge of your bankruptcy and would almost certainly have to go through a bank that offers manual underwriting additionally if you are native american the program is a great option for your situation as it allows for a wide latitude in terms of underwriter discretion and is always manually underwritten as there is no automated underwriting system developed for the loan program there are several great lenders that offer nationwide financing as long as you 're in a eligible area and would be a great potential solution if you meet the qualifying parameter of being native american

the only professional designations for people allowed to provide tax advice are attorney ea or cpa attorney and cpa must be licensed in the state they practice in ea 's are licensed by the federal government tax preparers are not allowed to provide any tax advice unless they hold any of these designations they are only allowed to prepare your tax forms for you so no tax preparer is not a solution yes you need to talk to a tax adviser ea cpa licensed in your state you probably do n't need a tax attorney you should do that before you start earning money so that you can plan properly and understand what expenses you can incur and how they 're handled with regards to your future income tax payments you might also want to consider a bookkeeping service many ea cpa offices offer the bookkeeping as well but that you can also do yourself not all that complicated if you do n't have tons of transactions and accounts

gt go on try walking away without signing your credit card receipt at stores where they present it for signature and see what happens   that 's true if the amount is over $ 25 did you notice it actually at costco is over $ 50   and you know what else is true that yes they require you to something but you can write an obvious incorrect signature and nobody will care you have no idea how many times the screen with the electronic pen did not work right so i just put couple of lines   gt;&gt   know what i am talking about because i deal with credit cards a lot professionally in it   gt you and everyone else big deal different credit card processors have different requirements for their customers merchants   just because different processors have different requirements makes the whole process impossible to manage or comply with go figure out the requirement based on the card presented   gt;&gt the credit card companies do n't really care   gt i think the real lesson here is nobody cares    the merchant cares because they are ultimately responsible for paying for fraud which is the main reason why credit card companies do n't care and many merchants too because they have insurance   the bottom line is that everyone would not mind to enter a pin to get the transaction through but a stupid ego trip of the credit card companies who do n't want to be like atms that 's it   so they came up with chip in the card which made the process slower and more expensive and does not solve anything except fake credit cards copied credit cards

right now interest rates are pretty low and as such you wo n't see blockbuster interest rates in anything highly liquid that being said you 're motivation is liquidity over rate of return anyway so i do n't think that is a concern money market funds should give you a similar return to amex personal savings due to their lack of a rate guarantee i would n't be surprised if that is simply a branded money market account your best bet is to look at what rates you can get on any short term security and park your money in the one that best suites your needs and offers the greatest return money markets are simply a great way for you to keep your cash liquid while investing you in a broad range of liquid assets diversification is key

no it can really not look at detroit which has lost a million residents over the past few decades there is plenty of real estate which will not go for anything like it was sold other markets are very risky like florida where speculators drive too much of the price for it to be stable you have to be sure to buy on the downturn a lot of price drops in real estate are masked because sellers just do n't sell so you do n't really know how low the price is if you absolutely had to sell in general in most of america anyway you can expect real estate to keep up with inflation but not do much better than that it is the rental income or the leverage if you buy with a mortgage that makes most of the returns in urban markets that are getting an influx of people and industry however real estate can indeed outpace inflation but the number of markets that do this are rare also if you look at it strictly as an investment as opposed to the question of is it worth it to own my own home there are a lot of additional costs that you have to recoup from property taxes to bills rental headaches etc it 's an investment like any other and should be approached with the same due diligence

rather than thinking of becoming a landlord as a passive investment like a bank account or mutual fund it may be useful to think of it as starting a small part time business while certainly many people can and do start their own businesses and there are many success stories there are many cases where things do n't work out quite as they hoped i would n't call starting any new business low risk even one that is n't expected to be one 's main full time job though some may be acceptable risk for your particular circumstances but if you 're going to start a part time business is there any particular reason you 'd do so in real estate as opposed to some other activity it sounds like you 'd be completely new to real estate so perhaps for your first business you 're starting you 'd want it to be something you 're more familiar with or if you do want to enter the real estate world or any other new business be sure to do a lot of research come up with a business plan and be prepared for the possibility of losing money as with any investment or new business

another way of explaining the balance right after a particular bill is paid you have $ 0 saved to pay that bill the next time   just before the bill is next due you wisely have the whole amount saved   that 's the purpose of the whole process   so for that bill on average over time you 'll have one half that upcoming bill in the account but the same argument holds for every one of the upcoming bills   so for a large number of bills with varying sizes and times between occurrence the average amount in the account will be approximately one half of the total amount of all the bills that you 're saving for

in such a situation is it really safe to give financial info to a person who does not encrypt it encryption only helps to an extent i.e. during transmission of data or during brute force makes it more difficult to get the real data however you concern is more of staff using this data which encryption will not help much as they would be able to and see the data in what ways could it be misused this depends on the type of data the financial data can be used to hack into your accounts if other bits of info are known i.e. most of the times on telephone requests say putting card on hold requesting balance on account etc only your address mother name last few transaction details are asked some critical requests need more id proofs so generally not of concern the other misuse would be selling this to marketing companies so that you can be bombarded with sales pitch for anything and everything the pan and other id documents are becoming more prone to mis use i.e. give a copy of pan to open fraudulent accounts etc a good practise would be to mark every copy of id proof you give with the purpose as to why its given and a date this would make the id proof stale to an extent if she is not going to encrypt it should i ask her to delete all my old data and then create a new profile for my communication with her the new profile not being my name but a fake name the regulations would not allow her to create fake accounts and may lead to issues and as such any recognised financial advisor would not allow this to be done quite a few countries have regulations for financial advisor 's that need to be to

imagine that your normal mode of using credit gets you a score of x. as time goes by your score trends upward if the positive items length of credit outweigh your negative items but there are no big increases or decrease in your score then you make a one time change to how you use credit if this is a event that helps your score there will be a increase in your score if it is bad thing your score will drop but if you go back to your standard method of operating your score will drift back to the previous range getting a car loan for a few months to get a bump in your credit score will not sustain your score at the new level indefinitely overtime the impact will lessen and the score will return your your normal range spending money on the loan just to buy a temporary higher credit score is throwing away money

why do people talk about stock that pay high dividends   traditionally people who buy dividend stocks are looking for income from their investments most dividend stock companies pay out dividends every quarter every 90 days if set up properly an investor can receive a dividend check every month every week or as often as they have enough money to the ex dates there is a difference in high $ $ amount of the dividend and the yield   a $ 1/share dividend payout may sound good up front but how much is that stock costing you if the stock cost you $ 100/share then you are getting 1 yield if the stock cost you $ 10/share you are getting 10 yield   there are a lot of factors that come into play when investing in dividend stocks for cash flow keep in mind why are you investing in the first place growth or cash flow arrange your investing around your major investment goals do n't chase big dollar dividend checks do your research and follow a proven investment plan to reach your goals safely

are you asking what does everybody else do spend   i think any amount less that 90 is safe but if depends on your goals   saving a dime of every dollar is a good rule of thumb for retirement so 90 is left to spend but i believe that is the wrong way to think about it   you have expenses some are optional and some are not   the percentages are n't the important thing   what is important is that you meet your obligations and meet your goals   everybody is different so i do n't think you can reasonably your percent of expenses to somebody else in setting up your budget go the simple route   you can always get super detailed later if you want income as you have extra funds be sure you have an emergency fund ~6 months of expenses and a fully funded retirement   pay off any outstanding debts   if you are so fortunate to have some left over then revisit the savings amount or become an investor like many people here or have fun and go on vacations or buy a nicer car   the point being you will know you can afford it if you put detailed categories under those main categories that will give you a picture of where you spend you money and you can fix that if desire   if it bothers you that you spend 15 of your income on imported classical music you can adjust that with a habit change

does this make sense i 'm concerned that by buying shares with post tax income i 'll have ended up being taxed twice or have increased my taxable income the company will then re reimburse me for the difference in stock price between the vesting and the purchase share price sure   assuming you received a rsu for shares worth $ 10 and your marginal tax rate is 30 all made up numbers either or so you 're in the same spot either way   you paid $ 300 to get $ 1,000 worth of stock taxes are the same as well   the full value of the rsu will count as income either way and you 'll either pay tax on the gains of the 100 shares in your rsu our you 'll pay tax on gains on the 70 shares in your rsu and the 30 shares you bought   since they 're reimbursing you for any difference the cost basis will be the same although you might get taxed on the reimbursement but that should be a relatively small amount this first year i wanted to keep all of the shares due to tax reasons and because believe the share price will go up i do n't see how this would make a difference from a tax standpoint you 're going to pay tax on the rsu either way either in shares or in cash   how does the value of the shares going up make a difference in tax additionally i 'm concerned that by doing this i 'm going to be hit by my bank for exchange fees foreign money transfer charges broker purchase fees etc   that might be true if that 's the case then you need to decide whether to keep fighting or decide if it 's worth the transaction costs

gt so if everybody took your advice how would you ever be able to hire other people   i never said every single person needs to open a business   i said we need more entrepreneurs   your example is implausible unrealistic over simplified and not at all what i suggested   i just find it hysterical that i get down voted to hell for suggesting that we teach kids that there are other options besides get a job and that anyone can start their own business and actually provide jobs improving their local economy   but fuck that i guess   go upvote the guy who says the government should just be giving out free money to everyone   yea that makes much more sense in the long term growth of our economy     this ignorance in this subreddit is astounding

it is creepy how wealthy companies always get these tendencies to change their structure and functioning   to pay the least possible taxes and get into all kinds of this shady shit i once heard that if you study the behaviour of companies as if they were people many of them would get diagnosed as and this kind of behaviour is an example of that    why does the most profitable company on earth have this perverse urge to increase that money in such shady ways why not live up to your honour and pay taxes back to the country that gave you the chance to develop and grow

who issued stock typically support it when the stock price go down   no not many company do that as it is uneconomical for them to do so money used up in buying back equity is a wasteful use of a firm 's capital unless it is doing a buyback to return money to shareholders does the same thing happen with government bonds   not necessarily again here bond trading is very different from equities trading there are conditions specified in the offer document on when an issuer can recall jack up the price of an oversold bond even government bonds have them   the actions of the government has a bigger ripple effect as compared to a firm the government can start buying back bonds to increase it 's price but it will inflation because of the increase in the supply of money in the market which may or may n't be desirable then again people holding the bond would have to incentivized to sell the bond even during the greek fiasco the greek government was n't buying greek bonds as it had no capital to buy printing more euros was n't an option as no assets to back the newly printed money and the ecb would have stopped them from being accepted   and generally buying back is n't useful because they have to return the might run into billions invested in long term projects by the government and can not be liquidated immediately while servicing a bond is cheaper and investing the proceeds from the bond sale is more useful while being invested in long term projects the government can just roll over the bonds with a new issue and refrain from returning the capital till it is in a position to do so

  so your question is how confident are people that fb stock will close above a certain price at a certain time   a call option contract allows you to buy shares in the future at a certain price   fb calls are available for march of 2013   the number in the strike column is the price you can buy fb stock at on the given date let 's take the strike   this allows you to buy fb shares at $ 33 each next march   if at that time it turns out they 're worth $ 50 each you can buy them at $ 33 then immediately sell them on the open market for $ 50 making money   the person selling you the option knows that there 's a chance the price will be above $ 33 in march so he 's going to charge you a few bucks to cover that possibility   in this case he 's charging you $ as of me writing this   so you can have the option to buy fb shares at $ 33 each for $   this means the guy selling you the option is reasonably confident that in march fb stock will be at or under $ otherwise he 'd lose money when you exercised the option     therefore $ is the option market 's best guess as to the highest fb stock will be going for in march

$ 15 $ 5 = $ 10 how did you possibly buy a put for less than the intrinsic value of the option at $ so we can infer that you would have had to get this put when the stock price was at least $ but given the 3 months of theta left it was likely above $ 7 the value of the put if the price of the underlying asset the stock abc between $ 5 $ 7 would be somewhere between $ 10 $ 8 at expiration so you do n't really stand to lose much in this scenario and can make a decent gain in this scenario i mean decent if you were trading stocks and were trying to beat the s&p or keep up with warren buffett but a pretty poor gain since you are trading options if the stock moves above $ 7 this is where the put starts to substantially lose value

the vanilla advice is investing your age in bonds and the rest in stocks index funds of course so if you 're 25 have 75 in stock index fund and 25 in bond index of course your 401k is tax sheltered so you want keep bonds there assuming you have taxable investments when comparing specific funds you need to pay attention to expense ratios for example vanguard 's sp 500 index has an expense ratio of .17 many mutual funds charge around 1.5 that means every year 1.5 of the fund total goes to the fund and that is regardless of up or down market since you 're young i would start studying up on personal finance as much as possible everyone has their favorite books and websites for sane no nonsense investment advise i would start at bogleheads.org i also recommend two books   this is assuming you want to set up a strategy and not fuss with it daily weekly monthly the problem with so many financial strategies is they 1 do n't work i.e. try to time the market or 2 are so overly complex the gains are not worth the effort i 've gotten a lot of help at the boglehead forums in terms of asset allocation and investment strategy good luck

savings accounts have lower fees if you do n't anticipate doing many transactions per month e.g. three or fewer withdrawals then i would suggest a savings account rather than a checking account a joint account that requires both account holder signatures to make withdrawals will probably require both account holders signature endorsements in order to make deposits for example if you are issued a tax refund by the u.s. treasury or any check that is payable to both parties you will only be able to deposit that check in a joint account that has both persons as there can be complications due to multi party account ownership if cashing versus depositing a joint check and account tax id number when you open the account you will need to specify what your wishes are regarding whether both parties or either party can make deposits and withdrawals also at least one party will need to be present with appropriate identification probably tax id or social security number when opening the account   if the account has three or more owners you might be required to open a business or commercial account rather than a consumer account this would be due to the extra expense of administering an account with more than two after the questioner specified interest north carolina in the comments i found that the north carolina general banking statutes have specific rules for joint accounts any two or more persons may establish a deposit account    the deposit account and any balance shall be as joint tenants    unless the persons establishing the account have agreed with the bank    that withdrawals require more than one signature payment by the bank    to or on the order of either person on the account the bank 's obligation i looked for different banks in north carolina i found joint account terms similar to this in pdf file format everywhere joint account if an item is drawn so that it is unclear whether one payee ’s    endorsement or two is required only one endorsement will be     required and the bank shall not be liable for any loss incurred by the    maker as a result of there being only one endorsement also   joint accounts are owned by you individually or jointly with others    all of the funds in a joint account may be used to repay the debts of    any co owner whether they are owed individually by a co owner    jointly with other co owners or jointly with other persons or    entities having no interest in your account you will need to tell the bank specifically what permissions you want for your joint account as it is between you and your bank in north carolina

you have a high risk tolerance then learn about exchange traded options and futures or the variety of markets that governments have decided that people without high income are too stupid to invest in not even kidding it appears that a lot of this discussion about your risk profile and investing has centered around stocks and bonds the similarities being that they are assets issued by collections of humans corporations with risk profiles based on the collective decisions of those humans that does n't even scratch the surface of the different kinds of asset classes to invest in bonds boring bond futures happening over there also there are potentially very favorable tax treatments for other asset classes for instance you mentioned your desire to hold an investment for over a year for tax reasons well every futures trade gets that kind of tax treatment partially whether you hold it for one day or more see the 60/40 rule a rebuttal being that some of these asset classes should be left to professionals stocks are no different in that regards either educate yourself or stick with the managed 401k funds

here 's another answer on the topic saving for retirement how much is enough an angle on it this question made me think of a good approach here is to focus on savings rate which you can control rather than the final number which you ca n't plus it will fluctuate with the markets and make you nervous for example focus on saving at least 10 of your income annually 15 is much safer   if you focus on the final number the way it works in the real world is that you save as much as you can but there are lots of random factors and unknowns some people end up having to work a lot longer than they hoped to others end up able to retire early others retire on time but have to spend less than they hoped but the one thing you can often control as long as you have an income and no catastrophes anyway is that you spend less than you make

before you invest in a house make sure you account for all the returns risks and costs and compare them to returns risks and costs of other investments if you invest 20 of a house 's value in another investment you would also expect a return you also probably will not have the cost interest for the balance 80 of i have heard people say if i have a rental property i 'm just throwing away money i 'll have nothing at the end if you get an interest only loan the same will apply if you pay off your mortgage you 're paying a lot more you could save invest the extra and then you will have something at the end + interest if you want to compare renting and owning count the interest against the rental incoming against lost revenue for however much actual money you 've invested so far + interest   i 've done the sums here renting vs. owning which is slightly different e.g. my house will never be empty i pay extra if i want a different house location not counting for the up front costs real estate mortgage establishment etc and not accounting for house price fluctuations i get about the same return on buying as investing at the bank houses do of course fluctuate both up and down risk usually up in the long term on the other hand many people do lose out big time some friends of mine invested when the market was high everyone was investing in houses they paid off as much as they could then the price dropped and they panicked and sold for even less than they bought for the same applies if in your example house prices drop too much so you owe more than the house is worth the bank may force you to sell or offer your own house as collateral do n't forget about the hidden costs lawn mowing and snow shoveling were mentioned insurance maintenance etc and risks like fluctuating rental prices bad tenants tenants moving on loss of incoming cleaning expenses up the place etc

be very careful about buying property because it has been going up quickly in recent years   there are some fundamental factors that limit the amount real estate can appreciate over time   in a nutshell the general real estate market growth is supported by the entry level property market   that is when values are appreciating people can sell and use the capital gains to buy more valuable property   this drives up the prices in higher value properties whose owners can use that to purchase more expensive properties and so on and so forth at some point in a rising market the entry level properties start to become hard for entry level buyers to afford   the machine of rising prices throughout the market starts grinding to a halt   this price level can be calculated by looking at average incomes in an area   at some percentage of income people can not buy into the market without crazy loans and if those become popular watch out because things can get really ugly   if you want an example just look back to the us in 2007 2009 and the nearly apocalyptic financial crisis that as with most investing you want to buy low and sell high   buying into a hot market is generally not very profitable   buying when the market is abnormally low tends to be a more effective strategy

a re financing or re fi is when a debtor takes out a new loan for the express purpose of paying off an old one this can be done for several reasons usually the primary reason is that the terms of the new loan will result in a lower monthly payment debt consolidation taking out one big loan at a relatively low interest rate to pay off the smaller higher interest loans that rack up like credit card debt medical bills etc is a form of refinancing but you most commonly hear the term when referring to refinancing a home mortgage as in your example to answer your questions most of the money comes from a new bank that bank understands up front that this is a re fi and not new debt the homeowner is n't asking for any additional money but instead the money they get will pay off outstanding debt therefore the net amount of outstanding debt remains roughly equal even then a re fi can be difficult for a homeowner to get at least on terms he 'd be willing to take first off if the homeowner owes more than the home 's worth a re fi may not cover the full principal of the existing loan the bank may reject the homeowner outright as not creditworthy a new house is a huge ding on your credit score trust me or the market and the homeowner 's credit may prevent the bank offering loan terms that are worth it to the homeowner the homeowner must often pony up cash up front for the closing costs of this new mortgage which is money the homeowner hopes to recoup in reduced interest however the homeowner may not recover all the closing costs for many years or ever to answer the question of why a bank would do this there are several reasons the bank offering the re fi is usually not the bank getting payments for the current mortgage this new bank wants to take your business away from your current bank and receive the substantial amount of interest involved over the remaining life of the loan if you 've ever seen a mortgage summary statement the interest paid over the life of a 30-year loan can easily equal the principal and often it 's more like twice or three times the original amount borrowed that 's attractive to rival banks   it 's in your current bank 's best interest to try to keep your business if they know you are shopping for a re fi even if that means offering you better terms on your existing loan often the bank is itself on the hook to its own investors for the money they lent you and if you pay off early without any penalty they no longer have your interest payments to cover their own and they usually ca n't pay off early bonds which are shares of corporate debt do n't really work that way the better option is to keep those scheduled payments coming to them even if they lose a little off the top often if a homeowner is working with their current bank for a lower payment no new loan is created but the terms of the current loan are this is called a loan modification especially when the government is requiring the bank to sit down at the bargaining table or in some cases a streamlining if the bank and borrower are meeting in more circumstances without the government forcing either one to be there historically the idea of giving a homeowner a break on their contractual obligations would be comical to the bank in recent times though the threat of foreclosure the bank 's primary weapon does n't have the same teeth it used to someone facing 30 years of budget busting payments on a house that will never again be worth what he paid for it would look at foreclosure and even bankruptcy as the better option as it 's theoretically all over and done with in only 7 10 years with the government having a vested interest in keeping people in their homes making whatever payments they can to keep some measure of confidence in the entire financial system loan modifications have become much more common and the banks are usually as they 've found very quickly that they 're not getting anywhere near the purchase price for these toxic assets sometimes a re fi actually results in a higher apr but it 's still a better deal for the homeowner because the loan does n't have other associated costs lumped in such as mortgage insurance money the guarantor wants in return for underwriting the loan which is in turn required by the fdic to protect the bank in case you default the homeowner pays less the bank gets more everyone 's happy including the guarantor they do n't really want to be underwriting a loan that requires pmi in the first place as it 's a significant risk the u.s. government is spending a lot of money and putting a lot of pressure on fdic insured institutions including virtually all mortgage lenders to cut the average joe a break banks get tax breaks when they do loan modifications the fed 's buying at risk bond packages backed by distressed mortgages and where the homeowner has n't walked away completely they 're negotiating mortgage mods directly all of this can result in the homeowner facing a lienholder that is willing to work with them if they 've held up their end of the contract to date

at 50 years old and a dozen years or so from retirement i am close to 100 in equities in my retirement accounts   most financial planners would say this is way too risky which sort of addresses your question   i seek high return rather than protection of principal   if i was you at 22 i would mainly look at high returns rather than protection of principal the short answer is that even if your investments drop by half you have plenty of time to recover   but onto the long answer you sort of have to imagine yourself close to retirement age and what that would look like   if you are contributing at 22 i would say that it is likely that you end up with 3 million in today 's dollars   will you have low or high monthly   expenses   will you have other sources of income such as rental properties    let 's say you rental income that comes close to covering your monthly expenses but is short about 12 k per year   you have a couple of options so in the end let 's say you are ready to retire with about 60 k in cash above your emergency fund   you have the ability to live off that cash for 5 years   you can replenish that fund from equity investments at opportune times   its also likely you equity investments will grow a lot more than your expenses and any emergencies   there really is no need to have a significant amount out of equities   in the case cited real estate serves as your cash investment now one can fret and say how will i know i have all of that when i am ready to retire   the answer is simple structure your life now so it looks that way in the future   you are off to a good start   right now your job is to build your investments in your 401 k which you are doing and get good at budgeting   the rest will follow   after that your next step is to buy your first home good work on looking to plan for your future

whole life is life insurance that lasts your whole life   seriously since the insurance company must make a profit and since they know they will always pay out on a whole life policy whole life tends to be very expensive and has lower death benefits than a term policy some of these policies are paid up policies meaning that they are structured so that you do n't have to pay premiums forever   but what it amounts to is that the insurance company invests your premiums and then pays you a smaller dividend much like banks do with savings accounts unless you are especially risk averse it is almost always a better decision to get an inexpensive term policy and invest the money you save yourself rather than letting the insurance company invest it for you and reap most of the benefits if you are doing things properly you wo n't need life insurance your whole life as retirement investments will eventually replace your working income

i do n't see how this concept takes off first and foremost is not a bank but a tech company as one leaves industry regulation and treasury management the core of banking to outside parties   call me old fashioned but i prefer to have as few stops between me and my money as possible if not for a fear of losing it in a robbery and inability to earn interest i 'd shove it under a mattress so why would i want to bank with an intermediary who does n't understand how the process works how is that looking out for my interests and how is your security better than other institutions that offer encryption and multiple security questions to test a customer 's identity   i 'd like to add that not charging overdraft fees and providing lines of credit to help customers out in the event they spend more than they have is nice in concept but what happens when those same customers do not make deposits to cover their shortfalls when it comes to money people will take advantage of any opportunities they have to circumvent the system especially if funds are tight

it is true that operation profit comes from gross profit however it is possible for a company to have negative net profit yet have cash flow it has to do with the accounting practice a possible example is that a company has extremely high depreciation expense of fixed asset hence net profit will be negative but cash flow will be positive assuming the fixed asset has been fully paid for in earlier years

i do n't think you 've mentioned which state you 're in here in ontario a person who is financially incapable can have their financial responsibility and authority removed and assigned to a trustee the trustee might be a responsible next of kin as her ex you would appear unsuitable that being a potential conflict of interest otherwise it can be the public guardian and trustee it that happens then the trustee handles the money and handles makes any contracts on behalf of in the name of the incapable person the incapable person might have income e.g. spousal support payments and money e.g. bank accounts which the trustee can document in order to demonstrate credit worthiness or at least solvency for the time being the kids see it as an adventure but i suspect it will get old very fast i hope you have a counsellor to talk with about your personal relationships i 've had or tried several and at least one has been extraordinarily helpful you 're not actually expressing a worry about the children being abused or neglected is your motive for asking that you want her to have a place so that the children will like it being there better as long as your kids see it as an adventure perhaps you can be happy for them perhaps i do n't know depending on the people too it 's a good or at least a better thing that they are visiting with friends and relatives and a better topic with those people might be how they show your children a good time instead of your ex 's money one possible way i thought of co signing is if a portion of child spousal support goes directly to the landlord i asked the child support services who deduct money from my paycheck monthly to pay support to my ex and they told me that they are not authorized to do this perhaps i do n't know there is some way to do that if you have your ex 's cooperation and a lawyer and perhaps a judge you have n't said what portions of your payments are for child support versus spousal support nor who has custody etc if a large part of the support is for the children then perhaps the children can rent the place idea note that in ontario there are two decisions to make 1 financial and 2 personal care which includes housing and medical someone can retain their own self care authority even if they 're judged financially incapable or vice versa if there 's a personal care or medical decision which they can not understand the technical language is mentally incapable of managing property this term applies to a person who is unable to understand information that is relevant to     making a decision or is unable to appreciate the reasonably foreseeable consequences of a     decision or lack of decision about his or her property processes for certifying an     individual as being mentally incapable of managing property are prescribed in the substitute decisions act and in the mental health act the mental heath act is for medical emergencies only but ontario has a substitute decisions act as well an intent of the law is to protect vulnerable people people may also acquire and/or name their own trustee and/or guardian voluntarily via a power of attorney a living will etc i do n't know how about offering the landlord a year 's rent in advance or in trust i guess that 1 a court order can determine override guarantee the way in which the child support payments are directed 2 it 's easier to get that order agreement if you and your ex cooperate 3 there are housing specialists in your neighborhood they can buy housing instead of renting it or be given gifted housing to live in

this question has been absolutely to me   it has a few heated debates amongst fellow colleagues and friends my laymen understanding has provided me with what i believe to be a simple answer to the originator 's question   i 'm trying to use common sense here so be gentle fico scores while very complex and mysterious are calculated from data derived from things like length of credit history utilization types of credit payment history etc only a select few know the actual algorithms closely guarded secrets   are these really secrets i do n't know but it 's the word on the street so i 'm going with it creditors report data to these agencies on certain weekly monthly or annually   these dates may be by simply calling the respective creditor and asking   making sure that revolving credit accounts are paid in full during the creditors data dump may or may not have a positive impact on ones fico score a zero balance reported every time on a certain account may appear to be inactive depending on how the algorithm has been written and vice versa utilization and payment history may outweigh the negativity that a constantly zero balance could imply oh lord did that last sentence just come out of my head i reread it four times just make sure it makes sense my personal experience with revolving credit and fico i was professionally advised to without any other life changing credit just using the credit card in this my fico score increased by 44 points   i did end up paying a little in interest but it was well worth it top tier feels great in conclusion i would say that the answer to this question is not cut and dry as so many would imply

your question is expressed as a run on sentence which i 'm having trouble parsing maybe you could restate   i 'm just pointing out the stupidity of the statist that the debt is not a problem because we owe it to ourselves like to think we 're all in this together but that 's not reality some people are taking from others by force of law   the debt is owed to banks and they want to keep this system going would n't you like to have a legal monopoly on the supply of currency institutions which are funded by loose credit government academia military contractors crony corporations likewise benefit from this system   those who invest in us dollars and those who are from the central planning are the losers in this scheme    but there is more debt than currency so it ca n't ever be repaid so that is a moot point it ca n't even hypothetically be considered    there are however a number of other ways that this system could unwind when it inevitably does the banks could be left to fail and their assets would be bid on by others through the bankruptcy process or the fed could keep issuing currency to keep the banks solvent eventually inflating the whole system into irrelevance

as mentioned in the comments there are costs associated with owning living in an apartment first you have to pay maintenance charges on a monthly basis and perhaps also property tax find out the overall outgoings when you live in that apartment add the emi payments to the bank it should not be way higher than your current rent as an advantage you are getting an asset when you buy an apartment rent is a complete loss least financial terms so real estate is in general a good idea over paying rent as for the loan part personal loans are by far the most expensive of loans as they are in general unsecured loans but do check with your bank one way is to try and get a student loan which should be cheaper if you can borrow from family that is the best option you could return the money with perhaps bank fixed deposit rates it is better to pay family interest than bank if none of the options are workable then personal loan is something you need to look at with a clear goal to pay it off as soon as possible and try to take it in stages as an when you require it and if possible avoid taking all the at once

i have traded options but not professionally i had n't come across this terminology but i expect it counts how far in the money as an an option is relative to the distinct strike prices offered for the option series a series being the combination of underlying symbol expiration date and option type call put e.g. all january 2015 xyz calls no matter the strike for instance if stock xyz trades today at $ 11 and the available january 2015 xyz calls have strike prices of $ 6 $ 8 $ 10 $ 12 $ 14 and $ 16 then i would expect the $ 10 call could be called one strike in the money the $ 8 two strikes in the money etc similarly the $ 12 and $ 14 calls would be one and two strikes out of the money respectively however if tomorrow xyz moves to $ 13 then the $ 10 previously known as one strike in the money would now be two strikes in the money and the $ 12 would be the new one strike in the money perhaps this terminology arose because many option strategies frequently involve using options that are or near the money so the one strike in or out of the money contracts would tend to be those employed frequently perhaps it makes it easier for people to describe strategies in a more general sense without citing specific examples however the software developer in me dislikes it given that the measurement is relative to both the current underlying price which changes quickly and the strike prices available in the given option series hence i would n't use this terminology myself and i suggest you eschew it too in favor of something concrete e.g. specify your contract strikes in dollar terms especially when it matters

this is more of a legal question than a monetary one you can try to negotiate with the debt owner as pete b. suggests alternatively you can ignore them and see what happens they might sue you for the 400 plus costs or maybe not that is a pretty small amount for a lawyer to show up in a court of law if you go to court you can win by that you returned the box and the charge is invalid if you testify in court that you did not return the box then you will lose sometimes a debt collector will just file a credit complaint against you and you would have to go to court to get that complaint removed from your record with the credit agency the loan owner has no idea whether you returned the box at all all they have is a debt security which simply says who owes the money and how much it is in a court room they have zero evidence against you unless you said something to them and they wrote it down or recorded it

cap gains and qualified dividend taxes are the same see link below   first let 's assume were talking about a taxable account in a tax deferred exempt account taxes do n't really matter capital gains taxes are only realized at the end sale so share buybacks will not have any adverse until the gains are realized which in theory should be as far out as possible whereas dividends are taxed in the year they are received because of the compounding the buybacks are better than the dividends which pay tax up front versus on the back end with buybacks yes investors are irrational but i 'm trying to take the long term rational approach additionally dividends are taxed at cap gains rates if the position is held 60 + days so all else held equal share buybacks are more tax efficient in the long run

sure stocks do n't pay interest i just looked up the word compound in a couple of and the relevant definition in all of them just mentioned interest and not growth in the value of stock so it may be technically inaccurate to talk about compound growth of a stock i 'll yield to someone more knowledgeable about the technical language of finance to answer that part but regardless of whether the word strictly applies the concept certainly does suppose you put $ 1000 into a mutual fund and the fund grows by 10 you now have $ 1100 the next year the fund grows by 15 so you gain 15 of what of your original $ 1000 no of your present balance $ 1100 the effect is the same as compound interest there is the fundamental difference that interest is normally a fixed rate you get such and such percent a year as spelled out in a contract but change in the value of a stock depends on many factors none of them guaranteed

lets consider what would happen if you invested $ plus $ 10k down in a property or did the same in a low cost index fund over the 30 year term that most mortgages take   the returns of either scenarios can not be guaranteed but there are long term analyses that shows the stock market can be expected to return about 7 compounded yearly this does n't mean each year will return 7 some years will be negative and some will be much higher but that over a long span the average will reach 7   using a time value of money calculator that down payment monthly additions of $ 1,500 and a 7 annual return would be worth about $ 1.8 m in 30 years if 1.8 m were invested you could safely withdraw $ for the rest of your life do consider of inflation makes this less than today 's dollar   there are long term analyses that show real estate more or less keeps track with inflation at 2 4 annual returns this does n't consider real estate taxes maintenance insurance and the very individual and localized issues with your market and your particular house is land limited where you are increasing your price will new development drive down your price   in 30 years you 'll own the house outright you 'll still need to pay property tax and insurance on it and you 'll be getting rental income over those 30 years you can expect to replace a roof 2 3 hot water heaters concrete work several trees decades of snow shoveling mowing grass and weeding your hvac system windows and doors and probably a kitchen and bathroom you will have paid about 1.5x the initial price of the mortgage in interest along the way   so you 'll have whatever the rental price for your house monthly probably almost impossible to predict for a single family home plus the market price of your house again very difficult to predict but could safely say it keeps pace with inflation minus your expenses   there are scenarios where you could beat the stock market there are ways to reduce the lifestyle burden of being a landlord   along the way should you want to purchase a house for yourself to live in you 'll have to prove the rental income is steady to qualify for a loan having equity in a mortgage gives you something to borrow against in a heloc of course you could easily end up owing more than your house is worth in that situation   personally i 'd stick to investing that money in low fee index funds

as weird as it seems 5 years is not a long term investment   furthermore investing is about accepting risk   based on your criteria for the alternative to a down payment i think your only choice is to make the larger down payment if however you were willing to invest that money for the long term in a retirement account or an educational account for example then i would definitely encourage you to invest   i think the chance that a long term investment in a diversified investment account will exceed 3.25 is pretty high   however that is only my opinion and i am not so your let your personal tolerance to risk be your guide but again based on the way you asked it down payment all the way   your time frame means you are not an investor   therefore your only option for risk free storage of money is an fdic insured account which might pay a little less than 1 for the next 5 years   a bigger down payment will have a 3.25 return in this case in that order   4 and 5 could be swapped if the interest rate on the loans is really low

the obvious answer for savings costs with a car is not to have a car    of course that must be balanced against other expenses bicycle taxi public transport to do things generally speaking if you need a car ways to contain expense are to buy the least expensive vehicle with the most economical engine that meets your needs keep it reduces damage or wear due to exposure proactively maintain it maintenance is cheaper in the long run than the costs of dealing with a breakdown and cost of repairs and lack of maintenance accelerates depreciation and shop around for a good mechanic who will maintain it at a fair price if you do a lot of milage or do a lot of towing or drive under load consider a diesel   a diesel engine often costs more each service sometimes has a shorter service interval but it also gets greater milage    there may be a differential cost of fuel diesel is often a bit more expensive per volume    for towing a diesel is often more economical due to low end power greater torque at lower which does result in better fuel economy    it is no accident that most large transport vehicles consume diesel    do the sums based on your usage before you buy accelerate as gently as possible to get to speed within traffic conditions less fuel to get to a speed    change up to higher gears as soon as possible as at a given speed economy will be better as long as the engine has enough to handle it so do n't try to start from stationary in a high gear    do n't drive faster than necessary as drag increases with speed and hurts economy    similarly reduce speed gradually to reduce undue wear on breaks and reduce fuel consumption sharp breaking with power assisted breaks does affect fuel economy drive close to legal limits if conditions permit    this reduces chances of annoying other drivers who if they get impatient may throw rocks at your car or or subject you to road rage which contribute to damage and insurance costs    it also reduces chances of being pulled over by police and fined for obstructing other traffic do n't    this both consumes fuel in keeping up and means needing to slow sharply    and increases chance of accident do n't idle more than necessary   allow stop start systems on your car to operate particularly if you 're in stop start traffic    however there is a break even point where stopping and consumes more fuel than so get to know your vehicle    that depends on how much the engine needs to restart which is affected both by engine design and maintenance    maintain it yourself if you have the skills but account for the cost of parts and equipment to be sure it is cost effective   modern cars are software driven so equipment to diagnose and maintain can be expensive combine trips do n't get into the car for every little thing wait until you can do a few things during a single drive and car pool if fuel prices vary e.g some places have regular cycles try to refuel near the bottom of a pricing cycle take unnecessary weight out of the vehicle    do n't load it up with tools unless you need them frequently

they 're not most of human history has been dominated by these societies think feudalism with a few nobility on top and a massive surf class below them    but the differences in lifestyle were not as extreme as you or others would make them out to be   in feudal times everyone still froze their relative asses off in winter   and the lords of the manor were only hurting themselves and eventually killing themselves if they attempted to starve their population of   besides when the population demographics inverted after the plague and happening in the next few decades w/o a plague the tables got turned   gt;the middle class and our current income distribution is a huge historical anomaly   but mainly due to tapping a dense supply of energy and even more due to the huge advances of technology and productivity   the luddite attitude actually serves the people on the top in maintaining an establishment status quo tech tends to serve the people on the bottom   the so called poor today provided they act and live in a financially responsible manner live a far better life now than in 1970 just as the poor in 1970 lived a much better life than those of 1930 or 1890 1850 etc   i really could n't care less whether warren buffet craps on a gold plated toilet seat   or if sergei brin has a custom built yacht with a neither of those make me any less wealthy in real terms

there is no need to get an auto loan just to try and affect your credit score it is possible to have a score over 800 without any sort of auto loan if you can afford to pay for the vehicle up front that is the better option even with special financing incentives it is better to pay up front if you can yes it is possible to use the funds to make more if you finance with a silly low interest rate however it 's also possible to lose a job or have some other financial disaster happen and need that money for something else making it more difficult to make the payment   it may be just me but i find the peace of mind not having the payment to be worth a lot

would it be worth his business or is it too late at this point to be blunt you 're asking if we recommend that he stop breaking the law the answer is obviously yes he should be declaring his income and it would probably benefit him to get on the same page as his employer or client so they can both start obeying the law together once he 's filed a tax return for 2016 that would certainly help his cause as far as a lender is concerned and   as soon as he can provide some recent pay stubs or paid invoices he should be ready to move forward on the mortgage based on that additional income

i 'm trying to understand how an etf manager optimized it 's own revenue   here 's an example that i 'm trying to figure out   etf firm has an agreement with gs for blocks of ibm they have agreed on daily vwap + 1 for execution price   further there is a commission schedule for 5 mils with gs come month end etf firm has to do a monthly rebalance as such must buy 100,000 shares at ibm which goes for about $ 100 the commission for the trade is 100,000 5 mils = $ 500 in commission for that trade i assume all of this is covered in the expense ratio such that if vwap for the day was 100 then each share got executed to the etf at 101 1 + 5 mils per share = for a resultant cost basis   the etf then turns around and takes out let 's say 1 as the expense ratio $ per share   i think everything so far is pretty straight forward let me know if i missed something to this point   now this is what i 'm trying to get my head around etf firm has a revenue sharing agreement as well as other relations with gs one of which is 50 back on commissions as soft dollars on top of that gs has a program where if you do a set amount of vwap + trades you are eligible for their corporate well being programs and other sponsorship of etf 's interests including   helping to pay for marketing rent computers etc   does that happen do these disclosures exist somewhere

first you will need a plan stating three main points you will have to decide what criteria you will use to answer these points you might use fundamental analysis to find what to buy and technical analysis to decide when to buy and when to sell your buy and sell triggers once you have a trading plan in place you would need to find a broker with conditional orders you can place conditional buy orders to get in a trade for example if the price moves above or below a target price you can place conditional stop loss orders if your trade goes against you and you can also place conditional profit target stops to automatically get out if rises to your desired profit target you can place one two or many conditional orders after hours which will enable you to trade without being in front of your screen all day long

an investment portfolio is typically divided into three components all three of those can be accessed through mutual funds or etfs a 401(k will probably have a small set of mutual funds for you to pick from mutual funds may charge you silly expenses if you pick a bad one look at the prospectus for the expense ratio if it 's over 1 you 're definitely paying too much if it 's over 0.5 you 're probably paying too much if it 's less than 0.1 you have a really good deal us stocks are generally the core holding until you move into retirement or get close to spending the money on something else if it 's not invested for retirement international stocks are riskier than us stocks but provide opportunity for diversification and better returns than the us stocks bonds or fixed income investments are generally very safe but have limited opportunities for returns they tend to do better when stocks are doing poorly when you 've got a while to invest you should be looking at riskier investments when you do n't you should be looking for safer investments a quick and rough rule of thumb is that your age should match the portion of your portfolio in bonds so if you 're 50 years old and approaching retirement in 15 years or so you should have about 50 in bonds roughly   people whose employment and future income is particularly tied to one sector of the market would also do well to avoid investing there because they already are at risk if it performs badly for instance if you work in the technology sector loading up on tech stocks is extra risky if there 's a big bust you 're not just out of a job your portfolio is dead as well more exotic options are available to diversify a portfolio while many portfolios could benefit from these sorts of holdings they come with their own advantages and disadvantages and should be researched carefully before taking a significant stake in them

most people advocate a passively managed low fee mutual fund that simply aims to track a given benchmark say s&p 500 few funds can beat the s&p consistently so investors are often better served finding a no load passive fund first thing i would do is ask your benefits rep why you do n't have an option to invest in a fidelity passive index fund like spartan 500 ideally young people would be heavy in equities and slowly divest for less risky stuff as retirement comes closer and rebalance the portfolio regularly when market swings put you off risk targets few people know how to do this and actually do so so there are mutual funds that do it for you for a fee these in are called lifecycle funds the freedom funds here   i hesitate to recommend them because they 're still fairly new if you take a look at underlying assets these things generally just reinvest in the broker 's other funds which themselves have expenses fees and there 's all kinds personal situations that might lead to you place a portion with a different investment

the gold standard did n't work because of the following process   start with 10 oz of gold deposit in bank a bank lends out 9 oz of gold certificates gold certificates deposited in bank b bank b lends out 8 oz of gold certificates etc   now at the end of all this we have a lot of gold certificates   this is called the money wiki effect   what if someone wants to take their gold certificates and buy a boat made in europe   well   if they spend 5 gold certificates on that boat then the certificates land in the european bank who requests gold to be shipped from america to pay for it     suddenly america 's bank reserves collapse and there is a very sharp credit contraction as all the banks stop lending because they are out of reserves that back their gold certificates   if the person had actual coins he was using to buy the boat only his consumption would be reduced and it would n't cause damage throughout the whole financial system   so basically wherever you have fractional reserve banking gold backed monetary systems will fail   anywhere you criticize fractional reserve banking your theory will be basically ignored because criticizing banking gets you nowhere in economics career wise   praising derivatives and all sorts of hair financial innovations will win you awards and prizes and guest appearances on cnbc though

you seem to have all your financial bases covered and others have given you good financial advice so i will try to give you some non financial ideas the first and most important thing is that you are investing with a long time friend so the dynamics are a lot different that if you had recently met a stranger with an interesting new idea the first thing you need to ask yourself is if your friendship will survive if this thing does n't go well you 've already said you can afford to lose the money so that 's not a worry but will there be any the flip side is also true if the venture succeeds you should be able to go further with it because he 's your friend you know your friend better back to grade school than almost anyone else so here are some things to ask yourself what does your friend have that will give him a chance to succeed tech savvy a winning personality a huge general business savvy something else if your guardian angel had told you that one of your friends was planning to on an internet advertising venture is this the one you would have guessed conversely knowing that your friend was planning to do a start up is this the kind of venture you would have guessed how does internet and advertising fit in with what you are doing if this venture succeeds could it be used to help your professional development and career maybe as a supplier or customer can you see yourself leaving your current job and joining your friend 's now established company as a vice president or acting as a member of its board of directors the latter perhaps while pursuing your current career path   are your other mutual friends investing are some of them more tech savvy than you and better able to judge the company 's prospects of success to a certain extent there is safety in numbers and even if there is n't misery loves company on the upside would you feel left out if everyone in your crowd caught the next microsoft except you

it all depends on your loan contract and the way most are written the 10 day thing will not help   however assuming that the contract is written in such a way to allow this the difference will be negligible by saving money i assume you mean the amount of interest paid    there is really two ways of doing this   if you carry the loan to term paying the indicated amount on the due date you will pay $ in interest   an increase of over 33 to the cost of the car   yikes that is a lot of money    you should seek to minimize your interest expense    one way to do this is to reduce your rate   applying for a new loan that is at a more reasonable 6 and continuing to pay the per month will reduce the term to 59 months and only cost you $ in interest   a large savings    even better is to work a second job and earn an extra 1,000 per month   then bundle it with your payment and shoot that at the loan   this way you will only pay $ in interest and have it paid off in a year   once you do that you can stick $ 300/month or so in a savings account or other investment and pay for every other car in cash   making choices like these leads to building wealth   so the question becomes do you want to spend the rest of your life on the wheel of car payments or do you want to spend one year in pain so you make smart choices in the future   the choice is yours

i work in banking for the private bank division for a major bank as a banker i have been helping clients with these types of transactions for years i believe that large transactions like this are best left to the big boys that is where the talented bankers loan officers underwriters are and that is the type of transaction they specialize in i know for a fact that your credit union will not be able to suit your needs and a smaller bank will be tough to deal with i would n't worry at all about the credit pulls as much as picking a rock solid bank with lots of experiences doing these kinds of deals that is my 2 cents albeit a little bit biased but it is also coming from experience history with the bank definitely matters but what business you can bring to the bank along with the lending deposits 401k management personal investments business services etc matter just as much and can make or break the approval decline or even the terms being favorable or not favorable to your company

typically the least formal agreement for any type of lending is a note of which you can find plenty across the web although i 'd suggest picking up a nolo book from the library and using their templates i think the book holding your type of form would be the personal legal forms book still $ 10k is a very large amount of money to lend to a friend and he probably is better off going to a bank and asking for an unsecured line of credit not a credit card but rather a general loan and doing the money that way because typically that amount of money is small to the bank and they will already have the licenses assets in place to handle collateral and such which can be very tricky to do on your own

short term the game is supply demand and how the various participants react to it at various prices on longer term prices start to better reflect the fundamentals within something like week to some month or two if there has not been any unique value affecting news then interest options market swing traders and such play bigger part with intraday the effects of available liquidity become very pronounced the market makers have algos that try to guess what type of client they have and they prefer to give high price to large buyer and low price to small buyer as intraday trader has spreads and commissions big part of their expenses and leverage magnifies those instead of being able to take advantage of the lower prices they prefer to stop out after small move against them in practise this means that when they buy low that low will soon be the midpoint of the day and high etc if they are still holding on buy and sell are similar to long call or long put options position and options are like insurance they cost you also the longer the position is held the more likely it is to end up with someone with ability to test your margin if you 're highly leveraged and constantly making your wins from the same source   risk management is also issue the leveraged pros trade through a company not sure if they 're able to open another such company and still open accounts after the inevitable

the last column in the source data is volume the number of stocks that was exchanged during the day and it also has a value of zero for that day meaning that nobody bought or sold the stocks on that day and since the prices are prices of transactions the first and the last one on a particular day and the ones with the highest lowest price the prices can not be established and are irrelevant as there was not a single transaction on that day only the close price is assumed equal to its previous day counterpart because this is the most important value serving as a basis to determine the daily price change and we assume no change in this case continuous line charts also use this single value bar and candle charts usually display a blank space for a day where no trade occurred

actually asking to be refinanced at a lower rate is asking them to forgive give up part of the mortgage    either my knowledge of finance is wrong or how interest rates work is wrong if that statement is true    here is why your statement is not true   the interest rate is money the bank makes on the loan    for example say you buy a home valued at $ 250,000 put 10 down and your interest rate is 5 for 30 years    well now you 've got a mortgage $ 225,000 that you pay $ monthly now expand this out to 30 years which means you 'll make 360 payments for a total balance of $ so even though you have a mortgage of $ 225,000 and your home is only valued at $ 250,000 due to the interest rate on that loan you will   be giving the bank $ in profit for that $ 225,000 loan    refinancing the loan at a lower rate is not debt forgiveness or a write off    greed in getting themselves into upside down mortgages are why we have problems not the banks not helping them out enough   actually it 's the bank 's greed which is wanting to keep the homeowner at the higher interest rate because it will make them more money over the long run if the bank was to reduce the interest rate on the loan they would be reducing their potential profits    and now you know why i support non profit banks

the two biggest issues that impact your question i would say are diversification and fees if you have $ 10,000 to invest and only invest it in two securities then a 20 drop in one security can have you lose 10 of your initial investment which i would consider a very high risk scenario if you have $ 10,000 to invest and invest it in 20 securities then a 20 drop in one security would only cause you to lose 1 of your initial investment so far this is looking better from a diversification point of view but then the issue of fees comes in if you paid $ 10 per trade to buy those 20 securities you already spent 2 of your initial investment in fees not to mention you will pay at least another $ 200 to get out of all those positions no right answer but those are the two factors i always try to balance

i guess i should explain a little in detail since you really do n't seems to understand why sometimes anecdotal are not useful and why sometimes they are    it has nothing to do with economy sub or not but rather logic anecdotal can be useful to refute universal claims theories for example if anyone claims that all are white then all it takes is one anecdotal observation of one black swan is enough to disprove this theory there is no need to bring additional significant evidence in order to prove not all are white in fact this is how lot 's of theories were by contracting observation   a lot of people keep hearing things about anecdotal but never truly understood why they are not significantly important in certain situations thus making the mistake

i agree with the other posters that you will need to seek the advice of a tax attorney specializing in corporate taxation here is an idea to investigate could you sell the company and thereby turn the profits that are taxed as ordinary income into a long term capital gain taxed at 15 plus state income tax if any you can determine the value of a profitable business using discounted cash flow analysis even if you expect that the revenue stream will dry up due to product obsolescence or expiry of licensing agreements   to avoid the capital gains taxes especially if you live in a high tax state like california you could also transfer the stock to a charitable remainder trust the crt then sells the shares to the third party acquirer invests the proceeds and pays you annual distributions similar to an annuity the flip side of a sale is that now the acquiring party will be stuck with the taxes payable on your company 's profits while being forced to amortize the purchase price over multiple years 15 if i recall correctly which will factor into the valuation however it is likely that the acquirer has better ways to mitigate the tax impact e.g. the acquirer is a company currently operating at a loss and therefore can cancel out the tax liabilities from your company 's profits   one final caveat do n't let the tax tail wag the business dog in other words focus your on extracting the maximum value from your company rather than trying to find convoluted tax saving strategies you might find that making an extra dollar in profits is easier than saving fifty cents in taxes

any car manufacturer that undercuts their own dealer network would have that network fall apart quickly   tesla is using a dealer free distribution model from the start so they do n't have that problem   toyota does n't work that way though gm imposed a uniform no haggling policy with their brand but that policy was coupled with local monopolies for dealers to make it work   lexus has also experimented with no haggling and online ordering with delivery still taking place at a dealership   the rest of toyota does n't work that way though some car manufacturers such as bmw and audi allow you to take delivery of your new car at the factory for a discount but even then the transaction still takes place through a dealer   toyota does n't work that way though   for one thing they work at a different scale   if you buy a camry in the us it might be produced in kentucky indiana or depending on business conditions you say that you want to cut out the middleman but the fact is that you do require someone to deliver a toyota to you like it or not if you 're interested in saving money consider trying various well documented tips such as negotiating by e mail before showing up dealerships against each other   if you do n't want to negotiate you might be able to take advantage of pre negotiated dealer prices through costco you mentioned that the dealership offered you a interest rate for your fico score   that sounds insanely high i 'd expect deals more like 2 advertised by   remember toyota motor credit corporation exists to help toyota motor corporation sell more cars cheaply   you can also seek alternate financing online example or through your own bank

if i have a asset a with expected return of 100 and by standard deviation 1 and asset b with expected return of 1 and risk 100 would it be rational to put asset b into the portfolio no because modern portfolio theory would say that if there is another asset b2 with the same or higher return but less risk which you already have in asset a you should invest in that if those are the only two assets you can choose from you would invest completely in asset a. the point of diversification is that so long as two assets are n't perfectly positively correlated meaning that if one moves up the other always moves up then losses in one asset will sometimes be offset by gains in another reducing the overall risk

to answer your question yes it 's often worth it to have investments that produce income do a google search for income vs growth investing and you 'll get a sense for two different approaches to investing in equities in a nutshell growth stocks think netflix etc do n't pay dividends but are poised to appreciate in price more than income stocks think banks utilities etc that tend to have less volatile prices but pay a consistent dividend in the long run decades growth stocks tend to outperform income stocks that 's why younger investors tend to pick growth stocks while those closer to retirement tend to stick with more stable income producing portfolio but there 's nothing wrong with a mixed approach either i agree with pete 's answer too

i do n't agree that the market as a whole is a ponzi scheme but there are some ponzi like aspects to it if you buy high quality stocks like coca cola johnson and johnson at&amp;t verizon kraft wells fargo the vanilla bank not one of the crazy ones ibm berkshire hathaway etc and simply hold onto them for the next 10 20 years you will make money even over the last decade when stocks went nowhere you still came out ahead through the dividend payments it was just at an unsatisfactory rate of return also the market consists of a lot more than just stocks corporate bonds are a big market and i always recommend people to look at bonds if you can not judge whether a company is credit worthy how can you invest in the common stock i 've made a lot more money myself in the bond market than in the stock market   however for many stocks they do look a lot like ponzi schemes this is true in particular with many of the tech stocks cuban was a tech investor so that is probably where his sentiment is coming from you have many of these companies that create great products however they never have positive cash flow because all the money is spent to develop new products as the share price goes up the company issues new shares to fund research stock options to employees to enrich them etc however eventually they run into a string of bad research that do not yield a new product and the share price plunges perhaps the company goes bankrupt so you have a company that developed great products but the shareholders never got a penny in dividends and the final shareholders have paper worth zero   take a look at research in motion for example creating the blackberry has to be one of the biggest successes in tech over the last decade however has the shareholders gotten any richer only if they traded amongst themselves nobody got a dividend what happened to the many billions of dollars they made during the peak popularity years of blackberry it went to executives employees and was squandered on development that did not effectively defend the phone 's dominant market position now the stock price is back down to the pre prime years and if a shareholder held onto it throughout the entire period he would not have received a single penny and this is a profitable enterprise things look even more bizarre when you start looking at the tech companies that have never had a positive earnings quarter and no plans to ever have positive earnings something like pandora comes to mind often management at these more bizarre companies run the company as a toy to play with their own ideas and to issue themselves stock as compensation and of course they sell a lot of the stock to cash in before they delve into the next risky venture they have no intention of ever enriching anybody who holds into the stock in the long run if for some reason they make money they will put it all into their next toy project until one of them fails and wipes everything out   if you invest in a profitable business with reasonable management you will generally come out ahead some businesses get displaced by unpredictable circumstances and they go bankrupt but on average if a company is good at doing something and they pay out the earnings you come out ahead you get in trouble when businesses are good at something and they take all the money they make and put it into doing something they are not good at a business might only provide good cashflow for 10 20 years when the product is popular and before competitors cut into margins if that money is squandered the long term shareholder may ultimately have very terrible results the long term shareholder ends up being the guy who keeps going all in on a to win bet that is what management is doing when they bet the company on the next unproven product but eventually he gets zeroed out on one loss   this is why if you look at buffett 's investments they are all in simple businesses that spits off cash to the owner shareholder businesses like soft drinks snacks rail roads vanilla banking utility like energy companies insurance etc you might be good at judging the odds of whether a business will succeed or not aka make more money than your original investment or not but you do n't want management of that company to make a wildly different bet for you just because they are great at operating a company does n't mean they are good enough at judging odds or disciplined enough to make those bets for you i may have predicted accurately that business x will be a great success but if manage takes those profits and goes all in on business y without giving me a chance to cash out that may have results

hello   first of all i think it 's great you 're asking the community for help   asking for help when you need it is a sign of strength and self awareness of your own limitations which we all have even the smartest business people ask questions in fact they ask the most questions   i 'm wrapping up year 2 of doing what you 're trying to do and am finally seeing real traction i am a bit older than you and started out on my own 7 years after grad school but i have learned a lot and do n't mind sharing   here 's some things you might find useful   never work for free working for equity or working for exposure is working for free   people who offer you this because you 're just starting out are parasites looking to sell your talents but not pay for them   the only thing you can take away from attempts to do this is that your talents are in demand which is good     never sell yourself short would you rather do 10 websites for a $ 1000 each or do 1 website for $ 10000   you 'll be doing a lot of projects in the middle but one very important thing to bear in mind is that one $ 10000 website is a lot less work and may make you the same amount of money or more overall   in the beginning maybe you think you need to build a portfolio but you 'd be surprised how many prospects do n't care what 's in your portfolio and in fact never look at the portfolio which leads me to the most important bit of advice   learn to sell yourself   you are your company 's first and main product   learn to sell yourself as the smart kid future fortune 500 ceo who stays up all night getting things done etc   always aim high in your proposals   you 'd be surprised how many people do n't negotiate at all   that being said always put something in your proposal that is a good idea but it beyond what their asking for   if they ask you to come down in price remove this feature and come down a little bit   develop an ability to read how interested a prospect is in your services before you spring the price on them   at your age i was waiting tables   this helped me to be able to read a customer to determine which waiter they wanted me to be the attentive one the high class one the friend or the quiet   consider taking on a side job to help you develop this skill   as i said above some prospects will sign on the line without negotiating   you might even take two proposals with you into a meeting with a prospect one priced high and one low and present the version that matches their interests   go high if they need something right now   remember you are your company 's first product   this means also that your time is the company 's first commodity    be open to other things   i have a background in mathematics and am most capable as a software developer and a web developer   but i also help other companies sell and support physical products not at all related to technology   because it 's highly profitable i do it   when you 're a one person business selling your time at the highest price is the name of the game   but growing your business will require the help of others   i found it helpful to first network with other like minded people and split project money according to skill level and time commitment on a per project basis   this will allow you to take on bigger projects     but growing the company will eventually require you to hire or contract someone at a far lower pay rate than what you 're bringing in   the laws of supply and demand require you to do this as a business person if you 're to grow the business so that the business has money beyond what you 're being paid this is where the extra money comes from selling the time of others at a higher price than you 're paying them   be conscious of this   everyone you work with is not going to be your friend   make your website awesome   it does n't have to be a work of art but let it reflect the seriousness with which you approach your customers projects   make sure there are no grammatical errors   find a website of someone highly successful who 's doing what you 're doing and emulate it   you do n't have to have a portfolio starting out   your website is your first portfolio item and if it 's awesome prospects will think you 'll do the same for them   good luck   i 'm sure i 'm not the only one here who thinks your early developed entrepreneurship is going to take you far

now technically she is supposed to pay rent but legally i am not sure her name is not there in the rental agreement so she is not eligible to pay the rent since she is already living in the same house there is some basic courtesy to pay the $ 200 now thing here is how are we going to divide it if she is paying $ 200 will that be deducted out of your room mate 's or yours fact of the matter is who is taking more space and who is paying for it since there is no change to your space you should continue paying the same amount because there is no change in your space as you mentioned before moreover the fact that she is paying the utilities is good enough because that is shared by all 3 so keep the arrangement like somewhat like this you pay half the rent + utilities and your friend and his girlfriend will pay their share of the rent which is equal to yours and they will share the utilities too hope this makes sense    thanks

like any share valuing facebook requires a projection of earnings and earnings growth to arrive at a present value for the right to share in these future earnings    there are economic arguments to be had for facebook to see either a negative or positive future long term net income growth given the uncertainty we can establish a very rough baseline value by treating it as a perpetuity zero growth discounted at historical equity growth rate 8 with some very simple math an annual net income of 900 million discounted at 8 percent in perpetuity is worth billion   now take into account the fact that tech stocks trade at an inflated pe multiple of around 3 times that of a mature company in an established industry pe 20 for average stocks and anywhere between 60 + for tech stocks and i would expect the market cap for this perpetuity to be around 34 billion   a market cap of 34 billion is a share value of around 15.5 which is the point where i would take up a long position with fair confidence i do think that the share deserves a premium for potential income growth despite the current and potential future revenue losses simply due to the incredibly large user base and the potential to monetize this of course it was n't worth the 22 dollar premium that ipo buyers paid but its worth something   i think there is simply too much uncertainty for me to go long in the next 6 months unless it hits which may never happen if the company can monetize mobile and show quarterly results in the next year i would consider a long position for anywhere from 15 20 a share

cfds contracts for difference are basically a contract between you and the broker on the difference in price of the underlying between the time you open a position and close a position you are not actually buying the underlying with share cfds the outcome is a bit like buying the underlying shares on margin you pay interest for every day you hold the cfds overnight for long cfds however with short positions you get paid interest for every day you hold your short position overnight most people use cfds for short term trading however they can be used for medium to longer term trading just as you would hold a portfolio on margin what you have to remember is that because you are buying on margin you can lose more than your initial contract amount a way to manage this risk is by using position sizing and stop loses with your position sizing if you wanted to invest $ 10,000 in a particular share trading at $ 10 per share you would then buy 1000 shares or 1000 cfds in that share your initial expense with the cfds might be only $ 1000 at a margin rate of 10 so instead of increasing your risk by having an initial outlay of $ 10,000 with the cfds you limit your risk to the same as you were buying the shares directly

it 's a con being played upon the middle money people by the big money people and it 's based on the principle or effect simply put and in analogous form if a lot of something goes in one direction then a lot of other similar somethings will go in the same direction too so if a lot of big money gets invested into derivatives then other money will follow that original big money is called the primer it the pump flow and gets the other money following it in if the original money the primer gets removed from the process it does n't stop the flow of other money into the flow because once the flow is going any new money in the process acts like the original primer money sucking in even more money this is the effect in action it 's how most pumps work   so you prime the pump get it flowing nicely move your money out of the process and wait for the thing to suck out as much money as the economy can withstand and then crash er profit if you 've set your stakes correctly to benefit from the stopping of the flow the crash you can make billions with very little effort and practically no risk at all

i actually have a bit of experience with the supplier side of this having worked with other people attempting to get the business launched i can shed a bit of insight the primary reason for the pricing is that there simply is n't enough competition to warrant dropping the price any lower than it already is large companies such as hallmark will typically buy card designs at 5 of the card 's selling price with their existing distribution network this makes bringing in new and varied designs much easier for large companies that are already well established having talked with such designers in the past someone working full time producing designs makes on average 30 60k annually from this which is worth it to someone who does n't want to jump through the hoops of actually getting into the business independently the primary issue stifling competition is actually getting your product into stores there are topics here that i can not discuss due to nda but i can break down the overall outline for you you need to start with a large number of designs with enough variety that companies think could sell well if you bring a handful of designs with you no company is going to take your business venture seriously enough you need to find a company that can stamp out a large production process for you the company is going to need to be nice enough to take smaller purchase orders on the magnitude of several hundred cards but also be capable of scaling that production to several hundreds of thousands of cards very quickly for cards specifically most companies want you to ship custom racks with your cards some companies may provide their own racks for stocking your product but not all of them will this will also cost a lot of money up front you need to find a buyer for a company you want to sell your product to this is important and what killed our original business plans think wal mart target or even cvs pharmacy these big companies are going to have people who 's entire job is to buy new products to put on their shelves this is where networking is key you need to find people with connections to these buyers if you 're not already well established with them you will also likely fail several times either getting outright ignored or through a broker that ca n't meet expectations for example we had a broker that introduced us to a buyer for a large store chain and after several months of work we found out that this broker was just pulling our strings typically a company will want to test your product in a handful of stores to see if it will sell for example target may want to test your product in 100 200 stores over 3 months and expect your product to sell at a minimum rate finally you need to be able to scale your production suddenly you 'll be asked to go from supplying 100 stores to supplying 1,800 stores with a deadline in 2 weeks buyers will even turn you down at this point if they do n't think you can meet the production all of this work takes at least a year and typically takes several years to go from an initial product to having your product in every store without breaking the numbers down too much we could make a profit of for every $ 3 card that sold that number does n't cover the cost of racks and other overhead that 's just the per card profit even then people are more likely to go view the hallmark or other big name cards over your offering only when another company becomes a big powerhouse to be competitive will these companies be forced to drop their prices

i 'd talk to a solicitor and see if you can structure the purchase in a way that breaks the property into three pieces one would be the freehold of the whole building one would be a long lease on the downstairs part on which you would get a residential mortgage and one would be a long lease on the upstairs flat on which you would get a buy to let mortgage since there 's essentially no price premium for freehold as opposed to long lease you should be able to raise enough money from the two mortgages to fund the purchase

details as usual will depend on local culture and jurisdiction but in most jurisdictions there is generally no obligation for you to actively return something money parcel whatever you received in error usually it 's enough to notify the sender actually it might be a dangerous mistake to return it yourself what if you send it to the wrong account so you probably have done all you had to and can close your account without further delay however until the time specified by statute of limitations or similar concept in your jurisdiction has passed usually a few years the company could ask you to return the money if they do ask be prepared to return it so do not spend it my recommendation would be then lean back and wait

this is a fascinating question   i am posting here only a partial answer because i have n't found official sources   the upshot appears to be that a puerto rico ira is a wholly different thing from a us ira and different rules apply   this is said most succinctly in this post on the boglehead forums us federal tax code and puerto rican tax codes are separate by contributing to a u.s. ira you defer us taxes you need to pay these deferred us taxes and take an early withdrawal penalty too if you want to move the asset to pr other web pages give similar information for instance this post from accountant forums the puerto rico pr internal revenue code irc defines a puerto    rico ira i am assuming that this taxpayer has a pr ira it is    unfortunate that they chose to use the same name as the us irc    uses a pr ira is not a us ira it has different tax rules in    addition the us irc defines an ira as being a trust created or    organized in the united states the us irc sec defines    the united states as being the 50 states and the district of    columbia the bogleheads thread also contains a link to a document from a puerto rican cpa school which appears to be a faq and says translated here from spanish thus any distribution from an ira established in puerto rico does not qualify to be transferred to an ira established outside puerto rico without the of penalty and/or payment of corresponding income tax   in the same way the transfer of an ira established outside puerto rico to one established in puerto rico also does not qualify as a transfer it is not clear whether the exact meaning of transfer given as either or in the document corresponds to the us usage of ira transfers i.e. nontaxable events some information i found indicates that the end of the quote above might be translated as does not qualify as a rollover   in any case it seems that moving an ira to or from puerto rico at least potentially has tax consequences   there is also a previous question on this site which likewise says you can not transfer or rollover an ira that was established in pr to usa and vice versa these are not exactly authoritative sources but they all seem to point towards the same conclusion namely that you wo n't be able to avoid taxation on your ira by moving to puerto rico   of course i am no expert   to be sure you would have to talk to an accountant versed in the tax laws of both puerto rico and the incorporated us and probably also whatever state you 'd be moving from to be on the safe side

there is no right and wrong answer to this question what you and your business partner perceive as fair is the best way to split the ownership of the new venture   first regarding the two issues you have raised capital contributions the fact that you are contributing 90 of initial capital does not necessarily translate to 90 of equity in my opinion what is fair is that you transform your contributions into a loan for the company the securitization of your contribution into a loan will make it easier to calculate your fair contribution and also compensate you for your risk by choosing whatever combination of interest income and equity you see suitable for example you might decide to split the company in half and consider your contributions a loan with 20 50 or 200   annual interest   salary it is common that co founders of start ups forgo their wages at the start of the company i do not recommend that this forgone salary be compensated through equity because it is impossible to determine the suitable amount of equity to be paid i suggest the translation of forgone wages into loans or preferred stocks in similar fashion to capital contribution also consider the following in deciding the best way to allocate equity between both of you and your partner whose idea was it talk with you business partner how both of you value the inventor of the concept in general execution is more important but talking about how you both feel about it is good full time vs. part time a person who works full time at the new venture should have more equity than the partner who is only a part time helper control it is important to talk about control and decision making of the company you can separate the control and decision making of important decisions from ownership you can also check the following article about this topic at

a falling exchange rate is an indication of falling confidence in a currency   countries like iran or venezuela with a managed exchange rate set their exchange rates at a higher value than the market accepts such market expectations may be influenced by poor government management interventions into markets such as businesses or general instability scarcity the governments act to manage that uncertainty by limiting the availability of foreign exchange and pegging the exchange rate    since there is an inadequate supply of trusted foreign currency people turn to informal exchanges in order to hedge their currency risk   this creates a negative feedback loop   people in government who have access to foreign exchange start to trade on informal markets pocketing the difference in the official and unofficial rates   the increasing gap between the two rates drives increasing informal market exchange and can result in speculative bubbles driving instability or economic contradiction is that the massive and increasing difference between the official and market exchange rates becomes a powerful form of rent for government officials this drives further state led rent seeking behaviour and causes the economy to become even more unstable if you 're interested in a more formal academic study of how such parallel markets in currency arise zimbabwe ’s black market for foreign exchange by albert at the university of is a useful source

there 's really no right or wrong answer here because you 'll be fine either way if you 've investing amounts in the low 5 figures you 're likely just getting started and if your asset allocation is not optimal it 's not that big a deal because you have a long time horizon to adjust it and the expense ratio differences here wo n't add up to that much a third option is vanguard etfs which have the expense ratio of admiral shares but have lower minimums i.e. the cost of a single share typically on the order of $ 100 however they are a bit more advanced than mutual funds in that they trade on the market and require you to place orders rather than just specifying the amount you want to buy a downside here is you might end up with a small amount of cash that you ca n't invest since you can initially only buy whole numbers of etfs shares so what i 'd recommend is buying roughly the correct number of etfs shares you want except for your largest allocation then use the rest of your cash on admiral shares of that if possible for example let 's say you have $ 15k to invest and you want to be 2/3 u.s. stock 1/6 international stock and 1/6 u.s. bond i would buy as many shares of international stock etf and u.s. bond etf as you can get for $ 2500 each then whatever is left over put into vtsax u.s. stock admiral shares mutual fund

behind the scenes of banking are a lot of very manual processes especially when something goes wrong these take extra time not only because it involves people reviewing what went wrong but also because the bank will take extra steps to reduce human error e.g. technical jargon about maker checker dual controls something like this can easily get held up for a month and the best way to jump the queue is to start complaining a lot calling customer service frequently asking to talk to management and otherwise the bank until someone senior gets your problem fast tracked so you stop giving them a headache

a bullish or long call spread is actually two separate option trades   the a b notation is respectively the strike price of each trade the first leg of the strategy corresponding to b is the sale of a call option at a strike price of b in this case $ 165   the proceeds from this sale after transaction costs are generally used to offset the cost of the second leg the second leg of the strategy corresponding to a is the purchase of a call option at a strike price of a in this case $ 145 now the important part the payoff   you can visualize it as so this is where it gets a teeny bit math y   below p is the profit of the strategy k1 is the strike price of the long call is the strike price of the short call t1 is the premium paid for the long call option at the time of purchase t2 is the premium received for the short call at the time of sale and s is the current price of the stock   for simplicity 's sake we will assume that your position quantity is a single option contract and transaction costs are zero which they are not p = t2 s + s k1 t1 concretely let 's plug in the strikes of the strategy nathan proposes and current prices which i pulled from the screen   you have p = 165 145 = if the stock goes to $ 150 the payoff is which is n't quite break even but it may have been at the time he was speaking on tv if the stock goes to $ 165 the payoff is $ please do not neglect the cost of the trades   trading options can be pretty expensive depending on the broker   had i done this trade quantity 1 at many popular brokers i still would've been net negative pnl even if nflx went to > = $ 165

i 'm going to guess that you found this because of a stock screener   this company went through a reverse split on june 30 so every 20 shares outstanding became a single share   where before you had 20 shares worth $ 100 you now have 1 share worth $ 100 the value of the company does n't change because of a split   this company was never trading for $ 30 + per share   reverse splits are typical of a company trading on an exchange that has a minimum share price requirement   while reverse splits do n't change the value of the company just the number of shares outstanding and the price per share no healthy company performs a reverse split   reverse splits are generally a massive signal to jump ship the company seems to be trading for $ 1 right now why the value fell from a pre split $ 1.65 $ to $ 1 is anyone 's guess how the company ever got to $ 1.65 is also anyone 's guess but looking at the most recent 10-q there are numerous causes for concern   note 2 capital stock on march 6 2017 the company issued as compensation for services provided a total of common shares with a fair value of $ to a third party the fair value of the shares was based on the price quoted on the otc pink sheets on the grant date this indicates a share price of $ $ as of just to reinforce that the google price chart does n't show the true past but a past adjusted for the split results of operations the three months ended march 31 2017 compared to the three months ended march 31 2016 for the three months ended march 31 2017 compared to the three months ended march 31 2016 total revenues were $ 0 and $ 0 respectively and net losses from operations were $ and $ respectively the net losses were attributable to costs attributable to operating as a public company in particular common stock with a valuation of $ that was issued to an investor relations firm in the first quarter of 2017 going concern as of march 31 2017 there is substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern as we have not generated sufficient cash flow to fund our proposed business we have suffered recurring losses from operations since our inception in addition we have yet to generate an internal cash flow from our business operations or successfully raised the financing required to develop our proposed business as a result of these and other factors our independent auditor has expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern     liquidity and capital resources we had no cash as of the date of march 31 2017 additionally since there is no balance sheet in the last 10-q another bad sign the last annual report 10-k has this balance sheet so the company so why did the stock value plummet it 's guess but there is no shortage of ways to justify it    in fact it 's reasonable to ask how is this company still worth $ 3 mm $ 1 3 mm shares outstanding

it only matters for purposes of the dependent so if you are clearly at 50 then you do n't need to calculate this cost   if it is close to not being 50 then you will have to allocate between your sister and mother   to calculate support costs you can of course include the costs incurred for transportation per pub 17 p 34   if you and your sister have an arrangement where she uses the car and in exchange she shoulders extra costs for your mother then that 's legitimately your expense for your mother as long as this is a true agreement then it was money she owed you but paid directly to the vendors and creditors that you would have paid note that there is a simpler avenue   if your sister agrees that you will claim your mother as dependent and nobody else provides any substantial support of costs then she can just agree that it 's you who will claim her   if you like such an agreement may be attached to your taxes possibly using form   as a general rule though you do not need to use or any other agreement nor submit any support calculations   if your sister verbally agrees that she has n't and wo n't claim your mother then it 's unlikely to cause any problems   her signed agreement not to claim your mother is merely the most conservative possible documentation strategy but is n't really necessary   see pub 17 p 35 on multiple support agreements for more info

there are several issues with paying for furniture and appliances with 0 credit instead of paying with cash when you pay with 0 credit you might be tempted to spend more on something than you would have if you paid with cash because it feels like free money and you 've justified in your mind that the extra you earn will help pay for the more expensive item businesses do n't offer 0 credit for free and they do n't lose money on the deal   when you shop at a store that offers 0 credit you are generally overpaying for the item   by shopping at a store that does not offer 0 credit you might be able to get a better price your savings account is likely earning very little interest   you might invest the money you intend for your purchases in a place that gets better returns but in most of these places the returns are not guaranteed and you might not do as well as you think 0 loans typically come with lots of conditions that have very heavy penalties and interest rate hikes for late payments   you can mitigate this risk by setting up automatic payments but things can still go wrong   your bank might change your account number making the automated payment fail   as you mentioned you might also forget to put the proper amount of money in the account   a single mistake can negate all of the tiny gains you are trying to achieve ultimately the decision is yours of course but in my opinion there is very very little to gain with buying something on 0 credit when you could be paying cash

your question is very broad whole books can and have been written on this topic the right place to start is for you and your wife to sit down together and figure out your goals where do you want to be in 5 years 25 years 50 years to quote if you do n't know where you are going you 'll end up someplace else let 's go backwards 50 years i 'm guessing the answer is retired living comfortably and not having to worry about money you say you work an unskilled government job does that job have a pension program how about other retirement savings options will the pension be enough or do you need to start putting money into the other retirement savings options career wise do you want to be working as in unskilled government jobs until you retire or do you want to retire from something else if so how do you get there your goals here will affect both your 25 year plan and your 5 year plan finally as you plan for death which will happen eventually what do you want to leave for your children likely the pension will not be transferred to your children so if you want to leave them something you need to start planning ahead 25 years at this stage in your life you are likely talking college for the children and possibly your wife back at work could happen much earlier than this e.g. when the kids are all in school what do you want for your children in college do you want them to have the opportunity to go without having to take on debt what savings options are there for your children 's college also likely with all your children out of the house at college what do you and your wife want to do travel give to charity own your own home 5 years you mention having children and your wife staying at home with them can your family live on just your income can you do that and still achieve your 50 and 25 year goals if not further education or training on your part may be needed are you in debt would you like to be out of debt in the next 5 10 years i know i 've raised more questions than answers this is due mostly to the nature of the question you 've asked it is very personal and i do n't know you what i find most useful is to look at where i want to be in the near mid and long term and then start to build a plan for how i get there if you have older friends or family who are where you want to be when you reach their age talk to them ask them how they got there also there are tons of resources out there to help you i wo n't suggest any specific books but look around at the local library or look online read reviews of personal finance books read many and see how they can give you the advice you need to reach your specific goals good luck

that 's a very good question of which i did n't know the answer i did n't pay very close attention when they actually so i researched just now and i could n't believe the amount of public complaining the banks did about google 's ipo structure hilarious in retrospect    either way in a very satisfying development google only paid 3 on the underwrite the offering was worth almost $ 3b which means $ 100 m for the banks but they did n't have to do a road show or make a single call to sell the thing so i 'd say that was more than fair   articles business   's ipo price will thus be set naturally by all interested market participants not artificially by underwriters google and not well connected investors will receive the full benefit of investors enthusiasm for the stock to add insult to the injury of the investment bankers google has that it 'll only pay a 3 percent underwriting fee

ultimately no one really knows what causes the markets to rise and fall beyond supply and demand if more people want to buy then sell prices go up and if more people want to sell prices go down the news channels will often try to attribute a specific reason to the price move but that is largely just guess work to fill up the news pages so people have something to read you may find it interesting to read up on the elliot wave principle the crash of 2008 was a perfect elliot wave fit elliot wave theory states that social which ultimately drive the stock market generally occur in a relatively predictable pattern the crash in september was a wave 3 down this is where the majority of people give up hope however there are still a few people who are still holding on the markets tend to about during wave 4 finally the last few people give up hope and sell out this causes the final crash of wave 5 only when the last person has given up hope can the markets start to go up again

i disagree if nobody got their health insurance through their employer then everyone would go out on the market and acquire them this would create a more dynamic health insurance market which would over time drive down the cost of getting health insurance    i do n't follow your logic about how wages would n't keep up 10 or 20 years down the road if anything not having to worry about benefits in a particular job would give employees more job mobility causing the job market to be more competitive in other words it would be more likely to cause wages to up   also ancillary benefits of getting employers out of the health insurance benefit dynamic would be to create more efficiencies within those businesses reduce staff spent on coordinating plans and such make small businesses more competitive they are at a disadvantage now with regard to big companies with pools of employees and get more people to acquire at least some form of insurance health coverage goes up   i for one welcome a world in which our employers have absolutely nothing to do with our benefits choices and we choose them at our own discretion just as i do with my car insurance

some people have this notion that withdrawing dividends from savings    is somehow okay but withdrawing principal is not   note this notion would someone please explain the mistake on and why it 's a    mistake because there may be times where withdrawing principal may be a good idea as one could sell off something that has gained enough that in re balancing the portfolio there are capital gains that could be used for withdrawing in retirement how and why does the sale of financial instrument equate to the    receipt of dividends   in either case one has cash equivalents that could be withdrawn if you take the dividends in cash or sell a security to raise cash you have cash thus it does n't matter what origin it has if i sell a financial instrument that later    appreciates in value then this profit opportunity is lost in the    case of a dividend i 'd still possess the financial security and    benefit from the stock 's appreciation one could argue that the in the case of a dividend by not buying more of the instrument you are missing out on a profit opportunity as well thus are you out to make the maximum profit overall or do you have reason for taking the cash instead of increasing your holding

the simple answer because you believe every other option can yield greater losses so the thinking is lend it to france you 'll get your money back put your money in a bank and there 's a chance you wo n't get it back if the bank goes bust investors also believe that rates will continue to go more negative in which case they will actually make money   it 's a momentum play which will eventually reverse but since the bond market is extremely liquid it 's a bet that can quickly be unwound another theory floating around is that if the weaker countries of the euro leave e.g. greece etc and the core keep the euro then the value of the euro will actually rise so by putting your money in french or german bonds you would also be securing cash in french or german euro 's thinking the on a euro break up

options both puts and calls are typically written sold at different strike prices for example even though the stock of xyz is currently trading at $ 12.50 there could be put options for prices ranging from $ 0.50 to $ just as an example there are several factors that go into determining the strike prices at which people are willing to write options the writer seller of an option is the person on the other side of the trade that has the opposite opinion of you if you are interested in purchasing a put on a stock to hedge your downside that means the writer seller of the put is betting that you are wrong and that the stock price will rise instead

there could be a few reasons for this my first guess is that you did n't report the distribution on your return indicated on line 15 of your 1040 below the irs got a copy of the 1099-r and assumes it 's all taxable or maybe the 1099-r indicates the full amount is taxable if a 1099-r does n't have an amount populated for taxable amount it does n't mean the distribution is n't taxable and without any indication that it 's not taxable the irs assumes it is it 's not taxable if it 's a withdrawal of your contribution here 's a from how to calculate the taxable amount of an ira withdrawal withdrawals from a roth ira since roth ira contributions are made on    an after tax basis qualified withdrawals are completely tax free a    qualified roth withdrawal includes the following if your 1099-r indicates a taxable amount then you might need to contact the issuer to understand why if it does not indicate a taxable amount and you failed to record the distribution on your return you just need to file an amended return that shows the distribution on line and shows no taxable amount on 15b along with a completed form 8606   you may not need additional documentation to support of your claim that it 's not taxable but if you do it would be any statement showing that your contributions over the years exceed your withdrawal what a 1040 with a non taxable ira withdrawal would show   note there 'd also be a completed form 8606 the 1040 lines above just show if it was entered in the easiest path forward is probably to file an amended return using turbotax since you filed with them originally i have n't dealt with an irs letter in a few years i ca n't recall if you need to contact them or simply file the amended return but they 're pretty good about including instructions so the letter probably indicates what you need to do do n't delay in taking action as the irs can and will garnish wages if they are owed or think they are owed money   update op contacted irs and they did n't even want an amended return just the completed form 8606 so it 's worth calling the irs first with these letters

in general to someone in a similar circumstance i might suggest that the lowest risk option is to immediately convert your excess currency into the currency you will be spending note that risk here refers only to the variance in possible outcomes by converting to eur now assuming you are moving to an eu country using the eur you eliminate the chance that the gbp will weaken but you also eliminate the chance that the gbp will strengthen thus you have reduced the variance in possible outcomes so that you have a known amount of eur to put money in a different currency than what you will be using is a form of investing and it is one that can be considered high risk invest in a uk company while you plan on staying in the uk and you take on the risk of stock ownership only but invest in a german company while you plan on staying in the uk you take on the risk of stock ownership + the risk of currency volatility if you are prepared for this type of risk and understand it you may want to take on this type of risk but you really must understand what you 're getting into before you do this for most people i think it 's fair to say that fx investing is more accurately called gambling see more comments on the risk of fx trading here however this risk reduction only truly applies if you are certain that you will be moving to an eur country if you invest in eur but then move to the us you have not solved your currency volatility problem you have simply replaced your gbp risk with eur risk if you had your plane ticket in hand and nothing could stop you then you know what your currency needs will be in 2 years but if you have any doubt then exchanging currency now may not be reducing your risk at all what if you exchange for eur today and in a year you decide for all the various reasons that circumstances in life may change that you will stay in the uk after all and during that time what if the gbp strengthened again you will have taken on risk unnecessarily   so if you lack full confidence in your move you may want to avoid fully trading your gbp today perhaps you could put away some amount every month into eur if you plan on moving to an eur country and leave some most in gbp this would not fully eliminate your currency risk if you move but it would also not fully expose yourself to risk if you end up not moving just remember that doing this is not a guarantee that the eur will strengthen and the gbp will weaken

i 'm sorry   but no   it is not   some simple theories can be predictive in the current   but macroeconomic theories are almost never predictive and always more reminiscent of a religion   science must be predictive by definition   but predictions about complex systems are notoriously   this is why your ca n't predict more than a few days out     it 's because it 's impossible   the system is too complex   it is sensitive to initial conditions which are unknown and unknowable   and the inputs are too numerous and varied to account for everything   but they can be accurate to within a given confidence interval even if it does not achieve formal statistical significance   and they can run something akin to what economists would call monte carlo simulations given their models   but so far as macroeconomics go there is no admission by many practitioners in many schools about the predictive limitations on the whole endeavor based on the complex nature of the system   there are simply constructed theoretical frameworks which are not predictive but which seem to have fit certain patterns in the past that are cherry picked to confirm a hypothesis   if that is science it is bad science   this does not mean one can not have an untested hypothesis   economists generally can not set up their own experiments after all   and they deal in complexity and human decision just like the other social scientists   but economists perhaps more so than other social scientists due to the increased mathematical skill set in the standard tool box of the field tend to overstate their case   this is particularly true for those larger named economists in the field who inevitably get hired by major media companies   if friedman and were both scientists how did they come to such widely different conclusions     how does the university of chicago predict and prescribe the polar opposite of u. mo st. louis    basing any theory on splitting one half of 's theory of rationality from the other and assigning the behavioral patterns to actors already makes several cognitive leaps   and yes in the last few years we have had the school of behavioral economics and bounded rationality models to try to cope with this   but it 's still far from predictive   the austrians are certainly on some of the ground in my view   at least keynes work was rigorous   so was marx 's for that matter   that stands in stark contrasts to the austrians and their ilk   but regardless when dealing with essentially contested concepts consensus through induction becomes the only path forward   empirical deduction falls off the menu   the schools of biology and chemistry at u mo and u will not come to opposite conclusions given identical data   the schools of economics do   that in and of itself is anecdotal evidence of a severe flaw in the science in a very sense   and so i stand by my statement

it 's a form of debt issued by the united states treasury as the name implies a 10-year note is held for 10 years after which you get the face value in cash and it pays interest twice per year it 's being used in the calculator to stand for a readily available medium term nearly risk free investment as a means of discounting the value that the company gains the explanation for why the discounting is done can be found on the page you linked as a canadian you could use the yield of comparable canadian treasury securities as quoted by bank of canada which seem to have had the bottom fall out since the new year although i do n't suppose american notes would be hard for a canadian investor to come by so if you wanted to be conservative you could use the us figure as long as it 's higher

that 's not why they crashed they crashed because the only reason people were buying them is because they would go up in value and then they could sell them for profit later sounds exactly like bitcoin in my opinion the only difference is bitcoin is useful in the sense that criminals can use it and not get in trouble    how many people do you know using bitcoin as a currency they are n't they are only buying it to sell it for a profit later that is n't sustainable it is n't backed by a government or military and it is too volatile to actually use as a currency when it crashes and criminals are the only ones using it then what is it worth maybe $ 100 a coin $ 10 who knows it sure as hell is n't $ 5,000 a coin though

my realtor told me that even though they 're only asking for 1/2     the money and have excellent credit that the mortgage company may    not lend it to them if i 'm over priced is this true i 've never heard of it before it is a chance but it is a red herring to the discussion having excellent credit has nothing to do with being eligible for a debt object of a specific size just because you have excellent credit would you get approved for a property of $ 10,000,000 if you only made $ 35,000 a year and had no other net worth but regarding your potential buyers a chance vs a good chance is different your realtor just told you some basic always true lending fact that has nothing to do with your situation

for example for my employer i received a signing bonus and a    relocation lump sum separate from that signing bonus the relocation    lump sum is taxed and will appear as income on my w-2 and i can spend    it on anything i want that said should the relocation lump sum count    towards the entry quoted above in form or would it be considered    the same as any other bonus thus allowing me to take a full deduction    for all of my deductible travel expenses the signing bonus and relocation lump sum will appear as regular income on your w-2 you can think of the relocation bonus as something to cover the pain and suffering the cost of moving without needing to send in receipts lets assume that you meet the distance and time tests so there is potential to save money on your taxes lets also put your actual moving expenses as $ 2500 if you have valid moving expenses the irs will allow you to use them to reduce your agi so now you can reduce your agi by the $ 2500   enter the total amount your employer paid you for the expenses listed    on lines 1 and 2 that is not included in box 1 of your form w-2    wages this amount should be shown in box 12 of your form w-2 with    code p. my question is what exact payments from your employer should be    entered here i realize that you can just write the number you get in    box 12 with code p on your w-2 but i 'm curious how they come up with    this number in some cases the company will reimburse you your moving expenses up to a maximum of $ x. for example a maximum of $ 1000 that means you submit receipts for those expenses and they give you a check or add it to your next paycheck the check will either be for the amount on your receipts or the maximum amount whichever is smaller in this situation with actual expenses of $ 2500 and a reimbursement of $ 1000 you can reduce your agi by $ 1500

since the last time savings account interest rates were meaningful banks have made relationships much stick by that i mean that the online services and all the auto pay systems in place put up a significant barrier for people to leave their bank this results in people no longer shopping their banking business around to the bank with the best account interest rates so no cartel or other behavior from banks but rather just customer apathy as you pointed out was an option

it depends on what stocks you invest in or whether you invest in an index as all stocks are not created equally if you prefer to invest directly into individual stocks and you choose ones that are financially health and trending upwards you should be able to easily outperform any indexes and get your 30 return much quicker but you always need to make sure that you have a stop loss placed on all of your stocks because even the best performing companies can go through bad patches the stop loss prevents you from losing all your capital if the share price suddenly starts going south and turns into a downtrend

spring hill in 2009 spring hill united church of christ followed the lead of the denomination ’s 24th general of 2003 and adopted a statement of the church body would welcome and affirm all people including people of every sexual identity one way the church has decided to live up to that statement is by offering an educational and support group for those with hiv aids as well as people affected by it beginning this month the group will meet from 7 to p.m. on the last tuesday of each month at the church for the past two years our church has declared itself open to all people regardless of age race gender ethnicity sexual identity health or disabilities economic status or family structure said the as part of that of all people in our we are excited to be able to reach out to those who may lack the support and that comes from being hiv positive or having aids the ministry called red project will be led by church member and student ray gomez i chose the name red project because red is a stand out shout out kind of color gomez said red is also the color of the aids used to represent the illness he said red denotes danger and is an angry color representing the worst in human behavior and ignorance along with hatred shown to the people with the illness in the early years gomez said and the stigma surrounding hiv even today gomez is hiv positive and has more than 25 years of experience teaching and advocating on hiv aids he holds degrees in education and education and is working on a second master ’s degree in counseling he is an minister through the church international and is a student in ministry with the united church of christ gomez who is gay said he the church in spring hill because it is open and a lot of churches do not want to service or go out of their way to reach the hiv population he said it ’s unfortunate because a lot of people with hiv live in this community there ’s so much stigma still attached to hiv so for that reason many people do n’t want anything to do with church gomez said that several years ago he personally felt rejection by many churches subsequently he turned to alcohol crack cocaine and living i discovered quite quickly that the world ’s solutions make great promises but can never deliver he said it was all just an illusion of the intimacy i was seeking and i was left more broken more hopeless and experienced deeper despair over the past 11 years gomez said he returned to the faith of his youth and began to those who were hurting and broken now as an advocate and peer in the field he is a certified prevention specialist hiv test counselor and peer i have recovered from crack addiction and alcohol abuse he said i have discovered the metropolitan community church and the united church of christ two denominations that allow me to be fully myself and fully christian and which give me the opportunity to minister to a hurting and broken community reconciliation for hurting people is his goal my purpose and pastor ’s purpose is to reconcile gay men and people that have been hurt by other christians and that do n’t attend church anymore and welcome them back into a family of faith topics at the monthly classes will include i just tested positive now what talking with my health care provider the stuff you need to discuss medication adherence what ’s important and why and crystal meth and hiv a non judgmental educational experience according to a press release the purpose of red project is to offer emotional physical and spiritual support and guidance to those newly diagnosed with hiv and to those who have been positive for some time i believe a good support group needs four things gomez said physical support emotional support education and spiritual support there is no cost to attend but donations will be sought to help with and educational materials said those attending need not participate in the church there are no strings attached he said all we want to do is to help those who have a need and to affirm those who may feel alienated and by society at large my biggest hope is that people find inner healing and form bonds of friendship from participating in red project according to public information officer for the county health department the county does not offer a support group for those with hiv aids the health department reaches out with hiv aids education presentations literature testing and prevention said the health department clinics offer testing education comprehensive care and referrals hiv and aids is a concern across florida she said and we are fortunate to have resources available in county that support people who are living with hiv and aids

this is actually a very complicated question the key reading in this area is a seminal paper by optimal execution of portfolio transactions 2000 they show that there 's a tradeoff between liquidating your portfolio faster and knowing the value with more certainty versus liquidating more slowly and likely for a higher price but with less certainty so for example if you sold your entire position right now you would know almost certainly how much you would get for the position or you could sell off your position more slowly and likely get more money but you would have less certainty about how much you would get the paper is available online at

from my limited experience having taken a class on bankruptcy in order to become a chapter 11 is the portion of the bankruptcy code that allows certain corporate entities to reorganize basically the entity files for bankruptcy protection to halt credit collections or any number of reasons and then work with the courts to get out if the entity can put together a reasonable sounding restructuring plan the court may allow them to do it a restructuring plan essentially is a plan of who to pay back when and by what means this is seriously a simple explanation it 's much more complex than this so if the court approves the plan the entity will attempt to carry it out and come out of bankruptcy several years down the road in a more solvent position if the court rejects the plan or the plan fails then the entity has to then engage in chapter 7 proceedings selling assets to pay off debts

as a new graduate aside from the fact that you seem to have the extra $ to pay more towards your loan we do n't know anything else   i wrote a lengthy article on this in response to a friend who had a loan but was also pondering a home purchase in the future student loans and your first mortgage discusses the math behind one 's ability to put a downpayment on a house vs having that monthly cash to pay towards the mortgage in your case the question is whether in 5 years the $ 8500 would be best spent as a home down payment or to pay off the 6.8 loan   if you specifically had plans toward home ownership the timing of that plan would affect my answer here as i discuss in the article   the right answer to your question can only come by knowing far more of your personal situation   meanwhile the plan comes at a cost your plan will get rid of the loan in about 5 years but if you simply double up the payments advising the servicing company to apply the extra to principal it would drop to just a couple month over over 4 as you read more about personal finance you 'll find a lot of different views some people are fixated on having zero debt others will focus on liquidity in the end you need to understand each approach and decide what 's right for you

this may be a bit advanced now but once you start really working and get a place i think this will apply more do i set up a bank account now yes there is no reason not to as an adult you will be using this much more than you think   assuming you have a little money you can walk in to any bank almost any day of the week and set up an account with them in very little time note that they may require you to be 18 if your parents wo n't be with you on the account otherwise just ask any bank representative to help you do this just to be clear if you can get a credit union account over a typical bank account this is a great idea credit unions provide exactly the same financial services as a normal bank but typically have variety of advantages over banks    bank account parts bank accounts typically have two parts a checking account and a savings account your checking account typically is what you use for most day to day transactions and your savings account is generally used for well saving money   having a bank account often gives you the following advantages they give you an ability to store money without having large amounts of cash on hand once you start working regularly you 'll find you wo n't want to keep + cash every two weeks in your wallet or apartment they help you pay bills when you set up your bank account you will likely be able to get a visa debit card which will process like a regular credit card but simply deduct funds from your checking account you can use this card online to pay utilities i.e. electricity and water general bills e.g. your cell phone and cable purchase items ex at amazon or use it in stores to pay in lieu of cash   be aware some banks will give you an atm only card before they send you the visa debit card in the mail this atm only card can only be used at atms as it 's name implies   similarly if you can invest about ~$200 to build your credit you can often get a deposit secured credit card attached to your account basically a credit card where the bank keeps your money in case you ca n't pay your bill if you treat this card with responsibility you can eventually transition to an unsecured credit card they save you hassles when cashing your check if you do n't have a bank where you can cash your check e.g. you do n't have an account you will likely be charged check cashing fees usually by places such as grocery stores or payday loan chains or even other banks furthermore if your check is over a certain amount some places may refuse to cash your check period and a bank may be your only option they give you a way to receive money electronically the most common example of this is direct deposit many employers will send your money directly to your bank account instead of requiring you to cash a check if they are prompt this money gets to you faster and saves you trouble on payday you 'll just receive a pay stub detailing your wages and the amount deposited rather than a check   also since you asked about taxes you should know that when you do eventually file with the irs they have an option to receive your tax refund electronically as well e.g. direct deposit into your bank account and that can literally save you months in some cases depending on when you file your return and how many paper checks they have to process does it cost money to setup it depends some banks have special offers some do n't most places will set up an account for free but may require a minimum deposit to open the account typically $ 50-$100 the visa debit card mentioned above generally comes free if you want a secured credit card as above you will want about an additional $ 200 so $ 250 $ 300 total note that this is absolutely not required you can exclusively use the visa debit card above if you wish bank account fees any fees charged when you have a bank account are usually minor anymore regardless the bank will hand you a whole bunch of paperwork mostly in legalese detailing exactly how your account works that said the bank person helping set things up will cover what you need to know about keeping the account in plain english the most common types of fee associated with a bank account are monthly maintenance fees and overdraft fees but these are n't always necessarily charged likewise there may be some other fees associated with the account but these vary from bank to bank   monthly maintenance fees to give some examples overdraft fees overdraft fees are typically charged when you attempt to spend more money than you have in your bank account and the bank has to cover these charges overdraft fees typically apply to using paper checks which it is unlikely you will be using but not always   that said it is very unlikely you will be charged overdraft fees for three reasons many banks have done away with these fees in lieu of other ways of generating revenue     banks that still charge these fees usually have overdraft protection options for a little more money a month effectively negating the possibility you will be charged these fees   the ability to deduct an amount of money from your checking account is now typically checked electronically before the payment is authorized that is using a visa debit card the card balance is checked immediately and even when using paper check most retailers have check scanning machines that do roughly the same thing on a personal note the bank that i have allows my account to be deducted below my checking account balance only if the payment is requested electronically e.g. someone who has my card information charges me for a monthly service in this case the funds are simply listed in the negative and deducted from any amount i deposit till the proper amount is repaid e.g. if i 'm at dollars due to a charge when my account balance was $ 0 and then i deposit $ 100 my available balance will then be $ 75 not $ 100 finally per the comment by while i minimize the likelihood you will be charged overdraft fees it is good to check into the exact circumstances under which you might be charged unexpectedly by your bank read the documentation they give you carefully including any mailed updates and you 'll reduce the chance of receiving a nasty surprise for reference here are some of the fees charged by bank of america what about taxes when you begin working an employer will usually have you fill out a tax form such as a w-4 employee 's withholding allowance certificate so that your employer can withhold the correct federal income tax from your wages if they do n't then it is your responsibility to calculate and file your own income taxes if you are self employed an independent contractor or paid under the table   if your employer is reputable they will send you additional information generally in february you need to properly file your taxes prior to april 15th the irs tax deadline for most people this additional information will likely be some variation of a w-2 wage and tax statement or possibly a form 1099-misc   do i have to worry about money in my bank account unless you have a significant amount in your bank savings account earning interest see should i save for the future below you wo n't have to pay any sort of tax on money in your bank account if you do earn enough taxable interest the bank will send you the proper forms to file your taxes how do i file taxes while it wo n't apply till next year you will likely be able to fill out a form 1040ez income tax return for single and joint filers with no dependents as long as you do n't have any kids in the meantime you will either mail in the paper form available at your local irs office post office public library etc or file electronically there will be a lot of information on how to do this when the time comes so do n't worry about details just yet   assuming your all paid up on your taxes very likely unless you get a good paying job and take a lot of deductions throughout the year on your w-4 you 'll probably get money back from the irs when you file your tax return as i mentioned above if you have a bank account you can opt to have your refund money returned electronically and get it much sooner than if you did n't have a bank account again possibly saving you literal months of waiting should i save for my future if so how much any good articles yes you should save for the future and start as soon as possible it 's outside the scope of this answer but listen to your economics professor talk about compound interest in short the later you start saving the less money you have when you retire   not that it makes much difference now but you have to think that over 45 years of working age 20 65 you likely have to have enough money for another 20 + years of not working 65 85 + so if you want $ 25,000 a year for retirement you need to make $ 75,000 a year between your job and any financial instruments you have savings account stocks bonds cds mutual funds iras job retirement benefits etc where you should stick money your money is a complicated question which you can investigate at length as you get older personally though i would recommend some combination of ira individual retirement account long term mutual funds and some sort of savings bonds there is a metric ton of information regarding financial planning but you can always read something like investing for dummies or you can try the motley fool 's how to invest online and highly recommended but i 'm only 17 so what should you do now budget sounds dumb but just look at your basic expenses and total them all up rent utilities phone cable food gas other costs and divide by two out of each paycheck this is how much money you need to save not to go into debt   try to save a little each month $ 50 $ 100 a month is a good starting amount if you can swing it you can always try to save more later invest early you may not get great returns but you do n't need much money to start investing often you can get started with as little as $ 20 $ 100 you 'll have to do research but it is possible put money in your savings account checking accounts do not typically earn interest but money in savings accounts often do that is the bank will actually add money to your savings assuming you leave it in there long enough unfortunately this rate of interest is only about 3.5 on average which for most people means they do n't get rich off it you have to have a significant amount of money $ 5,000 + to see even modest improvements in your savings account balance each month but still you may eventually get there get into the habit of putting money places that make you money in the long run do n't go into debt do n't get payday loans pawn items or abuse credit cards besides wrecking your credit even a small amount of debt $ 500 + can be very hard to break out of if you do n't have a great paying job and can even make you homeless no rent means no apartment   remember be financially responsible but assuming your parents are n't totally tight with money do n't be afraid to ask for cash when you really need it this is a much better option than borrowing from some place that charges outrageous interest or making your payments late have an emergency account as already mentioned in another excellent answer you need to have money to smooth things out when you encounter unexpected events your employer has trouble with your check you have to pay for some sort of repair bill you use more gas in your car in a month than normal etc anywhere from $ 200 $ 2000 + should do it but ideally you should have at least enough to cover a month of basic expenses build good credit avoid the temptation to get a lot of credit cards even if stores and banks are dying to give them to you you really only need one to build good credit preferably a secured one from your bank as mentioned above never charge more than you can pay off in a single month charging then paying that amount off before the due date on your next statement will help your credit immensely likewise pay attention to your rent utilities and monthly services cell phone cable etc even though these seem like options you can put off oh my electric bill is only $ 40 i 'll pay that next month late payments on all of these can negatively affect your credit score which you will need later to get good loans and buy a house   get health insurance now that the affordable care act aca a.k.a obamacare has been enacted it is now simpler to get health insurance and it is actually required you have some hopefully your employer will offer health coverage you can find reasonably priced coverage on your own or you live in a state with a health exchange even if you ca n't otherwise get afford insurance you may qualify for some sort of state coverage depending on income if you do n't have some sort of health insurance private or otherwise the irs can potentially fine you when you file your taxes not to be too scary but the fine as currently proposed is jumping up to about $ 700 for individuals in 2016 or so so even if you do n't grab health insurance which you absolutely should you need to save about $ 60 a month even if just for the fine   this answer turned out a bit longer than intended but hopefully it will help you a little bit welcome to the wonderful world of adult financial responsibility

it is a legal issue for two reasons in the united states if both names were on the title both people would have had to sign the paperwork in order to transfer the title if the car was collateral for the loan then the bank would have had to be involved in the transaction the portion of the check need to repay the loan would have had to have been made out to the bank if the car was sold to a dealership then paperwork must have been forged if the car was sold to a person then it is possible that they were too naive to know what paperwork was required but it is likely still fraud you need legal advice to protect your money and your credit score they should also be able to tell you who needs to be contacted dmv the police the dealership the bank

i recently decided to out on a music system for the house which included a turntable i used to have a proper dj setup but that 's long been sold off and most of the records are of a genre i do n't listen to now but i wanted to enjoy the records i do listen to and also buy some more   one thing that struck me when listening through albums is how much more closely i listen to each track when it 's not part of an endless spotify playlist when you physically have to get up and flip the disc over every 3 tracks or so you pay so much more attention to it and it becomes a much more pleasurable experience rather than just background   it 's more labour intensive but that 's a good thing good music deserves your attention   edit also for all the replies to this that and make out it 's just a fad buying a vinyl offers so much more in terms of a physical product than cds or downloads i have a copy of 's my beautiful dark twisted fantasy and the actual design of the triple and all the included artwork is amazing    yes it 's more convenient to just get apple music or whatever but that 's not what we 're talking about it 's the reason people go a decent rather than mcdonalds

the question is how do i exit i ca n't really sell the puts because there is n't    enough open interest in them now that they are so far out of the money i have about $ 150 k of funds outside of this position that i could use but i 'm    confused by the rules of exercising a put do i have to start shorting the stock you certainly do n't want to give your broker any instructions to short the stock shorting the stock at this point would actually be increasing your bet that the stock is going to go down more worse a short position in the stock also puts you in a situation of unlimited risk on the stock 's upside a risk you avoided in the first place by using puts the puts limited your potential loss to only your cost for the options there is a scenario where a short position could come into play indirectly if you are n't careful   if your broker were to permit you to exercise your puts without you having first bought enough underlying shares then yes you would end up with a short position in the stock i say permit you because most brokers do n't allow clients to take on short positions unless they 've applied and been approved for short positions in their account in any case since you are interested in closing out your position and taking your profit exercising only and thus ending up with a resulting open short position in the underlying is not the right approach it 's not really a correct intermediate step either rather you have two typical ways out sell the puts   has pointed out in his answer that you should be able to sell for no less than the intrinsic value although you may be leaving a small amount of time value on the table if you are n't careful   my suggestion is to consider using limit orders and test various prices approaching the intrinsic value of the put   do n't use market orders where you 'll take any price offered or you might be sorry if you have multiple put contracts you do n't need to sell them all at once with the kind of profit you 're talking about do n't sweat paying a few extra transactions worth of commission exercise the puts   remember that at the other end of your long put position is one or more trader who wrote created the put contract in the first place this trader is obligated to buy your stock from you at the contract price should you choose to exercise your option   but in order for you to fulfill your end of the contract when you choose to exercise you 're obligated to deliver the underlying shares in exchange for receiving the option strike price so you would first need to buy underlying shares sufficient to exercise at least one of the contracts   again you do n't need to do this all at once   's answer has described an approach note that you 'll lose any remaining time value in the option if you choose to exercise finally i 'll suggest that you ought to discuss the timing and of closing out your position with a qualified tax professional there are tax implications and being near the end of the year there may be an opportunity to shift some all of the income into the following tax year to minimize and defer tax due be careful if your options are near expiry    options typically expire on the 3rd friday of the month

inflation will hurt your landlord but it wo n't hurt you in either case you have to pay 7200 regardless of how much inflation has increased over two years   however they are not equivalent to you if you take the monthly payment then you can potentially come out ahead if you were to take the 7200 and put it in a savings account and just pay monthly then you 'll be earning interest that you would n't get if you paid up front   there 's a whole lot of other investment options you could go with too but that 's another question the risk here is that if you go through financial hardship you may be tempted to draw on that 7200 early and come up short for rent one month

the short answer is that you can use student loans for living expenses   joe provides a nice of loans   i would just add that some loans are not only guaranteed but also subsidized   essentially the government buys down the rate of the loan the mechanics are that a financial aid package might consist of grants work study job subsidized and guaranteed loans   one can turn down one or more of the elements of the package   all will be limited in some form the work study will have a maximum number of hours and generally has low pay   many find better deals working in the businesses surrounding the college or starting their own services type business   the grants rarely cover the full cost of tuition and books   the loans will both be limited in amount   it mainly depends on what you qualify for and generally speaking the lower the income the more aid one qualifies for now some students use all their grant all their loan money and buy things that are not necessary   for example are you going to live in the $ dorm or the new fancy apartments that are running $ 800/month   are you going to use the student loan money to buy a car   will it be a new bmw or a 8 year old i see this first hand as i live near a large university   the pubs are filled with college students not working but drinking and eating every night   many of them drive very fancy cars the most onerous example of this is students at the military   attendees have their books and tuition completely paid for   they also receive a stipend and more money can be earned over the summer   they also all qualify for a 35 k student loan in their junior year   just about every kid takes this loan   most of those use the money to buy a car   i know a young lady who did exactly that and so did many of her friends so kids with a starting pay of 45 k also start life with a   buying a nice car in the military is especially silly as they can not drive it while deployed and they are very likely to be deployed   at least however they are guaranteed a starting job with a nice starting pay and upward potential college kids who behave similarly might not have it as good   will they even find work   will the job have the ability to move up   how much security is in the job   one might say that this does not apply to engineers and such but i am working with a fellow with a computer science degree who can not find a job and has not worked in the past 6 months   this even though the market is super hot right now for computer engineers so in a word be very careful what you borrow
