warren buffet is n't using any special sauce he looks for value and ignores hype greed and fear he buys what he knows and looks for companies that generate cash and/or are available for a discount of their true value he explains what he looks for in a company and his reasons for buying it he has said on numerous occasions i look for intrinsic value so there 's your formula human nature is often   irrational and investing seems to bring out the fear and greed i 've always been a bit surprised when people ascribe some sort of sixth sense to warren buffet 's success he just works hard and does n't deviate from a sound strategy be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful and of course rule one do n't lose money it 's not a joke how many people buy high and sell low because of fear and greed when the market tanks buy more finally anyone can invest with buffet without all the work just buy a few shares of brk.a or

it would be useful to forget about the initial price that you invested that loss happened it 's over and irreversible it 's a sunk cost and on it would only cause you to make worse decisions getting back from a loss is done exactly the same as growing an investment that did n't have such a loss you have x units of stock that 's currently priced $ that is your blank slate you need to decide wether you should hold that stock i.e. if $ is undervalued and likely to increase or it 's likely to fall further and you should sell it    the decision you make should be exactly the same as if you 'd bought it a bit earlier for $ 40

for option 2 do you really think you can guarantee an average return of 8 here historical returns are no guarantee of future returns   even if you could get higher returns for option 2 than the interest rate on the mortgage are you able to cover all the additional fees with the pmi in placing such a low down payment the wiser choice in my opinion would be to chose option 1

movie going actual tickets sold in and the theater market has only been kept afloat since then by increasing ticket prices   however the more ticket prices increase it creates a cycle where it 's less attractive to go to the movies and so they have to increase ticket prices again   movie theaters typically cede most of the opening week revenue to the studio so they need some minimum foot traffic so a percent of audience buys the high margin popcorn and drinks   movie studios got wanting to take the movie out of the theater ever faster to multiple revenue generating venues star wars was in the theater a now all but the biggest movies are in what a few weeks costs to a c heat buildings rise big tvs are cheaper every year netflix etc   not to mention the tablet which i watch netflix on more than a big tv and the rise of the formula superhero movie   pure no value added theaters are on the way out in any areas with decent internet   they arose in a time of touring stage entertainment and displaced many a live performance with this new moving picture tech   now they are being displaced by tech just the same   a of restaurant theaters and or next tech theaters and the like will stick around in 25 years as attractions but it just wo n't be the same scale   you can this to how consoles eventually killed the video game even with shittier hardware   it 's happening to retail market crashing down and it happened to small chain book stores cd stores and a bunch of other categories etc   no surprise to anyone that pays attention and thinks the next tech economical step   in the end it 's really up to studios to decide if the movie theater is a relic worth keeping and only if they work jointly and in the end it still might just buy them a few years til it sinks   i do n't think it 's worth keeping   my preferred local one is one of the better ones out of 4 5 3 are small time with limited screens and yet even they have n't replaced the in 15 years and it smells like piss in the summer   this is in one of the richer areas of the country not some ghetto not going to the movies for that bonus

what would happen if you was to cash a check did n’t realize it was    to you and your finance company take it to a local business that has    a money center they cash the check without even having you sign let    alone having the finance companies endorsement on it the money    cleared my account like a couple months ago and it was just brought up    now the reason why the check was made out the owner and the lender is to make sure the repairs were done on the car the lender wants to make sure that their investment is protected   for example you get a six year loan on a new car in the second year you get hit by another driver the damage estimate is $ 1,000 and you decide it does n't look that bad so you decide to skip the repair and spend the money on paying off debts what you do n't know is that if they had done the repair they would have found hidden damage and the repair would have cost $ 3,000 and would have been covered by the other persons insurance   jump ahead 2 years the rust from the skipped repair causes other issues now it will cost $ 5,000 to fix the insurance wo n't cover it and now a car with an outstanding loan balance of $ 4,000 and a value of $ 10,000 if the damage did n't exist needs $ 5,000 to fix   the lender wants the repairs done they would have not signed the check before seeing the proof the repairs were done to their satisfaction but because the check was cashed without their involvement they will be looking for a detailed receipt showing that all the work was done they may require that the repair be done at a certified repair shop with manufacturer parts   if you do n't have a detailed bill ask the repair shop for a copy of the original one

if you plan to keep this asset for ten years then you can take the of its cost over that time period for simplicity lets treat that as 120 monthly payments so at a purchase price of $ 60,000 you are committing around $ 500 per month not including vehicle maintenance i typically allocate around 20 percent of the purchase price of my vehicles for future maintenance costs since you have the cash to purchase this outright you have an option not afforded to most people this adds for additional consideration here is an example   you purchase a $ 60,000 car and put $ 10,000 down you finance $ 50,000 at over 60 months your total finance cost is $ if you do not miss any payments the question here is can you make more than $ on the $ 50,000 that you would retain in this situation over a five year period i know that i most certainly can and is an excellent example of why i finance my vehicles obviously this all goes out the window if you do not have the credit for top rates   i have also negotiated a vehicle maintenance plan with the dealership at the time of my vehicle purchases most dealerships offer this service the key here is negotiating on my last truck i was able to get an all inclusive maintenance policy for 72 months for 8 of the purchase price your mileage will vary with manufacturer and dealership as described in the comments above it is never beneficial for an individual to lease you end up paying more for the newer models i consider that to be a lifestyle choice as it is most certainly not a sound financial decision

you have multiple things going on some of which will work in opposite directions this is a second job for the family so that their income will be added onto of the main income this generally means that the 2nd income has too little tax withheld the tax tables used by employers have no way of handling this situation this 2nd job is being started part way though the tax year so too much in taxes is withheld if they make 2,000 a month for 4 months that would mean 8,000 in income but the tax tables used by the employer withhold at the $ 24,000 per year rate the third issue is the great variation in the number of hours per pay period this means that too much is withheld in checks with the most hours and too little in the ones with the least hours for this year you have a as long as you make the safe harbor levels for federal withholding you can avoid penalties when you file next spring to do so just make sure that the withholding of all the jobs in the family equal or exceed the total income tax for the family last year note this is n't equal to last years withholding or equal to the refund last year but the total tax you should have paid the general advice is to set the smaller income to have 0 exemptions and use the w-4 for the larger income to make adjustments in the past i have done this to make sure that we make the safe harbor level you can make adjustments in the new year once you know what the safe harbor goal is for the rest of the year

well it is a negative point of view but nobody in the history of money has ever loaned money because they like you   i suppose you could paint it as an honest point of view all money lending is for profit   if you have a high score you are very likely to repay your loan because you are lower risk   we always hear lower risk but the risk is that they wo n't make money off of you i think that just like we buy previously owned vehicles cars instead of used cars and we banks call them service fees instead of junk fees our credit score discusses our credit worthiness instead of profitability but none of that means you ca n't benefit from it   it is n't a fear tactic it is a way to judge each other   you probably pay interest and fees to keep it high but that is price of lending i think the questioner has a negative view of credit which i suppose is fine and is their right i will defend their right to an opinion but the way we do and judge credit is neither evil or benevolent i could certainly agree that more transparency would be good but only for honest folks   if the credit bureaus made it public how they judged us there would be a new industry for people who want to game the system update since it always will cost to use credit and using credit is the only way to prove your a low credit risk it will therefore always cost money to raise your credit score however the return on investment is in this question   a person with no credit was able to get a loan but at serious out of pocket cost   later after establishing credit at a price of real money he was able to secure a nearly identical loan for considerably less cost in terms of interest paid because he had proven himself worthy   when i say proven i mean paid interest there is nothing wrong with questioning the system change only occurs when people question the status quo   and for sure our current system is not perfect but like many employed systems while it is terrible but there is nothing better

after a bit of rooting around the hmrc sites i found this page which says this one key difference is that products are classed as electronically supplied services for vat and customs duties these services are for vat purposes the place of supply of these services is the country in which the customer lives if you supply electronic services to a business customer in another european union eu country the customer accounts for any vat due in that country you should not charge uk vat if you supply electronic services to a consumer charity or government body in another eu country you have to account for uk vat if you supply electronic services to anyone in a country outside the eu you do n't pay any vat if as a uk business you buy electronic services from a company outside the uk you have to account for vat if i read this correctly i as the supplier of the website need to account for vat only if the sponsor is a consumer charity or government body in another eu country it is not covered in this site but i assume i must also account for vat for a customer based in the uk   so in answer to the original question a customer from canada which is currently outside the eu would account for the vat themselves and i would simply charge the gross amount

gt i believe transparency when it comes to our food is important    totally agreed here 's my amateur solution   all food companies are required to have the answers to a set of questions available via email or website phone or standard mail those questions are determined by a combination of independent panel and consumer polling what those questions are may change over time allowing for a reasonably generous grace period for the companies to prepare   for example if consumers really have to know what gm ingredients are in their food for whatever asinine reasons then fine require the company to answer if consumers really want to know what color shoes the workers wear then so be it   i also think we need a series of third party organizations rather than the usda organic system we have what 's acceptable and what is n't is super arguable and rather than just taking the standard that exists which imo is not meaningful folks can choose which standard they wish to head combined with the mandated transparency above this would lower costs by removing the need for active investigation and lead to more informed decision making on the part of the consumers

your plan will probably work i speak from past experience approx 5 10 years ago when lloyds used to offer tiered interest of up to 4 on £ 5000 in their vantage accounts it was allowed for an individual person to have up to three vantage accounts the criteria for obtaining the headline interest rates were simply what i and many others did was to set up three vantage accounts call them a b and c and a standing order on each to transfer minimum amount + £ 1 on the same day each month in this manner this satisfied the letter of conditions though perhaps not the spirit most importantly it satisfied the bank and all three accounts received that headline interest rate these days banks have got a little wiser to this and have started including the set up n direct debits condition which makes this a more time consuming system to arrange you must assign your various bills across your accounts but i believe that the overall plan still works they do n't care where the money comes from or whether it stays just that it comes in enough people get it wrong that they do n't have to worry about the few who get it perfectly right see also how 0 balance transfer offers can be profitable

a credit card is essentially a contract where they will loan you money in an on demand basis   it is not a contract for you to loan them money the money that you have overpaid is generally treated as if it is a payment for a charge that you have made that has not been processed yet   the bank can not treat that money as a deposit and thus leverage it make money them selves you can open an account and get a debit card   this would allow you to accrue interest for your deposit while using your money   but if you find one willing to pay you 25 interest please share with the rest of us

does location of ea or cpa matter   not in particular the ftb has field offices all over the state so if a meeting needs to be arranged it will be in the nearest office when you interview the potential candidates you can ask them how they would deal the case if there 's a need of an in person visit to the ftb and if it is even an option you should be worrying about likely not since as you mentioned before you 're in a mail audit process are there websites that rate eas or cpas for example on how many audits they have won or should i simply rely on ratings there 's no winning in audits ideally given the same data any ea or cpa would reach the same result in the discussion re audits with the ftb obviously some are more experienced and some are less and some are specializing on specific types of audits entities etc yelp is a place to start but take the reviews there with a grain of salt since most reviewers are probably there to rant if you see a repetitive pattern in the reviews take that into consideration for example you probably do n't want to hire someone who 's been repeatedly to their clients not returning calls not answering questions being late etc are all eas and cpas equal   no some are some specialize in a specific area some build practice on representation irs or ftb or both some provide a wide range of services from bookkeeping to tax court representation i suggest looking for those who prominently advertise themselves as specializing in your area whatever your type of business is and representation in front of the ftb specialists especially experienced cost much more keep in mind you 'll be getting what you paid for also when you hire a big shot ea cpa check who 's actually going to do the work and how much oversight the big shot is going to provide anything else that i potentially missed any specific questions that i should ask ea or cpa on initial interview for example if my ea cpa could also talk with auditor in case ftb would want to talk directly with taxpayer if possible well that 's the point of representation to represent they should be talking to the ftb in your name you should verify credentials irs for eas ca cba for cpas make sure their license is current you can ask them about their continued education and how much of it is dedicated to the ca state law and ftb regulations ask them about their experience with similar cases overall a decently qualified tax professional should be able to handle a mail audit without an issue in person representation may be harder since it does not only require being competent in the tax law but also have some people skills

asset = equity + income expense + liability everything could be cancelled out in double entry accounting   by your logic if the owner contributes capital as asset equity is very similar to asset   you will end up cancelling everything i.e. 0 = 0   you do not understate liability by cancelling them with asset   say you have $ 10000 debtors and $ 10000 creditors you do not say net debtors = $ 0 on the balance sheet   you are challenging the fundamental concepts of accounting   certain accounts are contra accounts for example accumulated depreciation is contra asset retained loss and unrealized revaluation loss is contra equity

the answer depends on what is your portfolio 's objective    if you are operating a multi asset class portfolio i.e. your portfolio has both bonds and stocks and are targeting absolute returns then yes comparing a stock 's beta or correlation to a bond benchmark makes sense what you do with this stock 's bond beta information further depends on what kind of return profile you want your multi asset class portfolio to have if you want stocks that appreciate in price when bond prices decline then of course you want to buy negative bond beta stocks   if you are operating a purely relative equity portfolio i.e. you are to the stock market then comparing the bond beta is of little use to you   hope this helps

this is very much possible and happens quite a lot in the us for example promotional offers by credit card companies where you pay no interest on the balance for a certain period are a very common thing the lender gains a new customer on such a loan and usually earns money from the spending via the merchant fees specifically for credit cards at least the pro is obviously free money the con is that this is usually for a short period of time longest i 've seen was 15 months after which if you 're not careful high interest rates will be charged in some cases interest will be charged retroactively for the whole period if you do n't pay off the balance or miss the minimum payment due

many mortgages penalize early payment and i assume it 's possible to disallow it altogether it makes sense why they do n't want early payment if you pay off the loan early it is usually because you re financed it to a loan with a lower rate you would do this when the interest rate is low lower than when you got your original loan if you pay it off early that means they will have to re invest the money again or they will lose money if they just have it sitting around however recall above that people pay it off early when the interest rate is low that is the worst time for them to re invest this into another mortgage because the rate will not be as good for them as the one you were originally going to keep paying

this question is indeed rather complicated let 's simplify it a little bit paying down your mortgage makes sense if your expected return in the rest of your portfolio is less than the cost of the mortgage in many cases people may also decide to pay down their mortgage because they are risk averse and do not like carrying debt there 's no tax benefit to doing so though canada does n't generally allow you to write off mortgage interest unlike the u.s. as to keeping money in the corporation or not i 'm not going to address that i do n't have a firm enough understanding of corporate taxation canadian couch potato advises treating all of your investment assets as one large portfolio that is what you are trying to do here however let 's consider a different approach if you do not have enough money to max out your rrsp or tfsa you may choose to keep your tfsa for an emergency fund where the money is kept highly liquid keep your cash in an interest bearing tfsa or perhaps invest it in the money market inside your tfsa then use your rrsp for the rest of your investment money split according to your investment goals this is not the most tax efficient approach but it is nice and simple but you are looking for the most tax efficient approach so let 's assume you have enough to more than max out your tfsa and rrsp contributions and all of your investments are going toward your retirement which is at least a decade away because you are not taxed on your investment income from rrsps until you withdraw the money or tfsa it makes sense to hold the least tax efficient investments there tax advantaged investments such as canadian equities should be held in your investment accounts outside of tfsa and rrsps again the canadian couch potato has a great article on where to put your investment assets that article covers interest dividends foreign dividends and capital gains as well as rrsps resps and tfsas that article recommends holding canadian equities in a taxable account reits in a tax sheltered account tfsa or rrsp bonds gics and money market funds in a tax sheltered account as these count as interest the article goes into rather more detail than this and is worth checking out it mentions the 15 withholding tax on us listed etfs for example in addition to that website i recommend the following three books the above three resources strongly advocate passive indexed investments which i like but not everyone agrees with all three specifically discuss tax implications which is why i include them here

your question has already been answered you divide the amount of shares you own 100 by the total amount of shares however i feel it is somewhat misleading to talk about owning a percentage of the company by owning shares strictly speaking shares do not entitle you to a part of the company but instead give you a proportional amount of votes at shareholder meetings assuming no funky share classes what this means is that someone who owns 30 of a company 's shares ca n't just grab 30 of the company 's assets factories offices and whatever and say that they are entitled to own this what they actually own is 30 of the voting rights in this company this means that they control 30 of all available votes when the company calls a vote on corporate actions choosing a new director etc which is how shareholders exert their influence on a company

ianal but i had heard and would appreciate someone more qualified commenting on this that one reason these things were often found unenforceable is that there is no consideration   the contract is to bind you for your work each day but once you stop working they you have a continued obligation that your time at the company   claiming that your day to day compensation covers this is as if to say some part of that compensation is not for your work but to pay you for not going elsewhere   it would be nice to see at minimum a requirement to separate these two concepts into separate contracts as bundling them creates a blur and most importantly does n't allow you to negotiate or walk away from the terms of one part without the other   at the heart of any market which the job market purports to be is a sense that a fair price is reached when both parties can walk away from a bad deal this is not so in the case of employment because as said a hungry man is not a free man so someone who needs to eat or feed a family has a need to take an offer that is already their acceptance of work and this quasi duress is compounded when a company can attach additional pressures that work that person 's ability to fairly negotiate possible improvements of what may already have been a bad situation   i 'm of the impression that duress itself has been argued to be a reason to hold a contract invalid   but more and generally any time two parties are bargaining i 'm not sure the legal definition but intuitively i 'd say where one party has the ability to force a contract change and the other party is not then those terms have to be suspect   also for the special case the pay is anything near minimum wage i would suggest asking the question of whether the part of the compensation that is salary not keeping you from working for the competition is the wage paid consistent with minimum wage or does it have to draw from the pool of money that is not about wage but is about incentivizing you to not move   and finally if they stop paying you and each day you 've been paid a little to work and a little to incentivize you to leave then are you getting a continued revenue stream to continue to incentivize you not to work for the competition if not there would seem again not to be consideration   as i said i 'm not an expert in this i just follow such matters sometimes in the news but i do n't see these issues getting discussed here and i hope we 'll see some useful responses from the crowd here and also the smart folks at reddit can help through their discussions to form some useful political and legal to help individuals overcome what is really a moral outrage on this matter   capitalism is an often cruel engine   i worked at a company where one of the bosses said to me after contributing really great things that added structurally in fundamental ways to the company do n't tell me what you 've done tell me what you 've done lately capitalism makes people scrap every day to prove their worth so it 's morally an outrage to see it also trying even as it beats down the price of someone and tells them they are n't entitled to better to tell them that they may not go somewhere else that thinks they are better that is not competition and it is not fair     indentured servitude not slavery is more technically correct and yet it is a push to treat people like capital so slavery is not inappropriate   the topic is non competes but really it 's about businesses not wanting to have to compete for employees that is about businesses not wanting capitalism to prevail in hiring   sorry for the length

since you are not yet legally married he is a stranger to you and strictly speaking you do n't need to worry about the tax impact of his income yet file on your income alone that said you may have to address the money transfer aspect at a later date as banks are getting around money laundering regulations it 's really best if he has his own account for this especially given you are not married the worst case scenario is that his income gets frozen due to money laundering regulations and the deposits in your account get treated as unreported monetary gifts to you again you should be able to argue out of this but separate accounts make it much easier to do so

sure user data is valuable but valuable enough to be their business model the math does n't add up   if the data is that valuable then why even charge users in the first place letting people in free would certainly generate even more data definitely more than what they would have gotten at their $ 10 price point if they get twice as many people to jump in at the free price level not a far fetched assumption then they would make enough additional money to justify giving it away   and after a certain point additional data stops being statistically significant while costs continue to mount paying for all those additional tickets   furthermore the ceo has already said that their business model is to share the additional revenue with the theaters   i 'm not saying that they wo n't mine their data they would be fools not to and they will definitely be able to monetize it but it 's not possible for that alone to be their business model how can it every time they send someone to a new movie it costs them the full ticket price

to the best of my knowledge in california there 's no such thing as registering a place as a business there 's zoning residential commercial mixed etc and there 's a business registered at a place but there 's no place registered as a business so you better clarify what it is that you think your landlord did it may be that the place is used for short term rentals in which case the landlord may have to have registered a business of short term rentals there depending on the local municipal or county rules specifically regarding the deposit however there 's a very clear treatment in the california law the landlord must provide itemized receipt for the amounts out of the deposit that were used and the prices should be reasonable and based on the actual charges by the actual vendors if you did n't get such a receipt or the amounts are bogus and unsubstantiated you have protection under the ca law

loan officer here yes you pay the per diem i 'd recommend not paying it off for like 6 months you can pay it down to basically nothing and then hold it for six months and pay it off better for credit if it 's a simple interest rate most car loans are multiply the current principal balance by the interest rate and divide it by 365 that 's the per diem or daily interest for example 10,000 dollar auto loan at 3 10000 300 so each day the balance is 10k the loan cost 82 cents so in a month your first payment is 100 dollars goes to interest goes to principal then the new principal is so the next month another 30 days with the new per diem of the 100 payment is in principal in interest and so on

i feel dividends are better for shareholders the idea behind buy backs is that future profits are split between fewer shares thereby increasing the value not necessarily price that 's a market function of the remaining shares this that the company then retires the shares it repurchases but quite often buybacks simply offset dilution from stock option compensation programs in my opinion some stock option compensation is acceptable but overuse of this becomes a form of wealth transfer from the shareholder to management the opposite of shareholder friendly but let 's assume the shares are being retired that 's good but at what cost the company must use cashflow cash to pay for the shares the buyback is only a positive for shareholders if the shares are undervalued managers can be very astute in their own sphere running their business estimating a reasonable range of intrinsic value for their shares is a difficult and very subjective task requiring many assumptions about future revenue and margins a few managers like warren buffett are very competent capital but most managers are n't that good in this area and being so close to the company they 're often overly optimistic so they end up overpaying if a company 's shares are worth say $ 30 it 's not unreasonable to assume they may trade all around that number maybe as low as $ 15 and as high as $ 50 this is overly simplistic but assuming the value does n't change that the company is in steady state mode then the $ 30 point the intrinsic value estimate will act as a for the market price eventually it toward the value point well if management does n't understand this they could easily pay $ 50 for the repurchased stock heck companies routinely just continue buying stock with no apparent regard for the price they 're paying this is one of the quickest ways to shareholder capital overpaying for dubious acquisitions is another dividends on the other hand require no estimates they ca n't mask other activities other agendas they do n't transfer wealth from shareholders to management us companies traditionally pay quarterly and they try very hard not to cut the dividend many companies grow the dividend steadily at a rate several times that of inflation the dividend is an actual cash expenditure there 's no gaap reporting to get in the way of what 's really going on the company must be fiscally conservative and responsible or risk not having the cash when they need to pay it out the shareholder gets the cash and can then reinvest as he she sees fit with available opportunities at the time including buying more shares of the company if undervalued but if overvalued the money can be invested in a better safer opportunity

i 'll start with the bottom line below the line i 'll address the specific issues becoming a us tax resident is a very serious decision that has significant consequences for any non american with > $ 0 in assets when it involves cross border business interests it becomes even more significant especially if switzerland is involved the us has driven at least one iconic swiss financial institution out of business for us tax residents from the irs fincen so in a nutshell you need to learn and be afraid of the following and many more the best thing for you would be to find a good us tax adviser there are several large us tax firms in the uk handling the us expats there go to one of those and get a proper assessment of all your risks and get a proper advice you can get burnt really hard if you do n't prepare and plan properly now here 's that bottom line q will i have to submit the accounts for the swiss business even    though i m not on the payroll and the business makes hardly any    profit each year i can of course get our accounts each year but    they will be in swiss german that 's actually not a trivial question depending on the ownership structure and your legal status within the company all the company 's bank accounts may be reportable on fbar see link above you may also be required to file form q will i need to have this translated is there any format procedure    to this will it have to be translated by my swiss accountants and    if so which parts of the documentation need to be translated all us forms are in english if you 're required to provide supporting documentation during audit or if the form instructions require it with filing you 'll need to translate it and have the translation certified depending on what you need your accountant will guide you i was told that if i sell the business and property after i a    that i will be liable to 15 tax of the profit i 'd made   q is this correct no you will be liable to pay income tax the rate of the tax depends on the kind of property and the period you held it for it may be 15 it may be 39 depends on a lot of factors it may also be 0 in some cases i    also understand that any tax paid on selling in switzerland will be    deducted from the 15 may be may be not what you 're talking about is called foreign tax credit the rules for calculating the credit are not exactly trivial and from my personal experience you can most definitely end up being paying tax in both the us and switzerland without the ability to utilize the credit in full again talk to your tax adviser ahead of time to plan things in the most optimal way for you i will effectively have all the paperwork for this as we 'll need to    do the same in switzerland but again it will be in swiss german q would this be a problem if its presented in swiss german of course if you need to present it again most likely only in case of audit you 'll have to have a translation translating stuff is not a problem usually costs $ per page depending on complexity unless a lot of money involved i doubt you 'll need to translate more than balance sheet bank statement i know this is a very unique set of questions so if you can shed any    light on the matter it would be greatly appreciated not unique at all you 're not the first and not the last to to the us however you need to understand that the issue is very complex taxes are complex everywhere but especially so in the us i suggest you not do anything before talking to a us licensed cpa ea whose practice is to work with the eu uk expats to the us or us expats to the uk eu

the is per year not per month not too bad for a regular savings but it 's just interest rates in general that are bad right now the inflation rate should be 3.8 currently so if you hide your money in a bank you 'll end up with a loss of 2 in buying power in a year if you open an cd certificate of deposit the best apy would be around 2.2 for a 5 years one and you will still get hit by the inflation you might want to invest those money somewhere else and in some other ways the stock market might give you excellent entry points soon if not right now but since you 're very young and inexperienced i strongly recommend to do tons of research and ask for advice from experienced people before you jump into these kind of things by yourself

usually their pe ratio will just be listed as 0 or blank   though i 've always wondered why they do n't just list the negative pe as from a straight math standpoint it makes sense pe while it can be a useful barometer for a company but certainly does not tell you everything   a company could have negative earnings for a lot of reasons some good and some bad   the company could just be a bad company and could be losing money hand over fist or the company could have had a one time occurrence such as a big acquisition or some other event that just affected this years earnings or they could be an awesome high growth company that is heavily investing for their future and forgoing locking in profits now for much bigger profits in the future generally ipo company 's fall into that last category as they are going public usually because they want an influx of cash that they are going to use to grow the company much more rapidly   so they are likely already taking all incoming $ $ and taking on debt to grow the company and have exceeded all of those options and that 's when they turn to the stock market for the additional influx of cash so it is very common for these companies not to have earnings    now you just have to decide if that company is investing that money wisely and will in the future translate to actual earnings

the reason is n't because of the gold standard the real reason is because we have seen a sharp increase in fruit imports over the past 5 decades   huh agriculture is down to single digits as part of the gdp what does that have to do with a gold standard and monetary policy   is up rather dramatically as compared to 40 years ago maybe you mean manufacturing   productivity is up since say the turn of the century but this is to be expected since we incorporated electricity oil automobiles and eventually computers    but as soon as the usa left the gold exchange standard total factor productivity began to dramatically stagnate    that means the growth in productivity    you can see this best here   think of productivity like gdp it used to be 5 and was on its way to 6 but right as we went off the gold standard productivity increases stagnated and by 2007 we 're only at 5.5 instead of the expected 6 this uses a logarithmic function wherein 6 is 10x more than 5 so while productivity has not fallen in an absolute sense growth in productivity which is more important than absolute gdp growth has fallen and is infact related to a decrease in productivity growth   gt;the reason you 're seeing the gains over the past several years shifting towards the rich is due to a combination of tax policy and a rise in cronyism caused by our campaign financing problems big businesses often have a lot of lobbying power to get laws passed that ultimately are felt by the rest of the economy    the reason it has shifted to the rich is because as the currency has debased the gains have gone towards the biggest companies wealthiest individuals assisted by government which works like an auction house to those with connections which is why lobbying roi is huge   currency is a good thing for countries like the united states we can safely finance and pay our debts for a few more years while up debt without fear of hyperinflation    because our massive debt is doing so well for us in the beginning it looks nice because there is very little pain and is practically but as we see current events playing out in the us and to a greater extent europe which is nt as tightly economically as the us fiat currency has huge problems hyperinflation of commodities and deflation of assets are before our eyes house values are plummeting medical education consumer goods are inflating not quite to the hyper part but inflation is increasing and only when commodities such as oil see a deflation in demand as we see right now does inflation look under control shadow inflation is very much alive   if you have dollars in savings the rates do not even outpace inflation you are forced into riskier and investments to make a return   gt;now there may be a lot to gripe about how the united states is currently spending its money but it 's established practical fact that government investment can spur growth level out recessions help people etc   established over what the last 40 years that s hardly enough time to call practical fact when the gold standard existed for hundreds and thousands of years infact no fiat currency that has ever existed has survived that is the real fact and the dollar and euro themselves are currently going through the end stages of this cancer    the gold standard sucks it has a lot of problems fiat currency rocks for the usa because usa fuck yeah we are in a particular advantage where the real risks of fiat currency do n't really apply to the usa   55 million on food stamps with 20 30 million more on other forms of government assistance such as unemployment and welfare unemployment increasing gdp growth decreasing median income decreasing total employment stagnant same number of full time wage earners exist today as in 2000 despite 30 + million more american citizens decreased consumer confidence average age of cars on the road went from 5 years in the 1960s to 12 years today people do nt buy new cars as frequently meaning less disposable income decreased home ownership increased retirement age decreased young american employment   i am not sure why you think that the usa is in such a great position the american dream is if you 're just starting out in life just ask any number of recent college grads who are increasingly living with parents not getting married and ca n't find jobs

before starting with investing you should make sure you are saving enough   living in a welfare country france does not exempt you from potentially needing to save large amounts of money you state that you do not need much of an emergency day fund but this is not true   being dismissed from your job is not the only way to become unemployed and not all roads lead to unemployment pay   being fired for cause or leaving your job voluntarily are two work related causes that will leave you without an income source   unexpected major expenses are another reason you might need to dip into your emergency fund if your emergency fund is in order the next thing to investigate is your pension and saving for retirement   in a country with a strong pension system you need to check how comfortable you are with its sustainability greece anyone and also whether it will adequately meet your needs   if not there are no 401ks or iras in france but there is a relatively new personal supplementary pension plan that you might investigate contributing to if you 're comfortable with your emergency fund and your retirement savings then preparing for buying a house is likely your next savings goal   a quick search shows that to get a mortgage to buy a house in france banks will commonly require a downpayment of 20 plus various closing costs   see for example here   this is 40,000 + euro for a 200k euro house which will take you several years at the rate of 500 euro month   france has special plans plan with tax exempt interest for saving up for a house that you might want to investigate in your other question you also ask about buying a cheap car   as you get older and possibly start a family having a car will likely become more of a necessity   this is another goal you can save for rather than having to take a loan out when you buy one

i 'm curious to know if you or any of your relatives have ever been declared as being mentally ill or having a psychological disorder    worst case scenario let 's say it is a con operation in that case that just makes all of the other people who aided them look smart and the general i already agree with look stupid    if most of psychology is all bs then that just makes everyone else stupid for spending all of their money to get treated and really if we are that stupid stupid enough to believe such a huge lie i would then agree with the 25 of americans suffer from mental illness statement because you have to be pretty stupid to be told such a huge lie and not figure it out    another thing if it is so easy to tell that psychology is a scam then why is there in general cross from physics biology history language medicine etc acceptance of psychology as a science

what are my options for raising the funds assuming you have decent credit you can either mortgage your home or apply for a land loan in order to purchase the land since both your home and the land have value either one can act as collateral in case you default on your loan land loans tend to have a higher interest rate and down payment however this is because banks see land loans as a riskier investment since it 's easier for you to walk away from an empty plot of land than your own home

no an entrepreneur actually adds value whereas stock ownership does not buying stocks is akin to gambling except with different rules and an average positive return over time whereas normal casino gambling always has a net negative result on average   to put it shortly   if it does n't make a difference whether its you or john from across the corner doing the action then its basically a speculation with investment as an alias you 're merely the purse   if you are involved in the running of the project taking decisions organizing putting your time and creativity in then you 're an entrepreneur   in this case its clear to see that different persons will have different results so they matter as persons and not just as purses   note that if you buy enough stock to actually have a say in the running of the company then you 're crossing the threshold there

the most obvious use of a collateral is as a risk buffer just as when you borrow money to buy a house and the bank uses the house as a collateral so when people borrow money to loan financial instruments or as is more accurate gain leverage the lender keeps a percentage of that or an equivalent instrument as a collateral in the event that the borrower falls short of margin requirements brokers in most cases have the right to sell that collateral and mitigate the risk   derivatives contracts like any other financial instrument come with their risks and depending on their nature they may sometimes be much more riskier than their underlying instruments for example while a common stock 's main risk comes from the movements in its price which may itself result from many other macro micro economic factors an option in that common stock faces risks from those factors plus the volatility of the stock 's price   to cover this risk lenders apply much higher haircuts when lending against these derivatives in many cases depending upon the notional exposure of the derivative that actual dollar amount of the collateral may be more than the face value or the market value of the derivatives contract usually this collateral is deposited not as the derivatives contract itself but rather as the underlying financial instrument an equity in case of an option a bond in case of a cds and so on this allows the lender to offset the risk by executing a trade on that collateral itself

i strongly doubt that being executor will make the assets of the estate vulnerable to a suit against him personally the estate is it 's own separate legal entity with its own tin only creditors against the estate itself can make claims against it and after all creditors are paid then the balance is distributed in accordance with the terms of the will unless he has commingled assets and treated estate assets as his own the legal separation should be quite strong   whether his personal assets are at risk remember that the opposition will likely overstate their case to try to scare him into settling if the business was organized as an llp or llc his personal assets should be pretty safe if it was a sole proprietorship he has occasion to worry

i 've done this in az it 's important to know which lender is foreclosing because if it 's not the most senior one then your purchase can later be foreclosed a foreclosure all junior interests but can itself be extinguished by a more senior interest i may not have the correct terms here but you get the idea you should also check to be sure property taxes are current they are probably being paid by the original lender but it would n't hurt to check make sure you understand the requirements for participation in the auction in my case they required that i bring a $ 10 k cashier 's check made out to myself on winning the auction i endorsed the check over to the auction company and had to come up with the remaining funds in cash the property i bought had been previously sold at a sheriff 's sale to satisfy a judgment in favor of the homeowner 's association for delinquent dues the hoa bought the property at the auction and received a sheriff 's deed at this point the original owner 's interest in the property was extinguished nevertheless the original mortgage and deed of trust were still in place being senior to the hoa 's interest about a year later the lender foreclosed on the property and i bought it at auction at the courthouse this had the effect of the hoa 's interest a fact that took some explaining to the water utility to get the account in my name

specific stock advice is n't permitted on these boards i 'm discussing the process of a call spread with the apple jan 13 calls as an example   in effect you have $ 10 to bet each bet you 'd construct offers a different return odds for example if you bought the $ 750 call at $ you 'd need to look to find what strike has a bid of $ 27 or higher the $ is bid $ so this particular spread is a 4 to 1 bet the stock will close in january over $ with a $ 760 break even   you can pull the number from yahoo to a spreadsheet to make your own chart of spread costs but i 'll give one more example   you think it will go over $ 850 and that strike is now ask $ the highest strike currently listed is $ and it 's bid $ so this spread cost is $ 850 and a close over $ returns $ 8000 or over 9 to 1   again this is not advice just an analysis of how spreads work note any anomalies in the pricing above is the effect of a particular strike having no trades today not every strike is active so last trade can be days old    note my answer adds to 's response in that once you used the word bet and showed a desire to make a risky move options are the answer you acknowledged you understand the basic concept but given the contract size of 100 shares these suggestions are ways to bet under your $ 1000 limit and profit from the gain in the underlying stock you hope to see

one difference is in the ability to split the pre tax and after tax portions of the traditional account note that earnings in a traditional ira or traditional 401(k are always pre tax even if it was earned from after tax money so if you left the money for some amount of time after an after tax contribution chances are it 's a mix of pre tax and after tax money when you take money out of a traditional ira including for conversion to a roth ira you are generally subject to the pro rata rule which means that your withdrawal will consist of pre tax and after tax amounts in the same proportion as in your whole traditional ira this means that a conversion of a traditional ira with any mix of pre tax and after tax amounts will always be taxed on a portion of the withdrawal the pre tax portion and it will leave some after tax amounts in the traditional ira unless you take everything out the only way to separate the pre tax and after tax amounts is to roll over to a traditional 401(k if you have a 401(k plan that allows this rules say that only pre tax amounts can be rolled over into a 401(k so only pre tax amounts are rolled over and if you roll over all the pre tax amounts only after tax amounts will remain on the other hand when you rollover your entire traditional 401(k to iras you can choose to have the pre tax portion rolled over to a traditional ira and the after tax portion rolled over to a roth ira separating them due to irs notice 2014 54

since most of the answers are flawed in their logic i decided to respond here 1 what if you lose your job you ca n't pay back the loan the point of the question was to reduce the amount paid per month so obviously it would be easier to pay off the 401k loan rather than the 3 separate loans that are in place now also it 's stated in the question that there 's a mortgage a child with medical costs a car loan student loans other debt on the list of priorities the 401k loan does not make the top 10 concerns if they lost their job 2 consider stopping the 401k contribution this is such a terrible idea if you make the full contribution to the 401k and then just withdraw from the 401k rather than getting a loan you only pay a 10 penalty tax you still get 90 of the company match 3 you lose compound interest while currently the interest you get on a 401k depending on how that money is invested is higher than the interest you pay on your loans which means it would be advantageous to keep the loans and keep contributing to the 401k it 's very unreliable and might even go down i think you actually have a good case for getting a loan against the 401k if a you have your spending and budget under control b your income is consistent c you are certain that the loan will be paid back my suggestion would be to take a loan against the 401k but keep the current spending on the loans consistent if you do n't need the extra $ 150 per month you really should try to pay off the loans as fast as you can if you do need the $ 150 extra you are lowering the mental threshold for getting more loans in the future

in the united states regulation of broker dealer credit is dictated by regulation t that for a non margin account 100 of a trade must be funded finra has supplemented that regulation with an rider rule rule which reads no member shall permit a customer other than a broker dealer or a designated      account to make a practice directly or indirectly of effecting transactions in a cash      account where the cost of securities purchased is met by the sale of the same securities      no member shall permit a customer to make a practice of selling securities with them in a      cash account which are to be received against payment from another broker dealer where      such securities were purchased and are not yet paid for a member transferring an      account which is subject to a regulation t 90-day freeze to another member firm shall      inform the receiving member of such 90-day freeze it is only funds from sold equities that are prohibited from being used to purchase securities this means that an equity in one 's account that is settled can be sold and can be purchased only with settled funds   once the amount required to purchase is in excess of the amount of settled funds no more purchases can be made so an equity sold by an account with settled funds can be repurchased immediately with the settled funds so long as the settled funds can fund the purchase margin a closed position is not considered a long or short since it is an account with one loan of security and one asset of security and one cash loan and one cash liability with the excess or deficit equity equal to any profit or loss respectively thus to the market only to the creditworthiness of the clearing settling chain only open positions are considered longs or shorts a long being a possession of a security and a short being a liability because they are exposed to the market since unsettled funds are not considered longs or shorts they are not by previous trades thus only the reg t rules apply to new and current positions cash vs margin a cash account can not purchase with unsettled funds   a margin account can   this means that a margin account could theoretically do an infinite amount of trades using unsettled funds   a cash account 's daily purchases are restricted to the amount of settled funds so once those are exhausted no more purchases can be made the opposite is true for cash accounts as well   unsettled securities can not be sold either in summation unsettled assets can not be traded in a cash account

just to aid your searching note that what your employer has provided you with access to is a group personal pension now as to the question of whether partial transfers from a to a sipp are possible the answer would appear to be probably yes however you should contact the pension administrator at your employer who will be able to give both the employer 's and the scheme 's points of view and also the sipp provider you are considering to get a definitive answer i 'm basing this on the results i 'm seeing googling for partial transfer eg partial transfer from group pension possible and is it possible to transfer add to that the fact that one of the largest uk sipp providers explicitly includes a partial transfer checkbox on their pension transfer form

someone has to hand out cash to the seller even if no physical money changes hands and i 've bought a house i can tell you a lot of money changes hands at closing in at least the form of a personal check and regardless of exactly how the bank accounts for the actual disbursement of the loan the net result is that the buyer has cash that they give the seller and are now in debt to the bank for least that amount but they now have a house now the bank probably did n't have that money just sitting in its vault money sitting in a vault is money that is not making more money for the bank therefore most banks keep only fractionally more than the percentage of deposit balances that they are required to keep by the feds there are also restrictions on what depositors money can be spent on and loans are not one of them the model of taking in money in savings accounts and then loaning it out is what caused the savings and loan collapse in the 80s so to get the money it turns to investors the bank sells bonds putting itself in debt to bond holders then takes that money and loans it out at a higher rate covering the interest on the bond and making itself a tidy profit for its own shareholders banks lose money on defaults in two ways first they lose all future interest payments that would have been made on the loan technically this is n't revenue until the interest is calculated for each month and accrues on the loan therefore it does n't show on the balance sheet one way or the other however the holders of those bonds will expect a return and the banks no longer have the mortgage payment to cover the coupon payments that they themselves have to pay bondholders creating cash flow problems the second and far more real and damaging way that banks lose money on a foreclosure is the loss of collateral value a bank virtually never offers an unsecured signature loan for a house certainly not at the advertised 3 4 interest rates they want something to back up the loan so if you disappear off the face of the earth they have a clear claim to something that can help them recover their money usually that 's the house itself if you default they get the house from you and sell it to recover their money now a major cause of foreclosure is economic downturn like the one we had in 2009 and are still recovering from when the economy goes in the crapper a lot of things we generally consider stores of value lose that value because the value of the any really is based on what someone else would pay to have it when fewer people are looking to buy that demand drops bringing prices with it homes and real estate are one of the real big ticket items subject to this loss of value when the average joe does n't know whether he 'll have a job tomorrow he does n't go house hunting this average joe may even be looking to sell an extra parcel of land or an income property for cash increasing supply further decreasing prices economic downturn can often increase crime and decrease local government spending on upkeep of public lands as well as homeowners upkeep of their own property by the broken window effect this makes the neighborhood even less desirable in a vicious cycle what made this current recession a double whammy for mortgage lenders is that it was caused in large part by a housing bubble cheap money for houses made housing prices balloon rapidly and then when the money became more expensive such as in sub prime arms a lot of those loans which should never have been signed off on by either side went belly up between the loss of home value a lot of which will likely turn out to be permanent that 's the problem with a bubble things never recover to their peak and the adjustment of interest rates on mortgages to terms that will actually pay off the loan many homeowners found themselves so far underwater and sinking fast that the best financial move for them was to walk away from the whole thing and try again in seven years now the bank 's in a they have this loan they 'll never see repaid in cash and they have this home that 's worth maybe 75 of the mortgage 's outstanding balance if they 're lucky some homes in extremely distressed areas like detroit are currently trading for 30 40 of what they sold for just before the bubble burst multiply that by say 100,000 distressed homes with similar declines in value and you 're talking about tens of billions of dollars in losses on top of that the guarantor basically the bank 's insurance company against these types of losses is now in financial trouble themselves because they took on so many contracts for debt that turned out to be bad aig fannie freddie they may very well declare bankruptcy and leave the bank holding the bag even if the guarantor remains solvent as they did thanks to generous taxpayer bailouts the bank 's swap contract with the guarantor usually requires them to sell the house thus realizing the loss between what they paid and what they finally got back before the guarantor will pay out but nobody 's buying houses anymore because prices are on their way down the only people who 'd buy a house now versus a year from now or two or three years are the people who have no choice and if you have no choice you 're probably in a financial situation that would mean you 'd never be approved for the loan anyway in order to get rid of them the bank has to sell them at auction for pennies on the dollar that further increases the supply of cheap homes and further drives down prices making even the nicer homes the bank 's willing to keep on the books worth less there 's a reason these homes were called toxic assets they 're poisonous to the banks whether they keep or sell them meanwhile all this price depression is now affecting the people who did everything right even people who bought their homes years before the bubble even formed are watching years of equity building go down the crapper that 's to say nothing of the people with prime credit who bought at just the wrong time when the bubble was at its peak even without an adjusting arm to contend with these guys are still facing the fact that they paid top dollar for a house that likely will not be worth its purchase price again in their lifetime even with a fixed mortgage rate they 'll be underwater effectively losing their entire payment to the bank as if it were rent for much longer than it would take to have this entire mess completely behind them if they just walked away from the whole thing moved back into an apartment and waited it out so these guys decide on a strategic default give the bank the house which does n't cover the outstanding balance of course and if they sue file bankruptcy that really makes the banks nervous if people who did everything right are considering the hell of foreclosure and bankruptcy to be preferable to their current state of affairs the bank 's main threat keeping people in their homes is hollow that makes them very reluctant to sign new mortgages because the risk of default is now much less certain now people who do want houses in this market ca n't buy them further reducing demand further decreasing prices you get the idea that 's the housing collapse in a nutshell and what banks and our free market have been working through for the past five years with only the of a turnaround picking up home sales

you could evaluate the risk exposure of your uk bank reading this post and this other old one they basically say that uk bank exposure to greece is less than 6 billions pounds boe data so there is no reason to be worried now the main issue of this crisis is not the greek exit from the euro on its own it seems to be considered almost a fact by citi and by ms at 35 probability ex ceo of says the possibility are more than 50 the main issue is that other countries like italy and spain might follow the same fate if they do the exposure of many foreign banks including the uk ones to their debts is not negligible billions pounds for uk banks moreover other eu banks even the german ones exposed to italy and to spain will suffer too and this suffering will be translated into more suffering for uk banks exposed also to germany and to france that 's why you read euro doom articles like this one from paul krugman who won a nobel memorial prize in economics

does it cost money to refi i know there are quite a few deals out there i in june for $ 500 not bad but sometimes can cost couple grand if so you have up front costs plus the cost of the personal loan that probably would break even at some point after your refi but at what point will you sell before then or even think about it or would you break even next year then its a no brainer as mentioned by others do the numbers

you have a couple of options auto investing in an open end mutual fund   some companies may waive a minimum if you sign up for an automatic investing e.g. t. rowe price will waive its minimum if you agree to invest $ 100/month   there may be some lower ones out there as well some brokers like sharebuilder have programs where someone could auto invest getting fractional shares with each purchase   however something to consider is what percentage is it costing you to buy each time as it may be quite a bit of friction if you are paying $ 4 a purchase and only buying $ 40 this is 10 of your investment being eaten up in costs that i 'd highly advise taking the first option

i am a believer in stocks for the long term i sat on the s&p right though the last crash and am 15 below the high before the crash   for individual stocks you need to look more closely and often ask yourself about its valuation the trick is to buy right and not be afraid to sell when the stock appears to be too high for the underlying fundamentals before the dotcom bubble i bought motorola at $ 40 sold some at $ 80 $ 100 and out at $ 120 coworkers who bought in were laughing as it went to $ 160 but soon after the high tech bubble burst and my sales at $ 100 looked good in hindsight the stock you are looking at would you buy more at today 's price if not it may be time to sell at least some of that position

i 'll echo many factors brand there are generally two levels of pricing major brand and discount brand you can generally expect the discount brand to cost about 5 10 cents less per gallon in the same neighborhood as major brand gas this is for a number of sub factors chief among them is that not all are created equal a lot of the major brands shell chevron bp exxon have proprietary and cleaning agents that the discount brands do not they 're also generally closer to the real rating of the gas have less ethanol you 'll see the sign that says contains up to 10 ethanol the bargain brands are right up at that limit while the top tier brands keep it lower and have stricter requirements about storage tank maintenance anyone who tells you that all gas is the same send em my way i tried to save a few buying the cheaper stuff and now my car needs an engine overhaul because of causing premature wear a couple of my co workers got a fuel system overhaul free from the local supermarket because the storage tank was n't properly and they got water into their gas tanks market price yes this is of course a factor generally gas prices at the pump rise very quickly when the market price of crude or gasoline goes up then fall more slowly than the market price because the margins on gas sales for a c store are very slim when prices change the c stores lose either way when prices rise they have to pay more than they got from the last to buy the next one and when prices fall they do n't recoup the cost of their current tank by quickly increasing the price to match commodities market prices then gradually lowering them over time even if the market collapses they mitigate the losses both ways overhead a gas station right next to a highway probably had to pay more for that land both to buy lease it and in property taxes nicer newer cleaner stations generally have to pay more to stay that way the higher your operating costs the more you 'll have to charge for your gas you can usually do so because the nicer station will attract customers willing to pay a few cents more for the nicer facilities taxation most states charge a tax on gasoline in addition to a federal tax on gas that revenue either goes into the state 's general fund or is earmarked for transportation costs like road maintenance california 's gas prices are sky high across the state because they have the highest gas tax i 'm not sure colorado wyoming and have gas taxes at all proximity to other stations no matter what you have to pay for the land and facilities if there 's another station across the street you have to be within a penny of their price or people will vote with their feet while predatory pricing taking a loss on sales in one area by profits elsewhere in order to drive out competition is technically illegal you see it all the time in the c store industry and it is very difficult to prove this is a primary cause of neighborhood to neighborhood changes a c store will look around the other stations on their street corner and the ones down the road a block or two each direction when determining what they can sell gas for that day the guy five blocks down has a completely different pool of competing stations population distribution with a lot of people in a particular area there 's a big pie of customer dollars for c stores to compete for this generally leads to increased prices because the stations do n't have to be as cutthroat regardless of how good your price is you have only so many pumps and at some point people will pay more to use the open pump than wait for the cheaper one the reverse is true in rural areas with only two stations in an entire small town those two stations will become extremely cutthroat however rural prices also vary more with only one station in easy walking distance from where you ran out of gas they can charge you $ 6 to fill that gallon gas can if they want and you 'll pay it because the next gas station 's another 20 miles down the road and probably has even higher prices this along with overhead is generally why the states have the lowest average prices land 's cheap and people are scarce in wyoming but the price gouging can be seen in the rural southwest where there 's a lot of ground to cover between gas stations and so the last chance gas along major highways just outside of town each a nickel to a dime more than the previous station is a common stereotype transportation costs prices are higher on the east and west than in the gulf states for a very simple reason the bulk of the u.s. refinery capacity is along the gulf coast between and the florida border the further you are from there the more it costs to get the fuel from the refinery to the gas station and that cost is reflected at the pump in fact the east coast imports gasoline by tanker even though the united states is now a net exporter of gasoline because it 's cheaper to buy it from foreign sources than it would be to watch it drip through the limited pipeline capacity that exists between the gulf states and the eastern

assuming the amount of your car payment and student loan are n't crazy you should be fine i would suggest starting with a baseline budget listing your monthly income and expenses be sure to include miscellaneous expenses like car maintenance insurance food clothes etc the common things that sometimes get overlooked in a budget after all of your necessary expenses fluff like entertainment does n't count if your employer has a 401k with a match i would contribute to that up to the match amount   next i would save an emergency fund to cover unforseen events such as car repairs etc $ 1000 is not an uncommon amount to see people suggest for this next i would knock out your car loan then student loan as fast as possible this will free up some cash flow which gives you more freedom to do what you want at this point you save more so you do n't have to finance the next car or have a down payment for a home or whatever   building your savings to be 3 6 months of income is a good idea this covers things like being laid off or other larger unexpected events after you get to that point how you handle your budget is pretty open

an issue with the initial plan was that the house was gifted to you therefore you owned it now two years later you wanted to get a mortgage the irs would look at it as a home equity debt not a home acquisition debt and the interest on the first $ 100,000 of home equity dept is deductible this is from irs pub mortgage treated as used to buy build or improve home    a mortgage    secured by a qualified home may be treated as home acquisition debt    even if you do not actually use the proceeds to buy build or    substantially improve the home this applies in the following    situations you buy your home within 90 days before or after the date you take out the mortgage the home acquisition debt is limited to the home 's    cost plus the cost of any substantial improvements within the limit    described below in 2 or 3 see example 1 later you build or improve your home and take out the mortgage before the work is completed the home acquisition debt is limited to the    amount of the expenses incurred within 24 months before the date of    the mortgage you build or improve your home and take out the mortgage within 90 days after the work is completed the home acquisition debt is limited    to the amount of the expenses incurred within the period beginning 24    months before the work is completed and ending on the date of the    mortgage see example 2 later example 1 you bought your main home on june 3 for $ you paid for the    home with cash you got from the sale of your old home on july 15 you    took out a mortgage of $ 150,000 secured by your main home you used    the $ 150,000 to invest in stocks you can treat the mortgage as taken    out to buy your home because you bought the home within 90 days before    you took out the mortgage the entire mortgage qualifies as home    acquisition debt because it was not more than the home 's cost at two years you would be way outside the 90 day limit the pub also gives example on how calculate the amount of interest you can deduct

fire insurance as you have discovered is a complete ripoff most people pay fire insurance all their lives with no benefit whatsoever and those such as yourself who are lucky enough to get a payout find that it is completely insufficient to replace their loss i once computed the actual beneficial net present financial value of my fire insurance policy and it came out to $ 40 per month the cost was $ 800 per month that is typical homeowners pay $ 500 to $ 800 per year for something that is worth $ 30 to $ 50 per year ironically banks would actually make more money from mortgages if they did not require to buy insurance but nevertheless they insist on it it is not about logic but about fear and irrationality when i paid off my mortgage and gained ownership of my home the first thing i did was cancel my fire insurance i now invest the money i would have wasted on insurance making money instead of losing it being compelled to throw money down the toilet on fire insurance is one of the hidden costs of a homeowners mortgage in the united states in your situation the main option is to borrow the money to rebuild the house using the land as collateral if the land is valuable enough of course you still owe the money for your original mortgage on your now non existent home so to get a home you will have to have the income to service two mortgages a loan officer at a reputable bank can tell you whether you have the income necessary to support two mortgages if you were maxed out on your original mortgage then you may not have enough income and you are screwed in that case you will have to go back to renting and gradually paying off your old mortgage if it were me i would sue the insurance company pro se as a way to get the necessary money to rebuild the home because insurance companies roll over like a $ 20 when they get sued hate insurance companies but i am unusual in that i love and suing people most people are terrified of though so it may not be an option for you

johnny   i recently bought my first home as well and i have worked in the credit business not mortgage so i think i can answer some of your questions   disclaimer first that i 'm in ny and home buying does vary from state to state in my experience pre qual is not too different from pre approval   neither represents any real on the part of the bank i.e. they can still deny approval at any point and both are based on pulling your credit bureau and calculating ratios based on your stated probably not documented financial information   it 's theoretically possible that a seller would choose a pre approved buyer over a pre qualified buyer all other things being equal but all other things are seldom equal remember also that you do n't need to ultimately get a mortgage from the same bank that you use for the pre qual   the pre qual just shows that you are probably credit worthy and serves to give you some credibility with sellers   once you have an accepted offer and need to find a real mortgage you can shop around for the best rate and best loan structure   banks do n't need to have pulled your credit to quote rates but they will need to have a general idea of your fico range   once you find the bank you like with the best rate and actually apply for the loan they will pull a hard bureau and if your scores are different from what you said before the rate may change but within the same range you 'll generally be ok   also banks do not necessarily pull all 3 bureaus they may only pull 1 as it costs them for each pull 2 potential downsides to this approach also make sure you have a mortgage funding clause in your contract as banks are unpredictable and make sure you have a great real estate lawyer not a legal factory the extra few hundred $ are worth it do n't this credit stuff too much   find a good house for a good price and get a no nonsense mortgage that you fully understand no exotic stuff   good luck

with enough money in the emergency fund to get rid of the car and still have a cushion i would definitely get rid of it as the car is not needed your car is only going down in value which makes the current setup even less desirable in essence you are paying over $ 300 a month for something that every month is worth less and less since you are paying over $ 300 a month and it will take about $ 3000 from your emergency fund to get rid of the car if you start putting that $ 300 + back in the emergency fund in a mere 10 months you will have replenished the emergency fund

there is a mathematical way to determine the answer if you know all the variables and that 's a big if for example suppose you rent for 4 years and the price of rent never increases the total amount you will have paid is 600 48 = if you currently have money sitting in the bank earning only a negligible amount of interest and you can purchase the house for x and then sell it for exactly what you paid 4 years from now and you have 0 expenses otherwise then purchasing it will save you compared to renting obviously that makes some assumptions which are not possible now you need to calculate the variables all of these variables can drastically effect the profit margin and unfortunately they will vary greatly depending on your country location and the condition of the home once you estimate each of the variables it 's important to realize that if you purchase your profit or loss can swing unexpectedly in either direction based on appreciation depreciation which can be difficult to predict in part because it is somewhat tied to the overall macro economy of where you live state or country on the flip side if you rent it 's pretty easy to calculate your cost as approximately over 4 years perhaps slightly more for modest rent increases lastly if you elect to purchase the house realize that you 're investing that money in real estate you could just as easily rent and invest that money elsewhere if you want to choose a more aggressive or conservative investment with your money

keep in mind that the federal reserve chairman needs to be very careful with his use of words   here 's what he said it is arguable that interest rates are too high that they are being constrained by the fact that interest rates ca n't go below zero we have an economy where demand falls far short of the capacity of the economy to produce we have an economy where the amount of investment in durable goods spending is far less than the capacity of the economy to produce that suggests that interest rates in some sense should be lower rather than higher we ca n't make interest rates lower of course they only can go down to zero and again i would argue that a healthy economy with good returns is the best way to get returns to savers so what does that mean when he says that we ca n't make interest rates lower that does n't mean that it is n't possible he 's saying that our demand for goods is lower than our ability to produce them negative interest would actually make that problem worse if i know that things will cost less in a month i 'm not going to buy anything the fed is incentivizing spending by lowering the cost of capital to zero by continuing this policy they are eventually going to bring on inflation which will reduce the value of the currency which gives people and companies that are sitting on money an dis incentive to continue hoarding it

this is an unfortunate situation for you   you have zero chance at your question number 1 if someone was going to bend this rule for you it would have happened already   the answer to question number 2 is pursue solution number 3 the overriding issue is that the irs makes these rules not the employer plan sponsor or the administrator   you ca n't talk the plan administrator in to reimbursing you their system likely does n't even have a function to do so fsa timing issues can be complex and i think that 's the root of your issue because when an expense can be incurred date of service versus date of payment and when a claim must be filed are different things it 's really common to bend the rules on when a claim is submitted but not when it was incurred    it 's really common for an exiting employee to have 30 days to submit expenses for reimbursement   fsa expenses must always be incurred within the specified plan year or within your dates of employment if you were n't employed for the entire plan year this is specified by the irs   it seems like some wires were crossed when you asked this question   you were asking can i still incur claims and they were hearing how long do i have to submit an expense that has already been incurred some plans allow cobra continuation on fsa which generally does not make sense   your contributions to the plan would use after tax dollars but for folks who know they have an eligible expense coming it can make sense to continue via cobra in retain your eligibility under the plan so you can incur a claim after your employment termination regarding number 3   this sort of reimbursement would be outside the plan no precedent is necessary   you 've gotten them to claim it was their mistake they 're going to reimburse you for their mistake it has nothing to do with the fsa good luck

what a silly question   they took all the tax payer money and bought all the bad loans that the banks had on their books they put all the bad loans as assets on the feds books   but because it was bad and was not really worth anything they created a further $ 1 trillion and loaned it out to all the banks to show as tier i capital and paid an interest of 2.5 while the fed rate was effectively 0 on the understanding that this money could never leave the fed and was only for display purposes hence they could over leverage that $ 1 trillion many times over   the banks then seem adequate and required no further activity in the lending market as they generated 2.5 of fucking hot air and the rest of the funny money could be played with in the ever fed stimulus supported equity markets   so no real money ever entered the real economy no real organic growth occurred so the fed started to fudge the figures to show a employment and growth but because there was no liquidity there was no inflation   in short all that grew since 2008 is the size of the bubble between the fed and the banks and our paychecks went to the bankers bonuses for   a job well done

the cash is not penalty free if you take up loans from the policy to pay for retirement growth essentially stops and the interest will eat away policy value over time so instead of gaining 7 8 per year and taking withdrawals you would be taking loans and losing whatever the interest rate is   dividends are just the profits made from the company which is why its tax free its considered a return of premium you are just overpaying for the policy by its dividend rate    whole life is a great vehicle for some situations but it always comes after a 401k or other retirement savings whole life does nt even begin to make sense imo until you are making a few hundred thousand a year and need it for a business buy sell agreement or legacy money to leave children grandchildren   it does nt scale well to lower incomes

like pointed out fundamentally you need to decide if the money invested elsewhere will grow faster than the interest you are paying on the loan in india the safe returns from fixed deposits is around 8 9 currently factoring taxes the real rate of return would be around 6 7 this is less than what you are paying towards interest the ppf gives around 9 with tax break if there are no other options and tax free interest the real return can be as high as 12 14 there is a limit on how much you can invest in ppf however this looks higher than your average interest the stock markets in long term 7 years averages give you around 15 returns but are not predictable year to year so the suggest from is valid you would need to see what are the high rate of interest loans and if they accept early repayment you should complete it asap if there are loans that are less than average say in the range of 7 8 you can keep it and pay as per schedule

the advantages of the tfsa are   this makes them great for who did n't do any saving yet for whom when they drawdown rrsps will have a big impact on taxes and government related income it also makes them great for i will save up for that car my downpayment the kids fees next year when the money would come out of an rrsp at the same or even a higher tax rate and would not have time to compound for long this may apply to you and finally it makes them great for highly paid people who just do n't know what the heck to do with all the money that is piling up and have no intention of ever using any of it while they 're working but have filled up their rrsps my are using them because they pay essentially no taxes now so are waiting to use their rrsp room later if you have money that you are saving for something other than retirement put it in a tfsa if you 've maxed the rrsp and still have money left over put it in an tfsa if you have children consider an resp first because of the bonus money but do n't think tfsa first unless it 's for saving like towards a car or renovation

your 5 8 year time frame is interesting because it is actually a two windows   when people are savings for retirement they tell us how many years or decades they have until they reach retirement age but they also imply that they are planning on spending decades withdrawing the money   but you wanting the money for a house in 5 8 years are needing the money more like somebody who is saving college money for a teenager in fact your plan is similar in time frame as a 13 year old has for their college fund start in 5 years but only have a 4 year spending window take the california 529 program beneficiary age 13 14 beneficiary age 18 + the funding agreement provides a minimum guaranteed rate of return on the > amounts allocated to it by the investment portfolio the minimum effective > annual interest rate will be neither less than 1 nor greater than 3 at > any time so you plan of investing 100 in the s&p with your window is way too risky you should only invest a portion of your down payment in equities and be prepared to only be in that mode for a few years any drop in the market now hurts you but one just before you need the funds would be devastating

based on my experience hiring working with a fortune 500 company legal team to make hiring decisions i do n't believe anything illegal necessarily happened   you 're allowed to discriminate against that list all the time like when hiring a model an actor or a pastor that have to be a specific age gender ethnicity religion etc or other jobs that require it   and yes any public facing position at an explicitly christian organization does require it   if i call a christian plumbing company i would expect them to send a christian plumber   you can also discriminate against the degree to which someone is religious as well   imagine if you could n't use answers like do you go to church regularly when interviewing a pastor   i worked previously for a christian organization that required many positions to be christians like salesmen and board members   all other internal positions like accountants etc they would not even ask are you christian for legal reasons because it was n't required for the job   so it was either explicitly required in the job description or they could n't ask or take it into account when hiring you

here is a simple way to analyze the situation go to your bank or credit union website and use their loan calculator with their current real interest rates and down payment requirements enter the rate and number of years enter different values for the loan amount to get the monthly payment to the level you want $ 400 today for my credit union the max loan would be about $ 9,500 keep in mind there may be taxes registration fees and down payment on top of this jump ahead two years the loan is paid off the car is owned free and clear you will be able to sell it and get some money in your pocket   if you go for a longer term loan to keep the payments under your goal the issue is that in two years you might be upside down on the loan the car may be worth less than the remaining balance on the loan your equity would be negative

i do n't know really is the best investment strategy people think that they have to know everything to make money but realistically out of the hundreds of thousands of publicly traded securities you really can only invest in a tiny number of them of the course of a week you literally have more than a million buy or do n't buy decisions because the prices of those securities fluctuate every day   simply due to the fact that there are so many securities you can not know what everything is going to do you have to say i do n't know also when you do understand something it is usually fairly priced so will you make money on it i do n't know only very rarely will you find something that you actually understand well and it is significantly undervalued you can be looking at a company a day for two years before you find it but people get trigger happy they bet on odds when they should only bet on odds or higher   if you are forced to bet on everything it makes sense that you bet on everything you believe is greater than 50 chance of winning but since you can not bet on everything you should only bet on the highest quality bets those with greater than 90 chance of winning to find such a bet you may have to shuffle through 100 different companies and only make 2 3 bets you are looking for something that is at least 2 standard deviations away from the mean   people are not good at doing a lot of work most of which yields nothing to find one big payoff they are wired to only look at the present so they take the best bet they can see at the moment which is often barely above 50 and with any it may actually be well below 50 and people are not good at understanding compound geometric growth you can keep 10 gains 1.10 1.10 1.10 but that can all be wiped out by multiplying by one zero which is why taking a bet is so dangerous even though technically it is an advantageous one they forget to adjust for the geometric aspect of compounding a bet is one you should take but if you are allowed to repeat it and you keep going all in you will eventually lose and have $ 0 which is the same as if you took a single all in bet that has 0 chance of winning   as buffett says if you are only allowed to make 20 investments over a lifetime you will most likely do better because it prevents you from making many of these mistakes

the classic definition of inflation is too much money chasing too few goods   within a tight range say 1 3 inflation is somewhat benign   there 's a nice inflation widget at the inflation calculator which helps me see that an item costing $ 1000 in 1975 would now 2010 be about $ 4000 and $ 1000 from 1984 till now just over $ 2000 i chose those two years to make a point first i am 48 i graduated college in 1984 so in my working life i 've seen the value of the dollar drop by half on the other hand it only took 9 years from 75 84 to see a similar amount of inflation occur   i 'd suggest that the 26 year period is far more acceptable than the 9 savers should be aware of their real return vs what was a result of inflation i 'm not either way but logically have to acknowledge the invisible tax of inflation i get a say 6 return pay 2 in tax but i 'm not ahead by 4 3 may be lost to inflation on the flip side my mortgage is 3.5 after taxes that 's but less than 0 after long term inflation so as a debtor i am benefiting by the effect of inflation on what i owe   interesting also to hear about deflation as we 've grown used to it in the case of electronics but little else perhaps the ipad wo n't drop in price but every year it will gain features and competitors will keep the tablet market moving yet people still buy these items   right now there 's not enough spending i 'd suggest that good financial advice aside people as a whole need to start spending to get the economy moving the return of some inflation would be a barometer of that spending starting to occur

i have been renting rooms out of my house for over 7 years now   when renting to non family the arrangement is usually successful   people leave for various reasons an occasionally i will ask someone to move out if they are not working out   in the usa this works well because by keeping things formal rental agreements etc you actually have a great business with lots of deductions that end up reducing you net income quite a bit however us law makes a big distinction about whether or not you 're renting to family relatives specifically around whether or not they are paying full market rent for their room   if not then you are subsidizing them which could disqualify your property or at least the portion they are using from being legitimately rented and thus no tax deductions for said activity the other risk again in the usa is the possibility of a long term relationship falling under rules of common law marriage   this is rare unless children are involved   a couple who have children married or not may have the courts get involved to oversee the division of assets with regards to ensuring the children have a place to live and adequate financial support for the uk i would think the laws would be roughly similar   check out this website for more a detailed review

over on quantitative finance stack exchange i asked and answered a more technical and broader version of this question should the average investor hold commodities as part of a broadly diversified portfolio   in short i believe the answer to your question is that gold is neither an investment nor a hedge against inflation although many studies claim that commodities such as gold do offer some diversification benefit the most credible academic study i have seen to date should investors include commodities in their portfolios after all new evidence shows that a mean variance investor would not want to allocate any of their portfolio to commodities this would include gold presumably nevertheless many asset managers such as pimco offer funds that are marketed as real return or inflation managed and include commodities including gold in their portfolios   pimco has also commissioned some research strategic asset allocation and commodities claiming that holding some commodities offers both diversification and inflation hedging benefits

typically the settlement price for a financial instrument such as aapl stock underlying a derivative contract is determined from the average price of trading in that instrument during some short time window specified by the exchange offering the derivative   read the fine print on your contract to learn the exact date and time of that settlement period because it 's in an exchange 's best interest to appear as fair as possible the exchange will in general pick a high volume period of time such as the close of trading on the expiry date in which to determine the settlement price now the expiry date time may be different from the last time at which the option can be traded which may be different from the underlying settlement time   for example most us equity options currently expire on the saturday following the third friday of the month whereas they can last be traded at end of day on the third friday of the month and the settlement period may be at a slightly different time on the third friday of the month   again read the contract to know for sure   moreover your broker may demand to know whether you plan to exercise the option at an even earlier date time so to answer your question after hours trading can only affect the settlement price of an underlying instrument if the exchange in question decides that the settlement period should happen during after hours trading   but since no exchange that wants to stay in business would possibly do that the answer is no contract expiry time contract exercise time final contract trading time and underlying settlement time may all fall at different dates times   the important one for your question is settlement time

what you will probably get is an option to buy for £ 10,000 £ 10,000 worth of stock if the stock price on the day your option is granted is £ 2.50 then that 's 4,000 shares companies rarely grant discounted options as there are tax disincentives the benefit of the stock option is that when you exercise it you still only pay £ 10,000 no matter what the 4,000 shares are now worth this is supposed to be an incentive for you to work harder to increase the value of the company you should also check the vesting schedule you will typically not be able to exercise all your options for some years although some portion of it may vest each year

one thing that has not been pointed out as a disadvantage of using credit cards   people tend to spend more   you can see this study and this one plus about 500 others   on average people tend to spend about 17 more with credit cards then with cash   this amount any perks one gets by having a credit card    the safest way to use one is to only use them for purchases where you can not make a decision to spend more   one example would be for utility bills that do n't charge a fee or at the gas pump using them at amazon might have you upgrade your purchase or add some extra items   using them at restaurants might encourage you to order an extra drink or two   using them at the coffee shop might have you super size your coffee or add a    of course this extra spending could lead you into a debt cycle exacerbating the financial hit many struggle with   please tread carefully if you decide to use them

if this matters to you a lot i agree you should leave my primary bank account raised chequing account and transaction fees i left when i was closing my account the teller asked for the reason they needed to fill out a form and i explained it was the monthly fees eventually if a bank gets enough of these they will change i want to get back those features for the same price it cost when i opened it they are in their rights to cancel features or raise prices just as you are in your rights to withdraw if they do n't give you a deal the reason why i mention this is that this approach is comical in some instances a grocery store may raise the price of carrots typically you either deal with it or change stores prices rise occasionally thus they will lose a lot of money from my savings from my understanding a bank makes a large chunk of their money from fees very little is from the floating kitty they can have because of your savings if you have an investment account with your bank not recommended or your mortgage that would matter more i 've had friends who have left banks and moved their mortgages because of the bank not giving them a better rate does the manager have any pressure into keeping the account to the point of giving away free products to keep the or they do n't really care depends i 've probably say no one data point is an anecdote it is expected in a client base of thousands that a few will leave for seemingly random reasons only if mass amounts of clients leave or complain will the manager or company care a note some banks waive monthly account or service fees if you keep a minimal account balance i have one friend who keeps x thousand in his bank account to save the account fee he budgets a month ahead of time and savings account rates are 0 so this costs him nothing

as others have explained defined contribution is when you or your employer contributes a specified amount and you reap all the investment returns   defined benefit is when your employer promises to pay you a specified amount benefit and is responsible for making the necessary investments to provide for it    is one better than the other we can argue this either way    defined benefit would seem to be more predictable and assured   the problem being of course that it is entirely reliant upon the employer to have saved enough money to pay that amount   if the employer fails in that responsibility then the only fallback is government guarantees   and of course the government has limitations on what it can guarantee   for example from wikipedia    the maximum pension benefit guaranteed by pbgc is set by law and adjusted yearly for plans that end in 2016 workers who retire at age 65 can receive up to $ per month or $ per year under pbgc 's insurance program for single employer plans benefit payments starting at ages other than 65 are adjusted which means the maximum guaranteed benefit is lower for those who retire early or when there is a benefit for a survivor and higher for those who retire after age 65 additionally the pbgc will not fully guarantee benefit improvements that were adopted within the five year period prior to a plan 's termination or benefits that are not payable over a retiree 's lifetime other limitations also apply to supplemental benefits in excess of normal retirement benefits benefit increases within the last five years before a plan 's termination and benefits earned after a plan sponsor 's bankruptcy by contrast people tend to control their own defined contribution accounts   so they control how much gets invested and where   defined contribution accounts are always 100 funded    defined benefit pension plans are often underfunded   they expect the employer to step forward and subsidize them when they run short   this allows the defined benefits to both be cheaper during the employment period and more generous in retirement   but it also means that employers have to subsidize the plans later when they no longer get a benefit from the relationship with the employee    if you want someone else to make promises to you and are n't worried that they wo n't keep them you probably prefer defined benefit    if you want to have personal control over the money you probably prefer defined contribution    my personal opinion is that defined benefit plans are a curse   they encourage risky behavior and false promises   defined contribution plans are more honest about what they provide and better match the production of employment with its compensation   others see defined benefit plans as the gold standard of pensions

your rate of return for paying off this loan is 9 and that 's guaranteed for reference the best rate of return on a 10-year fdic insured certificate of deposit today is 3 there 's definitely something out there with better returns than paying off your loans but there 's definitely not going to be anything with better risk adjusted returns than paying off your loans investors dream of guaranteed 9 rates of return if you had something that could provide a guaranteed 9 rate of return wannabe investors would be lining up at your door and tripping over each other to outbid each other until it actually closer to a 3 rate of return :p depending on whether your loans are tax deductible and what your inflation expectations are you could adjust those rates to make the comparison more accurate but at 3 vs 9 the picture 's pretty clear

as someone who 's done quit a bit of home improvement and seen positive roi i can speak from some personal experience   all of this assumes you do the unskilled labor yourself and shop around for relatively cheap plumbers electricians etc first never underestimate the resale value added by a can of paint   this assumes you have or know someone with a good sense of style that can help improve the aesthetics of the home significantly   white walls can be so boring to homebuyers and so many of them ca n't see through the of an inch of white paint second look for shortcomings in the house as is anyway these are some common upgrades   the big thing is to find something you are reasonably comfortable doing yourself and that you will enjoy   realize that if you 're new to this most projects will cost twice what you budget and take four times as long   the pride of having done it yourself and put in the sweat equity makes it worth it though usually edit to better answer your modified question i 'm adding to my answer   so if i understand it your question is now at what rate is it sane to invest in our house vs. outside investments   this is really just a matter of balancing risk vs. lifestyle   with most upgrades there is no financial benefit to investing in upgrading your home now vs. 5 years from now right before you sell   you could be making 10 in mutual funds until then and then invest in the upgrades right before you sell   there is obviously a physical limit to how fast you can do these improvements yourself but front loading this now at the beginning of your timeframe as opposed to the end is not an investment decision it is a lifestyle decision   not saying do n't do it but do n't rationalize it to yourself as we 're saving money by doing this now   maybe use the rationalization we want to enjoy these upgrades and not just add them before we move out one exception to that i 'd plant any trees now and make sure they have a good water supply   good trees take a while to grow and doing that sooner rather than later will help

i would disagree with your analysis   to me there are two purposes for a money market mm your emergency fund should be from 3 to 6 months of expenses   think of it of an insurance policy against murphy   you may want to have some money designated for big expenses or even sinking funds   for example i keep some money in a mm for a car as both the wife daughter and i driver older vehicles   i may need to replace them if you were planning on making a larger purchase car house boat engagement ring i would put the money in a mm fund so you are not subject to the whims of the market    after that you are free to invest all your money   its likely that you should have some money outside of tax advantaged funds so if you want to start a business you will not have to do high cost withdrawals

funds earned and spent before opening a dedicated business account should be classified according to their origination for example if your business received income where did that money go   if you took the money personally it would be considered either a distribution or a loan to you   it is up to you which of the two options you choose on the flip side if your business had an expense that you paid personally that would be considered either a contribution of capital or a loan from you if you choose to record these transactions as loans you can offset them together so you do n't need two separate accounts loan to you and loan from you when the bank account was opened the initial deposit came from where   if it came from your personal funds then it is either a contribution of capital or a loan from you from the sound of your question you deposited what remained after the preceding income expenses   this would in effect return the loan account back to zero if choosing that route the above would also be how to record any expenses you may pay personally for the business if any in the future because these transactions were not through a dedicated business bank account you ca n't record them in quickbooks as checks and deposits   instead you can use journal entries   for any income received you would debit your capital loan account and credit your income account   for any expenses you would debit the appropriate expense account and credit your distribution loan account also if setting up a loan account you should choose either current asset or current liability type   the capital contribution and distribution account should be equity type hope this helps

you do n't need a credit score after i paid off my house mortgage many years ago i had this discussion with my mortgage agent now bank vp your credit score is not a measure your ability to repay it is a behavioral model and a statistical measure of the likelihood that the banks will make money off of you when they give you a loan and a marketing tool that the banking industry uses to sell you long term and short term debt mortgages and credit cards statistically speaking people who close out major loans change their behaviors and the model captures this change in behavior in my own case even though i have a credit history and sufficient cash is the bank to buy my next home outright i have no credit score what the model says is that people with my behavioral profile are not likely to take a loan and if they did take one they would pay it back so quickly that the bank would not even recoup the cost of initiating the loan in short people with my profile are bad news for the loans side of the bank thanks for suggesting i capture this and post it as an answer

gave an excellent answer let me add a little analogy here that might help suppose you bought a car from joe 's auto sales you pay your money do all the paperwork and drive your car home the next day joe 's goes bankrupt what affect does that have on your ownership rights to your car the answer is absolutely none same thing with stocks and a stock exchange a stock exchange is basically just a store where you can buy stock once you buy it it 's yours that said there could potentially be a problem with record keeping if you bought a car from joe 's auto sales and joe went out of business before sending the registration paperwork to the state you might find that the state has no record that you legally own the car and you could have difficulty proving it likewise if a stock exchange went out of business without getting all their records properly updated their might be an issue actually i think the bigger concern here for most folks would be their broker and not the stock exchange as your broker is the one who keeps the records of what stocks you own long term in practice though most companies are responsible enough to clean up their paperwork properly when they go out of business and if they do n't a successor company or government regulators or someone will try to clean it all up

this is completely disgusting utterly unethical deeply objectionable and yes it is almost certainly illegal the federal trade commission has indeed filed suit halted ads etc in a number of cases but these likely only represent a tiny percentage of all cases this does n't make what the car dealer 's do ok but do n't expect the swat team to bust some heads any time soon which is kind of sad but let 's deal with the details let 's see what the federal trade commission has to say in their article are car ads taking you for a ride deceptive car ads here are some claims that may be deceptive and    why vehicles are available at a specific low price or for a specific    discount what may be missing the low price is after a downpayment often    thousands of dollars plus other fees like taxes licensing and    document fees on approved credit other pitches the discount is only    for a pricey fully loaded model or the reduced price or discount    offered might depend on qualifications like the buyer being a recent    college graduate or having an account at a particular bank only $ what may be missing the advertised payments are temporary teaser    payments payments for the rest of the loan term are much higher a    variation on this pitch you will owe a balloon payment usually    thousands of dollars at the end of the term so both of these are what the ftc explicitly says are deceptive practices has the ftc taken action in cases similar to this yes they have if auto dealers make advertising claims in headlines they ca n’t take    them away in fine print said jessica rich director of the ftc ’s    bureau of consumer protection these actions show there is a    financial cost for violating ftc orders in the case referenced above the owners of a 20 + dealership chain was hit with about $ 250,000 in fines if you think that 's a tiny portion of the unethical gains they made from those ads in the time they were running i 'd say you were absolutely correct and that 's little more than a cost of doing business for unscrupulous companies but that 's the state of the us nation at this time and so we are left with caveat emptor as a guiding principle what can you do about it competitors are technically allowed to file suit for deceptive business practices so if you know any honest dealers in the area you can tip them off about it try saying that out loud with a serious face   but even better you can contact the ftc and file a formal complaint online i would n't expect the world to change for your complaint but even if it just generates a letter it may be enough to let a company know someone is watching and if they are a big business they might actually get into a little bit of trouble

these are increasingly popping up at universities and other types of large campuses where space allocation is an important and often touchy subject between departments and how they utilize their assigned space   i suspect to see this grow considerably as many large campuses with space concerns will start looking at this kind of technology as a way to better manage their facilities   another variation in use is sensors that track room occupancy in real time something particularly useful for managing shared meeting spaces that are being improperly utilized

is it possible if after getting ein i change my llc type    disregarded entity or c type or s type or corporation or change in    number of members for tax saving you marked your question as real estate so i 'm guessing you 're holding rental properties in your llc that means that you will not be able to qualify for s corp only c corp treatment that in turn means that you 'll be subject to double taxation and corporate tax rate i fail to see what tax savings you 're expecting in this situation but yes you can do it if you so wish i suggest you talk to a licensed tax adviser ea cpa licensed in your state before you make any changes because it will be nearly impossible to reverse the check the box election once made for at least 5 years

why will they find financing when they leave the euro why would their currencies not simply due to excessive issuance in an attempt to devalue which is worse for unemployment austerity or hyperinflation   be expelled by germany   this is a union correct why do you assume germany holds all the cards i 've read that lira essay and have read mish about everyday since 2009 yet still do not think it is so obvious that the euro will collapse   i gained quite a bit of skepticism from barry 's paper on the breakup of the euro papers   what i see right now is that so far the ecb has only acted in such a way as to prevent outright deflation and meet its 2 inflation target but not to continuously outright fund the profligate governments they let the bond markets force those governments into contraction or into default whereas the fed with its dual mandate will always buy the us bonds and eventually will inflate the currency as opposed to having a sovereign default   so i think we will see the ecb continue to print as much is needed to meet its mandate but at the same time there will be defaults bank and failures and a continued lack of growth in the euro area until eventually the austerity measures bring revenue and spending in line at which point the countries under heavy debt would be stupid not to default because they can self finance   whereas in the us we are so dependent on deficit financing that as foreigners move further away from holding treasuries we become more susceptible to bond taking the reigns which will force the feds hand into outright monetization then i think we will see our own government exacerbate inflation by bidding on the same goods that those dollars which no longer are going into treasuries are bidding on then i think we 'll finally see bad inflation in the us   of course as long as there is of money fleeing europe for the us safe haven the lack of foreign treasury investment is pretty moot    spelling

yes there are huge number of parts in the chain entire careers can be made out of handling clearing and settlement back office work for banks exchanges and trading houses even more so in the old days when this had to be done by hand but obviously now everything is electronic i can provide some insight into your questions at least on the trading side   brokers in many cases have their own brokers or their own trading operations they will have their own order entry and risk control systems so that is all proprietary but it usually does n't involve more than send buy sell y shares of name x to venue z at price p with extra instructions a b c d e. eventually an order will make its way to a direct market participant who sends an electronic order directly to an exchange   note that when you say market you should be referring to such exchanges in the us these are the nyse nasdaq and so on when you are talking about futures there is the cme and so on in europe there is the and so on the market refers to all these exchanges together which all have their own order mechanisms and matching engines in many cases exchanges will route orders to other exchanges depending on the specific country 's trading rules exchanges compete with each other by fee and liquidity offerings which are directly by market participants   another detail is that each market participant has its own clearing firm which has prior credit lines established with the market participant and a central clearing house like you said as soon as an order is matched the exchange where the order takes place hands the trade over to the clearing house where the trade is then settled between the clearing firms representing either side of the trade clearing disputes happen at this step

i think the best answer that does n't make the buyer look like a moron is this buyer had previously sold a covered call   they wanted to act on a different opportunity so they did a closing buy write with a spread of a couple cents below asking for the stock but it dipped a couple cents and the purchase of those options to close resolved at 4 cents due to lack of sellers

the biggest issue is your lack of diversification   your real estate investments have performed quite well so far but you have also likely enjoyed a period of unprecedented growth that is not sustainable in the long term stocks have always outperformed real estate investments which tend to track more closely to the inflation rate you need more balance for when when the real estate market cools off you do n't mention tax deferred retirement savings accounts you should prioritize your attention to these to keep your income tax low consider selling one of your investment properties if you ca n't adequately fund the 401k

sure it is quite easy depending on income   if one receives a bonus that is high in relationship to their income it is very easy to max out a 401 k prior to when one intended   the later in the year such a bonus occurs the more likely that one will max out prematurely    if one only has a single employer in the year the custodial company will not accept amounts above the max so one need not worry about that case   if there is more than one employer a refund is typically issued with the appropriate tax withheld    assume that a person makes about 60 k per year   they intend to put 12k into their 401 k thus have their contribution set to 20   by the beginning of september they have 8 k into their retirement but they also receive a bonus of 50k.   their 401 k contribution for that bonus will be 10 k and thus they have maxed out their individual contribution for the year so they will not be able to contribute for the rest of the year including the first paycheck in september   they will miss out on any match that the company may supply   while that sucks it should be relieved by the bless of receiving such a large bonus

the canada revenue agency describes in detail here what information businesses must generally include on their invoices so that gst hst registrants can claim input tax credits for the expenses quote sales invoices for gst hst registrants you have to give customers who are gst hst registrants specific    information on the invoices receipts contracts or other business    papers that you use when you provide taxable goods and services this    information lets them support their claims for input tax credits    or rebates for the gst hst you charged the page quoted continues with a table describing what specifically needs to be on a sales invoice based on the total amount of the invoice the requirements differ for total sale under $ 30 total sale between $ 30 to $ and total sale $ 150 or more for the total sale under $ 30 category the only things a sales invoice must contain to support an itc claim are 1 the provider 's business name 2 the invoice date and 3 the total amount paid payable i.e. when the total sale is under $ 30 there is no requirement for any gst hst amount to be indicated separately nor for a business number to be present on the invoice hence imho and i am neither an accountant nor a lawyer if your uber rides are for $ 30 or less then you should n't expect a gst hst number anyway and a simple invoice as described should be enough for you to claim your whether or not the provider is registered in fact for gst hst is beside the point for amounts over $ 30 you need a bit more while the page above specifies that the provider 's business number should be included beginning with the next level of total sales   there are exceptions to those rules described at another page mentioned exceptions to invoice requirements that specifically apply to the taxi limousine case quote exceptions to invoice requirements gst hst registrants are required to keep the necessary documentation    to support their claim for and rebates in certain circumstances    the documentation requirements have been reduced for taxi or limousine fares your books and records must show so at a minimum for fare in excess of $ 30 total you should ask the driver to note either a the amount of gst hst charged or b a statement that the fare includes gst hst the driver 's business number need not be specified consequently if your receipt for a ride in excess of $ 30 does not contain any such additional information with respect to gst hst then i would expect the receipt does not satisfy the cra 's requirements for supporting your itc claim i.e. keep your individual rides under $ 30 each or else get a better receipt from the driver when it is above that amount p.s it should go without saying but your rides of course must be considered reasonable business expenses in order to qualify for gst hst for your business receipts for rides of a personal nature are not eligible so be sure to maintain proper records as to the business purpose and destination for each ride receipt so claimed

then you should not enjoy the benefits by being in a union then right   that seems simple enough but that 's not how it works    unions by law have the duty of fair so even if you are not a member you still are awarded all the benefits and protections of the contract    so it 's not that simple because how do you balance that if not for fair share   the union still has to pay to protect you but you do n't have to pay for any of the work they do   so then if you can get all the benefits of being in the union and not pay a dime for it why would you   seems logical right it 's a good deal we all want to save money    well as everyone stops paying and the union ca n't afford to operate as it did like any organization it and lays off staff   now the union no longer has the resources to offer you good representation which causes the dues paying members to be frustrated and to drop out and or ditch the union entirely   now no one in your workplace has a voice a contract or any protections    that may turn out to be great   but you know the company wants to save money too    the company is also no longer obligated to offer you the same wages or benefits that your coworkers negotiated   so now the company is free to cut wages benefits and workforce to improve thier bottom line or executive bonuses

most companies put the company match in your account each paycheck but your are not generally vested for the match if you leave before the specified time period then they pull back part of the matching funds   i knew somebody who did something similar back in the 1980 's with their 401k. they put in 8 of their paycheck after taxes a 100 match was deposited then they pulled out the employees contribution every quarter they did this for the 10 years i knew them it avoided any tax implications and they were still saving 8 of their pay for retirement

if we were to observe some call price e.g. 15 and then derived implied volatilities from the bs formula depending on different strike prices but fixed maturity i.e maturity = 1 and strike goes from 80 to 140 would we then see a smile yes market prices for various strikes and a given maturity often have higher implied volatilities from the black scholes model away from at the money    it is not accounted for in the black scholes model in the fact that volatility is not a function of strike so volatility is assumed to be constant across strikes but the market does not price options that way i do n't know that a quantitative theory has ever been proven i 've always just assumed that people are willing to pay slightly more for options deep in or out of the money based on their strategy but i have no evidence to base that theory on

i speak from a position of experience my bs and ms are both in comp sci i know very little about loans or finances that is very unfortunate as you are obviously an intelligent human being   perhaps this is a good time to pause your formal education and get educated in personal finance   to me it is that important i study computer science and am thus confident that i will be able to find work after i finish school this kind of attitude can lead to trouble   you will likely have a high salary but that does not always translate into prosperity   personal finance is more about behavior then mathematics   i currently work with people that have high salaries in a low cost of living area   some have lost homes due to foreclosure some are very limited in their options because of high student loan balances   some are millionaires without hitting the ipo startup lotto   the difference is behavior it 's possible that someone in my family will be able to cosign and help me out with this loan this is indicative of lack of knowledge and poor financial behavior   this kind of thing can lead to strained relationships to the point where people do n't talk to each other   never co sign for anyone and if you value the relationship with a person never ask them to co sign i 'll be working as a ta again for a $ 1000 stipend yikes   why in the world would you work for 1 k when you need 4 k   you should find a way to earn 6 k this semester so you can save some and put some toward the loans you already acquired   accepting this kind of situation raises red flags on your attitude towards personal finance   and yes it is possible you can earn that waiting tables and if you can find a part time programming gig you can make a lot more then that   consider working as a ta and wait tables until you find that first programming gig i am just about done with my undergraduate degree and will be starting graduate school at the same university next semester to me this is a recipe for failure in most cases   you have all your financing options to date and are planning to go backwards even more   why not get out of school with your bs and go to work   you can save up some of your ms tuition and most companies will provide tuition reimbursement    computer science software engineering can be a fickle market   right now things are going crazy and times are really good   however that was not always the case during my career and unlikely for yours   for example just this year i my highest rate of pay that occurred in 2003   i was out of work most of 2004 and for part of 2005 i actually made less then when i was working while in college   in 2009 my company cut our salaries by 5 but the net cost to me was more like a 27 cut   in 2001 i worked as a contractor for a company that had a 10 reduction in full time employees yet they kept us contractors working    recently i talked with a recruiter about a position doing which is what i am doing now   it required a high level security clearance which is not an easy thing to get   the rub was that it was located in a higher cost of living area and only paid about 70 of what i am making now   they required more and paid less but such is the market   you need to learn about these things good luck

when you pay off a loan early you pay the remaining principal and you save all of the remaining interest so you do save on interest but it 's the interest you would have paid in the future not the interest you have paid in the past your remaining balance when you pay off the loan only includes the principal not the projected interest interest is a factor of the amount borrowed the interest rate and the amount of time you borrow the money the sooner you repay the money the less interest you pay imagine if you had taken a 30 year loan at 4 interest but were allowed to make no payments until the loan term ended if you waited 15 years to make your first payment you would n't owe the same money as if you 'd made payments every month no instead of owing you 'd owe because you had borrowed $ 100k for 15 years plus the interest due rather than borrowing a declining sum so that 's why you do n't get a refund on interest for previous months if you had started with a 16 year loan then you would have been paying more principal every month and your monthly amount due would have been higher to reflect that as you paid the principal off faster the interest each month would drop faster paying a huge portion of the principal at the end of the loan is not the same as steadily paying it down in the same time frame you will pay a lot more interest in the former case and rightfully so it might help to consider a credit card payment in comparison if you run up a balance and pay only the minimum each month you pay a lot of interest over time because your principal goes down slowly if you suddenly pay off your credit card you do n't have to pay any more interest but you also do n't get any interest back for previous months that 's because the interest accrued each month is based on your current balance just like your mortgage the minimum payments are calculated differently but the interest accrued each month uses essentially the same mechanism

before doing anything else you want a lawyer involved right from the beginning to make sure that something reasonable happens with the house if one of you dies or leaves seriously you 'll both be safer and happier if it 's all explicit how much you should put on the house is not the right question houses do n't sell instantly and while you can access some of their stored value by borrowing against them that too can take some time to arrange you need to have enough operating capital for normal finances plus an emergency reserve to cover unexpectedly being out of work or sudden medical expenses there are suggestions for how much that should be in answers to other questions after that the question is whether you should really be buying a house at all it is n't always a better option than renting and again as discussed in answers to other questions there are ongoing costs in time and upkeep and taxes and insurance if you 're just thinking about the financials it may be better to continue to rent and to invest the savings in the market the time to buy a house is when you have the money and a reliable income plan not to move for at least five years really want the advantages of more elbow room and the freedom to alter the place to suit your needs which will absorb more money   as far as how much to put down vs. finance you really want a down payment of at least 20 anything less than that and the bank will insist you pay for mortgage insurance which is a significant expense whether you want to pay more than that out of your savings depends on how low an interest rate you can get this is a good time in that regard versus how much return you are getting on your investments combined with how long you want the mortgage to run and how large a mortgage payment you 're comfortable committing to if you 've got a good investment plan in progress and can get a mortgage which charges a lower interest rate than your investments can reasonably be expected to pay you putting less down and taking a larger mortgage is one of the safer forms of leveraged investing if you 're comfortable with that if the larger mortgage hanging over you is going to make you uncomfortable   this might not be a good answer for you it 's a judgement call i waited until i 'd been in out of school about 25 years before i was ready to buy a house since i 'd been careful with my money over that time   i had enough in investments that i could have bought the house for cash or i could have gone the other way and financed 80 of it for maximum leverage i decided that what i was comfortable with was financing 50 you 'll have to work thru the numbers and decide what you are comfortable with but i say again if buying shared property you need a lawyer involved it may be absolutely the right thing to do but you want to make sure everything is fully spelled out and you 'll also want appropriate terms written into your wills being married would carry some automatic assumptions about joint ownership and survivor rights but even then it 's safer to make it all explicit edit yes making a larger down payment may let you negotiate a lower interest rate on the loan you 'll have to find out what each bank is willing to offer you or work with a mortgage broker who can explore those options for you

it depends on the relative rates and relative risk ignore the deduction you want to compare the rates of the investment and the mortgage either both after tax or both before tax your mortgage costs you 5 a bit less after tax and prepayments effectively yield a guaranteed 5 return if you can earn more than that in your ira with a risk free investment invest if you can earn more than that in your ira while taking on a degree of risk that you are comfortable with invest if not pay down your mortgage see this article mortgage prepayment as investment for example the borrower with a 6 mortgage who has excess cash flow would do well to use it to pay down the mortgage balance if the alternative is investment in assets that yield 2 but if two years down the road the same assets yield 7 the borrower can stop allocating excess cash flow to the mortgage and start accumulating financial assets note that he 's not comparing the relative risk of the investments paying down your mortgage has a guaranteed return you 're talking about cds which are low risk so your comparison is simple if your alternative investment is stocks then there 's an element of risk that it wo n't earn enough to outpace the mortgage cost update hopefully this example makes it clearer for example lets compare investing $ 100,000 in repayment of a 6 mortgage with investing it in a fund that pays 5 before tax and taxes are deferred for 10 years for the mortgage we enter 10 years for the period 3.6 if that is the applicable rate for the after tax return $ 100,000 as the present value and we obtain a future value of $ for the alternative investment we do the same except we enter 5 as the return and we get a future value of $ however taxes are now due on the $ of interest which reduces the future value to $ the mortgage repayment does a little better so if your marginal tax rate is 30 you have $ 10k extra cash to do something with right now mortgage rate is 5 ira cd apy is 1 and assuming retirement in 30 years if you want to plug it into a spreadsheet the formula to use is substitute your own values note the minus sign before the cash amount make sure you use after tax rates for both so that you 're comparing apples to apples then multiply your ira amount by to get the value after you pay future taxes on ira withdrawals

most personal loans in the us are for the purpose of purchasing some tangible object usually a house or car and that object is the collateral for the loan indeed the loan proceeds are usually paid directly to the seller without passing through the bank account of the borrower and the seller delivers the title of the car to the lender or a mortgage lien is recorded on the real property except possibly in the case of a refinance of a home mortgage   there is not much cash from such a loan to send to a friend to invest in his business whether in the us or in india   these types of loans are relatively easy to get much harder to get are unsecured personal loans unless your friend has a very friendly banker getting an unsecured loan of say $ 20,000 just for the heck of it is not easy some reasonably well off people do manage to get such loans and use the money to invest in the stock or bond markets in which case the interest paid on such loans can be deducted on   schedule a but only to the extent of the actual investment income any extras can be carried over to the next year so will your friend be investing in your business or making a loan to your business and do you anticipate that your business will generate any investment income or interest for your friend if not and your friend still wants to finance your business while making payments on the loan in the us then your friend must really like you a lot or have faith that a few years down the road you will be able to sell your business to for big bucks and pay him off very handsomely

the workaround solution is to simply avoid having an exactly zero balance on your account thus for inactive credit cards that i want to keep around for emergency use i always leave a small positive balance on the card the credit card company reserves the right to cancel my card at any time but a positive balance would force them to send me a check for the privilege of doing so a positive balance avoids making the account appear inactive and makes it cheaper for them to simply leave the account open

it does n't really make sense to worry about the details of what counts as saving unless you also move beyond a simplistic rule of thumb like save 10 of your income that said most of the sources i see pushing rules of thumb like that are talking about saving for retirement   that is you need to sock that money away so you will be able to spend it after you retire   this cnn page is one example   on that theory it only counts if you put it away and do n't touch it until you retire so things like car and computer funds would not count as saving another thing you 'll see some people say e.g. this nerdwallet article is to use 20 of your income for financial priorities   this would include retirement saving but also things like paying off debt and saving for a down payment on a house saving for a small purchase in the near future would not usually be considered saving at all since you 're not going to keep the money   if you put $ 5 in your wallet tonight so you can buy a hamburger for lunch tomorrow you would n't call that saving likewise setting aside a few hundred dollars for a new computer would n't count as saving under most definitions   some people might count saving for something like a house since that is a long term plan and the house unlike a computer may rise in value after you buy it   but you would n't want to fully count the house as part of your retirement savings unless you 're willing to sell it and live off the proceeds however none of these rules will help that much if your goal is as you say at the end of your question to know if i need to save more than what i actually am saving currently   saving 10 of your income wo n't magically ensure that you 're saving enough   to assess whether you personally are saving enough you need to actually start running some numbers on how much money you personally will need in retirement   this will depend on any number of factors including where you live what sources of retirement income you might have besides savings e.g. pensions etc   in short to know if you 're saving enough you ca n't listen to the generic stuff that everyone says you need to consider your own situation in a deliberate focused way

definitely do n't borrow from your 401k.   if you quit or get laid off you have to repay the whole amount back immediately plus you are borrowing from your opportunity cost   the stock market should be good at least through the end of this year    as one of the commentators already stated have you calculated your net savings by reducing the interest rate   you will be paying closing costs and not all of these are deductible only the points are   when calculating the savings you have to ask yourself how long you will be hanging on the property   are you likely to be long term landlords or do you have any ideas on selling in the near future    you can reduce the cost and principal by throwing the equivalent of one to two extra mortgage payments a year to get the repayment period down significantly by years   in this way you are not married to a higher payment as you would be if you refinanced to a 15 year term    i would tend to go with a eat the appraisal cost not refinance and b throw extra money towards principal to get the term of the loan to be reduced

i think what those articles are saying is if you want to leave some money to charity and some to relatives do n't a roth to charity while taxable accounts to relatives   in other words it 's not bad to leave a roth ira to charity it 's just not as good as giving it to humans if there are humans you want to give money to in your situation the total amount you want to leave to relatives is less than the value of your roth   so it sounds like the advice as it applies to you is do n't leave your relatives $ 30 k from your taxable funds while leaving the whole roth to charity   instead leave $ 30 k of your roth to your relatives while leaving all the taxable funds to charity along with the leftover $ 20 k of the roth   in other words the roth is a last resort for charitable giving only give away roth money to charity if you already gave humans all the money you want to give them   i 'm unsure of the details of how you would actually designate portions of the roth for different beneficiaries but some googling suggests it is possible

some good and some bad here the bad amounts to the fact that consumers are missing out on potential opportunity in the markets due to fear any financial advisor or analyst can tell you that there are a multitude of ways to enjoy the markets while limiting risk you may not make a million but you will likely beat the savings account rate on the good news front it is great that americans continue to shed debt and are hesitant to take on more somewhere in the middle is the fact that some borrowers who may be able to qualify for lower rates ca n't get them due to depreciated home values the bottom line there is that if you can afford your mortgage be happy you do n't need to refinance for a lower rate our grandparents never refinanced and they did fine

you can fairly simply make a spreadsheet in your favorite spreadsheet application or in google docs if you want portability i like to make an overview page that shows how much i take in per month and what fixed bills come out of that then break the remaining total into four to get a weekly budget then i make one page per month with four columns one per week with each row being a category sum the categories at the bottom and subtract from your weekly total voila a quick reference of how much you can spend that week without going over budget i then make a page for each month that lists what i bought and how much i spent on it so i can trace where my money 's gone the category total is just a summation of the items from that page that belong in that category   once you have a system stop checking your bank balance except to ensure your paycheck is going in alright use the spreadsheet to determine how much you can spend at any time then make sure you pay off everything on the card before the end of the month so you do n't incur interest

will the proportion of my payments towards interest eventually go down   yes today would be a good day to do a web search for amortization schedule you will quickly learn how to compute precisely how much of each payment goes to interest and how much goes to principal given different payment choices would it be wiser to spend more each month on loan payments that depends on your goals and resources which we know nothing about if you have extra money you could spend it on debt reduction or you could spend it on an investment that pays more money in growth or dividends than the interest you 'd save or you could decide that the longer you have that loan sure the more interest you 'll pay but inflation will make future money less valuable basically by taking out a loan you have chosen to gamble that the thing you bought with the loaned money will be worth the cost of the interest payments in the future adjusted for inflation the bank on the other hand is gambling that you 're good for the debt and that they can make a reasonable profit off it if you have more money to gamble with which bet is the wisest one is really up to you would it be smarter to try to pay off one loan before the other if you want to pay off a loan early then always choose the loan with the higher interest rate should i start making bi weekly payments instead of monthly that 's roughly equivalent to paying off the principal by one additional payment a year there are two reasons to do so   the first is that the total interest will be lower and the loan will be paid off faster you can work out exactly how much with your new found skill at amortization computation    the second is the simple convenience of knowing that your budget for each pay period is the same   that convenience is worth something is it worth the amount extra you 'll be paying every year again this is for you to decide work out how much extra you 're paying per year and how much you 're saving in the long run and compare that against the benefit

the government thought of that a long time ago and has any loophole there plugged like if you set up a company to buy a car and then allow you to use it you can use the car for company business like driving to a customer 's office to make a sales call or delivery and the cost of the car is then tax deductible but the company must either prohibit personal use of the car or keep a log of personal versus business use and the personal use becomes taxable income to you so at best you 'd get to deduct an expense here and then you 'd have to add it back there for a net change in taxable income of zero in general the irs is very careful about personal use of business property and makes it tough to get away with a free ride i 'm sure there are people who lie about it and get away with it because they 're never audited but even if that causes you no ethical qualms it 's very risky i do n't doubt that there are people with very smart lawyers who have found loopholes in the rules but it 's not as simple as i call myself a business and now all my personal expenses become tax deductible business expenses if you could do that everybody would do it and no one would pay taxes which might be a good thing but the irs does n't see it that way

you need receipts only if you claim deductions in the itemized deductions section based on them you itemize deductions only if your claims exceed the standard deduction which for a single person was $ 5,800 last year even then you need receipts for everything only if you claim sales tax as the deduction you have to buy really a lot to pass $ 5 k with sales tax i would expect people to pay more in state income taxes than sales taxes you can claim either this or that not both for food there are no taxes at least here in california so nothing to deduct anyway in any case you can always scan your receipts and keep them in the computer for just in case but imho it 's waste of time pixels and here 's a question which deals with the same issue read the answers there as well

you should learn about it its a great program doctors in their residency or fellowship are on a visa the visa says they must leave the us and go home for two years before returning to the u.s. so to say foreign doctors affecting supply is not accurate its actually a crazy harsh rule that protects american doctors and artificially keeps americans wages higher because you know the foreign doctor has to go home even if they are the best in your class so your point about immigrants keeping wages low may be true in other cases like tech the problem occurs when the american doctors want to serve in metro areas with good homes good private schools for their kids communities and hipster restaurants and art so even though the american doctors are protected even though an graduates wages are higher because half their class was sent back to india most of the us wo nt get an american born doctor even if they wanted one   so if you 're a state like iowa or nebraska or the and you have no major attractions to lure doctors no art no houses and major shortages of doctors in your area the federal gov't gives each state 30 waivers so if you 're a hospital a couple miles outside of des iowa it does n't make sense to send a perfectly well trained home   to india when you need one now otherwise your 20,000 people do n't have a heart doctor a program to protect american workers from foreign workers actually leads foreign workers to protect lives in addition your point about wages is wrong rural areas across the us pay the most because they are the most desperate the supply of doctors wanting to practice in la chicago new york is very high so the compensation is actually low its the rural doctors in small town america making in the percentile many of them reject the great money on offer because who wants go practice in a town in the middle of nevada the numbers are produced by your point about medical schools not increasing class sizes in correct that is a problem however that is not without consequence we have seen nurse practitioners scope of medicine begin to creep into family doctors scope to med schools refuse to increase class sizes so because their is such a shortage practices and clinics now are hiring np 's which affects supply and hurts wages of primary care doctors so foreign doctors are not causing wages to go down infact if you were an american family doctor your main worry is american nurse practitioners provides all the data on this for you to enjoy lol in summary i get it i own a business supply and demand is everything but with medicine its complicated small town alabama needs a doctor too who s actually a world class that could be working at the mayo clinic chooses to practice in small town alabama just to stay here that small town gets a doctor does nt have to go home foreigners are not always the enemy of capitalism sometimes they keep it alive pay attention next time you are in a small town that foreign doctor is probably awesome

i do n't like buying individual bonds for my own portfolio   i actually used to buy long term government strip bonds or provincial bonds but i stopped   here are some reasons why my broker allows me to purchase bonds via their web application   however to sell a bond i had to call in to the fixed income trading desk   that was inconvenient   but your broker may be different bonds do n't typically trade on a formal exchange   so there 's no cheap easy way as far as i know to get an independent quote for a bond 's value i had to trust what my broker said my bond was worth when assessing my portfolio performance    i asked my broker once how they arrive at the market value shown i.e. whether it was last bid ask or actual trade and i was told they use a third party bond quotation valuation information provider for the data and that quotes are an estimate of what the bond would be worth based on similar bonds   i quickly learned that was n't the value i could actually get when selling it when you 're dealing with your broker to buy and sell bonds you 're likely dealing with theirs or a related investment bank which makes a market for specific issues of bonds   while i was n't being charged an explicit commission to buy or sell bonds it was evident the broker makes money off the spread   that is the difference between what they would be willing to sell a bond for and what they would be willing to buy that same bond for   they will buy your bond back from you cheaper than what they could turn around and sell it to somebody else for   that 's why they do n't charge an explicit commission it 's built in and hidden anyway when i finally discovered my broker would seldom actually offer me the market value quoted for my bonds typically it would be bought back for a few percent less than it were theoretically worth i gave up   i do n't think bonds simply are liquid enough nor the costs transparent enough for retail investors   or maybe it 's just me however i do think bonds remain an important part of a diversified portfolio   bonds ought to be represented in a diversified portfolio using low cost bond index mutual funds or exchange traded funds   since these funds buy sell bonds in large quantities they get a better deal on the spreads   so while you do pay an explicit management fee for a fund you are probably saving since you 're not getting shafted on the spreads

as you mentioned in the title what you 're asking about comes down to volatility   dca when purchasing stock is one way of dealing with volatility but it 's only profitable if the financial instrument can be sold higher than your sunk costs   issues to be concerned with let 's suppose you 're buying a stock listed on the nyse called foo this is a completely fake example   over the last six days the average value of this stock was exactly $ 1   over six trading days you put $ 100 per day into this 2 at market close on january 11th you have shares of foo   you paid $ for it so your average cost before fees is $ = $ per share let 's look at this including your trading fees $ + $ 30 = $ 1.01 per share when the market opens on january 12th the quote on foo could be anything   patents customer wins wars politics lawsuits press coverage etc could cause the value of foo to fluctuate   so let 's just roll with the assumption that past performance is consistent selling foo at $ 0.80 nets $ 0.80 $ 5 $ + $ 30 =   $ loss selling foo at $ 1.20 nets $ 1.20 $ 5 $ + $ 30 =   $ profit every day that you keep trading foo those numbers get bigger assuming foo is a constant value   also remember even if foo never changes its average value and volatility your recoverable profits shrink with each transaction because you pay $ 5 in fees for every one speaking from experience it is very easy to paper trade   it is a lot harder when you 're looking at the ticker all day when foo has been $ 0.80 $ 0.90 for the past four days and you 're $ 300 under water on a $ 1000 portfolio   now your mind starts playing nasty games with you if you decide to try this let me give you some free advice unless you have some research such as support resistance information or data on why foo is a good buy at this price let 's be honest you 're gambling with dca not trading end notes

technically this does n't seem like a scam but i do n't think the system is beneficial   they use a lot of half truths to convince you that their product is right for you some of the arguments presented and my thoughts do n't buy term and invest the rest because you ca n't predict how much you 'll earn from the rest    also do n't invest in a 401k because you ca n't predict how much you 'll earn they are correct that you wo n't know exactly how much you 'll have due to stock market but that does n't mean the stock market is a bad place to put your money   investing in a 401k is risky because of the harsh 401k withdrawal rules   yes 401ks have withdrawal rules ca n't typically start before 59.5 must start by 70.5 but those rules do n't hamper my investing style in any way     most term life insurance policies do n't pay out   they are correct again but their conclusions are wrong yes most people do n't die while you have a term insurance policy which is why term life insurance is relatively cheap    but they are n't arguing you do n't need insurance just that you need their insurance which is better you need the guaranteed growth they offer   the chart used to illustrate their guaranteed growth includes non guaranteed dividends    they invest $ 10,000 per year for 36 years and end up with $ 1,000,000    that 's a 5 return   i use 10 for my estimate of stock market performance but let 's say it 's only 8    the same $ 10,000 per year results in over $ 2 million dollars   using 10.5 average return of the s&p 500 over it 's lifetime the result is a staggering $ 3.7 million    so if i 'm looking at $ 3.7 m vs. $ 1 m it costs me $ 2.7 million dollars to give me the same coverage as my term life policy that 's one expensive term life insurance policy my personal favorite blindly following the advice of wall street and financial gurus such as dave ramsey and suze orman got you where you are are you happy with the state of your finances do you still believe their buy term insurance and invest the difference   yes i sure do believe that and i 'm quite well thank you while i do n't think this is a scam it 's outrageously expensive and not a good financial choice

what you 're asking about is called a distribution when it comes to an llc   it 's basically you paying yourself some or all of the proceeds of the business depending on how you 're set up   you can pay yourself distributions on a regular schedule say monthly or you can do it at the end of the year whatever you do in this regard what you take out as distributions is reported on your personal income tax as taxable income   llcs in the u.s. use pass through taxation unless you intentionally elect to have the llc treated as a corporation for tax purposes which some people do so whatever the principals receive in distribution is personally taxable keep in mind that you 'll have to pay all of the taxes normally covered by an employer such as self employment tax usually about 15 social security tax and so on   this is in addition to income tax so remember that i hope this helps good luck

there 's no limit from the legal perspective with regards to the us law that is to how much you can keep on your bank accounts anywhere in the world fbar requirements are reporting requirements they do n't limit how much you can keep in the accounts they only make you report the accounts to the government there 's no such requirement with regards to the us domestic accounts that is for the us government your own government of the country of which you 're a citizen of may have limitations on what accounts you may have outside of that country or have reporting requirements of their own that said keep in mind that fdic only insures up to $ 250 k per person i.e. on all your accounts in each institution so if you have more than $ 250 k in a fdic insured account you better spread it across different banks

i took a course in forex trading for 3 months i also studied financial markets in the uni i have been saving in order to start investing but i face the same question i have gathered some advantages and that i would like to know your opinion forex market is more liquid its more easy to identify what makes the currency change and to predict it for small investors its an intraday trading the risk is huge but the return can be also huge stocks are for long term its difficult to have a bigger return unless you know something that others do nt its more difficult to predict price change since its easier to anyone influence it the risk is less

to be fair regarding the 15 vs 20 difference disregarding the 5 expected tip increase the price of the food has also increased meaning that even with the 15 rate you would have been paying more for service on top of paying more for mediocre food and now you 're tacking an extra 5 on top of that it 's crazy and ultimately it 's why a lot of restaurants are doing very poorly right now the value proposition really is n't there anymore   we need to find a new way to compensate wait staff in america

blue apron i used it for quite a while the meal standards have gotten worse and variety lacking it had also gotten more complicated to prepare to the point where i think it 's faster and easier to make my own meals spending 40 minutes to prep an unsatisfactory meal that i 'll finish in 10 minutes is just bad roi

as other people have posted starting with fictional money is the best way to test a strategy learn about the platform you are using etc that being said i would about how fundamental analysis works fundamental analysis is the very basis of learning about an assets true value is priced however in my humble opinion i personally just stick with index funds in layman 's terms index funds are essentially computer programs that buy or sell the underlying assets based on the index they are associated with in the portion of the underlying index therefore you will usually be doing as good or as bad as the market i personally have the background education and skillsets to build very complex models to do fundamental analysis but even i invest primarily in index funds because a well made and well researched stock model could take 8 hours or more and modern portfolio theory would suggest that most investors will inevitably have a regression to the mean and have gains equal to the market rate or return over time which is what an index fund already does but without the hours of work and transaction cost

actually you have it twisted if everyone is not getting the experience needed for making more money then that lowers the experience threshold to get into a job making more money however if everyone in the gen x generation is making less money during the time that most people save for their future there is no way of getting that back ever

i would just do a loan for a different number of years on your new mortgage for example if you just spent 10 years paying off your first house then for your second close the first mortgage upon selling and then open a 20 or 25 year mortgage and the loan end date as well as the payment should remain similar this would be more do able if you paid ahead a little to compensate all the early on interest you have to eat so if you want to finish around the same time you could look into doing that since you 'll have more equity to make a stronger down payment
