this may not answer your question but it may be an alternative my credit union credits my account for deposits immediately ones i make in an envelope   they view it as a service to their members   they take the risk that the member could deposit an empty envelope say they deposited $ 400 and then withdraw the money there may be banks in your country that do business this way

member of group a few savings banks sparkasse and vr banks offer cash bill deposit machines   however it can take a few business days until the deposit is credited to your checking account which has to be with the same bank google for = cash deposit machine as stated correctly hsbc which is the german arm of the hsbc group does not operate any atms in germany in addition they do not share the same bank accounts so i would recommend going with the classic banks mentioned above

your first question has been answered quite well already to answer your second question if you pay extra do you want the extra to go toward the interest or    toward the principal this gives the consumer some flexibility to decide how additional payments are applied it might seem like a no brainer to always apply extra payments towards principal that way the interest amounts on future payments will be lower and if you 're billed a fixed amount each month more of each regular payment will then be applied to principal shortening the term of the loan however while it would mean spending more over the life of the loan there are certain advantages to applying extra payments towards the main advantage is that it pays your account ahead and means you do n't have to make another payment as soon you could use this strategy to give yourself a buffer of several months so that if you should ever run into financial hardship you can stop making mortgage payments for a while without the risk of foreclosure note in most cases it 's more likely that you are simply paying more without specifying to the lender that it should be used as principal i have n't seen cases where you can explicitly ask the extra to be applied toward interest in this situation the funds would be held until you 've provided enough to cover one or more monthly payments in full at which point your next payment due date will simply be extended   another advantage is that the funds that are being held not due yet not allocated toward any specific payment maybe held in escrow may be refundable to you upon request this would depend on the lender 's policy some will permit refunds of credit balances that go beyond what is necessary to cover the current month 's bill whether you apply extra payments towards principal or not it makes little difference to the bank any additional payments received increase their immediate cash flow the cash can be reinvested immediately by them into whatever they are currently focusing on

gt if the buyside was showing demand what 's wrong with hft for reacting with supply   in my example hft is n't actually adding supply liquidity   they 're just grabbing it and flipping it   gt the example you gave is akin to me going from car dealership to car dealership yelling loudly about what car i want and the price i 'd like it at would you be upset if someone heard you and decided to sell their car to you later down the line    not the same   the equivalent would be me yelling about wanting to buy a porsche 911 and you buying them all before i can finish my own purchase then offering to resell them to me at a higher price   gt;in this case the buy side trader is being stupid    maybe certainly if all this could be eliminated by avoiding market orders   this is a major critique many people have with brad k. instead of serially going from exchange to exchange he could have sent orders to all exchanges at the same time parallel and likely received much better prices    he did do this at his time at rbc sent orders to all exchanges at once   the result would be apparently liquidity asks at the market disappearing and his orders getting filled at higher prices   gt;in my opinion the hft player here is simply facilitating price discovery by reacting to demand as a market maker that 's his job   i think that 's a of what these particular hfts are doing   's a good article let me know what you think   interesting   it certainly goes against a lot of what lewis wrote   and i suppose that 's the problem very few of us are actually qualified to say what is actually true   i know little about market structure and as i said have no involvement in high liquidity stocks   the fund managers next door to me also trade pretty illiquid stuff that i strongly doubt any hft ever touches and they 're value investors anyway not arb hfs or something

looking at the list of bonds you listed many of them are long dated in short in a rate rising environment it 's not like rates can go much lower in the foreseeable future these bond prices will drop in general in addition to any company specific events occurred to these names so be prepared for some paper losses   just because a bond is rated highly by credit agencies like s&p or moody 's does not automatically mean their prices do not fluctuate yes there is always a demand for highly rated bonds from pension funds mutual funds etc because of their investment mandates but i would suggest looking beyond credit ratings and yield and look further into whether these bonds are secured unsecured and if secured by what keep in mind in recent financial crisis prices of those cdos clos ended up even though they were given aaa ratings by rating agencies because some were backed by housing properties that were over valued and loans made to borrowers having difficulties to make repayments hence these type of bonds have greater default risks and traded at huge discounts most of them are also callable so you may not enjoy the seemingly high yield till their maturity date like others mentioned buying bonds outright is usually a big ticket item i would also suggest reviewing your cash liquidity and opportunity cost as oppose to investing in other asset classes and instruments

everyone buys at the ask price and sells at the bid price no matter who you are there are a few important things you need to understand example eve bid 16.00 eve ask so if your selling eve at market price you are entering an ask equal to the highest bid $ 16.00 if you buy eve at market price you are entering a bid equal to the lowest ask price $ its key to understand this rule an order executes only when both bid and ask meet bid = ask so a market maker puts in a bid when he wants to buy but the trade only executes when an ask price meets his bid price when you see a quote for a stock it is the price of the last trade so it is possible to have a quote higher or lower then both the bid and the ask

this is kind of halfway between the stuff i was talking about and halfway to the stuff i do n't want to get into but it raises some very legitimate and relevant points that are kind of separate from the gold standard debate    the big question taking the banks out of it is a two fold one that goes something like this    is it possible to have a modern economy without credit markets and   is it possible to have functional credit markets without some sort of fractional reserve currency   for example let 's say toyota decides to design a new car before they can sell a single unit someone in africa or somewhere has to dig up the minerals to make it someone has to design it tools have to be re worked all that kind of stuff building one car of a new design might cost a billion dollars or wiki    obviously it 's not realistic for toyota to expect the first customer to pay that much they amortize the design and tooling costs over the expected production run or whatever moreover we might say that only companies that have amassed a billion dollars in physical gold from previous sales should be able to do that kind of thing   but there is a relevant question of whether this makes any kind of sense should toyota have to literally ship or of physical gold through middlemen and suppliers to the miner in africa down to the actual guy who digs up the aluminum or whatever in order to make this transaction happen    how would that work without some sort of intermediary promises    i 'm imagining a scenario where toyota sends an armored truck full of gold out to go find half a ton of aluminum the drivers can not rely on any promises or fractional reserve they must only trade the physical gold in their truck for actual aluminum or expenses along the way    this starts to sanity in a modern economy you have to rely on the promises of middle men and suppliers and contractors and so on and the instant you have promises you have fractional reserves because people are getting paid and money is changing hands that has n't been minted yet    it 's not just the of your local supermarket having to trade a bag full of gold for a shipment of lettuce it 's that contracts to purchase would be meaningless because the driver would have had to give a smaller bag of gold to the supplier who gave a smaller bag of gold to the grower and so on moreover the supermarket would have to just wait to see what entrepreneurial driver shows up and what they have    the supermarket obviously can not order a hundred heads of lettuce per week with a promise to pay not unless we also give the supplier permission to order a hundred heads of lettuce a week from the grower and the grower permission to order seed and hire workers sufficient to grow a hundred heads of lettuce a week and the workers permission to set up car payments to get to work and the seed supplier to so on and so on   that sequence of promises is facto a fractional reserve system with or without a central bank people are promising to deliver gold cash whatever that they do n't currently have moreover it is entirely possible in a gold denominated currency for everyone to keep those promises since the gold like any currency just keeps changing hands and cycling through the economy    your example of gold certificates is exactly equivalent to privately arranged contracts promises to produce a certain amount of gold on completion it 's promises all the way down unless we insist on instant cash transactions e.g. literally handing an employee a dollar 's worth of gold every five minutes or whatever if the employee is counting on the good faith of the employer to settle up at the end of the day or week then we have a fractional reserve system whether or not    when you buy an iphone or a laptop someone had to dig up the stuff to make it out of the ground when you buy a cheeseburger someone had to grow wheat and someone else had to raise and kill a cow it 's not a reasonable proposition that they should wait for you to show up with a bag of gold before doing those things in this day and age    we trade in promises and ious sometimes that sometimes but it 's remarkable how well it does work most of the time and how much better it works than the times and places where people had to trade physical goods for physical goods    this is not an argument against a gold backed currency

according to the reference on the issue new york is a recourse state recourse means that the lender can go after you for the difference between the foreclosure discharge amount in new york the higher of the fmv or the actual sale price and the debt balance that includes your wages seizing your assets and any other method of collecting the judgement the relevant law is in the new york consolidated laws article 13 the option you 're talking about is the option any lender has anywhere not to sue you for the difference provision 3 of the paragraph if   no   motion   for   a deficiency judgment shall be made as herein    prescribed the proceeds of the sale regardless of amount shall be    deemed    to be in full satisfaction of the mortgage debt and no right    to   recover    any deficiency in any action or proceeding shall exist so if during the foreclosure they did n't sue you for the difference they can not change their mind after that if you 're not sure you can repay the loan you should probably walk away from the deal

question is what do we need to do as far as the irs is concerned i    mean we 'll get the money from them and pay it back less than two    months later you 're probably worried about the gift tax since you 're a couple the maximum exclusion amount is calculated like this the reason the pg multiplier stands separate is that gift splitting does require form 709 filed even if no tax is due unless they actually write separate checks for their respective portions so the math shows that you and your wife can get at least $ 28 k from anyone without the need of gift tax to be paid or gift tax return to be filed you can get up to $ 56 k from your parents but the gift splitting may need to be documented on form 709 since you 're in fact talking about a loan you 're going to repay you 'll need to document it with a note and everything and document the repayment if interest is being paid your parents must declare it on their tax return for the year obviously in this case if the loan is properly documented repaid and the interest is declared the irs wo n't even bother claiming it was a gift even if there 's no real interest it should n't be an issue the irs might assign some deemed interest at their rates that would be considered a gift but assuming no other gift transactions between you exist for the year the amount would be miniscule and way below the $ 14 k exclusion level of course as with any tax concern you get here what you paid for for a proper advice talk to a tax adviser ea cpa licensed in your state

if a stock that makes up a big part of the dow jones industrial    average decided to issue a huge number of additional shares that will    make the index go up at least this is what should happen since an    index is basically a sum of the market cap of the contributing    companies no indices can have various weightings the djia is a price weighted index not market cap weighted an alternative weighting besides market cap and price is equal weighting from dow jones dow jones industrial average ™ introduced in may 1896 the index also    referred to as the dow ® is a price weighted measure of 30 u.s.    blue chip companies thus i can wonder what in the new shares makes the index go up if a stock is split the dow divisor is adjusted as one could easily see how the current dow value is n't equal to the sum or the share prices of the members of the index in other cases there may be a dilution of earnings but that does n't necessarily affect the stock price directly as there may be options exercised or secondary offerings made so if the index goes up will the etf dia also go up automatically    although no additional buying has happened in the etf itself if the index rises and the etf does n't proportionally then there is an arbitrage opportunity for someone to buy the dia shares that can be redeemed for the underlying stocks that are worth more in this case look at the creation and redemption unit process that exists for etfs

i 'm surprised by all the pro credit answers here debit has some definite advantages most importantly when you pay with a credit card the merchant pays around 3 of the transaction to the credit company in many states they are forced to charge you the same amount and this is frequently as consumer protection but consider what this means for the business they loose money for every credit transaction and they 're legally forbidden to do anything about it so you 're taking 3 from a business and handing it over to a massive cooperation   to make matters worse the buisness is inevitably going to have to raise their prices by a small amount so in the end the average consumer has gained nothing on the other hand the credit card company wins big and they use their profits to pay lobbyists and lawyers to keep these rules in place to put in the worst possible light it 's essentially legal extortion on corruption as for the fraud protection offered while it may be true that credit cards will offer a more hassle free reimbursement i.e. you just do n't have to pay the bill if your card is stolen consumer protection laws also extend to debit in many cases your bank is legally required to cut you a check for all the money you lost

enterprise value is supposed to be the price you would be willing to pay to acquire the company typically companies are delivered debt free and cash free so the cash on the balance sheet at the time of the transaction is distributed to the original owners so for instance a company like apple would have a lower ev than market value because the cash on the balance sheet is not going to be included in an acquisition   and you are right there are plenty of instances where you see enterprise value lower than market value cap    if you are solely looking at equity valuation equity investing then use market cap if you are looking at firm valuation for m&amp;a then ev is more important

gt;but facebook which claims more than 900 million members had 158 million unique visitors to its site in april according to researcher up just 5 from a year ago that compares with year over year growth rates of 89 in april 2010   so about 1 in 6 users visited facebook during a particular recent month   the other 5 of 6 of users did n't visit during that month   hmmm   sounds like a lot of relatively dead fairly inactive accounts users to   and the thing is that different than other social sites like linkedin which is in a lot of ways an online resume amp business contact database facebook pretty much needs continuous and regular use that 's the premise that their whole model especially advertising wise is built on if fb reverts to people simply using it to maintain a once or twice a year update on movements of friends i.e. it becomes the equivalent of a card list storage site then it 's potential value diminishes rather dramatically   gt;also the social network is testing ways to allow those under 13 currently prohibited to participate with parental supervision   which seems from a cynical perspective anyway to be a sign that they are potentially getting desperate to maintain the purported growth in number of users and in a certain sense they are doing what all companies with saturated markets do a futile attempt to pull future demand into the present which of course to the extent that it succeeds anyway really just moves the inevitable that much closer     edit and in addition not surprisingly it looks like principle which tends to be recursive of the roughly 20 unique visitors during the month probably the majority of them roughly 80 of the 16 engaged in minimal activity with only some 20 of it and thus somewhere round of the total user base being truly active and then again probably only 20 of that maybe at or under 1 were of the users that everyone thinks are

if you withdraw all or most of your pension 25 is tax free but the rest is treated as income upon which you will pay income tax at the usual uk rates withdrawing a lump sum to buy property is therefore unlikely to be 10 per annum as you 'll spend years making up lost ground on the initial capital investment if your pension is a self invested personal pension a sipp you could buy property within the pension wrapper itself which would avoid the income tax hit if you do n't have a sipp you may be able to convert your pension to a sipp but you would be wise to seek professional advice about that the uk government is also introducing an additional 3 stamp duty on properties which are not your first home so this may further impact your returns this would apply whether you withdraw your pension as cash or buy the property within a sipp one other alternative to an annuity in the uk is called drawdown where you keep the money invested in your pension as it is now and withdraw an annual income this means your tax bill is reduced as you get to use your annual allowance each year and will also pay less higher rate tax the government provides more details on its website

you ca n't currently avoid it the reason the legislation was introduced was to prevent the big name developers from setting up shop in a low vat country and selling apps to citizens of eu countries that would normally be paying a much higher vat   you need to register for vat and file quarterly nil returns so that you get that money back it 's a hassle but probably worth it just to recoup those funds   from an article in from late 2014 you see in the uk we have a rather sensible exemption on vat for    businesses that earn under £ a year this allows people to run    small businesses like making and selling games in your spare time    for instance without the administrative nightmare of registering as    a business and paying vat on sales unfortunately none of the other    eu member states had an exemption like this so when the new    legislation was being put together there was no exemption factored    in that means that if someone makes even £ 1 from selling something    digital to another person in another eu country they now have to be    vat registered in the uk and they have to pay tax on that sale at    whatever rate the buyer ’s country of residence has set that could be    25 in sweden 21 in the netherlands and so on there ’s one piece of good news even though anyone who sells digital    stuff now has to be vat registered in the uk they do n’t actually have    to pay vat on sales to people in the uk if they earn less than £    from it this concession was achieved earlier this month after    extensive lobbying but they ’ll still have to submit what ’s called a    nil return which is essentially a tax return with nothing on it    every quarter in order to use the vat moss service that ’s a lot of    paperwork obviously brexit may have a significant impact on all this so the rules might change   this is the official google link to how they 've implemented this and for which countries it affects   due to vat laws in the european union eu google is responsible for    determining charging and remitting vat for all google play store    digital content purchases by eu customers google will send vat for eu    customers digital content purchases to the appropriate authority you do n't need to calculate and send vat separately for eu customers    even if you 're not located in the eu this change in vat laws will    still apply

irr is subjective if you could provide another metric instead of the irr then this would make sense you ca n't spend irr for example you purchase a property with a down payment and the property provides cash flow you could show that your internal rate of return is 35 but your actual rate of importance could be the ror or cap rate i feel that irr is very subjective irr is hardly looked at top mba programs it 's studied but other metrics are used such as roi ror etc irr should be a tool that you visually compare to another metric irr can be very misleading for example it 's like the cash on cash return on an investment

first off i 'm very sorry for your loss   depending on when the money comes in i would park it and give it some time   after that one of the best investments is paying off debt   right now your net worth is less than 30 k and that is really not even accessible until retirement   if the money is there to pay off the house i would do that   if there is n't enough to pay off the house then i would pay off the automobile and put all or a sizable portion of the remainder into the house   now you have very little risk in your life and most likely much more monthly income to invest in 401 k iras college funds or any other investment life insurance is mostly to replace your income if there are people counting on that income spouse kids etc   normally this would be invested to hopefully replace that income with the growth of the money   in your case it does n't sound like you were relying on your father 's income so this can go to clean up current debt finally depending on your relationship what kind of person your father was and how he was with financials what do you think he would want you to do with it

seriously have you ever actually done any research on the cpi before making such silly claims   gt;this is also kind of glossing over the fact that the cpi essentially makes the bold argument that energy and transportation prices never affect inflation   from the cpi website      gt;which index is the official cpi reported in the media our broadest and most comprehensive cpi is called the all items consumer price index for all urban consumers cpi u for the u.s. city average 1982 84 = 100   gt;in addition to the all items cpi bls publishes thousands of other consumer price indexes one such index is called all items less food and energy some users of cpi data use this index because food and energy prices are relatively volatile and these users want to focus on what they perceive to be the core or underlying rate of inflation   gt;again while we publish many indexes our broadest measure of inflation includes all items consumers purchase including food and energy in addition when cpi data are reported these data can be reported on a not seasonally adjusted basis as well as a seasonally adjusted basis often the media will report some or all of the following

this is a slightly different reason to any other answer i have seen here about irrationality and how being rationally aware of one 's irrationality in the future or in different circumstances can lead you to make decisions which on the face of it seem wrong first of all why do people sometimes maintain balances on high interest debt when they have savings standard advice on many money management sites and forums is to withdraw the savings to pay down the debt however i think there is a problem with this suppose you have $ 5,000 in a savings account and a $ 2,000 credit card balance you are paying more interest on the credit card than you get from the savings account and it seems that you should withdraw some money from the savings account and pay off the cc however the difference between the two scenarios other than the interest you lose by keeping the cc balance is your motivation for saving if you have a credit card balance of $ 2,000 you might be obliged to pay a minimum payment of $ 100 each month if you have any extra money you will be rewarded if you pay more in to the credit card by seeing the balance go down and understanding that you will soon be free from receiving this awful bill each month to maintain your savings goal it 's enough to agree with yourself that you wo n't do any new spending on the cc or withdraw any savings   now suppose that you decide to pay off the cc with the savings there is now nothing forcing you to save $ 100 each month when you get to the end of the month you have to motivate yourself that you will be adding spare cash to your $ 3,000 savings balance rather than that you have to pay down your cc yes if you spend the spare cash instead of saving it you get something in return for it but it is possible that spending $ 140 on small scale discretionary spending things you do n't need actually gets you less for your money than paying the credit card company $ 40 interest and saving $ 100 you might even be tempted to start spending on your credit card again knowing that you have a 0 balance and that you can always pay it off out of savings it 's easy to this to a situation with two types of debt suppose that you have a $ 2,000 debt to your parents with no interest and a $ 2,000 loan at high interest and you get a $ 2,000 windfall let 's assume that your parents do n't need the money in a hurry and are n't you to pay them otherwise you could consider the guilt or the hassle as a form of emotional interest rate might it not be better to pay your parents off if you do you are likely to keep paying off your loan out of necessity of making the regular payments in 20 paychecks or whatever you might be debt free if you pay off your loan you lose the incentive to save after 20 months you still owe your parents $ 2,000 i am not saying that this is always what makes sense just that it could make sense note that this is an opposite to the debt snowball method that method says that it 's better to pay off small debts because that way you have more free cash flow to pay off the larger debts the above argues that this is a bad idea because you might spend the increased cash flow on junk it would be better to keep around as many things as possible which have minimum payments because it restricts you to paying things rather than gives you the choice of whether to save or spend

several things to consider i do n't see why your friend should pay any tax it 's not his income at all and i am not sure where your income should be taxed in this scenario is he declaring it as his income somehow the bank wo n't do it for him the transfer as such should be transparent on the other hand money on his account could in principle look suspicious although € 300 is unlikely to raise alarm what i do know is that if you do pay taxes 20 is not particularly high as such there are four brackets of income tax and tax like contributions to the pension system in the netherlands between and 52 rates for personal taxes in the netherlands are simply way higher than what you might be used to in eastern europe or what has been mentioned in comments   in fact if anything 20 seems too low i am at a loss guessing what it could correspond to you could ask your friend how he came to that number there various tax discounts and deductions that apply to freelance work and some that apply to all incomes € 3000 yearly is quite low and would probably not be taxed at all if you were recently registered as freelance in the netherlands and had no other sources of income but on the other hand if your money is treated as being part of your friend 's income these would n't apply as he is probably already benefiting from them there are special rules for copyright fees not sure this is necessarily 100 kosher but i have met people who got paid that way for articles they wrote in trade publications

the best ask is the lowest ask and the best bid is the highest bid   if the ask was lower than the bid then they crossed and that would be a crossed market and quickly resolved so the bid will almost always be cheaper than the ask a heuristic is that a bid is the revenue of the stock at any given time while the ask is the cost so the market will only ever offer a profit to itself not to the liquidity seeker if examining the book vertically all orders are usually sorted descending since the best ask is the lowest ask it is on the bottom of the asks and vice versa for the best bid the best bid best ask will be those closest since that 's the spread and price time priority will promise that a bid that crosses the asks will hit the lowest ask the best possible price for the bidder and vice versa for an ask that crosses the best bid

in the us a surviving family member that inherits the entire property may also assume the mortgage   if the new mortgagee fails to uphold the terms of the mortgage i.e. make timely payments the can begin foreclosure proceedings   there is generally no requirement to pay off the mortgage quickly this is obviously the simple case where one person inherits the entire property if the estate is split and no one person inherits the house or if the house is left to a non relative things get more complicated   effectively in that case the house is either sold to pay off the mortgage or the needs to take out a new mortgage to pay off the old one

i would never use a market order   some brokerages have an approval process your short sale goes through before going to market   this can take some time   so the market prices may well be quite different later some brokerages use a separate account for short sales so you must get their approval for the account before you can do the trade    i like the listing of shares available for shorting the interactive brokers has but i have experienced orders simply going into dead air and sitting there on the screen not being rejected not going to market not doing anything even though the shares are on the list

i can only share with you my happened with my wife and i. first and foremost if you think you need to protect your assets for some reason then do so be open and honest about it if we get a divorce x stays with me and y stays with you   this seems silly even when your doing it but it 's important you can speak with a lawyer about this stuff as you need to but get it in writing now i know this seems like planning for failure but if you feel that foo is important to you and you want to retain ownership of foo no mater what then you have to do this step it also works both ways you can use with some limitations this to insulate your new family unit from your personal risks for example my business is mine if we break up it stays mine the income is shared but the business is mine this creates a barrier that if someone from 10 years ago sues my business then my wife is protected from that keep in mind different countries different rules next and this is my advise give up on his and hers everything it 's just ours together you make 5400 € decide how to spend 5400 € together pick your goals together the pot is end of line it does n't matter how much from one person or how much from another unless your talking about mitigating losses from sick days or injuries or leave etc all that matters is that you make start your budgeting there   next setup an equal allowance that is money set aside for non sense reasons i like to buy video games my wife likes to buy books this is not for vacation or stuff together but just little tiny stuff you can do for your self without asking   permission the number should be small and equal maybe   finally setup a budget house stuff 200 € car stuff etc etc then it does n't matter who bought the house stuff you only have to coordinate so that you do n't both buy house stuff after some time took us around 6 months you will find out how this works and you can add on some rules for example i do n't go to best buy alone i will spend too much on house stuff my wife does n't like to make the budget so i handle that then we go over it things like that

i just want to point out something that seems to be generally true if you are supposed to report something to the irs and you do n't the irs will probably send you a letter assuming the maximum possible tax liability and it 's up to you to prove that scenario is incorrect in your case you obviously owe no tax but since you did n't report it the irs simply assumed that you do owe tax until you prove otherwise you 're one form away from fixing the issue i have first hand experience that this is also true if you forget to report an hsa distribution i received a letter considering my entire distribution as if it was for non eligible medical expenses this made the amount taxable and had an additional 20 penalty to boot of course i have medical receipts for all of the distributions which makes them not taxable and had i simply put the correct number on my return to begin with i would n't have had to fill out the additional form to correct my mistake

anything related to the central bank will have a large impact as they are the ones who determine interest rates and interest rates have a big effect on currency flows   gdp is also important as when there is an economic slowdown it may result in the central bank reducing rates to boost economic activity the opposite is also true large increases in gdp may mean that an interest rate hike might be needed inflation data is also very important again large changes in inflation either way may push the central bank towards changing rates this data typically is in the form of cpi note that each central bank is different they all have specific mandates and specific pieces of economic data that they place emphasis on the federal reserve as of late has closely been watching inflation data especially wage inflation data and employment significant deviations in these data points from what s expected by investors can greatly move the market however these specific factors are a little less important for say mexico which is mostly concerned with headline inflation read the statements issued by the central banks to find out what s important to them central banks also issue expectations for things like growth cpi etc if these expectations are not met it may result in a policy change or at least talk of a policy change at the next meeting of the central bank anticipating these policy changes and trading accordingly is one strategy to be a profitable forex trader also there are several forex news calendars online that indicate what is likely to be high impact news these can be helpful starting out

currency exchange is rather the norm than the exception in international wire transfers so the fact that the amount needs to be exchanged should have no impact at all the processing time depends on the number of participating banks and their speeds typically between europe and the us one or two business days are the norm sending from other countries might involve more steps banks   which each takes a bit of time however anything beyond 5 business days is not normal consider if there are external delays how did you initiate the sending was it in person with an agent of the bank who might have put it on a stack and they type it in only a day later or worse or was it online so it is in the system right away on the receiver side how did you your friend check could there be a delay by waiting for an account statement finally and that is the most common reason were all the numbers names and codes absolutely correct even a small mismatch in name spelling might trigger the receiving bank to not allocate the money into the account either way if you contact the sender bank you will be able to make them follow up on it they must be able to trace where they money went and where it currently is if it is stuck they will be able to get it

a very interesting topic as i am moving to the us in a month i realise this thread is old but its been helpful to me   my observations from my home country   before we judge anyone who does n't use direct deposit or who prefers to be paid in cold hard cash consider that direct deposit is a luxury of stability steady job home etc direct deposit does n't make sense for a contractor or day who expect to work for a different person each day or week   well here a contractor would still be paid by a direct deposit even if he was working for many different people on the invoice the contractor provides bank account details and customer logs onto their internet banking and pays electronically it is a a very simple process and is the preferred method of payment by most businesses even small contractors many accounting software programs are linked to bank accounts and can quickly reconcile accounts for small business many businesses will not accept a cheque in australia anymore as they are considered to be a higher risk   i started work in 1994 and have never received any payment except via direct deposit

great idea so lets make trader joes in locations where people need living wages like the ghetto because that has been working /s   you make a store that makes a premium selling to the upper middle class and can afford to pay their workers more because of these better margins from their abnormally higher prices it does n't work in areas where cheap food is a necessity these kinds of stores ca n't sell in all economic classes so these stores giving living wages do n't solve any issues we have regarding wage gentrification does n't work so i do n't see why i keep seeing articles talk about trader joes suddenly solving our minimum wage debate if i see a company that rivals walmart in price yet can give a living wage while still being profitable then we have something costco is what comes to mind and to be honest it 's probably the best example we can take from a good business that is able to give a decent wage for unskilled labor while still being profitable the issue is not everyone can afford to spend $ 100 to buy 20 jars of to save 10 cents a jar to rival walmart 's savings

i do n't think there 's any federal law prohibiting them from allowing you to autopay more than your minimum   certainly there are federal laws telling them what to do with payments more than the minimum they must apply the leftover to the principal by default so the law does n't assume you ca n't overpay however federal law does require them to advance your next payment date if you overpay by a multiple of your minimum payment i.e. if your payment is $ 50 and you send them $ 100 you do n't have to make your next payment though interest still accrues of course   it 's possible navient is n't interested in implementing this functionality in their autopay who knows in any event assuming you have a bank that has functionality you may want to consider using that either for the extra or for the whole amount if navient is n't giving you a discount for autopay if so use that at least   your bank is happy to cut a check in any amount and send it on and navient is required to apply it to the principal   though if you do the autopay and billpay and are sending an extra amount less than a whole payment verify that they 're willing to accept amounts less than a full payment first not all lenders are

they are purchasing the company is this correct yes this is correct if i purchase a company here in australia i also purchase its assets and liabilities yes that is correct how can it be nil how can it be legal the value of shares or shareholders is assets liabilities generally a healthy company has assets that are greater than its liabilities and hence the company has value and shareholders have value of the shares in case of ten the company has more liabilities even after all assets are sold off there is not enough money left out to pay all the creditors hence the company is in administration i.e. it is now being managed by regulated australian authority the job of the administrator is to find out suitable buyers so that most of the creditors are paid off and if there is surplus pay off the shareholder or arrive at a suitable deal in case of ten the liabilities are so large that no one is ready to buy the company and the deal of cbs will also mean nothing gets paid to existing shareholders as the value is negative as the company is separate legal entity they ca n't recover the negative from shareholders even the current creditors may not be paid in full and may get a pro rated due and may lose some money

keep in mind that the only portion of the mbs that was rated aaa was the most senior tranche it achieved this rating due to the buffer to principal losses provided by the equity and mezzanine tranches so for the principal to be at risk for the aaa senior tranche 10 of the mortgages in the pool would have to default since this number was way higher than historical default rates it seemed safe obviously looking back we know that risk management underestimated the effect that lowered lending standards would have on the default rates if they did project a rise in default rates they did not project a large enough rise   as well while the mbs is exposed to systemic risk as happened when the entire country was affected by the collapse they were packaged to avoid other risks for example the pool would spread out mortgages across the country and other various factors would be hedged so that if a natural disaster hits state x and everyone defaults on their mortgage you are only losing a small part of the underlying   i assume hope that at some point the quantitative analysis people in risk management at the major investment banks realized that the default rates would rise given the lower lending standards being employed but chose to ignore it they chose to ignore it because investors still wanted to buy it and the banks make money by collecting fees on issuing securities

if you are calculating simple roi the answer is straightforward math   see this answer for some examples but yes with more leverage you will always see better roi on a property if you can maintain a positive cash flow   the most complete answer is to factor in your total risk that high roi of a leveraged property is far more volatile and sensitive to any unexpected expenses additionally a loss of equity in the property or an upside down mortgage will further impact your long term position to put this more simply as noted in the comments below your losses will be amplified you can not say a leveraged property will always give you a better roi because you can not predict your losses

you can have as many ira accounts as you want whether roth or traditional so you can have a roth ira with american funds and another roth ira with vanguard if you like one disadvantage of   having too many ira accounts with small balances in each is that most custodians   including vanguard charge an annual fee for maintaining ira accounts with small balances but waive the fee if the balance is large so it is best to keep your roth ira in just one or two funds with just one or two custodians until such time as investment returns plus additional contributions made over the years makes the balances large enough to diversify further remember also that you can not contribute the maximum to each ira the sum total of all your ira contributions does n't matter whether to roth or to traditional iras for any year must satisfy the limit for that year you can move money from one ira of yours to another ira of the same type of yours without any tax issues to worry about such movements called rollovers or transfers are   not contributions and do not count towards the annual contribution limit the easiest way to do move money from one ira account to another ira account is by a trustee to trustee transfer where the money goes directly from one custodian american funds in this case to the other custodian vanguard in this case the easiest way of accomplishing this is to call vanguard or go online on their website tell them that you are wanting to   establish a roth ira with them and that you want to fund it by transferring money held in a roth ira with american funds give vanguard the account   number of your existing american funds ira tell them how much   you want to transfer over $ 1000 or $ 20,000 or the entire balance as the case may be and tell vanguard to go get the money   in a few days time the money will appear in your new vanguard roth ira and the american funds roth ira will have a smaller balance possibly a zero balance or might even be closed if you told vanguard to collect the entire balance   do not approach american funds and tell them that you want to transfer money to a new roth ira with vanguard they will bitch and and drag their heels about doing so because   they are unhappy to lose your business and will probably screw up the transfer talk to vanguard only they are eager to get their hands on your ira money and will gladly take care of the whole thing for you at no charge to you do not cash in any stock shares or mutual fund shares or whatever is in your roth ira in preparation for cashing out of the old account there is a method where you take a rollover distribution from your american funds roth ira and then deposit the money into your new vanguard roth ira within 60 days but i recommend most strongly against using this because too many people manage to screw it up it is 60 days not two months the clock starts from the day american funds cuts your check not when you get the check and it is stopped when the money gets deposited into your new account not the day you mailed the check to vanguard or the day that vanguard received it   and so on in short do not try this at home   stick to a trustee to trustee transfer and avoid the hassles

i answered a similar question before essentially you should n't trust a site you find on the internet merely because it looks professional and real   before signing up with any new service provider you found online you should verify the authenticity of both the organization itself and their web site address even if the name displayed by a web site represents a legitimate brokerage firm any site you happen to come across on the internet could be an elaborate of a real company intended to capture your personal details or worse first to check if a brokerage firm is in fact registered to trade securities in the united states you can consult finra 's online service   this might be the first of many checks you should undertake after you convince yourself that finra is legitimate   a meta problem then if you want to know if the web site address is authentic one way is to contact that broker offline using the contact information found from a trusted source such as the finra details   unfortunately those details do not currently appear to contain the broker 's web site url   else that could be useful another thing to look at is the site 's login or sign up page for a valid ssl certificate that is both issued to the correct legal name of the brokerage firm as well as has been signed by a well known certificate authority e.g. for a financial services firm of any kind you should look for and expect to see an extended validation certificate   any other kind of certificate might only assert that the certificate was issued to the domain name owner and not necessarily to an organization with the registered legal name   yes anybody can register a domain with a similar name and then acquire a basic ssl certificate for that domain fwiw scottrade and sharebuilder are both legitimate brokers i was aware already of each but i also just checked in the finra tool and the urls currently linked to by the question are legitimate web site addresses for each   also you can see their ev certificates in action on secured pages here and here as to whether your investments with those brokers would be safe in the event of the broker failing e.g. goes bankrupt you 'll want to know that they are members of the securities investor protection corporation wikipedia   of course this kind of protection does n't protect you if your investments simply go down in value but do your own due diligence always

this is basically what financial advisers have been saying for years that you should invest in higher risk securities when you are young and lower risk securities when you get older however despite the fact that this is taken as truth by so many financial professionals financial economists have been unable to formulate a coherent theory that supports it   by changing the preferences of their theoretical investors they can get solutions like putting all your investments in a super safe asset until you get to a minimum survival level for retirement and then investing aggressively and many other solutions   but for none of the typically assumed preferences does investing aggressively when young and becoming more conservative as you near retirement seem to be the solution   i 'm not saying there can be no such preferences but the difficulty in finding them makes me think maybe this idea is not actually correct couple of problems with your intuition that you should think about it 's not clear that things average out over time   if you lose a bunch of money in some asset there 's no reason to think that by holding that asset for a while you will make back what you lost prices are not cyclical   moreover does n't your intuition implicitly suggest that you should transition out of risky securities as you get older perhaps after having lost money you can invest in safe assets or even better the portfolio from your graph and then lever up if you do want higher risk return   you do n't need to change your allocation to risky assets and it is suboptimal to do so you want to move along the cal not the curve the riskiness of your portfolio should generally coincide negatively with your risk aversion   when you are older and more certain about your life expectancy and your assets are you exposed to more or less risks   in many cases less risks   this means you would choose a more risky portfolio because you are more sure you will have enough to live on until death even if your portfolio takes a dive your actual portfolio consists both of your investments and your human capital the present value of your time and skills   when you are young the value of this capital changes significantly with market performance so you already have background risk   buying risky securities adds to that risk   when you are old your human capital is worth little so your overall portfolio becomes less risky   you might want to compensate by increasing the risk of your investments edit note that this point may depend on how risky your human capital is how likely it is that your wage or job prospects will change with the economy overall the answer to your question is not definitively known but there is theoretical evidence that investing in risky securities when young is n't optimal having said that most people do seem to invest in riskier securities when young and safer when they are older i suspect this is because with life experience people become less optimistic as they get older not because it is optimal to do so   but i ca n't be sure

there contracts called an fx forwards where you can get a feel for what the market thinks an exchange rate will be in the future   now exchange rates are notoriously uncertain but it is worth noting that at current prices market believes your will be worth only euro less three years from now than it is worth now so if you are considering taking money out of your investments and converting it to euro and missing out on three years of dividends and hopefully capital gains its certainly possible this may work out for you but this is unlikely   if you are at all uncertain that you will actually move this is an even worse idea as paying to convert money twice would be an additional expense on top of the missed returns there are fx financial products futures and forwards where you can get exposure to fx without having to put the full amount down   this could help hedge your house value but this can be extremely expensive over time for individual investors and would almost certainly not work in your favor something that could help reduce your risk a bit would be to invest more heavily in european even irish and british stocks which will move along with the currency and economy   you can lose some diversification doing this but it can help a little

you must file as married for 2013 if you were married as of december 31 2013 it is true that the roth ira contribution phaseout for married filing separately is 0 $ 10k. but you can still do backdoor roth ira contribution contribute to a traditional ira then convert it to a roth ira assuming you do not have any pre tax iras this is identical to a roth ira contribution but you already made a roth ira contribution for 2013 and did not do the backdoor let 's assume that you want to turn it into a backdoor roth ira contribution and that you do n't have any pre tax iras there are two ways to do this withdraw the roth ira you contributed including earnings then do a normal backdoor roth ira contribution contribute to a traditional ira then immediately convert it to roth ira the earnings you had in the roth ira that you withdrew will be treated as normal income and taxed the conversion will not be taxable because all of the traditional ira was non deductible when you converted re characterize your original roth ira contribution as a traditional ira contribution then convert it to roth ira it will be treated as if you made a traditional ira contribution originally and then waited until now to convert the earnings in the ira up till now will be taxed on conversion so in both cases you will need to pay income tax on the earnings in the account up to now the difference between the two is in the amount of money in the ira now with the first way you can only contribute $ 5500 now with the second way you will keep the same amount of money you have in the ira now

the auto industry maybe has to worry about safety standards however these standards have been set for decades it 's not like they 're making new kinds of cars that would be unsafe by adopting a completely different design or principle but for drugs every mechanism in health is different a body is much more complex and still not completely understood so while you may have a drug that can affect a certain biological pathway it may also destroy another that you may not notice until 10 years from now when it 's too late the company would then have to pay a settlement such as and templates story resulting in a billion loss   pharma is n't cheap to research which is why pharma research is dying

first it 's clear from your story that you very likely should be able to receive some financial aid   that may be in the form of loans or better grants in which you just get free money to attend college   for example a pell grant   you wo n't get all you 'd need for a free ride this way but you can really make a dent in what you 'd pay   the college may likely also provide financial aid to you   in order to get any of this though you have to fill out a fafsa   there are deadlines for this for each state and each college there you would ask individually   i 'd get looking into that as soon as you can do student loans have to be paid monthly   any loan is a specific agreement between a lender and a borrower so any payment terms could apply such as or quarterly   but monthly seems like the most reasonable assumption   generally you should assume the least favorable reasonably likely terms for you so that you are prepared for a worst case scenario   let 's say monthly can i just as i had hoped borrow large sums of money and only start    paying them after college yes   that is a fair summary of all a student loan is   importantly though some loans are federal government subsidized loans for which the interest on the loan is paid for you as long as you stay in college + 6 months although do check that is the current situation   unsubsidized loans may accrue interest from the start of the loan period   if you have the option obviously try hard to get the subsidized loans as the interest can be significant   i made a point to only take subsidized loans    warning student loans currently enjoy a nearly unique status in america as being one of the only loan types that are not in bankruptcy   this means that if you leave college with $ 100,000 in debt that begins accruing interest there is no way for you to get out of it short of fleeing the country or existence   and at that point the creditors may come after your mother for the balance   these loans can balloon into outrageous amounts due to compounding interest   please have a healthy fear of student loans   for more on this listen to this hour long radio program about this would a minimum wage job help   of course it will help but will it help enough   that depends on how much you work   if you make $ and work 20 hrs week for all but 3 weeks of the year after taxes you will be adding about $ 6,000 to offset your costs   in 3 years of college see below that 's $ 18,000 which depending on where you go is not bad at helping costs   if you are at full time 40 hrs then it is $ 12k yr or $ 36k toward costs   these numbers are nothing to sniff at do you have any computer web graphics skills   it 's possible you could find ways to make more than minimum wage if you learn some niche it industry skill   if i could go back and re do those years i would n't have wasted much time delivering pizzas and would have learned html in the 90s and would have potentially made some significant money would college and full time job be manageable together   that 's highly specific to each situation which job   how far a commute to it   which major how efficient are you   how easily do you learn but i would say that for the most part it 's not a good idea not only for the academic achievement side of it but the personal enrichment aspect of college   clubs sports relationships activities dorm bull sessions all that good stuff they deserve their space and time and it 'd be a shame to miss out on that because you 're on the 2nd shift at wal mart 40hrs week how do i find out what scholarships grants and financial aid i can apply for   are you in a high school with a career or guidance counselor   if so go to that person about this as a start   if not there are tons of resources out there   public libraries should have huge directories of scholarships   the federal student loan program has a website   there are also a lot of resources online found by just searching google for scholarships though do be careful about any online sources including this advice lastly please carefully consider the overall cost vs. benefit to you   college in 2012 is anything but cheap   a typical price for a textbook is $ 150 or more   tuition and board can range over $ 40k at private colleges   there is a recent growing call for americans to re think the automatic nature of going to college considering the enormous financial burden it puts many families under   charles murray for one has put out a book suggesting that far too many students go to college now to society 's and many individuals detriment he 's a controversial thinker but i think some of his points are valid and actually urgent   with all that said consider ways to go to college but keep costs down   public colleges in your state will almost always be significantly cheaper than private or out of state   once there aim for as and bs don't cheat yourself out of what you pay for   and lastly consider a plan in which you complete college in three years by attending summer courses   this website has a number of other options for helping to reduce the cost of college

there is plenty of over in the majority of these answers when the simple answer is that it is simply down to statistics say an insurer had two pieces of information about two separate drivers annual mileage and whether they had had an accident in the last 3 years driver a drives 10,000 miles a year and has n't had an accident in the past 3 years driver b drives 500 miles a year and has n't had an accident in the past 3 years which would the insurer think was the safer bet the answer is a and this makes his premiums lower the reason for this is that the insurer has a lot more data about driver a than driver b they know that driver a has driven 30,000 miles without having an accident this could of course be luck or a fluke but it is likely that driver a is actually a safe driver the chance that driver a has n't had an accident just through sheer luck and that they are actually a terrible driver is quite slim on the other hand driver b has only driven 1,500 miles in the past three years whilst this seems like prima evidence of them being as safe a driver as driver a it is much more likely that driver b could have driven 1,500 miles and avoided an accident through sheer luck even though they are a terrible driver   this means drivers who drive low amounts of mileage will be penalised relative to other drivers who have high mileage it has nothing to do with insurers taking a judgement that doing more mileage makes you more experienced or makes you a better driver as others have suggested here although it is probably true it 's not quantifiable from an insurer 's perspective

there seems to be a disconnect between brands and channels in which brands advertise while i see and agree the point of the article it treats all media channels as equal where there are clear differences between them and as an extension the level of confidence given to a brand as a result    the author does focuses on the millennials as a target group that is less receptive to advertising but neglects to take into account the sheer volume of advertising that is around us compared to ten or even twenty years ago the increase has been exponential today it ’s almost impossible to even go to even a family without having it sponsored by your local dentist real estate agent and pizza chain   the fact that millennial are performing more due diligence is not just a reflection on the group as a whole but speaks volumes of the sheer quantity of many low quality options of media and advertising we come across on a daily basis

no do n't bother   you need to decide what you are saving for and how much risk you are prepared to take it would make sense if you wanted the money only in x years and could n't afford to lose say 20 or more if the stock market crashed the day before you needed the cash   typically if you are about to retire and buy an annuity you want to protect your capital   this is n't you at 28 you might be saving for a wedding a deposit on a house possibly for school fees or for eventual retirement   it does n't sound like you need to get back exactly 24k in july 2022 keep the 6 months expenses in accounts that you can withdraw from at short notice   some of this in a current account some might be in a savings account that does n't pay interest if you make withdrawals after that i 'd stick most of the rest in stock market tracker funds but you might go for actively managed funds instead ask another question and take professional advice there will presumably be local tax considerations too and add in most of your monthly savings too   these should beat the 2.3 over the 5 years and you can liquidate them easily if you want to buy a house if there is a recession and a stock market dip you presumably have the flexibility to hold on to them longer for the economy to recover   and if you are intending to buy a house then a recession will probably also involve a fall in house prices so the loss in your savings will be somewhat balanced by the drop in the purchase price of your house of course the worst case scenario is a severe downturn where you lose your job are unemployed for a considerable period of time burn through your emergency fund and need to sell shares at a considerable loss to meet your expenses    you might have family or dependents that you can borrow from or would need to support which would change your tolerance for risk   having money locked away for 5 years in this scenario is even worse   so if you do n't want to put all your non emergency savings into the stock market you still want to choose something that is accessible at a slightly lower interest rate but ultimately it sounds like you can afford to lose some of your savings and the probability is that you will be rewarded with much better returns than 2.3 over 5 years

these have the potential to become end of the world scenarios so i 'll keep this very clear if you start to feel that any particular investment may suddenly become worthless then it is wise to liquidate that asset and transfer your wealth somewhere else if your wealth happens to be invested in cash then transferring that wealth into something else is still valid   digging a hole in the ground is n't useful and running for the border probably wo n't be necessary consider countries that have suffered actual currency collapse and debt default   take zimbabwe for example   even as inflation went into the millions of percent the zimbabwe stock exchange soared as investors were prepared to spend ever more of their devaluing currency to buy stable stocks in a small number of locally listed companies even if the euro were to suffer a critical fall european companies would probably be ok if you did n't panic and dig in the back garden over the fall of dotcom there is no need to panic over the decline of certain currencies   just diversify your risk and buy non cash or euro assets update a few ideas re diversification the problem for greece is n't really a euro problem it is local local property local companies these can be affected by default because no one believes in the entirety of the greek economy not just the currency it happens to be using so diversification really means buying things that are outside greece

first keep about six months expenses in immediately available form savings account or similar second determine how long you expect to hold on to the rest of it   what 's your timeframe for buying a house or starting a family   this determines what you should do with the rest of it if you 're buying a house next year then a cd certificate of deposit is a reasonable option low ish interest but something probably roughly inflation level and quite safe and you can plan things so it 's available when you need it for the down payment if you 've got 3 5 years before you want to touch this money then invest it in something reasonably safe   you can find reasonable funds that have a fairly low risk profile usually a combination of stock and bonds with a few percent higher rate of return on average   still could lose money but wo n't be all that risky if you 've got over five years then you should probably invest them in an etf that tracks a large market sector in the us i 'd suggest voo or similar vanguard 's s&p 500 fund i 'm sure australia has something similar which tracks the larger market   risky but over 5 + years unlikely to lose money and will likely have a better rate of return than anything else 6 or higher is reasonable to expect   five years is long enough that it 's vanishingly unlikely to lose money over the time period and fairly likely to make a good return accept the higher risk here for the greater return and do n't cringe when the market falls as it will go up again   then when you get close to your target date start pulling money out of it and into cds or safer investments during up periods

as has been said before going from nothing to something is an infinite percent increase it is not 100 maybe you had a dollar and now have $ 101 that is a 10000 increase quite remarkable i often work with percent changes like spc = 100 where i compute the percent with respect to the average first this is more stable as often measurements can have noise the average is more reliable   second advantage is also that this is so going from 95 to 105 is a 10 increase while going from 105 to 95 a 10 decrease of course you need to explain what you show

i 'm assuming this is a publicly traded company if not things are somewhat different the objection that management might have that flows out of the fact that the pool of available options is fixed in size for the current year or maybe several years depending on how they structured the compensation plan within that pool they have allocated some to various key individuals and then some to to the esop pool they do n't want requests for more options than they planned to issue in that period suppose that many people notice that the companies prospects are good and offer to forgo some salary for options this could easily eat up the whole pool and leave nothing for the rest of the year if i was management here i would want to structure it so that i had control over how many options were granted so that everyone eligible got some and the pool lasted until the end of the year

if you keep going over budget with your credit card then stop using the credit card if you plan to pay off the card every month then your balance should always be under whatever your budget is   for example if you budget to spend $ 500 then even though your card has a limit of $ 5,000 you will never carry a balance of over $ 500   most banks have an option to email and or text message you when you pass a certain balance threshold in this instance you would set two notices one when your balance exceeds $ 400 warning you that you 're close need to start paying closer attention and one when you exceed $ 500 additionally maybe you are n't ready to pay for everything with your credit card   i prefer to use mine just for groceries and then pay it off at the end of the month   whatever rewards you get for putting all of your purchases on the card are more than paid for when you cross your budget limit costing you more in interest and fees   perhaps starting with just one type of purchase groceries or gas are good choices as most consumers are fairly consistent in their purchases of both would allow you to ease into using the card until you get used to managing your budget with it personal finances are all about behavior not knowledge   do n't worry too much about slipping up right now and making a mistake just keep practicing good behavior with your credit card and soon managing your budget with it will be as natural for you as when you only used cash

when buying investment properties there are different levels of passive investment involved   at one end you have those that will buy an investment property and give it to a real estate agent to manage and do n't want to think of it again apart from watching the rent come in every week at the other end there are those that will do everything themselves including knocking on the door to collect the rent where is the best place to be well somewhere in the middle the most successful property investors treat their investment properties like a business they handle the overall management of the properties and then have a team taking care of the day to day nitty gritty of the properties regarding the brand new or 5 to 10 year old property you are going to pay a premium for the brand new a property that is 5 years old will be like new but without the premium i once bought a unit which was 2 to 3 years old for less than the original buyer bought it at brand new also you will still get the majority of the depreciation benefits on a 5 year old property you also should not expect too much maintenance on a 5 to 10 year old property another option you may want to look at is defence housing they are managed by the department of defence and you can be guaranteed rent for 10 years or more whether they have a tenant in the property or not they also carry out all the maintenance on the property and restore it to original condition once their contract is over the pitfall is that you will pay a lot more for the management of these properties up to 15 or more personally i would not go for a defence housing property as i consider the fees too high and would not agree with some of their terms and conditions however considering your emphasis on a passive investment this may be an option for you

many of the major indices    today because of this news why how    do the rising budget deficits and debt    relate to the stock markets it does seem strange that there is a correlation between government debt and the stock market   but i could see many reasons for the reaction   the downgrade by s&p may make it more expensive for the government to borrow money i.e. higher interest rates   this means it becomes more expensive for the government to borrow money and the government will probably need to raise taxes to cover the cost of borrowing   rising taxes are not good for business   also many banks in the us hold us government debt   rising yields will push down the value of their holdings which in turn will reduce the value of us debt on the businesses balance sheets   this weakens the banks balance sheets   they may even start to unload us bonds why is there such a large emphasis on    the s&p rating i do n't know   i think they have proven they are practically useless   that 's just my opinion   many though still think they are a credible ratings agency what happens when the debt ceiling is    reached theoretically the government has to stop borrowing money once the debt ceiling is reached   if this occurs and the government does not raise the debt ceiling then the government faces three choices

there can be federal estate tax as well as state estate tax due on an estate but it is not of direct concern to you estate taxes are paid by the estate of the decedent not by the beneficiaries and so you do   not owe any estate tax as a matter of fact most estates in the us do not pay federal estate tax at all because only the amount that exceeds the federal exemption $ 5.5 m is taxable and most estates are smaller state estate taxes might be a different matter because   while many states exempt exactly what the federal government does others   exempt different usually smaller amounts but in any case estate taxes are not of concern to you except insofar as what you inherit is reduced because the estate had to pay estate tax before distributing the inheritances as joetaxpayer 's answer says more succinctly what you inherit is net of estate tax if any what you receive as an inheritance is not taxable income to you either if you receive stock shares or other property your basis is the value of the property when you inherit it thus if you sell at a later time you will have to pay taxes only on the increase in the value of the property from the time you inherit it the increase in value from the time the decedent acquired the property till the date of death is not taxable income to you   exceptions to all these favorable rules to you is the treatment of traditional iras 401ks pension plans etc that you inherit that contain money on which the decedent never paid income tax distributions from such inherited accounts are mostly taxable income to you any part of post tax money such as nondeductible contributions to traditional iras that is included in the distribution is   tax free annuities present another source of complications for annuities within iras even the irs throws up its hands at explaining things to mere mortals who are foolhardy enough to delve into pub 950 saying in effect talk to your tax advisor for other annuities questions arise such as is this a tax deferred annuity and whether it was purchased with pre tax money or with post tax money etc   one thing that you should check out is whether it is beneficial to take a lump sum   distribution or just collect the money as it is distributed in monthly quarterly semi annual or annual payments annuities   in particular have heavy surrender charges if they are terminated early and the money taken as a lump sum instead of over time as the insurance   company issuing the annuity had planned on happening   so taking a lump sum would mean more income tax immediately due not just on the lump sum but because the increase in agi might reduce deductions for medical expenses as well as reduce the overall amount of itemized deductions that can be claimed increase taxability of social security   benefits etc you say that you have these angles out and so i will merely re beware the surrender charges

i 've spoken with a number of in canada and canadian bankers over the past few days   here 's what i 've been able to piece together this was surprising to me   as i understand it the only sure fire way to wire transfer funds from an arbitrary bank to another arbitrary bank on a different continent on the first try   is by using the iban number of the destination account   iban seems to be the only account number format that is anywhere close to a worldwide standard   if the destination account does not have an iban number like those in canada and usa then you rely on a degree of wisdom on the part of the sending to format your numbers account institution transit etc in such a way that the transfer successfully reaches the destination account if any given sending bank has not sent funds to another given non iban bank recently then there is an element of uncertainty as to how the destination account 's numbers have to be entered into the sending bank 's system   the de facto practice seems to be to develop the wisdom of what works and what does n't by attempting to transfer small sums until they succeed   then the sending bank uses the exact same method to transfer the large sum as they used for the small sum that succeeded it seems like there are some things you can do pro actively increase your odds that a wire transfer to a non iban account will succeed   ultimately you want to provide four different pieces of information that are especially important for non iban wire transfers all of your numbers in all applicable wire transfer number formats are often actually multiple fundamental numbers that are and   i suspect that some wire transfer actually need to enter the fundamental numbers separately or in different   suppose the sending bank needs for example the institution   the aba routing number does contain among other things the institution identifier   however you should provide the institution number separately in your wire transfer instructions because the sending bank might need the institution number and will probably have no idea how to extract it from the aba routing number for canada i think the number you should provide are as follows

let me start with a somewhat sarcastic statement there are probably as many things done to analyze a stock as there are people doing the analysis that said at a general level an analyst researches the historical performance of the company at a fairly detailed level operations within divisions of the company product development cycles within divisions expenses vs income trends for each division and product marketing costs customer acquisition costs etc gathers information about what the company is doing now and planning to do in the future often by a discussion with principles at the company establishes a view on related macro economic trends sector and industry trends demographic trends etc and combines it all to forecast a change in revenues margins free cash flow dividends etc over a period of time    they then apply statistics that relate those numbers to stock price in order to imply stock prices and price ranges over those same periods   finally depending on how those stock prices compare to the current stock price they 'll classify the stock as buy sell hold etc this sounds like alot of work    and it generally is if you get detailed about it which is what professionals or significant money managers are doing    however there are also lots of arm chair analysts posting their output on any number of financial sites seeking alpha motley fool etc if you 'd like to really explore the range of detail some people consider as a stock analysis   that sounds more negative than i intended it to be so let me clarify that i think some of these write ups are really quite good imo

grad school applications typically have deadlines around december or january so you 're thinking about this at the right time    first obviously you should get an idea of where you want to go and what kind of program there 's plenty of ranking lists online that can help give you an idea grad school applications take a non trivial amount of effort so most people apply to only 5 10   next you 'll want to contact potential references the grad school websites should inform you what type of reference they want but in my experience these were mostly academic and usually 2 3 per application finance programs may want more professional references as well try to choose the right references for the application e.g. i applied to financial engineering programs and would usually have one economics professor and then either a math professor or a statistics professor depending on the focus of the program   now check to see if your programs require a gre gmat score they probably will and start studying asap there 's tons of study materials available both in book form and online and if you can put the time in you can probably get a decent score with just a few weeks 4 6 of studying as far as i know just about every program that accepts a gmat score will also accept a gre score but not necessarily the other way around so you may be better off studying for the gre verify this   and with all those components complete you 'll basically be done some applications will ask for various forms of cover letter or have other essay questions so set aside some time to write these as well    also if you 're looking at finance master 's programs i notice that they tend to come in a few varieties some set you up for phds and are naturally more academic focused where as terminal master 's that resemble an mba will focus on trying to get you a job reflect a bit on what you want to accomplish with your degree and figure out the program that 's best for that if you get in to a top school then it wo n't matter much regardless but otherwise it is very likely that schools which produce good phd candidates and research are not necessarily the same schools which place people on wall street   hope that helps

first let me fill in the gaps on your situation based on the numbers you 've given so far i estimate that your student loan balance principal is $ with the variable rate loan option that you 've presented the maximum interest rate you could be charged would be 11.5 which would bring your monthly payment up to that $ number you gave in the comments your thoughts are correct about the advantage to paying this loan off sooner   if you are planning on paying off this loan sooner the interest rate on the variable rate loan has less opportunity to climb one thing to be cautious of with the comparison though the $ 1200 difference between the two options is only valid if your rate does not increase   if the rate does increase of course the difference would be less or it could even go the other way   so keep in mind that the $ 1200 savings is only a theoretical maximum you wo n't actually see that much savings with the variable rate option before making a decision you need to find out more about the terms of this variable rate loan how often can your rate go up what is the loan rate based on i 'm not as familiar with student loan variable rate loans but there are other variable rate loans i am familiar with with a typical adjustable rate home mortgage the rate is locked for a certain number of years perhaps 5 years   after that the bank might be allowed to raise the rate once every period of months perhaps once every year   there will be a limit to how much the rate can rise on each increase perhaps 1.0 and there will be a maximum rate that could be charged over the life of the loan perhaps 12 the interest rate on your mortgage can adjust up inside of those parameters   the actual formula used to adjust will be found in the fine print of your mortgage contract   however the bank knows that if they let your rate get too high above the current market rates you will refinance to a different bank   so the mortgage is typically structured so that it will raise your rate somewhat but it wo n't usually get too far above the market rate   if you knew ahead of time that you would have the house paid off in 5 years or that you would be selling the house before the 5 years is over you could confidently take the adjustable rate mortgage credit cards on the other hand also typically have variable rates   these rates can change every month but they are usually calculated on some formula determined ahead of time   for example on my credit card the interest rate is the published prime rate plus   on my last statement it said the rate was   of course because i pay my balance in full each month i do n't pay any interest   the rate could go up to 50 for all i care as i said i do n't know what determines the rate on your variable rate student loan option and i do n't know what the limits are   if it climbs up to 11.5 that is obviously ridiculously high   i recommend that you try to pay off this student loan as soon as you possibly can however if you are not planning on paying off this student loan early you need to try to determine how likely the rate is to climb if you want to pick the variable rate option

well it certainly has the first mover advantage i imagine tesla has become pretty efficient in its production of electric cars and they are continuously driving down costs as production expands tesla is gaining economies of scale allowing it to produce electric vehicles for much cheaper than any other company might do with its patents i think it would be difficult for new entrants to achieve the same quality and cost that tesla does even if they are using tesla 's patents    furthermore tesla and electric vehicles have become synonymous if someone is going to buy an electric car the first thing they are going to think of is tesla owning a tesla has become and will likely continue to be a bit of a status symbol and because of that i think they will probably always have the dominant position in the electric vehicle industry and will likely be able to charge premium prices that competitors might not be able to justify similar to the way that despite the ubiquity of smartphones apple has a dominant position and an ability to charge premium prices largely because apple kind of drove the smartphone revolution    tesla wants the electric car market to grow as quickly as possible the more money automobile manufacturers pour into electric cars the less they will spend on cheaper fossil fuel vehicles secondly as more companies start producing electric vehicles more people will end up owning one hence more infrastructure will be built to support those people making owning an electric car a lot easier hence increasing the value of a tesla making electric cars accessible to the mainstream public is tesla 's ultimate goal because they know they will likely always have the lion 's share of that industry

the public does n't really need to notice for inflation to take effect   inflation happens there 's more money relative to things to buy   most people think that if say we increase the money supply by 2x everything should get more expensive   but it matters where the increase in money supply is and to whom is receiving it    for example the liquid money supply for us$ increased almost 4 times from 2009 to 2017 via quantitative easing where the central bank purchased not just short term treasuries but also longer term bonds     you would think that having 4x the amount of us$ circulating would lead to a lot of inflation on consumer prices   for every $ 1 that was floating around in 2009 we now have $ 4 so people should be willing to pay more for a given good increasing its price    however the new money has been primarily used to purchase assets and drive up their prices   it has not really found its way to into worker pay or to the general public as median income for workers has stayed relatively flat in that time frame    so it can be argued that the asset markets are feeling the effects of inflation from the increased money supply   where real estate prices public stock prices venture capital investments etc have all seen a large increase in their costs to acquire relative to the same asset and opportunity    these assets are acting like a sponge for the new money that prevents the effects of its inflationary properties from exiting out into the consumer economy    that is also why central banks across the globe are in a predicament in how to stop quantitative easing   if they were to shrink the money supply the inflationary pressures on assets would go down because there 's not enough new money to keep raising their prices   doing it the wrong way would cause housing stocks and investment markets to stop growing because there would n't be as much new money creating demand for those assets    the best way i can illustrate this is with an example   say you have an economy that consists of an orange tree that produces 10 oranges per year   there are 10 people in this economy that each want 1 orange per year   and there is a circulating money supply of $ 10    the owner of the orange tree hires all 10 people to pick 1 orange for him and pays them $ 1 to pick    in this scenario each person picks 1 orange and gives it to the owner   they then receive $ 1   they then turn around and purchase one of the oranges from the owner of the tree   because demand is 10 oranges and supply is 10 oranges and the money supply is $ 10 each orange is priced at $ 1 and everyone is happy    now let 's say the central bank prints $ 100 more dollars   if the central bank gave it to the people evenly each person would end up with $ 11   now we have 10 people that want 10 oranges and each have $ 11   so the price for the oranges would inflate to $ 11 per orange    now let 's say instead of giving the extra $ 100 to the people the central bank instead gives it to the orange tree owner   the owner can still pick his 10 oranges with the 10 people the labor force and can still charge $ 1 per orange   as long as oranges are still $ 1 he does n't really need to increase the wages of the orange pickers   so instead he invests the $ 50 into building a bigger house for himself and then puts the remaining $ 50 into developing an orange picking machine   the supply of oranges is the same the demand for oranges is the same and the supply of money that demands oranges is the same so each orange will continue to be priced at $ 1   in this scenario the supply of money increased by 10x but the prices of oranges did not inflate   this is because the new money went into assets not consumer demand    now play this scenario forward a few years   the orange tree owner now has a machine that picks oranges so he stops hiring people to pick oranges   now he has a new house and all the oranges he can eat     now let 's say this economy was replicated 100 times but here are only 20 houses   so there are 100 orange tree owners and 1,000 people that get paid to pick oranges and are willing to pay to consume oranges    the central bank hands $ 100 to each of the 100 orange tree owners   in this case some of the orange tree owners will bid up the price of the houses from $ 50 to $ 100   the other orange tree owners may invest in bigger and better orange tree picking machines   that automation will lower the cost to pick oranges and increase profits if prices stay the same   eventually those owners will be able to bid more than $ 100 for one of the 20 houses    as this plays out the price of a house will continue to increase until all orange picking is automated but no one can afford oranges because they are not needed to pick them anymore    this is a simplified version of what 's basically happening on a global scale

you ca n't really avoid inflation as the population grows the amount of money needed will grow as well because the people will grow up and go to work and earn money and someone has to create it to pay them one of the definitions of inflation is increasing amount of money increasing amount of money causes devaluation for example if instead of 1000 dollars we now have 2000 dollars in circulation because the population tripled in the last 50 years while in russia the population remained the same and they have the same 1000 rubles as they had 50 years ago 1 ruble will no longer cost 1 dollar but rather 2 i.e. prices rise this is very simplified of course and there are a lot of causes and triggers for inflation inflation when controlled and within certain limits is necessary for growth as mentioned but when uncontrolled and very high it causes a lot of damage and that 's what troubles people about inflation not its mere existence as to bringing the prices the prices do n't go down the   gallon of gas will not go back to $ 0.25 it 's just the buying power of the money goes down because of inflation you could buy a gallon of gas for 0.25 50 years ago but you had to work for 1/2 hour to earn these 0.25 now you have to pay $ 4 but if you still need to work for 1/2 hour for that then the price did n't rise effectively

what teachers have is not ridiculous stop blindly accepting what the media is throwing at you what teachers have is the right to a due process when they are being evaluated that 's all    why try this the next time you assert pseudo free market principals into education at least take into account the fact that unlike a free market schools can not hire anybody to teach simply because you want to someone on wall street can hire literally anyone they want based simply on the idea that they 're convinced the person can do the job   not in education the people demand that a teacher go through literally years of classes observations training and tens of thousands of dollars to earn their credential in other words if you were a principal and you stumbled across somebody that you were convinced would make an excellent teacher you could n't hire them   there is no free market system in education because the people have demanded standards for what qualifies someone as a professional teacher   here 's the point what kind of people would jump through all those hoops to become a teacher or or policeman without something to protect what they 've earned we 're already losing record number of teachers because of the bullshit that comes from letting politicians run our schools take away union protections and they 'll be leaving in droves   what 's fucking ridiculous is a public that wants no child left behind performance at a fraction of what they paid forty years ago

this is a bit of an open ended answer as certain assumptions must be covered hope it helps though my concern is that you have 1 year of university left is there a chance that this money will be needed to fund this year of uni and might it be needed for the period between uni and starting your first job if the answer is yes to either of these keep any money you have as liquid as possible ie cash in an instant access cash isa if the answer is no let 's move on are you likely to touch this money in the next 5 years i 'm thinking house flat deposits whether you rent or buy cars etc etc if yes again keep it liquid in a cash isa but this time perhaps look to get a slightly better interest rate by fixing for a 1 year or 2 year at a time something like will show you best buy cash isas if this money is not going to be touched for more than 5 years then things like bonds and equities come into play ultimately your appetite for risk determines your options if you are uncomfortable with swings in value then fixed income products with fixed term ie buy a bond hold the bond when the bond finishes you get your money back plus the yield interest may suit you better than equity based investments equity based means alot of things stocks in just one company an index tracker of a well known stock market eg tracker actively managed growth funds passive etfs of high dividend stocks and each of these has different volatility price swings and long term performance as well as different charges and risks the only way to understand this is to learn so that 's my ultimate advice learn about bonds learn about equities learn about gilts corporate bonds bond funds index trackers etfs dividends active v passive management in the meantime keep the money in a cash isa where £ 1 stays £ 1 plus interest once you want to lock the money away into a long term investment then you can look at stocks isas to protect the investment against taxation you may also put just enough into a pension get the company match for contributions it 's not uncommon to split your long term saving between the two routes then come back and ask where to go next but chances are you 'll know yourself by then because you self educated if you want an alternative to the us based generic advice check out my simple steps concept here and my free posts on this framework at i also host a free weekly podcast at also on itunes and others they were designed to offer exactly that kind of guidance to the uk for free

when investing small amounts you should consider the substantial toll that commissions will take on your investment in your case $ 800 placed in just one etf will incur commissions of about $ 8 each way or a total of 2 of your investment i suggest you wait until you have at least $ 5000 to invest in stocks or etfs since this is in a ira your options are limited but perhaps you may qualify for a vanguard mutual fund which will not charge commissions and will have annual expenses only a trivial amount higher than the corresponding etf it should probably go in a mixed allocation fund and since you are young it should be a relatively aggressive one mutual funds will also allow you to contribute small amounts over time without incurring any extra fees

you need to understand how various entities make their money once you know that you can determine whether their interests are aligned with yours for example a full service broker makes money when you buy and sell stocks they therefore have in interest in you doing lots of buying and selling not in making you money or no fee financial advisors make their money through commissions on what they sell you which means their interests are served by selling you those investments with high commissions not the investments that would serve you best financial media makes their money through attracting viewers readers and selling advertising that is their business and they are not in the business of giving good advice there are lots of good investments index funds are a great example that do n't get much attention because there is n't any money in them   in fact the majority of wall street is not aligned with your interests so be skeptical of the financial industry in general   there are for fee financial advisors who you pay directly their interests are fairly well aligned with yours there is a fair amount of good information at the motley fool

yes this is possible with some companies when you buy shares of stock through a stock broker the shares are kept in street name   that means that the shares are registered to the broker not to you   that makes it easy to sell the stock later   the stock broker keeps track of who actually owns which shares   the system works well and there are legal protections in place to protect the investors assets you can request that your broker change the stock to your name and request a certificate from the company   however companies are no longer required to do this and some wo n't   your broker will charge you a fee for this service alternatively if you really only want one share for decoration there are companies that specialize in selling shares of stock with certificates   two of them are and which offer one real share of stock with a stock certificate in certain popular companies   note i have no experience with either one   some companies no longer issue new stock certificates for those these services sell you a stock certificate along with a real share of electronic stock   this is now the case for disney and apple with your stock certificate you are an actual official stockholder entitled to dividends and a vote at the shareholder meeting if this is strictly an investment for you consider the advantages of street name shares as to your question on buying stock directly from a company and bypassing a broker altogether see can i buy stocks directly from a public company

agree with it is rare larger cap examples include nokia and holdings   if cash exceeds market cap that means total debt is greater than ev the value of the operating assets if the debt is partially repaid matures the equity is ok but if management is crap and the cash is spent at an below the interest rate on the debt now you have a situation where the net debt exceeds the value of the operating assets the credit quality suffers debt trades down you need to in order to avoid bankruptcy   the above assumes debt is greater than cash situations where cash exceeds market cap and debt is less than cash i.e. a negative ev are exceedingly rare in larger companies and are either a a wonderfully attractive mispricing or b market views management as so awful that the cash will get burnt up by the business and the value of that cash will be destroyed

yes because you can not have an exponential growth rate that is faster than the rate at which the economy grows on the long term 100 growth is much more than the few percent at which the economy grows so your share in the world economy would approximately double every year today the value of all the assets in the world economy is about $ 200 trillion if you start with an investment of just $ 1000 and this doubles every year then you 'll own all the world 's assets in years assuming this does n't grow you can of course take into account that it does grow this will yield a slightly larger time before you own the entire world

car dealers as well as boat dealers rv dealers maybe farm vehicle dealers and other asset types make deals with banks and finance companies to they can make loans to buyers they may be paying the interest to the finance companies so they can offer a 0 loan to the retail customer for all or part of the loan term   neither the finance company nor the dealer wants to make such loans to people who are likely to default such customers will not be offered this kind of financing but remember too that these loans are secured by the asset the car which is also insured but the dealer or the finance company holds that asset as collateral that they can seize to repay the loan so the finance company gets paid off and the dealer keeps the profit he made selling the car so these loans are designed to ensure the dealer nor the finance company looses much these are called asset finance loans because there is always an asset the car to use as collateral

tl;dr i think you can find a much better deal doing a refi will cost you some amount of money   however a 2.5 fee top of closing costs seems really high   you can get a quote from quicken loans pretty quick and compare their fee   also i would check with a local bank preferably one you already do business with   the 2.5 is probably their commission for originating the loan   if you are in the southeast i have had great luck with regions bank   they are large enough but also small enough   please know that i have no affiliation with either company btw the rate also seems high   doing a quick search of bank rate it seems you can get 3.25 with zero fee as of this writing   the worse deal they show is with a .75 fee much better than you were quoted if you can afford it i would also encourage you to think outside the box   a client of mine was able to obtain a home equity loan not line of credit to replace their mortgage   they went for a 7 year pay off with the loan in first position at a rate about .75 below the then current 15 year rate   the key was there was zero closing costs   it saved them quite a bit of money also look at a 10 year fixed   it might not be much more than you are paying now

in general scholarship income that you receive that is not used for tuition or books must be included in your gross income and reported as such on your tax return   scholarship income you receive that is used for those kinds of expenses may be from your gross income   see this irs information and this related question i believe that as represented on the 1098-t this generally means that if box 5 scholarships and grants is greater than box 1 or 2 only one of which will be used on your 1098-t you received taxable scholarship income   if box 5 is less than or equal to box 1/2 you did not receive taxable scholarship income   this page draws the same conclusion however you should realize that the 1098-t is not what makes you have to pay or not pay taxes   you incur the taxes by receiving scholarship money and you may reduce your tax liability by paying tuition   the 1098-t is simply a record of payments that have already been made for instance if you received $ 10,000 in scholarship money that is actually received checks for that amount or had that amount deposited into your bank account then your income went up by $ 10,000   if you yourself paid tuition it is likely that you can exclude the amount of the tuition from your taxable income reducing the tax you owe see the irs page linked above   however if you received $ 10,000 in actual money and in addition your tuition was paid by the scholarship with money you never actually had in your own bank account then the entire $ 10,000 would be taxable   you do not give enough information in your question to be sure which of these situations is closer to your own   however you should be able to decide by looking at your bank account look at how much money you received and how much you spent on tuition   if you received more scholarship money than the tuition you paid out of pocket you owe taxes on the remainder   i emphasize that this is just a general rule of thumb and should not be taken as tax advice you should review the irs information and/or consult a tax professional to determine what part of your scholarship income is taxable in addition as this now rather old article from the new york society of cpas notes many colleges and universities prepare incorrectly and report tuition and related expenses   this means you should be careful to reconcile the 1098-t with your own financial records of what money you actually received and paid   when i was in grad school there was a good deal of hand wringing and hair pulling each year among the students as we tried to determine what relationship if any the 1098-t bore to the financial facts

dollar cost averaging is beneficial if you do n't have the money to make large investments but are able to add to your holding over time if you can buy the same monetary amount at regular intervals over time your average cost per share will be lower than the stock 's average value over that time this wo n't necessarily get you the best price but it will get you on the whole a good price and will enable you to increase your holdings over time if you 're doing frequent trading on a highly volatile stock you do n't want to use this method a better strategy is to buy the dips know the range and place limit orders toward the bottom of the range then place limit orders to sell toward the high end of the range if you do it right you might be able to build up enough money to buy and sell increasing numbers of shares over time but like any frequent trader you 'll have to deal with transaction fees you 'll need to be sure the fees do n't eat all your profit

i think it 's easiest to illustrate it with an example if you 've already read any of the definitions out there then you know what it means but just do n't understand what it means   so we have an ice cream shop we started it as partners and now you and i each own 50 of the company it 's doing so well that we decide to take it public   that means that we will be giving up some of our ownership in return for a chance to own a smaller portion of a bigger thing with the money that we raise from selling stocks we 're going to open up two more stores   so without getting into too much of the nitty gritty accounting that would turn this into a valuation question let 's say we are going to put 30 of the company up for sale with these stocks leaving you and me with 35 each we file with the sec saying we 're splitting up the company ownership with 100,000 shares and so you and i each have 35,000 shares and we sell 30,000 to investors   then and this depends on the state in the us where you 're registering your publicly traded corporation those shares must be assigned a par value that a shareholder can redeem the shares at many corporations will use $ 1 or 10 cents or something nominal   and we go and find investors who will actually pay us $ 5 per share for our ice cream shop business we receive $ 150,000 in new capital but when we record that in our accounting $ 5 in total capital per share was contributed by investors to the business and is recorded as shareholder 's equity $ 1 per share totalling $ 30,000 goes towards actual shares outstanding and $ 4 per share totalling $ 120,000 goes towards capital surplus   these amounts will not change unless we issue new stocks the share prices on the open market can fluctuate but we rarely would adjust these edit i could n't see the table before dumbcoder has already pointed out the equation capital surplus = stock par value + premium per share number of shares based on my example it 's easy to deduce what happened in the case you 've given in the table in 2009 your company xyz had outstanding common stock issued for $ that 's probably a in thousands and b at a par value of $ 1 per share on those assumptions we can say that the company has shares outstanding for year end 2009   then if we guess that 's the outstanding shares we can also calculate the implicit average premium per share ÷ = = $ note that this is the average premium per share because we do n't know when the different stocks were issued at and it may be that the premiums that investors paid were different frankly we do n't care   so clearly since common stock in 2010 is up to $ it means that the company released more stock someone else can chime in on whether that means it was specifically a stock split or some other mechanism it does n't matter for understanding this you just need to know that the company put more stock into the marketplace = = more shares to be exact with the mechanics of rounding to the thousands i would guess this was a stock split   now what you can also see is that the capital surplus also increased = = the shares were issued into the market at an average premium of ÷ = = $ so investors probably paid or were given by the company an average of $ at this split   then in 2011 the company had another small adjustment to its shares outstanding the common stock went up and there was a corresponding increase in its capital surplus   without details around the actual stock volumes it 's hard to get more exact you 're also only giving us a portion of the balance sheet for your company so it 's hard to go into too much more detail hopefully this answers your question though

the benefit of having gold to trade is that there is almost always someone that will take gold when the fiat currency is in trouble     the potential downfall of doing this is that when people think the fiat currency is in trouble they tend to buy up gold thus driving up the price   this means that you get less gold for each hour of work you perform deer basket of apples etc     even more if the financial crisis is limited to only one fiat currency you have a situation where that fiat currency devalues but others can gain in value as people try to sell their old currency for the new standard currency   if people also sell their gold to buy up this currency that lowers the price of gold in that currency     for example let us assume that gold was 1000 dollars an ounce and 1000 euros an ounce   suddenly people start thinking that the euro is in trouble so they start buying gold   the law of supply and demand kicks in more buyers same supply so higher prices and gold is suddenly worth 2000 dollars and 2000 euros an ounce   if you start buying at this point you get half as much gold as the person who bought in the beginning   suddenly the euro collapses   stores that used to take euros start demanding dollars   suddenly it costs 20,000 euros for an ounce of gold but an ounce of gold will only get you 1,000 dollars since everyone is selling their gold to get dollars     the people who buy gold in the panic end up losing half the value of their money if not more   the speculators that bought gold at $ 1,000 sold it at $ 2,000 and bought it back at $ 1,000 now have all their gold back plus the $ 1,000 the other people lost

i 've considered simply moving my funds to an australian bank to lock in the current rate but i worry that this will put me at risk of a substantial loss due to exchange rates transfer fees etc when i move my funds back into the us in 6 months   why move funds back   if you want to lock in current exchange rates figure out how much money you are likely to spend in australia for the next six months   move just enough funds to cover that to an australian bank   leave the remainder in the united states us as your future expenses will be in us dollars    so long as you do n't find some major unanticipated purchase this covers you   you have enough money for the next six months with no exchange rate worries    at the end of the six months if you fall slightly short cover with your credit card as you are doing now   you 'll take a loss but on a small amount of money   if you have a slight excess and you were right about the exchange rate you 'll make a little profit at the end   if you were wrong you 'll take a small loss    the key here is that you should be able to budget for your six months   you can lock in current exchange rates just for that amount of money    moving all your funds to australia is a gamble   you can certainly do that if you want but rather than gambling it may be better to take the sure thing   you know you need six months expenses so just move that   you will definitely be spending six months money in australia so you are immune to exchange rate fluctuations for that period   the remainder of your money can stay in the us as that 's where you plan to spend it    however recent political events back in the states have me and i 'm sure every currency speculator and foreign investor worried that this advantage will not last for much longer   if currency speculators expect exchange rates to fall then they 'd have already bid down the rates   i.e. they 'd keep speculating until the rates did fall   so the speculators expect the current rates are correct otherwise they 'd move them    donald trump 's state goal is to increase exports relative to imports   if he 's successful this could cause the us dollar to fall to make exports cheaper and imports more expensive   however if his policies fail then the opposite is likely to happen   most of his announced trade policies are more likely to increase the value of the dollar than to decrease it   in particular that is the likely result of increased tariffs    if you are worried about trump failing then you should worry about a strong dollar   that 's more in line with actual speculation since the election    i do n't know that i 'd make a strong bet in either direction   hedging makes more sense to me as it simply locks in the current situation which you apparently find favorable   not hedging at all might produce some profit if the dollar goes up   gambling all your funds might produce some profit if the dollar goes down   the middle path of hedging just what you 're spending is the safest if least likely to produce profit    my recommendation is to hedge the six months expenses and enjoy your time abroad   why worry about political events that you ca n't control   enjoy your working studying vacation

let me add another consideration to the company 's side of the equation   not only is a 401 k a tool for the company to make them competitive when recruiting employees among other companies that offer that benefit it is also a good retention tool most company 's 401 k plans include a vesting period of at least 3 years sometimes more an employee that leaves the company before they are vested in the plan will have to give up some of the employer matched funds in the account this gives employees incentive to stick around longer and the company reduces the risk of turnover which can be costly in terms of training and recruiting this also factors into the reason why employers would rather give matching on the 401 k than a simple pay raise some of those employees are going to leave during the vesting period anyway and when that happens the employer got the benefit of motivating the employee but in the end got to keep some of the money

i wrote about the dynamic of why either of a lower or higher exchange rate would be good for economies in would dropping the value of its currency be good for an economy a strong currency allows consumers to    import goods cheaply from the rest of    the world   a weak currency allows    producers to export goods cheaply to    the rest of the world   people are    both consumers and producers     clearly there have to be trade offs strong or weak mean relative to purchasing power parity i.e. you can buy more or less of an equivalent good with the same money governments worrying about unemployment will try and push their currencies weaker relative to others no matter the cost   there will be an inflationary impact imported inputs cost more as a currency weakens but a country running a major surplus like china can afford to subsidise these costs

sensitive topic inflation is a consequence of the mismatch between supply and demand   in an ideal world the amount of goods available would exactly match the demand for those goods    we do n't live in an ideal world one example of oversupply is dollar stores where you can buy from companies that demand   most recently we 've seen wheat prices rise as fires outside moscow damaged the harvest and the russian government banned exports and that introduces the danger of inflation inflation is a signal like the pain you feel after an injury   if you simply took a you may completely ignore a broken leg until took your life governments sometimes ban inflation by fixing prices   both the and venezuelan governments have tried this recently   the consequence of that is goods become unavailable as producers refuse to create supply for less than the cost of production as pointed out governments do desperately want to avoid deflation as much as they want to avoid hyperinflation there is a correct level and that has resulted in the monetary policy called inflation where central banks attempt to manage inflation into a target range usually around 2 to 6 the reason is simply that limited inflation drives investment and consumption   with a guaranteed return on investment people with cash will lend it to people with ideas   consumers will buy goods today if they fear that the price will rise tomorrow if prices fall as they have done during the two decades of deflation in japan then the result is lower levels of investment and employment as companies cut production capacity   if prices rise to quickly as in zimbabwe and venezuela then people can not save enough or earn enough and so their wealth is drained away add to this the continual process of innovation and you see how difficult it is to manage inflation at all   innovation can result in increased efficiency which can reduce prices   it can also result in a new product which is sufficiently unique to allow predatory pricing the apple iphone new types of medicines and so on the best mechanism we have for figuring out where money should be invested and who is the best recipient of any good is the price mechanism   inflation is the signal that investors need to learn how best to manage their efforts we hide from it at our peril

it 's not mentioned in the article but the state will invariably pay for infrastructure upgrades and maintenance around a project like this the only way this pays off is if the tax revenue generated is enough to pay for any additional expenditure by the state and the fact that foxconn has a track record of not living up to its promises is what prevents this from being a no brainer we 'll need to revisit the topic in 15 years when this deal has reached its conclusion to know if the gamble was worth it the thing that is working to foxconn 's advantage here is that there were several states competing for this

noted the liquidity can very wildly especially 9 months out and there will be little volume even in the largest stocks   victor noted standard measures of liquidity do n't always apply cleanly to options as they are priced using a hybrid of model and market inputs   so your question is generally very hard to answer on se but you can get an answer yourself without too much trouble the best way to get a feel for slippage in your case is to just get quotes   most systems should let you get a quote for both buying and selling options at the same time   this will give you a feeling for how much you are paying in spread   do the same for near dated options to get a feeling for spread size when you end up selling you should factor in some widening of spreads at bad times but this should get you a feeling for the scale of the slippage problem

a reason to get an accountant is to avoid penalties for possible mistakes that is if you make a mistake the irs can impose penalties on you for negligence if the professional makes the same mistake the burden of proof for negligence shifts to the irs which probably means that you 'll pay more taxes and interest but no penalties hiring an accountant is prima evidence of not being negligent i would get an accountant since this the first time for you in the present situation when mistakes are most likely if you feel that s he did the same for you that you would have done for yourself then you might go back to doing your own taxes in later years

their income is from the two sources you mentioned they charge the merchants for each use and they make interest money on people who carry a balance this is one reason a lot of merchants will be willing to give you a discount if you pay cash they do n't have to give a portion to visa or mastercard    i would n't be able to speak to the relative proportions between the two income sources but when many cards are at 30 interest for balances carried and many people have tens of thousands of dollars owed on their cards the interest income is not insignificant   they 'll also charge interest immediately on cash advances a few cards also make money off of annual fees although i 'd suspect this is not very much in the full scheme of things the way to get the most out of a card is to always pay it off fully at the end of each month

according to your numbers you just stated that you spend approximately $ 1500 in discretionary expenditures per month yet are unable to save i fully realize that living in a big city is usually expensive but on your presumably after tax salary i think you can easily save a substantial portion of your income as others have already noted enforcing saving of a significant portion of your discretionary income is the most obvious step   it 's easy to say but i suspect that if you are like most people who have difficulty saving the psychological impact of quitting your previous spending habits cold turkey is likely to be very harsh all the more so if you have an active social life   you may find yourself becoming depressed or at having to save   you may lose motivation to work as hard because you might think that you 're putting away all this money for the distant future whereas you are young now and want to enjoy life while you can it is in this context then that i looked at your other financial obligations   paying $ to your parents is a lot   it 's over 20 of your after tax salary   you do not specify the reasons for doing this other than a vague sense of familial duty but my recommendation is to see if this could be reduced somewhat   if you can bring it down to $ 1000/month that $ 300 would go into your savings and you would psychologically feel a lot better about putting say $ 600 of your own discretionary income into savings as well   now you have all told about $ 1000/month of savings without severely your extra expenditures but i would start with that $ 1500/month of luxury spending first   and yes you do need to view it as luxury spending   the proper frame of mind is to compare your financial situation to someone who is truly unable to save because their entire income is spent on actual necessities   food and shelter their effective tax rate is 0 because they earn too little and they usually find themselves in debt because they can not make ends meet   now look back at that $ 1500/month   can you honestly say that you can not afford to cut that spending

does gold 's value decrease over time due to the fact that it is being continuously mined remember that demand increases and decreases we 've had seven years or so of strong demand increase and the corresponding price increase suggests there is a lack of gold coming into the market rather than too much also bear in mind that mining the stuff on any scale is hazardous and requires massive investment in infrastructure and time large mines frequently take seven to ten years to come on stream hardly an elastic enterprise

i was thinking more of a limit on the total of patents something fairly small like maybe 10,000 total patents are allowed to be valid at any given moment in time so that patent applications from multiple sources have to be somehow compared with each other to decide which would provide more societal benefit by being allowed patent status   if you want to take the government mostly out of the picture then maybe use an auction format when a valid patent slot becomes available due to a previously granted patent expiring or being invalidated due to court challenge then anyone who wants their idea to get patent rights submits their application to an auction for that slot   then the people who want to own the patent rights to any of those submitted ideas will bid for them whoever pays the top bid will get the patent rights for the concepts in the specific application they were targeting   this will force the people who are doing the bidding to basically do the due diligence on each patent application instead of depending on the patent since they will not want to pay a lot of money to get the patent rights for an idea only to have that patent 's value be destroyed by being declared invalid in court   if you want to encourage small inventors to throw their hat into the ring then set things up so that the money from the winning bid goes to the inventor who submitted the original application this way you get the best of both worlds the inventor gets compensated handsomely in most cases for their good idea and the idea being patented gets into the hands of someone with enough resources to exploit the idea in a broad scale

what littleadv said is correct   his worth is based on the presumed worth of the total company value which is much greater than all investment dollars combined because of valuation in other words his worth is based on the potential return for his share of ownership at a rate based on the latest valuation of the company he is worth $ 17.5 billion today but the total funding for facebook is only $ 2.4 billion i do n't understand this in private companies valuations typically come from either speculation analysts or from investments   investment valuations are the better gauge because actual money traded hands for a percentage ownership however just as with public companies on the stock market there are at least two caveats just because someone else sold their shares at a given rate does n't mean that rate in both cases it 's possible the value may be much lower or much higher   some high value purchases surprise for how high they are such as microsoft 's acquisition of skype for $ 8.5 billion the formula for one owner 's worth based on a given acquisition is valuation = acquisition amount acquisition percent worth = owner 's percent × valuation according to wikipedia zuckerberg owns 24   in january goldman 's invested $ 500 million at a $ 50 billion valuation that is the latest investment and puts zuckerberg 's worth at $ 12 billion however some speculation places a facebook ipo at a much higher valuation such as as $ 100 billion   i do n't know what your reference is for $ 17 billion but it puts their valuation at $ billion between the january goldman valuation and current ipo speculation for instance originally invested $ 10,000 which at his estimated 5 ownership would now be worth $ 3 5 billion

wire transfers are the best method   costs can vary from $ 10 to $ 100 or more depending on the banks and countries involved   there 's rarely any saving using the same bank although hsbc may have reduced charges if you have premier accounts in both countries for a one off transaction it may not be worth the effort to open an account however that cost is insignificant compared to your possible losses on the currency exchange   assuming your money is currently in hong kong dollars hkd it will need to be converted to us dollars usd one place where it could be converted is at your hong kong bank   you 'll get their retail rate make sure you are aware of the rate they will use and any fees in advance   expect to pay around 2 3 from the mid market rate the rate you see quoted online which does n't fluctuate much for hkd usd as the currencies are linked another place where the currency could be converted is at your us bank   you really do n't get any control over that if it arrives as hkd and is then automatically converted into your usd   the rate and fees could be quite poor especially if it is a minor us bank that has to deal with anther bank for foreign currency for amounts of this size it 's worthwhile using a specialist currency conversion company instead   currency fair in ireland is one   it 's a peer to peer exchange that is generally the best deal at least for the currency pairs i use   you wire the money to them do the exchange on their site at a rate that is much closer to 0.5 from the then the money is transferred out by wire for a few dollars   adds a few days to the process but will possibly save you close to us$ 1000   another established option is currency online in new zealand there are probably also specialist currency exchange companies in hong kong the basic rule is do n't let the banks exchange currencies at rates that suit them use a third party that offers a better rate and lower fees

i make it a habit at the end of every day to think about how much money i spent in total that day being mindful of what was essential and was n't i know that i might have spent $ 20 on a haircut essential $ 40 on groceries essential and $ 30 on eating out not essential then i realize that i could have just spent $ 60 instead of $ 90 this habit combined with the general attitude that it 's better to have not spent some than to have spent some money has been pretty effective for me to bring down my monthly spending i guess this requires more motivation than the other more involved techniques given here you have to really want to reduce your spending i found motivation easy to come by because i was spending a lot and i 'm still looking for a job so i have no sources of income but it 's worked really well so far

question 2 some financial institutions can provide a way to invest small amounts with low or no cost fees over a period of time like monthly weekly etc   for instance a few brokerages have a way to buy specific etfs for no cost outside of the total expense ratio question 3 when someone says that investing is like buying a lottery ticket they are comparing an event that almost always has at least a 99.9 of no return large winnings to an event that has much better odds   even if i randomly pick a stock in the s&p 500 and solely invest in it over the course of a given year i do not face a 99.9 chance of losing everything so comparing the stock market to a lottery unless a specific lottery has much better odds keep in mind that some of these jackpots have a of no return is not the same   unfortunately nothing truly safe exists risk may but it 's always present instead the probability of something being safe and or generating a return may be true for a given period of time while in another given period of time may become untrue one may argue that holding cash is safer than buying an index fund or stock etf mutual fund etc and financially that may be true over a given period of time for instance the usd beat the spy for the year of 2008   benjamin franklin per a biography i 'm reading argued that the stock market was superior to gold from the context it sounds like the cash of his day because of what the stock market represents essentially you 're betting on the economic output of workers   it 's like saying in an example using oil that i believe that even though oil becomes a rare resource in the long run human workers will find an alternative to oil and will lead to better living standards for all of us do like the roman and empires collapse   yes and would holding the market in those days fail   yes   but cash and gold might be useless too because we would still need someone to exchange goods with and we would need to have the correct resources to do so if everyone in a city owns gold gold has little value   the only safe bet in those days would be farming skill land crops and or livestock because even without trading one could still provide some basic necessities

in most cases a debit card can be charged like a credit card so there is typically no strict need for a credit card however a debit card provides weaker guarantees to the merchant that an arbitrary amount of money will be available this is for several reasons as such there are a few situations where a credit card is required for example amazon requires a credit card for prime membership and car rental companies usually require a credit card the following does not apply to the op and is provided for reference debit cards do n't build credit so if you 've never had a credit card or loan before you 'll likely have no credit history at all if you 've never had a credit card this will make it very difficult to get any sized loan also some employers typically if the job you 're applying for involves financial or other highly sensitive information check credit when hiring and not having credit puts you at a disadvantage

one of the problems is that its being marketed at a growth stock   when facebook has 900 million users there is n't exactly a lot of growth left   the only thing they can do is try to squeeze more money out of their existing user base which wo n't be easy to do for people not generally interested in clicking ads or paying for things   facebook as a company will continue to do well for a long long time   it 's good they are n't really dependent on the money their stock brings them   i would n't be surprised to see the stock settle around $ even though it probably should technically settle in the $ 13 15 range

doing your homework means to perform what 's more accurately called fundamental analysis according to proponents of fundamental analysis fa it is possible to accurately determine how much a stock should trade for and then buy or sell the stock based on whether it trades above or below this target price this target price is based on the discounted anticipated future earnings of your stock so doing your homework means that you figure out how much future earnings you can expect from the stock and then figuring out at what rate you want to discount those future earnings are 1000 dollars that you 'll earn next year worth $ 800 today or $ 900 or only $ 500 that depends on the overall economic and political climate so does this make any sense depends i 'm aware that there are a lot of anecdotes of people researching a stock buying that stock and doing well with that stock but poor decisions can at times lead to good outcomes edit due to some criticism i want to expand on a few points so is homework completely for naught no

check how long you have to hold the stock after buying it if you can sell reasonably soon and your company is reasonably stable you 're unlikely to lose and/or be taxed and/or pay enough in fees to lose more than the 30 free money they 're giving you   whether you hold it longer than the minimum time depends partly on whether you think you can better invest the money elsewhere and partly on how you feel about having both your salary and part of your investments tied to the company 's success the company would like you to double down that way in the theory that it may make you motivated but some investment would advise keeping that a relatively small part of your total investments basically for the same reasons you are always advised to diversify

long term bonds any bonds really can be risky for two main reasons   return on principal or return of principal   the former is a problem if interest rates are low which they are now in the us because existing bonds will fall in price if interest rates rise   the second is a problem if the lender defaults iou nothing no investment is riskless   short term bonds command a lower interest rate than long term bonds usually because of their quicker maturity but short term bonds carry risk just like long term bonds though the interest rate risk is lower sometimes quite a bit lower than for long term bonds
