the most important thing to do when moving is to change your address with the post office this will forward most mail for a year and even automatically send change of address notices to many businesses that send mail to you if you do this and the irs needs to send you something over the next year you 'll get it   the irs does have a procedure for changing your address and you would want to do this if you are expecting something from the irs and are unable to do a change of address with the post office for some reason but if you do forward your mail and you are n't expecting a refund check i do n't think it is necessary the irs will get your new address when you file your return next year

there are two components to any non trivial financial decision   assuming that all things remain equal borrowing money at a low rate while investing for a higher return is a no brainer the problem is all things do not remain equal for example i think that you need to assess your position and preferences i 'd err on the side of being in less debt

a few practical thoughts a practical thing that helps me immensely not to loose important paperwork such as bank statements bills payroll statement all those statements you need for filing tax return is in addition to the folder where the statements ultimately need to go i use a there are also standing instead of hanging varieties of the same idea may be less expensive if you buy them new i got most of mine used you have easy to add to folders where you can just throw in e.g. the bank statement when it arrives this way i give the statement a preliminary scan for anything that is obviously grossly wrong and throw it into the respective folder every once in a while i take care of all my book keeping punch the statements file them in the and enter them into the software i used to hate and never do the filing when i tried to use only i recently learned that it is well known that and are very time consuming if you have paperwork arriving one sheet at a time i 've tried different accounting software being somewhat on the side i use gnucash including some phone apps   personally i did n't like the phone apps i tried imho it takes too much time to enter things so i tend to forget it i 'm much better at asking for a sales receipt everywhere and sticking them into a calendar at home i also note cash payments for which i do n't have a receipt as far as i recall them the forgotten ones = difference ends up in category hobby as they are mostly the beer or coke after sports i was also to impatient for the cloud online solutions i tried i use one for business as there the is guaranteed to be according to the legal requirements but it really takes far more time than entering the records in gnucash

there are several insurance products that i buy for legal reasons both of these protect me from lawsuits and fines many people buy similar products to protect their business operations e.g. medical malpractice insurance there are some insurance products i buy for tax planning and financial planning purposes i have a large amount of savings available so i have several tricks to reduce my insurance costs and i have several products that i avoid several of these reasons are mentioned in other answers but i thought i would collect them into a single answer to demonstrate that there are reasons other than the rational calculation of what the payout will be for the insurance products vs. the premium paid if i gain access to a tax advantaged health savings account that is a bigger benefit to me than avoiding the premium especially when my employer is paying the majority of the premium perhaps it makes no sense to buy insurance given sufficient savings like the products i listed that make no sense for me given my finances but not everyone can self insure it does require a certain level of wealth

now asking if college is worth it   that 's not the question that should be asked   higher education and extended training are always a benefit at any point in life when it 's of high quality   the question that should be asked is why is the cost of college as high as it is   when i went to college to get my bachelors a semester at my state university cost $ bucks us this was in the early to mid 90s   twenty years later that same education cost $ 6,500 per semester   the main difference between these periods is that borrowing for school is now standard practice much less so in the 90s   any time you need to borrow to pay for something you 're going to overpay just because you have access to credit and can keep borrowing when someone hands you a bill   today kids borrow for college because they do n't have much choice if their parents did n't save enough or stopped supporting them right out of high school   and if you have this level of debt right out of college your hands will be tied for decades it affects things like first home buying and disposable income spending   the only way to drive the cost of college down is to plan ahead and pay with cash and to do that you need to have enough luck to be born to parents who care enough to help with your future   if schools know you ca n't or wo n't borrow to pay for an education they adjust

what you 're looking at is something called bridge financing   essentially it allows you to borrow your down payment from the bank using your old home as collateral   the interest rate varies but if you get the bridge from the same institution as your new mortgage they will often be a bit flexible    you take possession of the new home and begin mortgage payments on it normally   when the old home is sold the bridge is paid off    note that the deposit on signing for the new house will still have to be cash   all bets are off if you are talking about a new new home as builders usually require advance payments during the build

there are etf funds that only purchase preferred stock from banks i have one that pays a monthly dividend of a little under 6 per year that means that it pays just under 0.5 every month the purchase price of this stock just slowly goes up and up   you can do a whole lot better than 2 per year   the crux of the issue as i understand it is the lousy 2 interest she is getting my point is that you can do a lot better than 2   an etf is not a scam the price has stability and slow growth because it buys preferred stock from banks   yes she should invest my answer is yes because 2 roi   is a lousy return and she can do better   looking at the 200 day moving average the price goes from 15.25 in may of 2014 to in dec of 2015 that in price appreciation alone is a increase add on top of that a 0.5 increase per month and you get a stellar total return   the increase in the fed funds rate is a benefit to banks pgf invests in banks by buying their preferred stock this means that the share price of pgf will continue to increase and its ability to pay the nearly 6 per year dividend will also improve

theoretically this concept makes sense   however as recent numbers have shown i do not have the source handy but one can simply obtain this information via the ecb 's website banks have tapped this something in the likes of 500 billion or so and instead of buying sovereign debt they instead prefer to park this money with the ecb paying something like 25 bps on deposits   so instead of using this money to buy sovereigns or perhaps lend to other banks easing the strain on libor banks have just parked this money back with the ecb as the ecb has seen its deposits once again reach record amounts again see the ecb website for proof   just this speaks volumes about the carry trade and how it is evidently not going to achieve its long term goal of bringing spreads down in europe   perhaps in the short run yes but if you look at the fundamentals eurusd the eur basis swap and the libor spread they show how the situation in europe is far from over and the is nothing close to a long term and stable solution

i think people in general tend to unnecessarily over complicate this issue   here 's what i think you should do in any situation like this first and foremost put all tax considerations aside and decide whether it makes sense to sell the stock now or hold on to it for the long term based on its merits as an investment   tax considerations have absolutely nothing to do with whether the stock is a good investment   if you consider all non tax factors and decide to hold on to it for the long term then you can use the tax considerations as a very minor input to how long you should hold it in other words do n't set your time horizon to 17.5 months if waiting another 2 weeks gives you better tax treatment you 're going to pay taxes on your gains no matter what   the only difference is whether you pay capital gains tax or income tax   granted the income tax rate is higher but would n't it suck if you pay a lot less tax only because you have a lot less value in your stock so to answer your question i would say absolutely not tax consequences do not make it worthwhile to hold on to your espp shares   if you decide to hold on to your espp for other reasons and they better be good ones to put that much free profit at risk only then should you look at the tax consequences to help fine tune your strategy

why should i have any bias in favour of my local economy the main reason is because your expenses are in the local currency    if you are planning on spending most of your money on foreign travel that 's one thing   but for most of us the bulk of our expenses are incurred locally   so it makes sense for us to invest in things where the investment return is local    you might argue that you can always exchange foreign results into local currency and that 's true   but then you have two risks   one risk you 'll have anywhere   your investments may go down   the other risk with a foreign investment is that the currency may lose value relative to your currency   if that happens even a good performing investment can go down in terms of what it can return to you   that fund denominated in your currency is really doing these conversions behind the scenes    unless the bulk of your purchases are from imports and have prices that fluctuate with your currency you will probably be better off in local investments   as a rough rule of thumb your country 's import percentage is a good estimate of how much you should invest globally   that looks to be about 20 for australia   so consider something like 50 local stocks 20 local bonds 15 foreign stocks 5 foreign bonds and 10 local cash   that will insulate you a bit from a weak local currency while not leaving you out to dry with a strong local currency    it 's possible that your particular expenses might be more or less vulnerable to foreign price fluctuations than the typical   but hopefully this gives you a starting point until you can come up with a way of estimating your personal vulnerability

a credit default swap is a derivative a financial contract with a value dependent upon another asset a cds in essence is exactly what it sounds like a swap upon default the typical arrangement is that a holder of non risk free credit enters into an arrangement with a counterparty to pay the counterparty a portion of the income received from the non risk free credit in exchange for being able to force the counterparty to deliver risk free credit if the non risk free credit defaults banks use this mechanism to reduce the risk of the loans they produce while packaging them to be resold to investors   banks will typically buy on mortgages and corporate bonds paying part of the income from interest payments received to have the right to force counterparties typically hedge funds and insurance companies to swap national treasuries upon the event that the mortgages or corporates default   the banks receive less income yet are able to take on more inventory to sell to investors so that more loans can be made to borrowers households and corporations hedge funds typically take on more complex arrangements while insurance companies sell because they are usually overflowing with risk free assets yet are starved for income

ah i just read a fascinating comparison between gambling investing and trading on either /r /r or maybe /r it reminded me a lot of the investors in trump 's projects    my take on it is anyone putting money into one of his projects does so with the awareness of his track record and is simply playing the game at that level if they somehow have n't protected themselves against the possible loss of their investment that would be as silly as failing to carry health homeowner vehicle insurance    one obvious response is to sue alleging that trump is evil and that he intentionally stole money from his investors finance at that level is a strategy game he happens to be a skilled player and especially adapt at extracting himself from seemingly losing positions personally i would n't play at his table

how you pay income tax pay as you earn paye most people pay income tax through paye this is the system your employer or pension provider uses to take income tax and national insurance contributions before they pay your wages or pension your tax code tells your employer how much to deduct your tax code can take account of state benefits so if you owe tax on them eg the state pension it ’s usually taken automatically from your other income self assessment tax returns if your financial affairs are more complex eg you ’re self employed or have a high income you may pay income tax and national insurance through self assessment you ’ll need to fill in a tax return every year income tax on savings and investment interest income tax is usually taken from interest on savings and investments automatically income that ’s not automatically taxed you must fill in a tax return if your untaxed income is over £ 2,500 or if you do n’t pay tax through your wages or pension you must contact the income tax helpline if it ’s less than £ 2,500

the earlier answers answered the question on how a more practical trader can lose money here i 'd like to mention some obtuse ways   using debt to buy stocks if one is borrowing at a higher rate than they are getting back from an economics prospective their stocks are losing money even if the value of those stocks are going up using debt to buy stocks i 'll simplify the nightmare situation i know someone who has y dollars of cash their broker will loan them x. with their x+y money they purchase some equities through the broker the agreement of the loan is that if the value of those equities drops below a certain percentage of the outstanding debt ex 150 the broker will automatically and without notification sell some equities to reduce the outstanding debt being in high interest debt but buying stocks there are millions of people who are paying interest rates on consumer debt while investing and getting 5 returns or less on average similar to an earlier point from an economics prospective the choice to buy equities is a profit losing choice

i can but it takes a significant amount of time    i 'll do a short version which might leave more holes than you like basically traders do n't want to barter because it is hard to find the person with precisely the goods you want who wants to trade for the goods you have thus the need for coupons that represent value in a marketplace then you need to decide who gets to create coupons if too many can issue them problems arise and no one trusts the coupons will be good later eventually you want one large bank nation trader to be able to issue them so everyone has the same level of trust in them and you do n't have the economic inefficiencies of many coupon issuers   next the number of coupons needs to be enough to facilitate trade if the amount of trade increases a lot and the number of coupons does n't increase similarly they become worth more and people start to hoard them this causes deflation which causes less investment which causes less growth which hurts everyone in the long run    if there are too many coupons added this causes inflation which causes people to spent them quicker instead of holding them for reasons i wo n't cover here slight predictable inflation is much better than deflation so remember inflation is slightly preferred note that inflation is often caused not by the number of coupons but by external price changes   now for a modern economy to do well has to watch the economy measure it carefully and add subtract coupons into the system as needed coupons like all money have no real value whatever that means but only have value because the holder expects to be able to trade them later for goods and services you can not eat coupons use them for shelter usually or wear them but you want to trade them for such needs the same is true for paper money gold stones or almost whatever money system one uses money in all these forms is merely an iou tradable for future goods   the fed is tasked among other things with making sure there is precisely enough coupons in the economy to keep trade functioning as well as possible this is very hard to do since there are external and internal shocks to an economy think disaster foreign shutting off resources rapid changes in people 's tastes etc    central banks such as the fed need to be independent of political control since empirical evidence has shown that politicians tend to add more money to the system than is needed because the short term gains give them votes but the long term consequences rapid inflation unemployment lower economic growth are bad for society this is why the fed is largely out of congressional control and large amounts of empirical evidence across hundreds of years and dozens of cultures shows this to be good   note another function of the fed is to be a lender of last resort to help prevent bank panics that were widespread in the 18th and early 19th century something that none of us now remember but it was a real problem i 'll skip that part for now   so now we 're at the point where the fed needs to add subtract coupons from society to do this part justice takes significant time to cover all the reasons why various rules are in place banking reserve requirements for example and you can not learn it from one pass of reading   but i 'll try instead of being like the majority of internet fools that rail against the system try to learn the why of all this and you 'll be much wiser and understand that it is all a pretty good system   one method they use is the interbank lending rate banks have a reserve requirement which is the ratio of coupons they need to have on hand as a ratio compared to the total coupons depositors lent them this is usually around 1:10 the amount deposited that they can lend goes to business loans school loans mortgage loans etc and helps economies grow now when a bank on a given day falls short due to too many withdrawals other banks or the fed offers an overnight loan to meet reserve requirements and the fed sets the interest rate which in turn drives other interest rates in the system   this does not change the money supply very much   secondly the fed sets the reserve requirement which vastly can change the amount of money available to society but they change this rate so rarely all the historical data is on the st. fed site among others that it is not usually an issue i 'll explain below how this can drastically change the money supply though the money multiplier   thirdly and this is the part the poster above seems upset about they conduct open market operations this is the primary means by which the fed exercises control over the number of coupons in play the government like businesses like individuals often needs to borrow money in theory to invest in wise causes like infrastructure or perhaps money making enterprises such as technology and i know what they often use the money for causes many to complain the government like companies offers the sale of various contracts such as bonds to investors who want a place to park some accumulated coupons for safety and they get a return plus some interest so the government sells bonds on the open market to investors banks pensions foreign governments basically to whomever wishes to purchase them at the market rate and the government like many individuals and banks uses these loans to perform day to day functioning and possible smooth out volatility in spending needs by law the fed can not purchase directly from treasury now once on the market these bonds are traded packaged resold etc since they have inherent value and since those owning them want to buy sell them perhaps before maturity date this liquidity ability to sell your goods is necessary fewer would purchase an item if they could not sell it when they desire thus bonds are bought sold and traded and their prices fluctuate based on what the market thinks they are worth just like any good   now the fed can buy sell these bonds on the open market like anyone else so when the fed wishes to increase the money supply they can buy bonds that are not spendable money and inject money into the system note they now hold a bond that had at the time of transaction the same value as the money they injected note investors freely bought these from treasury meaning the market thought at the time of purchase that this was a good it is not the government merely wishing more money into it is market forces that require more money for trades and is selling goods from the marketplace of presumably equal value to the fed this increases liquidity but takes valuable assets from circulation when the fed wishes to shrink the money supply they sell these bonds back into circulation basically by offering better terms than treasury in fact you can find graphs of the fed operations and see how every december they inject money for more christmas need more coupons for more trade and every january they extract some   so open market transactions buying and selling goods at market prices in the marketplace along with other traders is how the fed injects and removes money from the money supply this is the primary mechanism that the fed uses to control the number of coupons in the economy   finally a little about reserve requirements and the money multiplier since it affects so much of the number of coupons in play this also i must simplify drastically each bank needs to hold 1/10 of all deposits in cash the rest can be lent which lands in another bank which again can be lent etc thus each $ 1 deposited can result in loans totalling 9/10 + + + = 9 more dollars many people claim that banks are printing money which is nonsense since each also has an equal debt to pay to the person they borrowed from when all loans are paid back there is no net money gain   however this allows for each $ 1 the fed injects by buying bonds for there to be up to $ 9 in the economy if banks all loan to the fullest banks tend to want to loan since loaned money makes them profit banks used to loan too much and runs on the banks caused significant problems which is why laws were made to require all banks to have the same reserve requirement   now when banks get scared and stop loaning this 9 fold multiplier dries up and the fed has much less on being able to target the proper number of coupons to keep the economy smooth during the recent crash when banks stopped loaning as each dollar was paid back on debts there was significant of available money for transactions and this kills the economy this is the liquidity crisis    hope this helps as i said this is vastly simplified and i can not go into all the reasons and historical items needed to understand it fully it is a vastly complex and necessarily so and takes significant study to grasp the genius of it it 's similar to not being able to understand nuances of particle physics in one go but as you study and work at it you see why things go as they do and you learn all the failed methods the gold standard is one example that were thrown out for many good reasons   cheers

your logic breaks down because you assume that you are the only market participant on your side of the book and that the participant on the other side of the book has entered a market order here 's what mostly happens large banks and brokerages trading with their own money we call it proprietary or prop trading will have a number of limit and other more exotic orders sitting on both sides of the trading book waiting to buy or sell at a price that they feel is advantageous some of these orders will have sat on the book for many months if not years these alone are likely to prevent your limit orders executing as they are older so will be hit first even if they are n't at a better price   on more liquid stocks there will also be a number of participants entering market orders on both sides of the book whose orders are matched up before limit orders are matched with any market orders this means that pairing of market orders at a better price will prevent your limit order executing in many markets high frequency traders looking for arbitrage opportunities for example will enter a few thousand orders a minute some of these will be limit orders just off touch others will be market orders to be immediately executed the likelihood that your limit order being as it is posited way off touch is hit with all those traders about is minimal on less liquid stocks there are market makers large institutional traders who effectively set the bid and offer prices by being willing to provide liquidity and fill the market orders at a temporary loss to themselves and will in most cases have limit orders set to provide this liquidity that will be close to touch they are paid to do this by the exchange and inter dealer brokers through their fees structure they will fill the market orders that would hit your limit if they think that it would provide more liquidity in such a way that it their obligations only if there are no other participants looking to trade on the instrument at a better price than your limit which of course they can see unless you enter it into a dark pool and there is a market order on the opposite side of the book will your limit order be instantaneously be hit executed and move the market price

it sounds good but perhaps they 've overlooked several things that would need to be addressed before anything like this could work well   1 if there is a leak in the overall flow such as a hft hedge fund sucking money out of the markets at an enormous rate into a tax haven such a system would just perpetuate the existing rise of the entities they still get richer without spending much in return   2 as described they have only talked about one government one nation one monetary recycling system as if nations are closed boxes they are not money flows across borders with ease nations compete to maximise the amount of assets they hold within their borders at any given time these can be fixed capital assets too so nothing prevents the global equity investment they mention from starting to resemble all the powerful corporations concentrated in a single nation over time that would represent a lot of political power concentrated in ways that are not necessarily favourable to individual sovereign national legal systems elsewhere   it is possible that this could mean that nations would compete to lower taxes to zero to attract corporations thereby risking bankrupting governments unless the income from the global equity index compensated enough at 6 it wo n't match current tax rates   the second point also means that nations can not unilaterally decide to implement this unless they have a guaranteed additional income from activities that could compensate for excessive outflow

if you 're in the 25 tax bracket then you probably should n't be doing a roth conversion right now   you 'd prefer to do roth conversions when you can do so at a 15 rate   you could contribute some of your current annual contributions to roth directly but even that is n't a great idea except to diversify your holdings odds are you wo n't be paying 25 average tax rate on your retirement unless you 're doing very well in your retirement account   odds are you 'll be somewhere around 15   converting at a 15 rate therefore is fine basically you 'll have something like this based on some assumptions i 'm making up dollars brackets etc obviously these will change doing this you pay 0 15 tax on up to 75k then pay 0 tax after that on the roth which you paid 15 tax on already   therefore you do n't end up paying more than 15 on any single dollar and you pay less on the total sum   but you also do n't really want to be paying 25 on any of it since that wo n't really help you out any and could hurt you will hurt you if you end up getting some of that 15 bracket income from the roth if you 're in the 25 bracket now then you probably are better off just keeping everything in regular ira unless you 're expecting to be in the 28 bracket after retirement   putting some in roth is n't a terrible idea just for diversification 's sake but it 's probably going to cost you money unless tax rates rise dramatically which they certainly could though not as likely to rise on the middle class 0 100k range   they 'd have to double for you to be worse off this way and finally do not ever withdraw from the 401k to pay taxes on a conversion you 're subject to a 10 penalty for doing that as it 's an early withdrawal and also have to pay taxes on that withdrawal      for more information about when roth makes sense read site joetaxpayer 's blog article on the subject which explains this in great detail

gt america is growing western europe is stagnant china and most of east asia is expanding relatively quickly   so staring into the face of evidence from his own intro context that generally the more active fiscal intervention since the gfc the better economies have fared the author proceeds to about impending doom for the chinese if they do n't switch amp stick to austerity and ignore growth to focus on hidden inflation for the us somehow everything comes down to fed monetary policy despite the fact that 4 years of the fed 's alphabet soup programs without any fiscal assistance from congress has n't kicked the us back into preferred growth and gdp is seeming to slow back down toward recession stagnation and finally the eurozone is apparently most plagued by overblown public debt and government spending somehow out investment that just wishes it had the chance to invest if those pesky profligate politicians would get out of the way and maybe the countries should fork over their economic sovereignty to the ecb so they can be structurally reformed grave robbing   just my opinion this whole article seems like shitty backward economic views coming out of academic economics likely to be a very serious person in ecb bureaucratic advisory en expert professor the lack of being able to comprehend amp adjust to real world results is just sad

you question is a bit scary to me you show $ 2100 rent and let 's even assume that 's 100 i.e. never a vacancy rule of thumb is 10 vacancy depending on area a tenant may stay a year but when they leave you might need to have a bit of maintenance and miss 2 months rent you count the mortgage and taxes and are left with $ 500/mo where is the list of ongoing expenses i suggest you put that $ 500/mo into a separate account and let us know a year from now if anything is left to anthony 's point i agree 100 no one can tell you everything you need to know but whatever my answer or his other members with experience similar or different will add to this and in the end you 'll have a great overview the truth is that it 's easy for me to sit here and see what you may be missing by the way if you look at the rules of thumb they will make your head spin there are those who say the target is for the rent to be 2 of the value of the house but there are markets where this will never happen there 's another rule that says the expenses besides tax should be planned at 50 of the rent i.e. you should put aside $ 1000/mo for expenses over the long term the new house will be lower of course but in years past year 10 or so this number will start to look reasonable

owing taxes to two or more levels of government is n't double taxation it 's a feature of the american union i 'm not for this bill in general mostly for the timing and the loss of the highest bracket but both the state and federal governments have to generate revenue and basing rates on pure incomes with a few loopholes as possible is the most progressive way to do it by owing taxes unadjusted for other taxes paid there 's more incentive for states to lower local taxes and to balance state programs with federal programs and for state reps to more fairly redistribute federal transfers instead of targeting states with usually artificially low local taxes and fewer state programs usually republican

this is n't so much a legal issue the prohibition on giving discounts was written into the merchant agreements that most of the major credit card companies enforced on businesses that accepted their credit cards that is until the recent financial reform bill 2010 passed congress it changes everything the logic on this is a little convoluted so read carefully credit card companies can no longer prohibit merchants from requiring a minimum purchase amount to use a credit card meaning that if merchants want to they can now stop taking credit cards for a $ 4 latte credit card companies can no longer prohibit merchants from giving discounts for cash here is an article with a lot more detail financial reform bill good news for credit card holders here is a link to the actual bill details and content hr dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act here is the relevant part this subsection is supposed to take affect at the end of the 12-month period beginning on the date of the enactment of the consumer financial protection act of 2010 in other words july 21st 2011

it is not an either or decision   if you want to retire decades early then you will need to have a taxable account anyway as you wo n't be able to stuff enough money into the tax advantaged accounts to meet that goal and if you are making a huge sum then you will be in a high tax bracket and so the tax advantages of saving into a 401 k or ira will be substantial so max out your 401k ira and then save the rest into the taxable brokerage account   when you retire at 39 live off your taxable account until you are old enough to tap the other ones without penalty unless you plan to die decades early as well as retire decades early   in that case you can bypass the 401k ira

the notion that you can put product on the web and sit back and watch the money roll in is a myth plain and simple   if you put content on the web and expect people to pay money for your products t shirts etc you have to do the work to get your stuff seen by people and preferably the right kind of people who will buy your stuff that means you need to know your market and provide something that they are eager to pay for this does n't necessarily mean buying advertising to direct traffic to your site there are plenty of no cost ways to bring people to your web site but instead of costing $ $ the cost is in effort and time that you have to put into it also keep in mind that the more participants you have in your production and fulfillment pipeline the less you will make off every sale hands off production services like or cafe press do everything for you all you have to do is provide the artwork   however they also take all the income and pay you a rather percentage of sales   you can get a larger percentage of sales if you do more of the work yourself like handmade items sold on etsy   but then you 're doing work maybe you 'll get $ 1 for each t shirt you sell   if you just upload your artwork to the production service and type in some product description text into their web sales catalog how many sales will you make in the first month   most likely somewhere between zero and two   why should anyone buy your shirt over the tens of thousands of other designs carried by the same production service   it 's your responsibility to tell people about your stuff and send them to the site to buy it   and that means it 's not a passive income for truly passive income invest in bank cd 's treasury bonds or in stocks that pay dividends   the only problem with that is you have to have money to make money this way

the appropriate structure for an organization depends largely on the size of the firm smaller firms can employ some non traditional more easily i.e. flat design whereas the same structures are more difficult to use in mid size and large companies the most important pieces of any corporate structure are 1 clarity of roles 2 accountability and 3 ease of communication   firstly everyone in the organization must have clarity of their own role and how it fits into the bigger picture that means a structure that is easy to understand and a comprehension of how all the roles tie in to each other    secondly a good structure will enable and empower leadership to hold the team accountable and be held accountable in turn what is often misunderstood about accountability is that people often assume that it simply means punishing poor behavior when something breaks down in reality that 's holding people responsible not accountable accountability is something that is self driven and is a product of sound relationships and transparency as an example one of the most common breakdowns in accountability is found in passive non this is when you may reach out to a business partner for help or an update but they simply do not reply as in email text or    thirdly the structure should be such that it is easy for individuals to communicate across and up down the chain this does n't mean that if you send an email communication is easy rather who do i reach out to for this problem what are the best practices or agreed upon methodologies for a certain practice and how does the team know this some of this should be codified in the form of standard operating procedures which can be referenced at any time many companies use a playbook which is a high level reference guide on how to operate the business an example is found here a playbook can be anything from a pdf to an interactive website like the aforementioned link it should always have the most up to date information   most companies will change their structure over time as their environment both internal and external change and they need to adapt for example a small firm may not need an hr department but as it employs more and more people a need to have someone or an entire team focused on human capital management rises quickly an owner operator can handle only so much before it is time to scale up   the most important thing to consider is who you hire people are the largest expense to an organization and having the right people in the right roles is the best way to avoid unnecessary incremental costs resulting from inefficiency fraud or risky behavior always look for the personality traits that make a good employee relative to the role i.e. customer service finance integrity operations teamwork   one of the most obvious parts of a business as it scales up is specialization you want to find a balance though for example hr handles all human relations issues while legal handles all internal claims suits and patents there is an overlap that occurs here as internal claims often start as human relations issues which means you must have healthy communication and clear accountability for an appropriate hand off so legal takes a claim at the right point in time while this example may be a little obvious many times the edges are blurred and clarity of role can be difficult   i hope that helps reach out with any follow up questions

your math is correct if you take the same amount of pre tax wages assuming that that amount can be fully contributed in both traditional and roth cases and assuming the same flat tax rate when contributing and withdrawing then the two are the same however we do n't have a flat tax and due to the way our tax brackets work there is often a slight advantage to traditional accounts recall that not every dollar of your income is taxed at the same rate the tax bracket only describes the rate that the last dollar of your income is taxed at but some of your income will be taxed at lower brackets no matter what your income is your first $ x of income will be taxed at 10 then $ y at 15 etc so what is the tax rate of the dollars of income that you used to contribute to a retirement account is it the first dollars of income the last dollars of income or what since we are comparing an after tax contribution roth versus a pre tax contribution traditional whose income does n't show up in taxable income and all other income is equal the dollars contributed is considered to come from the top in the roth case similarly when you withdraw in the traditional case the withdrawal counts as income is it the first dollar of income or the last dollar of income again since we are comparing the situation where the withdrawal counts as income traditional with the one where it does n't roth all other income being equal the taxable income is considered to be added to the top the difference is that when you contribute to a retirement account you contribute a very small percentage of your income every year probably no more than 5 10 if we count down from the top this small percentage of your income probably falls wholly within a bracket in other words the taxable income in traditional and roth cases are likely in the same bracket so the entire contribution is at the same rate your marginal rate the rate you cite as your tax bracket however when you withdraw in retirement it is likely that every year the retirement account withdrawals account for a large percentage of your income maybe even half or more if we count down from the top this large percentage of your income probably crosses into lower brackets in other words the taxable income in traditional and roth cases are likely to be in different brackets so the withdrawal is partly taxed at one rate partly taxed at another so if your tax bracket is 15 in the traditional case it 's likely that your withdrawal is taxed partly at 15 and partly at 10 so in this case the average tax rate on the withdrawal is lower than your bracket

this would effectively be currency speculation betting that the pound will be stronger vs. the euro in november or whenever than it is today   this would be a profitable transaction if the exchange fees are less than the swing between the two in my very limited experience exchange fees are going to be at least a few percent and she 's going to have to do the exchange twice if she wants to turn current euros into pounds and back into euros later that 's at least a 6 hit    i 'd recommend against this   while it 's quite plausible for the two currencies to move more than 6 against each other in that time it 's also quite possible for them to move the other way causing her a large loss    the unfortunate thing about large heavily traded things like gbp eur is that you 're very unlikely to have some information that the big traders do n't   while lots of people think that the pound is going to become stronger just as many people think that the euro is going to be stronger   these two camps are constantly bidding against each other resulting in the 1.15 pounds euro exchange rate as of this writing   the current price and current direction that the line is moving in no way tells you what it 's going to do next

gt you bring up the feds but that the issue because now we have to talk about monetary policy taxation is fiscal policy   if the goal is for more investments you have to account for loans and money supply far more investment is done on issued bonds than on retained profits   gt;the firm has more money they are going to spend it somewhere   that 's an oversimplification they 'll spend to maximize profit not to grow gdp the two are related but the first is n't always optimal to the second if a firm captures monopoly that 's bad for gdp   the examples in the link are relevant in that context they 're only a part of the economy 92 publicly held u.s. corporations that reported a u.s. profit every year from 2008 through 2015 they 're a non trivial portion of the economy and represent a large share of who will benefit from reducing corporate taxes so when you say gt;in general lowering taxes increases capital investment regardless of the investment rate   the counter point is that no the investment rate matters if spending those taxes produces a higher investment rate you have to adjust policy accordingly to know that you have to estimate the investment rate from a marginal reduction in taxes and compare to the investment rate resulting form your marginal fiscal program spending increase saying that lowering taxes increases investment is insufficient in the same sense that saying infrastructure spending increases investment is insufficient

i ca n't answer the question if you should or should n't get a credit card after all you seem to manage fine without one which is good i started using credit cards when i lived in the uk as the consumer protection you get from a credit card there tends to be better than from a debit card i 'd also treat it as a debit or charge card ie pay it off in full every month that way because you 're not carrying a balance the high interest rate does n't matter and you avoid the trap of digging yourself deeper into the hole each month cashback or other perks offered by a credit card can be worth it but a make sure that they 're worth more than the yearly fee and b that they 're perks you 're actually using for that reason cashback tends to work best i 'd get a visa or mastercard they seem to be the ones that pretty much everybody accepts amex can have better perks but tends to be more expensive and is n't accepted everywhere especially not outside the us but in the end do you really need one if you 're managing fine without one

i do n't see this as an issue with obamacare but an issue with employers that have profits above all mentality    healthcare as a means of compensation was invented back to attract talent in the 30s when salary and wage were frozen during the depression now employer tied healthcare has its usefulness and become an to people who want to find better employment but ca n't afford to lose medical coverage    while obamacare is no single player i think it 's a step in the right direction not to mention that single player was a political doa that no congressman who hopes to be reelected for another term would support it 's but healthcare form to the likes of single payer will be for many powerful wealthy industries that would fight it with tooth and nail

while i think this is generally there are sites and communities dedicated to points churning credit card reward programs   in general no there is no easy way to get cash from a credit card and receive the spending rewards and not pay fees well in excess of your rewards value however there are people who figure out ways to do this kind of thing   like buying prepaid visa cards $ 500 at a time from drug stores on a 5 bonus rewards month   or buying rolls of $ 1 coins from the us treasury with free shipping the issue is the source of the fees   when you spend money on your card the merchant pays a fee   when you get cash from an atm not only is there no merchant remitting a fee there is an atm operator and a network both charging fees

littleadv 's answer gives a concise summary of the system as it stands now but much more changed than just the portion of the mandatory contribution that was diverted to the private plan in broad terms the balances of your accounts and your future benefit wo n't change it 's only the source of these benefits that 's changing the bloomberg article describes the changes this way the state will take over the amount of bonds that pension funds held as of end of sept. 3 and turn them into pension liabilities in the state run social security system the state will assume control of percent of pension fund assets including bonds guaranteed by the government and other non stock assets after the change polish workers that held bonds in the private portion of their retirement portfolios will instead have more payments from the state run pension system the balances of your retirement portfolio and your future benefits should n't change but the reality may depend on how the state pension system is managed and any future changes the government implements the effect this change will have on future benefits is n't clear because the change may simply delay the problem of high levels of outstanding sovereign debt not solve it the government stated that because increasing numbers of workers invested their money in private pension funds less money went into the government 's fund which forced them to issue sovereign debt in order to cover the shortfall in their current pension liabilities   the government 's recent cancellation of government bonds in the hands of private pensions will decrease their overall outstanding debt but in exchange the government is increasing its future pension liabilities years down the road the government may find that they need to issue more sovereign debt to cover the increased pension liabilities they 're taking on today in other words they may find themselves back in the same situation years down the road and it 's difficult to predict what changes they might make at that time

the reason is n't because of the gold standard the real reason is because we have seen a sharp increase in fruit imports over the past 5 decades   huh agriculture is down to single digits as part of the gdp what does that have to do with a gold standard and monetary policy   is up rather dramatically as compared to 40 years ago maybe you mean manufacturing   productivity is up since say the turn of the century but this is to be expected since we incorporated electricity oil automobiles and eventually computers    but as soon as the usa left the gold exchange standard total factor productivity began to dramatically stagnate    that means the growth in productivity    you can see this best here   think of productivity like gdp it used to be 5 and was on its way to 6 but right as we went off the gold standard productivity increases stagnated and by 2007 we 're only at 5.5 instead of the expected 6 this uses a logarithmic function wherein 6 is 10x more than 5 so while productivity has not fallen in an absolute sense growth in productivity which is more important than absolute gdp growth has fallen and is infact related to a decrease in productivity growth   gt;the reason you 're seeing the gains over the past several years shifting towards the rich is due to a combination of tax policy and a rise in cronyism caused by our campaign financing problems big businesses often have a lot of lobbying power to get laws passed that ultimately are felt by the rest of the economy    the reason it has shifted to the rich is because as the currency has debased the gains have gone towards the biggest companies wealthiest individuals assisted by government which works like an auction house to those with connections which is why lobbying roi is huge   currency is a good thing for countries like the united states we can safely finance and pay our debts for a few more years while up debt without fear of hyperinflation    because our massive debt is doing so well for us in the beginning it looks nice because there is very little pain and is practically but as we see current events playing out in the us and to a greater extent europe which is nt as tightly economically as the us fiat currency has huge problems hyperinflation of commodities and deflation of assets are before our eyes house values are plummeting medical education consumer goods are inflating not quite to the hyper part but inflation is increasing and only when commodities such as oil see a deflation in demand as we see right now does inflation look under control shadow inflation is very much alive   if you have dollars in savings the rates do not even outpace inflation you are forced into riskier and investments to make a return   gt;now there may be a lot to gripe about how the united states is currently spending its money but it 's established practical fact that government investment can spur growth level out recessions help people etc   established over what the last 40 years that s hardly enough time to call practical fact when the gold standard existed for hundreds and thousands of years infact no fiat currency that has ever existed has survived that is the real fact and the dollar and euro themselves are currently going through the end stages of this cancer    the gold standard sucks it has a lot of problems fiat currency rocks for the usa because usa fuck yeah we are in a particular advantage where the real risks of fiat currency do n't really apply to the usa   55 million on food stamps with 20 30 million more on other forms of government assistance such as unemployment and welfare unemployment increasing gdp growth decreasing median income decreasing total employment stagnant same number of full time wage earners exist today as in 2000 despite 30 + million more american citizens decreased consumer confidence average age of cars on the road went from 5 years in the 1960s to 12 years today people do nt buy new cars as frequently meaning less disposable income decreased home ownership increased retirement age decreased young american employment   i am not sure why you think that the usa is in such a great position the american dream is if you 're just starting out in life just ask any number of recent college grads who are increasingly living with parents not getting married and ca n't find jobs

but i have been having a little difficulty to include the expenditure in my monthly budget as the billing cycle is from the 16th to 15th of the next month and my income comes in at the end of the month many companies will let you change the statement date if you want so one way to do this would be to request your bank to have statements due at the end of the month or first of month you can call and ask this might resolve your problem entirely how can i efficiently add the credit card expenditure to my monthly budget we do this using ynab which then means our monthly budget is separate from our actual bank accounts when we spend we enter the transaction into ynab and it 's spent additionally we just pay whatever our credit card balance is a day before the end of the month so it is at $ 0 when we do our budget discussion at the end of each month

what is actually a halal investment your definition of halal investment is loose and subject to interpretation on one hand nothing is fixed in the financial world you might get a 10 year germany with a fixed coupon rate of 1 but the real rate of return of this investment is far from fixed it depends on the market environment the inflation etc also you can trade this investment on the secondary market at any time moreover the country can default for example nothing is fixed if you hold the argentina bonds you might think a saving account in the bank is a fixed investment but again what about the inflation and if you talk with the account holders in cyprus you will understand there is no such thing that you are guaranteed to profit a fixed amount each month or year so from this point of view everything is halal because nothing is fixed and the risk of losing the principle is there   on the other hand if you assume that investing a government bond and having a saving account is not halal by definition you will end up with a situation that every investment is not halal suppose you invest in a company what does the company do with your money sure they will use some of your money to buy equipments hire new people and so on but they will always save some money as cash reserves to meet the short term and emergency funding needs those cash reserves are usually in the form of highly liquid investment such as short term bonds money market funds savings in a bank account etc because those investments are not halal per definition is your investment in the company still halal so in the end you might just do whatever you want depending on your interpretation

note i am not a lawyer this is my personal opinion and interpretation first your source is european law which obviously does n't apply outside of the eu the eu can not make laws that bind entities in other countries so you can not claim that the vat was needed to be mentioned second if you owe something you owe it it does n't matter if it was forgotten to be mentioned at best you can say that under those circumstances you do n't want the software anymore and i would assume you can send it back and get your money back minus a fee for having it used for a while this gets quite difficult to calculate clearly so it 's probably not a good avenue to follow for you as the company has to send the vat to your country they will not be allowed to keep a dime of it and have to bear the complete cost for the handling it is a debt you have to your government they are just the entity responsible for collecting it still if you just ignore them they will probably suck it up and your government will also not do a thing to you if they only have your email address they have no way of knowing if you even still have use this address for all they know it could be you never got it they also can not simply charge your card as they probably do n't have the card data any more they are not supposed to keep it after the transaction is complete and they thought it was complete at the time all in all you should be safe to ignore it it 's between you and your god consciousness if you feel obliged to pay it as technically you owe it
# 457584
the reason that funds and the like are bad is n't because of the leverage ratio it 's because they 're compounded daily and the product of all the doubled daily returns is not mathematically equivalent to the double the long term return i 'd consider providing big fancy equations using pi as the product of elements in a sequence operator and other calculus but that would be overkill i do n't think i can do here and i do n't know the relevant anyway anyway from the economics theory perspective the ideal leverage ratio is 1x that is unlevered straight investment consider using leverage costs money you know that surely if someone could borrow money at n% and invest at an expected where x > 0 then they would they would borrow all the money they could and buy all the s&p500 they could but when they bought all that s&p500 they 'd eventually run out of people who were willing to sell it for that cheap that would mean the excess return would be smaller eventually you 'd get to a point where the excess return is zero well no empirically we can see that it 's definitely not zero and that in the real world that stocks do return more than bonds why   because stocks are riskier than bonds the difference in expected return between an index like the s&p500 and a us treasury bond is due to the relative riskiness of the s&p500 which is n't guaranteed by the us government to return your principal any money that you make off of leverage comes from assuming some sort of a risk now assuming risk can be a profitable thing to do but there are also a lot of people out there with higher risk tolerance than you like insurance companies and billionaires so the market is n't exactly short of people willing to take risks and you should n't expect the returns of assuming risk in the general case to be awesome now it 's true that investing in an unlevered fashion is risky also but that 's not an excuse to go leveraged anyway it 's a reason to hold back in fact regular stocks are sufficiently risky that most people probably should n't be holding a 100 stock portfolio they should be that risk with bonds instead and increasing the size of their bond holdings over time the appropriate time to use leverage is when you have information which limits your risk you have done research and have reason to believe that you understand the future of an individual stock index better than the rest of the stock market does you calculate that the potential for achieving returns with leverage outweighs the risks then you dump your money into the leveraged position in exchange for this the market receives information about anticipated future returns of this instrument because of the price movement which occurs as a result of someone putting his money where his mouth is if you 're just looking to dump money into broad market in a leveraged fashion you 're doing it wrong there is no free money ed which is not to say there 's not money there 's lots of money but if you go looking for the free kind you wo n't find it and may end up with money that you thought was free but was actually quite expensive edit okay so you do n't like my answer i 'm not surprised i 'm giving you a real answer instead of a make free money answer okay here 's your how to make free money answer assume you are using a constant leverage ratio over the length of time you 've invested your money and you do n't get to just jump into and out of the market that 's market timing not leverage so you have to stay invested you 're going to have a scenario which falls into one of these categories the s&p500 historically rises over time the average rate of return probably exceeds the average interest rate so the ideal leverage ratio is infinite of course this is a stupid answer in real life because you ca n't pull that off your risk tolerance is too low and you will have trouble finding a lender willing to lend you unsecured money and you 'll probably lose all your money in a crash sooner or later ultimately it 's a stupid answer because you 're asking the wrong question you should probably ask a better question when i use leverage to gain additional exposure to risk am i being properly compensated for assuming that risk

from the irs section 1091 loss from wash sales of stock or securities   section provides that in the case of any loss claimed to have been sustained from any sale or other disposition of shares of stock or securities where it appears that within a period beginning 30 days before the date of such sale or disposition and ending 30 days after such date the taxpayer has acquired by purchase or by an exchange on which the entire amount of gain or loss was recognized by has entered into a contract or option so to acquire substantially identical stock or 3 securities then no deduction shall be allowed under 165 the document is not long 4 pages and should be read to see the intent it 's tough to choose the one but the conclusion is this is the definitive response to that question   a purchase within an ira or other retirement account can create a wash sale if such a purchase would be a wash sale otherwise i.e. the fact that it 's a retirement account does n't avoid wash rules

reading and analyzing financial statements is one of the most important tasks of equity analysts which look at a company from a fundamental perspective   however analyzing a company and its financial statements is much more than just reading the absolute dollar figures provided in financial statements you need to calculate financial ratios which can be compared over multiple periods and companies to be able to gauge the development of a company over time and compare it to its competitors for instance for an equity analyst the absolute dollar figures of a company 's operating profit is less important than the ratio of the operating profit to revenue which is called the operating margin   another very important figure is free cash flow which can be set in relation to sales (= free cash flow sales   the following working capital related metrics can be used as a health check for a company and give you early warning signs when they deviate too much you can either calculate those metrics yourself using a spreadsheet e.g. excel or use a professional solution e.g. bloomberg professional reuters or worldcap

i just wanted to give you a different perspective as i own a house purchased with a mortgage with my girlfriend i think it can be done safely and fairly but you do need to involve legal help to do it right there really is nothing to be terrified about the extra cost to set this up was almost irrelevant in the bigger picture of legal costs around purchasing and the documents describing the ownership scheme are quite straightforward maybe it 's a uk thing but it seems rather commonplace here   we 've chosen to hold this as tenants in common and use a trust deed for this when we purchased we had a solicitor write the trust deed and it clearly states what percentage of the house is owned by either party and exactly what the steps would be taken should we decide to end the trust e.g. in case of a split up this includes things like the right to buy out the other person before selling on the market etc   we also had to make wills separately to indicate what should happen with our percentage of the property in case one of us died as with this type of ownership it does n't automatically go to the other person   finally we 're both on the mortgage which i guess is the main difference versus your situation but again you could get legal advice as to how this should best be handled

most biotech companies do not have a product they are selling    they have a set of possible drugs that they are developing      if any of these drugs get proven to be better than the current drugs they can be sold at a great profit therefore as soon as a biotech company proves a drug candidate is likely to pass large scale trials the company is often taken over by a large pharmaceutical company and is therefore no longer listed on the stock market so mostly profit comes after the company stops being listed therefore the profit will be negative for most biotech companies that are publicly traded

the mathematics make it easier to understand why this is the case using very bad shorthand d1 and are inputs into n and n can be expressed as the probability of the expected value or the most probable value which in this case is the discounted expected stock price at expiration d1 has two which is volatility in the numerator and one in the denominator   cancelling leaves one on top   calculating when it 's infinity gives an n of 1 for s and 0 for k so the call is worth s and the put   at 0 for it 's the opposite more concise is that any mathematical moment be it variance which mostly influences volatility mean which determines drift or which mostly influences skew are all thus costs so the higher they are the higher the price of an option economically speaking uncertainties are costs   since costs raise prices and volatility is an uncertainty volatility raises prices it should be noted that bs assumes that prices are distributed   they are not   the closest distribution currently is the gamma distribution

for this the internal rate of return is preferred in short all cash flows need to be discounted to the present and set equal to 0 so that an implied rate of return can be calculated you could try to work this out by hand but it 's practically hopeless because of solving for roots of the implied rate of return which are most likely complex it 's better to use a spreadsheet with this capability such as 's calc the average return on equity is 9 so anything higher than that is a rational choice example using this simple tool the formula variables can easily be input for instance the first year has a presumed cash inflow of $ because the insurance has a 30 discount from $ that is assumed to be otherwise paid a cash inflow of $ 40,000 to finance the a cash outflow of $ 40,000 to fund the a $ 400 outflow for inspection and an outflow in the amount of the first year 's interest on the loan this should be repeated for each year   they can be input as they are for each year and the calculator will do the rest

3 years ago i wrote student loans and your first mortgage in response to this exact question by a fellow blogger in my state   what i focused on was the way banks qualify you for a loan a percentage for the housing cost and a higher number that also comprises all other debt if the goal is speed to purchase you make minimum payments on the student loan and save for the $ 100 k downpayment as fast as you can   the question back to you is whether the purchase is your priority and how debt averse you are i 'd caution if you work for a company with a matched 401(k i 'd still deposit to the match but no more   personal finance is just that personal we do n't know your entire situation your current rental expenses vs your total condo cost when you buy if you are in a location where renting costs far more than your cost of ownership ben might change his mind a bit if the reverse is true you 're living a college student 's lifestyle with a room costing $ sharing a house with friends i 'll back off and say to pay the loan and save until you ca n't tolerate the situation you 'll find there are few situations that have a perfect answer without having all the details

let 's think like a real estate developer first you need to check with the zoning commission the restrictions for the area let 's say that the plot is actually suitable for 10 homes you buy the land you also need to finance the build itself if you do n't have enough cash you need to acquire financing from banks and perhaps from other sources as well because banks wo n't loan you the entire amount   next you need to divide the plot into 10 pieces making sure that each piece has driveway access to the street and plan access to utilities water sewer electricity broadband phone lines plan the size and position of each house get building approval this is a process that can take some time especially if they have follow up questions get a builder to build the houses including ground work and preparation for utilities get approval for the finished houses a building inspector will check that the houses follow the permission and all laws and regulations that apply this step can entail time and added cost   get a real estate agent to sell the new homes often the selling process starts in the planning phase and early buyers are able to influence both the layout of the house and the finish your cost estimate included a profit of 140k for each house from that a builder needs to subtract financing costs real estate agent costs any costs that you forgot to factor in budget overdrafts contingency costs and salaries for your staff and yourself i estimate the project time to 1.5 2 years so we have an $ 8 m project with a gross profit of $ 1.4 m not including all costs net profit probably just a few hundred thousand or less   real estate developers with local knowledge would be able to make a much more accurate estimate on both time and cost my guess is that they have and since the plot has n't sold in a while either the price is at the upper end of what makes a profitable project or there are other restrictions that limit the number size of homes that can be built on it

in general prices are inversely proportional to rates however accurate interest rate prediction would make one worthy of managing a large credit derivative hedge fund this is not to say that interest rates can not go up in canada since the world is currently undergoing a resource bust and the united states has begun exporting more oil even trying to recently open the market to europe both of which canada is relatively dependent upon also to say that canada currently has the most overpriced real estate is an oversight to say the least considering china currently has entire cities that are empty because prices are too high a ten to twenty percent drop in real estate prices would probably be a full blown financial crisis and since mortgage rates are currently around 2.5 a one to two hundred basis point rise could mean a nearly 50 decrease in real estate prices if interest payments are held constant   canada would either have to start growing its economy at a much higher rate to encourage the central bank to raise rates to such a height or oil would have to completely collapse suddenly to cause a possible collapse of cad to encourage the same the easiest relationship to manipulate between prices and rates is the perpetuity where p is the price i is the interest payment and r is the interest rate   in this case an increase of r from 2.5 to 4.5 would cause a decrease in p if i is held constant   however typical canadian mortgages seem to mature in ten years at a fixed rate so i can not be held constant and the relationship between r and p is less strong at earlier maturities thus the most likely way for prices to collapse is for a financial collapse as described above

start with the bank where you have your checking and savings account they can streamline some of the paperwork because they can see how much you make and have access to several years worth of bank statement legitimate mortgage companies do publish their rates but there is no guarantee that you will qualify for the best rate without them knowing your credit score salary and down payment information   there is no way to know that you have the best rate because of the time lag involved you will pick the best one you can work with but the rates can change every day   even when you lock in the rates other companies can drift lower once you have started down the application process you will reach a point where switching companies will cost you time and money once you decide to purchase a house the contract usually only gives you a few weeks to prove that you have financing in place therefore you will have to start the process before deciding on the house some advance work is needed to give you an idea of the maximum monthly payment you can afford which will then based on the rate and down payment determine the maximum house you can buy i have had good luck with my credit union but there is no guarantee that yours will be competitive keep in mind that while rates are very important some people also value customer service and also like that the mortgage wo n't be sold to out of town investors

you definitely do want to avoid losing money on repeated currency conversions   remember they are making a profit every time you change your currency a money market fund is basically like a savings account mutual fund   they are open like mutual funds in that you can buy or sell at any time   there do n't tend to be fees of any kind directly as all management is paid for out of the interest returns that the fund generates so using a money market fund to hold the cash portion of your tfsa or any other account for that matter would be a normal and free thing to do good luck

frequently selling and buying properties is generally not advisable in germany due to the high cost for property purchase tax and land registration fees you can generally assume that ever time you trade homes you pay about 10 extra so it is likely a good idea to keep your property and rent it out while you do n't need it so you can use the rent to pay for your new room that 's especially true if you expect the property to increase in value also due to the low interest rate right now real estate is practically the only good capital investment a 85k asset which makes you each year is a return of investment of any financial asset promising you that kind of dividend at the moment is likely equivalent to gambling yes i ignored maintenance costs but it 's still a really good deal if you want to rent out your flat as stress free as possible give it to a property management company in exchange for a percentage of the monthly rent they will take care of all the small stuff like hiring to fix broken toilets you might still have to pay for really expensive investments though like replacing a leaking roof but when something like that happens you should have no issue to finance it with a loan because you have a real estate as a security   however keep in mind that the german tenancy law might make it difficult but not impossible to get rid of the tenant in case you want to move back into the apartment google for more details should you decide after your study that you do n't want to move back you can always sell the flat with the tenant but rented properties usually get far lower prices on the real estate market than empty ones regarding covering your cost of living besides rent during your studies if you are eligible for state sponsored student loan you should take it because it 's an offer simply too good to refuse it 's literally free money but unfortunately you are not because you own too much real estate wealth you are not living in but you should ask your bank for a loan backed by said property that way you will likely pay far less interest than with a regular private student loan which is n't backed by anything except the hope for a relevant degree

obviously you ca n't predict the future too much but it 's not too hard to figure out what is going to happen to mortgage rates in the short term mortgage rates are heavily influenced by 10 year treasury yields   you can find the daily 10 year rates here   it 's easy to see the direction they 've been moving recently   it usually takes a few days for mortgage rates to follow if the 10 year treasury yield is dropping although if it 's going up mortgage rates will go up faster than they will fall here 's a sample of all the 10 year treasury yields for the past 10 years   looks like a good time to get a mortgage or refinance you can also take a look at movements in mortgage backed securities here you can find a chart for fannie mae 3.0 mortgages   as the price goes up mortgage rates go down   think of it this way right now people are will to pay $ 103 for $ 100 worth of 3.0 mortgages that does n't really make sense because i could just loan you $ 100 at 3.0 and turn around and sell it for $ 103 immediately pocketing the $ 3 profit   the reason is because right now no one would willingly borrow money at 3.0 rates have fallen so much that if a bank has a customer paying them 3.0 on a mortgage other people are willing to pay a premium on that mortgage new mortgages are probably being written for 2.0 there is no current mortgage backed security for 2.0 fannie because rates have never been this low before

the simplest way to consolidate the funds your old 401(k plans is by doing what 's called a direct rollover whereby the funds go directly into the new plan and skips you completely from each of the old plans into either an ira that you establish with a provider of your choice or even into your current employer 's 401(k plan if that is available that way the funds are in one central account and available to invest plus it eliminates the mandatory 20 withholding if the rollover is indirect and is sent to you first before the deposit into the new plan it is important to bear in mind that you have 60 calendar days from the date of distribution to get the full amount into the new plan and a rollover is considered a tax reportable but not necessarily a taxable event provided you deposit the funds within the time frame allotted

here in the u.s. a realtor can act as a seller 's agent or a buyer 's agent i think what you are calling a broker in the u.s. we call a buyer 's agent and this may just be a difference in terminology from your post it sounds like the concept is the same i am answering from a u.s. perspective please let me know if something does n't make sense in the israeli context here each typically gets 3 to 3.5 of the sale price at least in my part of the country so yes the buyer 's agent has an incentive to get a higher price even though this is contrary to the interests of the person he is supposed to represent on the other hand the buyer 's agent has a strong incentive to find a house at a price that you consider acceptable if the absolute most you are willing to pay is say and he keeps showing you houses that cost he 's just wasting his time he 's wasting your time too of course but let 's assume he does n't care about that i do n't know what housing prices are in israel today just making up numbers suppose he has two houses that he can show you one in your price range and one not if he shows you the first you may buy it and we will very quickly get his commission if he shows you the second you probably wo n't buy it and he 'll get zero if he keeps showing you houses above your price range he 's doing a bunch of work for which he will never be paid the worst case from your point of view is if you 're thinking that you 're expecting and prepared to pay say to and you tell the broker that his incentive is to concentrate on the upper end maybe even push it a little but still if he shows a house that 's well within your range so you 'll quickly buy he can get today versus trying to push you to go higher so he can maybe get in a few months is the extra worth several months of extra work probably not personally i 've never had a problem with a realtor trying to push me to buy a house more expensive than i said i was prepared to pay at least not that i noticed maybe they were very skillful at it and i did n't realize they were doing it like showing me houses that were totally run down dumps until i decided i was willing to pay more as to your specific suggestion i do n't know if a realtor would be willing to negotiate an alternative deal from their standard contract i 've never tried to do such a thing yes this would give him an incentive to find the lowest possible price arguably this would create a perverse incentive to show you houses of very low quality just because they 're cheap and there would be the problem that he 'd have no incentive to show you houses at or just over your stated maximum as his commission would be zero negative if it goes over slightly what i did on my last house was tell the realtor i want to start by looking at houses costing under if i ca n't find anything i like i 'll go a little higher by not telling the realtor my maximum i discouraged her from immediately going for the maximum at least that was my theory

assuming that the conversion was completely non taxable i.e. your traditional ira was 100 basis then the converted money can be taken out at any time whatsoever no 5 year or age stuff without tax or penalty similar to directly contributed money for withdrawing conversions and rollovers within 5 years of the conversion or rollover the penalty only applies to the part of the conversion or rollover that was taxable since in this case the conversion was completely non taxable there is no penalty on the withdrawal however note that the ordering of the conversion money is not the same as for contribution money and this may be significant in some cases when you take money out of roth ira it goes 1 contributions 2 rollovers and conversions and 3 earnings however money within 2 is then further divided by year with rollovers and contributions for earlier years ordered before rollovers and contributions for later years and then within each year the taxable rollover and conversion money are ordered first before the non taxable money so what does that mean well suppose you made a roth ira conversion that was taxable one year and then the next year you make a contribution if you withdraw a little bit it comes from the contribution which is ordered first which means no penalty now suppose in that second year you had a backdoor roth ira contribution instead of a regular contribution if you withdraw the first year 's conversion is ordered first and since it 's within 5 years there 's a penalty it 's still true that withdrawing the backdoor roth ira has no penalty but you do n't get to that money until you finish the other one if you 've never made a taxable conversion before then this issue does n't exist

i would always suggest rolling over 401(k plans to traditional iras when possible   particularly assuming there is enough money in them that you can get a fee free account at somewhere like fidelity or vanguard   this is for a couple of reasons first off it opens up your investment choices significantly and can allow you significantly reduced expenses related to the account   you may be able to find a superior offering from vanguard or fidelity to what your employer 's 401(k plan allows typically they only allow a small selection of funds to choose from   you also may be able to reduce the overhead fees as many 401(k plans charge you an administrative fee for being in the plan separate from the funds costs second it allows you to condense 401(k)s over time each time you change employers you can rollover your 401(k to your regular ira and not have to deal with a bunch of different accounts with different passwords and such   even if they 're all at the same provider odds are you will have to use separate accounts third it avoids issues if your employer goes out of business   while 401(k plans are generally fully funded particularly for former employers who you do n't have match or vesting concerns with it can be a pain sometimes when the plan is terminated to access your funds they may be locked for months while the bankruptcy court works things out finally employers sometimes make it expensive for you to stay in particularly if you do have a very small amount   do n't assume you 're allowed to stay in the former employer 's 401(k plan fee free the plan will have specific instructions for what to do if you change employers and it may include being required to leave the plan or more often it could increase the fees associated with the plan if you stay in   getting out sometimes will save you significantly even with a low cost plan

mutual funds are collections of investments that other people pay to join   it would be simpler to calculate the value of all these investments at one time each day and then to deem that any purchases or sales happen at that price   the fund diversifies rather than magnifies risk looking to hold rather than enjoy a quick turnaround   nobody really needs hourly updated price information for an investment they intend to hold for decades they quote their prices on a daily basis and you take the daily price   this makes sense for a vehicle that is a balanced collection of many different assets most of which will have varying prices over the course a day   that makes pricing complicated   this primer explains mutual fund pricing and the requirements of the investment company act of 1940 which mandates daily price reporting   it also illustrates the complexity how does the fund pricing process work mutual fund pricing is an intensive process that takes place in a short time frame at the end of the day generally a fund ’s pricing process begins at the close of the new york stock exchange normally 4 p.m. eastern time the fund ’s accounting agent which may be an affiliated entity such as the fund ’s adviser or a third party servicer such as the fund ’s administrator or custodian bank is usually responsible for calculating the share price the accounting agent obtains prices for the fund ’s securities from pricing services and directly from brokers pricing services collect securities prices from exchanges brokers and other sources and then transmit them to the fund ’s accounting agent fund accounting agents internally validate the prices received by subjecting them to various control procedures for example depending on the nature and extent of its holdings a fund may use one or more pricing services to ensure accuracy note that under rule forward pricing fund shareholders receive the next daily price not the last daily price   forward pricing makes sense if you want shareholders to get the most accurate sale or purchase price but not if you want purchasers and sellers to be able to make precise calculations about gains and losses how can you be precise if the price wo n't be known until after you buy or sell

what you 're getting at is the same as investing with leverage usually this comes in the form in a margin account which an investor uses to borrow money at a low interest rate invest the money and hopefully beat the interest rate   is this approach unwise that completely depends on how your investments perform and how high your loan 's interest rate is the higher your loan 's interest rate the more risky your investments will have to be in order to beat the interest rate if you can get a return which beats the interest rates of your loan then congratulations you have come out ahead and made a profit if you can keep it up you should make the minimum payment on your loan to maximize the amount of capital you can invest if not then it would be better to just use your extra cash to pay down the loan   are there really are investments aside from stocks and such that i can try to use to my advantage with interest rates as low as they are right now at least in the us you 'll probably be hard pressed to find a savings account or cd that will return a higher interest rate than your loan 's if you 're nervous about the risk associated with investing in stocks and bonds as is healthy then know that they come in a wide spectrum of risk it 's up to you to evaluate how much risk you 're willing to take on to achieve a higher return

this is actually a very complicated question the key reading in this area is a seminal paper by optimal execution of portfolio transactions 2000 they show that there 's a tradeoff between liquidating your portfolio faster and knowing the value with more certainty versus liquidating more slowly and likely for a higher price but with less certainty so for example if you sold your entire position right now you would know almost certainly how much you would get for the position or you could sell off your position more slowly and likely get more money but you would have less certainty about how much you would get the paper is available online at

in your comment you said it just seems a little stupid to me to go and put away money for the explicit purpose of emergencies presumably in a way that 's somehow different from how you would normally save money seems better to go and treat the money as you would normally and then pull whatever you need from the money that you had saved the problem with that logic is that people save money for many different things   you might save for a vacation or a new refrigerator or a new car or a house or your kids college education   if you pull whatever you need for such expenses you may find that when a real emergency occurs you do n't have enough money   the things you used it for may have been legitimate reasonable expenses but nonetheless you may later wish you had deferred those expenses until after you had built up a cushion so the idea of an emergency fund is to designate certain money that is not to be used for whatever you need but specifically for unforeseen circumstances   of course there can be debate about what counts as an emergency but the main point is to distinguish saving for planned future expenses from saving for unplanned future expenses note that this does n't mean the money has to be in a separate account or saved in any special way   it just means the money has to be considered by you as an emergency fund   for some people it may be psychologically useful to put the emergency fund in a separate account that they never withdraw from   but even if you just have all your money in one savings account and you mentally tell yourself i do n't want to ever let the balance drop below $ 10,000 just so i have a safety cushion then you are effectively designating that $ 10,000 as an emergency fund

would make sense that the higher liquidation cost and transaction costs are driving the share price down    higher and transaction means higher investors would require higher return driving down the share price the other possibilities i can think of off the top of my head based on looking at the firm for five minutes   1 in transaction costs did you include tax disclaimer math below done on the back of the envelope in between meetings   so nav says they are at liquidating that entire portfolio means about 22 capital gains tax rate which means after tax value is about $ add in any fees you 'd incur from trying to sell this stuff and it 's not unreasonable to assume you 'll only get about $ 55 m once all is said and done which is pretty close to the actual market cap    if you have accounted for the above consider   2 bulk of their investments seem to be in private assets which implies that they have some discretion in how they mark the value of those investments and there is the chance that the market does n't have confidence in these guys what 's their performance been like in recent years especially with a private asset portfolio i 'd be weary    if i was to invest in them i 'd want a higher return for the opaque portfolio

actually if you look at a loan for $ 115,000 over 30 years at current interest rates you would have a payment of about $ 500 a month i would argue your $ 500 monthly payments are building equity the same way a loan repayment schedule would is your agreement in writing if it is there 's nothing you can do unless they agree if it 's not then write up a contract for a $ loan that you will pay back over 30 years at $ 500 a month with the amortization table that will show how much equity you 're building over time it 's not much the first 10 years note that some states require real estate contract to be in writing or else they are by either party whatever you do get something in writing or you 'll probably either end up in court or feeling bitter for the next few decades

be careful of the other answers here many are wrong or partially wrong the question implies that you knew this but for everyone else 's benefit you can keep you llc organization and still elect to be treated as a s corp by the irs just for tax purposes   you do this by filing form with the irs you can also by the way elect to be taxed as a regular c corp if you want although that 's probably not advantageous   see form the advantage of electing to be treated as an s corp is that income beyond what constitutes a reasonable salary are not subject to social security and medicare taxes as they would when paid was wages or counted as self employment income on schedule c.   depending on what you need to pay yourself to meet the reasonable salary test your overall income and other factors about your business this could result in tax savings contrary to other answers here making this election will not force you to create a board of directors   you are still an llc for all purposes except taxes so whatever requirements you had in organization and governance at the state level will not change   you will have to file a corporate tax return on form 1120s and likely some corresponding state tax form so that is additional paperwork but this corporate return does not mean the s corp pays taxes itself with a couple of exceptions the s corp pays no taxes directly and therefore does not pay at the corporate tax rate instead the s corp its income expenses and deductions to the owner(s on schedule k.   the owners get their portion reported from the s corp on schedule k1 and then include that on their personal form 1040 to pay tax at their personal rate in addition to filing form 1120s you will have to handle payroll taxes which will create some additional administrative work and/or cost using a payroll service for this will likely be your best option and not terribly expensive you 've also got the issue of determining your reasonable salary within the rules which is the subject of other questions on this site and other irs guidance

yes it is a very good idea to start your credit history early   it sounds like you have a good understanding of the appropriate use of credit as a substitute for cash rather than a supplement to income   as long as you keep your expenses under control and pay off your card each month i see no problems with the idea try to find a card with no annual fees a low interest rate if possible which will be difficult at your age and with some form of rewards such as cash back   look for a reputable issuing bank and keep the account open even after you get a new card down the road   your credit score is positively correlated with having an account open for a long time having a good credit usage to credit limit ratio and having accounts in good standing and paid on time

taxes are a tool for achieving social policy goals while americans consider socialism to be a curse the us is in fact quite socialistic mostly towards corporations but sometimes even the normal people not only the corporation are people my friend m. romney get some discounts the tax deduction on mortgage interest comes as a tool to encourage americans to own their homes it is important socially for people to own their home to be independent and in general contributes to the stability of the society as anything when taken to the extreme it in fact achieves exactly the opposite as we 've seen in 2008 but when balanced works well capital gain is taxed in the us because it is income generally any income is taxed however gain sourced from the sale of primary residence is excluded up to a certain quite large amount from this tax if lived in the residence long enough 3 of the last 5 years prior to sale this again to encourage americans to upgrade their houses and make it easier for americans to relocate when needed sell one house and buy another without losing cash on taxes as to asset producing income that is true in the us as well you can not deduct your personal expenses in general mortgage interest on primary residence is a notable exception because it serves a social cause similarly medical expenses are allowed as a deduction if they 're above certain limit and many other things for example if a us person totals his car and insurance does n't cover the loss it is tax deductible above certain limit the higher the income the higher the limit these are purely social policy breaks socialism something americans like to have and love to hate many anti socialists in the us are in fact taking advantage of these specific tax breaks the most because for rich folks these are limited or non existent mortgage interest limited up to 1 million medical expenses are allowed only above certain percentage of income etc

i would expect that your position will be liquidated when the option expires but not before there 's probably still some time value so it does n't make sense for the buyer to exercise the option early and take your stock instead they could sell the option to someone else and collect the remaining time value occasionally there 's a weird situation for whatever reason where an option has near zero or negative time value and then you might get an early exercise but in general if there 's time value someone would want to sell rather than exercise if the option has n't expired maybe the stock will even fall again and you 'll keep it if the option just expired maybe the exercise just has n't been processed yet it may take overnight or so

in any technical field practitioners have difficulty explaining general abstract concepts to outsiders they 're accustomed to using a particular set of concepts and ideas that make communication fast and easy between their colleagues but make communication difficult with outsiders who do n't know that language it 's usually easy to come up with a mediocre analogy that communicates the gist of the idea but finding analogies that capture the complete essence of the concept is extremely hard and maybe impossible   have you studied mathematics try explaining the concept of a continuous function in all its without talking about and deltas or open sets and you can talk about drawing a line and not picking up your pencil but that 's not quite what a continuous function is likewise if you 've studied law try explaining what a security interest is in its full without talking about liens or pledges you can come up with specific examples sure but it 'll be tough to find one that captures the whole concept i 'm sure you can come up with examples from whatever field it is you specialise in   added to this is the problem that the skill set needed to be a good across disciplines is n't really valued in most corporations including banks    edit i accidentally a word

the equation is the same one used for mortgage amortization   you first want to calculate the pv present value for a stream of $ 50 k payments over 20 years at rate   then that value is the fv future value that you want to save for and you are looking to solve the payment stream needed to create that future value good luck achieving the 10 return and in knowing your mortality down to the exact year unless this is a homework assignment which need not reflect real life   edit as indicated above the first step is to get that value in 20 years   the image is the user friendly entry screen for the pv calculation it walks you though the need to enter rate as per period therefore i enter as the rate the payment you desire is $ 50k yr and since it 's a payment it 's a negative number the equation in excel that results is = and the sum calculated is $ next you wish to know the payments to make to arrive at this number   in this case you start at zero pv with a known fv calculated above and known rate this solves for the payment needed to get this number $ the excel equation is = most people have access to excel or a public domain spreadsheet application e.g. if you are often needing to perform such calculations a business finance calculator is recommended ti used to make a model ba-35 finance calculator no longer in production still on ebay used   one more these equations whether in excel or a calculator are geared toward per period interest i.e. when you state 10 they assume a monthly with that said you required a 20 year deposit period and 20 year withdrawal period we know you wish to take out $ per month the equation to calculate deposit required becomes   ha exact same answer far less work to be clear this works only because you required 240 deposits to produce 240 withdrawals in the future

when you adjust your investments the following will happen initial condition modified condition this means that after this change you will note that the amount of federal tax you pay each month via withholding will go up you are now contributing less pre tax so your taxable income has increased if you make no other changes then in april you will either have increased your refund by 6 months x the additional $ 25 a month or decreased the amount you owe by the same amount there is no change in the total 401 k balance at the end of the year other than accounting for how much is held pre tax vs. roth post tax keep in mind that employer contributions must be pre tax the company could never guess what your tax situation is they withhold money for taxes based on the form you fill out but they have no idea of your family 's tax situation if you fail to have enough withheld you pay the penalty not the company the tax savings are complex because it depends on marital status your other pre tax amounts for medical and how much income your spouse makes plus your other income and deductions

since you did not treat the house as a you have to use usd as your functional currency   to calculate capital gains you need to calculate the usd value at the time of purchase using the exchange rate at the time of purchase and the usd value at the time of sale using the exchange rate at the time of sale   the capital gain loss is then the difference between the two   this link describes it in more detail and provides some references that link also discusses additional potential complications if you have a mortgage on the house this link gives more detail on the court case referenced in the above link the court cases references 54 105   this link from the irs has some details from that 54 105 1 12 states that for purposes of determining    gain the basis and selling price of property acquired by a u.s. citizen living in a foreign country should be expressed in united states dollars at the rates of exchange prevailing as of the dates of purchase and sale of the property    respectively the text of this implies it is for u.s. citizen is living in a foreign country but the court case makes it clear that it also applies in your scenario house purchased while living abroad but now residing in the us agree that the pounds received for their residence should be translated into u.s. dollars at the $ exchange rate prevailing at the date of sale they argue however that the pound adjusted cost basis of the residence consisting of the pound purchase price and the pounds paid for capital improvements likewise should be expressed in u.s. dollar terms as of the date of the sale correctly state that viewed in the foreign currency in which it was transacted the purchase generated a pound gain as of the date of the sale which translates to approximately $ 200,000 at the $ per pound exchange rate however fair and reasonable their argument may be it amounts to an untenable attempt to convert their functional currency from the u.s. dollar to the pound sterling under use of a functional currency other than the u.s. dollar is restricted to qualified business units correctly assert that their residence was purchased for a pound denominated value while they were living and working in a pound denominated economy and since concede that the purchase and sale of their residence was not carried out by a the district court properly rejected their plea to treat the pound as their functional currency

trying to make money on something going down is inherently more complicated risky and speculative than making money on it going up   selling short allows for unlimited losses   put options expire and have to be if you want to keep playing that game   if you are that confident that the european market will completely crash i 'm not but then again i tend to be fairly contrarian i 'd recommend just sitting it out in cash possibly something other than the euro and waiting until it gets so ridiculously cheap due to panic selling that it all common sense   for example when companies that are n't completely falling apart are selling for less than book value and/or less than five times prior peak earnings that 's a good sign   another indicator is when you hear absolutely nothing other than doom and gloom and people they 'll never buy another stock as long as they live   then buy at these depressed prices and when all the panic sellers realize that the world did n't end it will go back up

think again     all prosperity ultimately comes from the generation -the of wealth     we create wealth out of the ether when we take a thing physical which is worth little and turn it into a thing that is worth more with the power of an idea and the application of labor   on a macro scale that translates into the manufacturing sector   the manufacturing sector in the us has changed it 's not gone   it 's spectacularly healthy in a of new ways while all the old ones have died off or are dying a slow death   the new manufacturing sector demands skill not just attendance   unskilled work is drying up because under current laws unskilled people cost more to employ than they can possibly produce but someone with a skill in trade can get a job in half a heartbeat especially if they are willing to move to where the job is   no nation of any size can prosper without the internal generation of real wealth   the idea that we can be a nation of bankers and managers is laughable and is precisely what got us into our current situation   the future is and will always be in making new things   labor is not a word and it does not equate to a second class existence as pay rates are currently demonstrating   it was geniuses working in the trades who were the innovators and entrepreneurs that built american industrial power thus economic power in the first place     it will be again

a lease payment is composed of an interest portion borrowed money and depreciation amount purchase residual the monthly payment is then monthly interest cost + monthly depreciation cost the money factor is used to estimate the amount of interest due in a single month of a lease so you can figure out the monthly payment if you are borrowing $ 100,000 then over the entire loan of repayment from a balance of $ 100,000 to a balance of $ 0 the average amount you owed was $ 50,000 1/2 of principal    you are repaying this loan monthly 1/12 of a year and percents are expressed as 1/100 6 1/2 for principal 1/12 for monthly 1/100 to convert percentage from 6 to .06   = 6 2400 is the product of 3 consecutive conversion 1/2 1/12 1/100 to convert from an interest rate to a money factor = money factor of which can be multiplied against the total amount being borrowed to know what the monthly interest would roughly equal some money factor info

as your question is written now it looks like you have a typo   your stated apr is = not as you 've written   i ran the numbers that you gave accounting for the typo through the formula at wikipedia and got $ month which will round to $ for most payments   that does n't match the number that you computed or the number on your til maybe you also the result of your calculation i agree that it 's unlikely that this is just a calculation error by the mortgage company although i would n't completely rule it out   are you paying anything else like a property tax escrow   i did n't pull a blank til form to see what might go into the monthly payment line that you showed but in many cases you do pay more than just principle and interest each month not sure if that gets reflected at that point on the form though

if you are the beneficiary of an annuity you might receive a single sum distribution when the annuity owner dies the amount of this death benefit might be the current cash value of the annuity or some other amount based upon contract riders that the owner purchased the tax on death benefits depends on a number of factors death benefits are taxed as normal income unlike other investments the named beneficiary of a non qualified annuity does not get a step up in tax basis to the date of death however that does n't mean the beneficiary will have to pay taxes on the full amount because the purchaser of the annuity made the investment with after tax dollars only the amount attributable to investment income is taxed but it will be taxed as ordinary income and not enjoy any special capital gains treatment when there is a death benefit that exceeds the value of the account that additional amount is also taxed as ordinary income   taxes on annuities depend on several circumstances for more information on distribution of inherited annuities and taxes go to annuities they go into details that could help you even more   one thing that annuities hq points out is if you take the lump sum payout you may be pushed into a higher tax bracket   along with doing research i would also contact a financial advisor

typically there are three ways an acquisition is financed what is used is called the consideration   1 cash existing cash on the balance sheet is used think of it like purchasing something with your debit card   2 stock this a bit more complicated the acquiring company issues new shares and exchanges those shares for shares of the because new shares are issued this can have a effect on the stock price of the acquirer however it can have an accretive effect if enough value between the two companies is realized and/or expected   3 debt basically like taking out a loan    the consideration for a deal is often reported as you read in your article   most deals are a combination of cash stock debt debt is often referred to as cash i.e. if you take out a loan you are essentially receiving cash     when it comes to which is best to use there are quantitative analyses for that with a specific focus on the acquirer 's eps earnings per share post deal   the factors that are considered are the forgone interest on cash the additional interest gained from taking on debt and the effects of issuing new stock there is no right answer for which is best as there are multiple different factors and circumstances involved across m&amp;a deals each company has different borrowing rates and value expected from their deals one big factor is the timing and stock price of both companies during the deal if the acquirer is trading at an all time high and the is at an all time low then perhaps an all stock deal would be advantageous to the buyer    typically companies want to avoid stock deals because they are the most

gold 's value starts with the fact that its supply is steady and by nature it 's durable in other words the amount of gold traded each year the supply and demand is small relative to the existing total stock this acting as a bit of a throttle on its value as does the high cost of mining mines will have yields that control whether it 's profitable to run them a mine may have a $ production cost in which case it 's clear they should run full speed now with gold at $ 1200 but if it were below $ 650 or so it may not be worth it it also has a history that goes back it 's valued because it always was john maynard keynes referred to gold as an archaic relic and i tend to agree you are right the topic is controversial for short periods gold will provide a decent hedge but no better than other financial instruments we are now in an odd time where the stock market is generally flat to where it was 10 years ago and both cash or most commodities were a better choice   look at sufficiently long periods of time and gold fails in my history i graduated college in 1984 and in the summer of 82 played in the commodities market gold peaked at $ 850 or so now it 's $ 1200 50 over 30 years is hardly a of value now is it yet i recall aug 25 1987 when the dow peaked at no i did n't call the top but i did talk to a friend advising that i ignore the short term at 25 with little invested i only concerned myself with long term plans the dow crashed from there but even today just over 18,000 the return has averaged plus dividends a lengthy tangent but important to understand a gold fan will be able to produce his own observation citing that some percent of one 's holding in gold adjusted to maintain a balanced allocation would create more positive returns than i claim for a large enough portfolio that 's otherwise well diversified this may be true just not something i choose to invest in last if you wish to buy gold avoid the hard metal gld trades as 1/10 oz of gold and has a tiny commission as it trades like a stock the buy sell on a 1 oz gold piece will cost you 4 6 that 's no way to invest update 29 years after that lunch in 1987 the dow was at a return of cagr plus dividends another 6 years since this question was asked and gold has n't moved $ and 6 years worth of fees 2.4 if you buy the gld etf from the 82 high of $ 850 to now 34 years the return has a cagr of or after fees to be fair i picked a relative high that $ 850 but i did the same choosing the pre crash high on the dow

the most important thing in my view is flexibility to avoid running into problems one useful thing in the uk would be an arranged overdraft you go to your bank and they 'll agree that you can overdraw your account by a certain number of pounds depending on your income etc it will cost you a very high interest rate but only for each day where you are overdrawn so paying a bill two days before your salary comes in is n't too bad obviously avoid using the overdraft if you can having an overdraft while not using it is free it 's meant for an emergency being regularly overdrawn is expensive but once it is arranged with your bank an arranged overdraft is much much cheaper than bouncing cheques etc and possibly high fees for overdrawing your account and it takes the pressure of you   now things to need before you get a loan again uk the real interest rate that you are paying is called apr that 's the number that counts and that can not be manipulated no payday loans to avoid getting yourself into deep deep trouble no loan sharks obviously if you buy things with interest free credit that 's a included in the price so you pay more and b if you miss paying by one day they 'll hit you with huge interest payments and some will try this intentionally interest rate depends on loan amount i once had to borrow 20 more than i needed because it reduced the interest rate by half the 20 went straight into a savings account credit cards and overdrafts are much more expensive than loans mortgage is again cheaper than a loan usually make sure that you only use money from sources that charge the least amount make sure you pay back regularly so cheap sources stay available to you   just do yourself a favour and if at all possible spend less instead of getting a loan

i 'm not going to tackle the 2nd part of your question as any number of the questions tagged with international transfer should cover you on that there 's no way to transfer an isa into an australian tax free savings account so no need to worry about anything special there do n't forget that the fx rates change quite a bit over time and different methods have varying fees so moving at the wrong time could easily cost you more than the missed interest for the first part it depends one thing you should seriously consider right away is switching your isa money into one paying a better rate check the best buy tables online or in a paper as you can get a lot better than 0.1 on a transfer in even with current depressed rates at least that way you 'll earn more interest while you decide as for when to transfer that 's something you 'll have to calculate for yourself based on your marginal tax rate and your view of how the fx rates will shift if you 're a 40 taxpayer then 2 in an isa is worth the same to you as 3.3 gross do n't forget to consider both your uk and australian tax rates in the year you move as most likely you 'll have to pay the higher of the two the westpac rate looks like you might struggle to beat a decent isa over the course of a year were you a higher rate tax payer oh and do n't forget that you 'll likely loose the tax free status of your isa once you 're an australian tax resident so you 'll need to start paying tax on interest in the isa once you 're out there

are there any other losses that can be expected beyond the above the lender may have to invest some money into the house in order to get it in shape to sell also while the lender possesses the house they are liable to the property taxes and possibly utilities are there any statutes or pressures to motivate the financial institution to get fair price when the property is sold the lender is motivated to at least break even when selling the property in order to limit losses on their investment this means they are very motivated to seek a higher price but they 're also motivated to sell the property quickly in order to limit their losses due to property taxes usually the lender takes a loss of the investment if foreclosure occurs only 10 percent to 20 percent   of auctioned foreclosed houses did yield a surplus when the lender sells the foreclosed property using a realtor they 're motivated to sell it as quickly as possible so long as they break even in this case there is little motivation to sell the property for a surplus if the property is being sold via auction then time is not a factor and the lender will just sell to the highest bidder

there are multiple reasons why this may have happened 1 i could n't tell in your question whether or not you had already paid off the loan before requesting the rollover but if the loan was defaulted then the $ 9k left in your account is not but is there to pay back the remaining balance on your loan the $ 9k will be treated as income and will be taxed you will receive   a 1099-r detailing the taxes you 'll owe i do n't know why this was n't done when they did your rollover distribution typically it all happens at the same time but it can vary depending on the administrator 2 do you get some type of safe harbor discretionary match or profit sharing contribution if so perhaps this contribution was made after your account was liquidated so now there is residual money in your account and it is treated as a new distribution which incurs a new $ 60 distribution fee 3 stock if some of your investments were in stock these take a few extra days to liquidate typically a tpa recordkeeper would wait until all of the funds are liquidated before issuing the rollover but some companies may be shady and do it separately incurring an additional $ 60 distribution fee if this was the case i would go to your former employer 's hr and tell them what s happening and to start looking for a new 401(k administrator i hope this helps good luck

gt;if banks did not have a big brother to bail them out of loans that went bust whenever they wanted they would be a lot more careful in who they loaned money to     that 's what they became an avenue to offload risk   the reason those banks were making bad loans was the high demand for trading in mortgage backed securities not because freddie and fannie were there they wanted to make those loans anyway so there 'd be more paper to trade if you could transfer half of the risk of a loan you already knew was shitty to another entity but still keep all the profits and fuck around with the derivatives then of course you 'll take full advantage    the intention behind them was to help that margin of people that fell just below the banks historically very high standards for home lending banks seek high profits fannie and freddie were to operate at break even or slim profit but serve a population toward upward economic benefits everyone when the banks lending standards dropped precipitously due to repeal of glass steagall creation of new exotic financial instruments and appalling lack of regulatory enforcement everything kind of went to shit   in my view they 're much more a casualty that 's become a scapegoat than a causal force

here 's an article on it that might help one of the tricky things is that you probably have the value of the vested shares and withheld taxes already on your w-2 this confuses everyone including the irs they sent me one of those audits by mail one year where the issue was they wanted to double count stock compensation that was on both 1099-b and w-2 a quick letter explaining this and they were happy the general idea is that when you first irrevocably own the stock it vests then that 's income because you 're receiving something of value so this goes on a w-2 and is taxed as income not capital gains conceptually you 've just spent however many dollars in income to buy stock so that 's your basis on the stock for tax paid if your employer withheld taxes it should be included in your w-2 in that case you would not separately list it elsewhere

when you buy a house the real estate agent or title company normally draws up a big sheet with all the costs and payments involved there are typically two columns one for amounts paid to or paid by the seller and another for amounts paid to or paid by the buyer who is responsible for what is a legal question this is pretty fixed but it 's very common for the seller to agree to pay some portion of the buyer 's closing costs in any house sale i 've ever been involved in whether as buyer or seller nobody bothers to say which costs the seller is agreeing to pay rather the seller just agrees to a number then somewhere on the sheet of costs there will be a line that says closing costs paid by seller or some such wording and then it shows a minus to the seller and a plus to the buyer or something equivalent depending on how the sheet is organized   the amount is negotiated when you make an offer you 'll say whatever numbers you are prepared to offer like i offer to pay $ 100,000 for the house seller to pay $ 3,000 of closing costs and whatever other conditions seller to repair the leak in the roof whatever it makes sense for the seller to pick up some share of the closing costs because the seller normally walks away with cash in hand while the buyer is struggling to come up with enough cash to make a down payment and pay all the closing costs i.e. the seller probably can afford to give up some cash while the buyer may be struggling to come up with cash the only costs i can think of that i 've had before closing day are a earnest money b inspection c credit check or application fee to bank earnest money is applied to the purchase price at closing so it 's pretty much a moot point the application fee is a potential deal breaker i 've never heard of a seller agreeing to pay this but i guess they could but if you ca n't get the loan you probably wo n't buy the house so the seller would be out money for nothing   everything else is normally paid on closing day they total up all the costs and all the money floating around and at the end the seller gets one check that is the net of everything and the buyer writes one check that is the net of everything and the realtor or title company deals with getting the money to the right people so there 's normally no issue of paying things as they come up you do it all at once

the appropriate amount of cash bonds to hold will be largely a matter of opinion but here are the general reasons why having at least some is a good idea cash is very liquid and bonds are often mostly liquid this means you can access them very quickly without taking on losses to get the most liquidity out of your bonds you can do what is called laddering this means that you take out different bond amounts with different maturity dates and periodically renew them on a schedule so that you always have some bonds maturing which you can access without paying an interest penalty you can look this term up online for more details cash and bonds are low risk if you have absolutely no low risk assets then in the event of say a market crash you may have no savings to fall back on by owning some bonds and some equities you are able to earn a modest return without being too risky however note that some bonds are just as risky as equities any bond which pays an abnormally high interest rate does so because the entity backing the repayment government company whomever is thought to not be guaranteed to be able to do so the 25 figure given by your author is his opinion on the appropriate mix of cash bonds to equities but there are many views on the matter consider that any rule of thumb in personal finance should be for general consideration only

a simple way to ask the question might be to say why ca n't i just use the same trick with my own shares to make money on the way down why is borrowing someone else 's shares necessary to make the concept a viable one why is n't it just the inverse of going long a simple way to think about it is this to make money by trading something you must buy it for less than you sell it for   this applies to stocks like anything else   if you believe the price will go up then you can buy them first and sell them later for a higher price   but if you believe the price will go down the only way to buy low and sell high is to sell first and buy later   if you buy the stock and it goes down any sale you make will lose you money i 'm still not sure i fully understand the point of your example but one thing to note is that in both cases i.e. whether you buy the share back at the end or not you lost money   you say that you made $ 5 on the share price dropping but that is n't true at all you can see in your example that your final account balance is negative in both cases   you paid $ 20 for the shares but only got $ 15 back you lost $ 5 or in the other version of your example paid $ 20 and got back $ 5 plus the depreciated shares if you had bought the shares for $ 20 and sold them for say $ 25 then your account would end up with a positive $ 5 balance that is what a gain would look like   but you ca n't achieve that if you buy the shares for $ 20 and later sell them for less at a guess you seem to be confusing the concept of making a profit with the concept of cutting your losses   it is true that if you buy the shares for $ 20 and sell them for $ 15 you lose only $ 5 whereas if you buy them for $ 20 and sell for $ 10 you lose the larger amount of $ 10   but those are both losses   selling early as the price goes down does n't make you any money it just stops you from losing more money than you would if you sold later

my concern is that just moving the balance will make you feel like you 've accomplished something when you really have n't   sure you 'll save on interest but that just reduces the rate at which you 're bleeding and does n't heal the wound   it 's entirely likely that you 'll feel freed by the reduced balance on the original card ignore the transferred balance since you are n't paying any interest on it and soon you 'll have two cards that are maxed out i would instead look at getting your expenses under control make sure you have the start of an emergency fund 1 2k depending on your family situation if you are single start with 1k if you have kids bump it up to 2k or maybe a little more just to avoid charging any expenses get on a written budget and do n't spend any money in the next month that is not accounted for   then you can figure out how much you can afford to put towards the credit card   that will also tell you how much interest you 're going to pay    the only way i would recommend the balance transfer is if the interest savings after the balance transfer fee reduced the time it takes to pay off the card by two or more months since one month is n't going to make a big difference interest wise and you immediately cancelled the original card and cut up both cards including the new one making payments by mail or online   other than that the interest saved after the balance transfer fee probably is n't worth the risk of being in a worse situation on the other side

when you buy a call option you transfer the risk to the owner of the asset they are risking losing out on gains that may accumulate in addition to the strike price and paid premium for example if you buy a $ 25 call option on stock xyz for $ 1 per contract then any additional gain above $ 26 per share of xyz is missed out on by the owner of the stock and solely benefits the option holder

if you owe a lot of money more then $ 500 or $ 1000 you will get hit with penalties you will also have to file every quarter the next year that is very painful there is a safe harbor if you make sure that you have withheld more money than your taxes from the previous year the information you provided is not enough for me to give specific advice but here is a hint right after you file this year use turbo tax to determine what changes you can make to your withholding to minimize any excess withholding

in america the government is ours   we vote for all the people in it   it is within our power to make it what we want and it is our responsibly to keep it functioning properly   we have been doing a poor job for the past couple of generations but we have the ability to turn it around   to restrict the power of the us government is to reduce the power of the american people to determine the kind of society we want to live in   i do not want to live under the tyranny of huge multinational corporations who only care that i work and consume   corporations have n't always owned and controlled the government to the degree they do today   they have always had influence and that is not necessarily a bad thing   for the past 40 years as we have been gradually moving towards a more laissez faire philosophy government corruption has gotten worse and worse   tax cuts for the uber rich blanket free trade agreements with 3rd world countries and deregulation have caused corporations get much larger and far more powerful than they were a generation or two ago   so much money has flooded into washington because of these bad policy decisions that it will be very hard to undo   but the only way to undo the damage caused by supply side economics is for the american people to decide they want something else and to vote accordingly

wait hold on is this good news or bad news i did nt see any information if these were good jobs we all know some jobs a total shit so did we add shit jobs do these jobs pay a liveable wage what s the quality of life these jobs will create will these jobs provide health care or require any government assistance will these jobs create greater social service because that would nt be anything to celebrate at face value these jobs could actually increase everyones taxes due to the fact the government supports low wage earners via food stamps health care etc i believe this headline would hold a lot more weight if we had a better understanding of the facts

i came across this € 1000 coin which can actually be bought for € 1000 it contains 17 grams of gold worth about € 600 today is there any downside to this over keeping € 1000 in regular banknotes these are medallions collectibles non circulating or whatever name one wants to call it a coin has a value because the central banks says so that enforces everyone accept it at that this as such is not a coin banks or anyone else will not accept this for face value   these are of interest and certain people do collect such items they are collectibles to the extent the price is dependent on general interest in future on such items and quantity available so if future the price may go up much higher than the gold price or may retain its gold price mints make these with intricate design best finish limited quantity to charge the additional premium if you are not into stay away a better options is buy simple gold bullion of similar weight for actual gold price

depending on your local laws such a layoff may be an unlawful act if the whole purpose of the lay off is to strip the employees of their rsu 's the employer may be liable and get sued however you have to check that with a lawyer licensed in your jurisdiction in many places there are no laws against this in any case you may claim that there was no good faith just cause in the action and still sue the employer mere threat of a lawsuit may the whole deal so i suggest the employees to lawyer up and talk to the employer that by the way will require to create a union a representative body for the employees in some places that by itself may be a just cause for termination in some extremely anti union jurisdictions i would guess if there were some they would be in the us bottom line talk to a lawyer

every plan administrator has their own procedures for rollovers in any case you would start by browsing their website or calling them seeking information on rollover you will need to arrange it with both your current and prior administrators usually the administrator will send the money directly to your current plan provider keeping you out of the chain and minimizing any risks of tax complications it may happen though that they have to send the check to you in that case you will have a limited amount of time to provide it to your current plan

as mhoran said the risks of buying a bankrupt company are huge and even successful bankruptcy do n't involve keeping the same stock for instance the gm bankruptcy was resolved by the company more or less selling all its valuable assets brands factories inventory to a new version of itself using that money to pay off what liabilities it could and then dissolving the new company then issued new stock and you had to buy the new stock to see it rise the old stock became worthless aa could have gone the same way delta could have bought it out of bankruptcy and consumed it outright with any remaining shareholders being paid off at market value that 's probably the best the market was hoping for instead the deal is a much more equal merger brings a very large airport network and aircraft fleet to the table and delta brings its cash an also considerable fleet and network and a management team that 's kept that airline solvent the stockholders therefore expect to be paid off at a much higher per share price either in a new combined stock in delta stock or in cash

as someone who 's done quit a bit of home improvement and seen positive roi i can speak from some personal experience   all of this assumes you do the unskilled labor yourself and shop around for relatively cheap plumbers electricians etc first never underestimate the resale value added by a can of paint   this assumes you have or know someone with a good sense of style that can help improve the aesthetics of the home significantly   white walls can be so boring to homebuyers and so many of them ca n't see through the of an inch of white paint second look for shortcomings in the house as is anyway these are some common upgrades   the big thing is to find something you are reasonably comfortable doing yourself and that you will enjoy   realize that if you 're new to this most projects will cost twice what you budget and take four times as long   the pride of having done it yourself and put in the sweat equity makes it worth it though usually edit to better answer your modified question i 'm adding to my answer   so if i understand it your question is now at what rate is it sane to invest in our house vs. outside investments   this is really just a matter of balancing risk vs. lifestyle   with most upgrades there is no financial benefit to investing in upgrading your home now vs. 5 years from now right before you sell   you could be making 10 in mutual funds until then and then invest in the upgrades right before you sell   there is obviously a physical limit to how fast you can do these improvements yourself but front loading this now at the beginning of your timeframe as opposed to the end is not an investment decision it is a lifestyle decision   not saying do n't do it but do n't rationalize it to yourself as we 're saving money by doing this now   maybe use the rationalization we want to enjoy these upgrades and not just add them before we move out one exception to that i 'd plant any trees now and make sure they have a good water supply   good trees take a while to grow and doing that sooner rather than later will help

you 're saying that you 're thinking of keeping 35 in cash if you expect the market to plummet in the next few months and then head up again this would be a smart strategy hold on to a bunch of cash then when the market hits bottom buy then as it goes back up collect your profits in practice the long term trend of the market has been up for as long as there has been a stock market bear markets tend to be relatively short usually just a few months or at most a year or two before the market gets back to where it was if you are smart enough to predict when there will be a decline and how long it will last you 're smarter than 99 of the professionals never mind the amateurs personally i keep only trivial amounts of cash let 's see right now about 2 of my assets if you 're more active in managing your retirement accounts if you really watch the market on a monthly basis or more frequently and adjust your assets according it would make sense to keep a larger cash reserve and use it when the market goes down but for the average person i think it would be a big mistake to keep anywhere near 35 of your assets in cash in the long run you 'll probably lose out on a lot of potential growth

plenty   following are just a few for things like resp and rrsp which have an end date as you or your children age you should be migrating to less speculative investments and more secure ones   when children are young for example you might be in a growth type fund   later on you would likely want to switch that to an income fund which is also more conservative and less likely to lose principal are you getting the best benefit from your credit cards   is there another card with benefits that you would get more back from using   is that fee based air miles card worth it   is cash back better for you if you have regular investment withdrawals can you increase them   do you like the plan they are going in to   similarly look over any other long term debt repayment   student loans car loans mortgage   what is coming up this year what is ending   if for example car payment will end how will you earmark that money so it just does not disappear into general funds while you could go over things like these more often once a year should be plenty often to keep tabs and not obsess good luck

my preferred method of doing this is to get a bank draft from the us in euros and then pay it into the french bank my countries are canada and uk but the principle is the same the cost of the bank draft is about $ 8 so very little more than the atm method if you use bigger amounts it can be less overall cost the disadvantage is that a bank draft takes a week or so to write and a few days to clear so you would have to plan ahead i would keep enough money in the french account for one visit and top it up with a new bank draft every visit or two

at least for liquid markets the downside of being a market maker is what we call negative selection specifically if you 're both bid and offered in a market trying to collect your spread then as the market goes up you 'll tend to sell the whole way up and vice versa so if you 're not smart about it you can end up losing a lot of money    being a good market maker then involves either being able to smarter about when to be aggressively bid and offered and when to pull back or being able to hedge them quickly before they really hurt you the first probably would require more sophisticated algorithms while the second requires good speed and execution strategies
