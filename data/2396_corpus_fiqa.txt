there has been almost no inflation during 2014 2015 do you mean rental price inflation or overall inflation housing price and by extension rental price inflation is usually much higher than the basket of goods cpi or numbers the low levels of these two indicators are mostly caused by technology oil and food price deflation at least in the us uk and europe other inflation my slightly biased i 've just moved to a new rental property and entirely london centric empirical evidence suggests that 5 is quite a low figure for house price inflation and therefore also rental inflation your landlord will also try to get as much for the property as he can so look around for similar properties and work out what a market rate might be within tolerances of course and negotiate based on that for the new asked price i could get a similar apartment in similar condos with gym and pool this one does n't have anything or in a way better area closer to supermarkets restaurants etc suggests that you have already started on this and that the landlord is trying to artificially inflate rents if you can afford the extra 5 and these similar but better appointed places are at that price why not move it sounds like the reason that you are looking to stay on in this apartment is either familiarity or loyalty to the landlord so it may be time to benefit from a move

absolutely yes just because a lease provides an option for renewal does not mean that a tenant can not try to re negotiate for better terms you should always negotiate the rent and start this conversation as soon as possible offer to pay three rent in advance of course if you have enough means

i think people are missing the most obvious thing   the yearly rate increases are just part of the landlord and it is good business for them   my grandmother owned several large apartment complexes   she would raise rates for any resident that had been there between 1 5 years by 5 7 a year   even when she had vacancies and property values did n't go up   for the following reasons so yes it is not only normal but just part of the business   if there are better apartments for less money i suggest you move there   soon those other apartments will even out and if they are better they will be much more   so if you see a gap take advantage of it   if you would rather stay then simply say you will not pay the increase   there is no use arguing about why   the landlord will either be ok with it or say no   probably the biggest factors include whether you will tell other tenants or their perception if you would and how good of a tenant risk they feel you are

if it is true that for the same price you could get a better place or that for a lower price you could get an equivalent place you should do some soul searching to decide what monetary value you would place on the hassle of moving to such an alternative   you should then negotiate aggressively for a rent that is no more than the rent of the alternative place plus your hassle costs and if the landlord does not meet your price you should refuse to renew your lease and instead move out to an alternative   of course you might also want to double check your research to ensure you really can get such a good alternative and that your new landlords wo n't try a similar bait and switch and force you to move again in a year barring local ordinances such as rent control laws i do n't think it 's worth it to worry about whether the increase is normal   if you can get a better deal somewhere else then what your landlords are asking is too much   if you have a good relationship with them on a personal level you may be able to tell them this in a nice way and thus get them to make a more reasonable offer   otherwise the landlords will learn that their expectations are unreasonable when all their tenants move out to cheaper places
# 513775
should you negotiate yes what harm can it possibly do the landlord is unlikely to come back and say because you tried to negotiate i 'm putting the rent up by 10 instead or to evict a paying tenant merely because they tried to negotiate is the proposed rent increase normal yes landlords will generally try to get as high a rent as they can
# 397749
there could be a number of reasons for a rent increase the only information i can offer is how i calculate what rent i will charge the minimum i would ever charge per unit mortgage payment + water number of units this number is the minimum because it 's what i need to keep afloat   keep in mind these are ballpark numbers the target rent mortgage payment + water number of i mark up the price 60 for a few reasons first the building needs a repair budget that money has to come from somewhere second i want to put away for my next acquisition and third i want to make a profit these get me close to my rental price but ultimately it depends on your location and the comparables in the area if my target rent is 600 a month but the neighbors are getting 700 800 for the same exact unit i might ask more it also depends on the types of units some of my buildings all of the units are identical other buildings half of the units are bigger than the other half so clearly i would n't charge a equal amount for them ultimately you have to remember we 're not in the game to lose money i know what my renters are going to pay before i even put an offer in on a building because that 's how i stay in business it might go up over the years but it will always outpace my expenses for that property
# 237784
yes automatic rate increases are typical in my experience and i think it 's very greedy when it 's based on nothing except that your lease is up for renewal which is the situation you are describing yes you should negotiate i 've had success going to the apartment manager and having this conversation   make these points conclude i am not open to a rate increase though i will sign a renewal at the same rate i am paying now this conversation makes me very uncomfortable but i try not to show it i was able to negotiate a lease renewal at the same rate this way in a large complex in sacramento ca   if you are talking to a manager and not an owner they will probably have to delay responding until they can check with the owner the key really is that they want to keep units rented especially when units are staying empty empty units are lost income for the owner it is the other empty units that are staying empty that are the huge point in your favor
# 584890
what happened in the past the rent you paid last year is in the past   you should n't be concerned with the percentage increase but with whether you want that apartment at the new rent for the coming year   if your rent had been half what it was last year and the new proposal were to double it you would be outraged at the doubling but really you got a steal last year    going forward you have three options   you can accept the new rent you can decline it and move or you can try to negotiate a better rate   it sounds like the landlord is hoping you will find the hassle of moving enough to accept the new rent   if you do negotiate you should know what your preferred alternative is which you should use to set your point   if you make a it is often useful to show what a comparable apartment is renting for to justify the rent you suggest

at my farm our turkeys live their entire lives outdoors on pasture except for the first three weeks when they need artificial heat to survive they do n't receive any medications or antibiotics and we slaughter them ourselves without pumping their full of whatever pumps into their turkeys   we charge $ 3.75 a pound so our birds range from about $ 45 to $ 75   what ends up being really expensive are heritage turkeys   these are old fashioned breeds that gain weight very slowly and have a huge feed to weight ratio   they take much more feed and labor for the same amount of weight and so are often upwards of $ 6.00 a pound   we do n't raise them because one of our goals is raising good food that normal folks can afford   also they can fly which throws our whole raise them outdoors system into logistical chaos   naturally raised turkeys are there to be had but you have to look for them   check out eat to find a pasture based farm in your area that raises turkeys   good luck

it can be a money laundering scheme the stranger gives you cash for free at first then proposes to give you more but this time asks you to spend a fraction of it like 80 so on his side the money comes from a legitimate source   so you do it because after all you get to keep the rest of it and it is free money but you are now involved in something illegal   having money for which you can not tell the origin is also something highly suspicious you will not pay tax on it and the fiscal administration of your country might give you a fine customs might also be able to confiscate the money if they suspect it comes from an illegal source

most of the time your tax only reduces by the current marginal rate meaning you would only reduce your tax by 28 to 25 depending on which part of the bracket you 're in however in the area around 100k there are cases where reductions will have more of a marginal effect than that   you 'll never reduce it more than 100 but you can reduce it by 35 40 despite being in the 25 bracket that is because of certain deductions and credits which phase out beginning around things like the ira deduction the child tax credit childcare tax credit and similar   since many of them phase out in this range additional dollars cost you your marginal rate 25 plus the percentage of the credits or deductions which phase out here which might bring you up another 10 or so

most bond etfs have switched to monthly dividends paid on the first of each month in an attempt to standardize across the market   for etfs but perhaps not bond mutual funds as suggested in the above answer interest does accrue in the nav so the price of the fund does drop on ex date by an amount equal to the dividend paid a great example of this dynamic can be seen in a bond etf holding floating rate corporate bonds   as you can see in this screenshot the nav has followed a sharp up and down pattern almost like the teeth of a saw this is explained by interest accruing in the nav over the course of each month until it is paid out in a dividend dropping the nav sharply in one day the effect has been particularly pronounced recently because the floating coupon payments have increased significantly benchmark interest rates are higher and mark to market changes in credit spreads of the constituent bonds have been very muted

to add to @keshlam 's answer slightly a stock 's price is made up of several components the only one of these that is known even remotely accurately at any time is the book value on the day that the accounts are prepared even   completed cashflows after the books have been prepared contain some slight unknowns as they may be reversed if stock is returned for example or reduced by unforeseen costs   future cashflows are based on amongst other things how many sales you expect to make in the future for all time exercise for the reader how many iphone will apple sell in even known future cashflows have some risk attached to them customers may not pay for goods a supplier may go into liquidation and so need to change its invoicing strategy etc estimating the risk on future cashflows is highly subjective and depends greatly on what the analyst expects the exact economic state of the world will be in the future investors have the choice of investing in a risk free instrument this is usually taken as being modelled by the 10 year us treasury bond that is guaranteed to give them a return to invest in anything riskier than the risk free instrument they must be paid a premium over the risk free return that they would get from that the risk premium is related to how likely they think it is that they will not receive a return higher than that rate calculation of that premium is highly subjective if i know the management of the company well i will be inclined to think that the investment is far less risky or perhaps riskier than someone who does not for example since none of the factors that go into a share price are accurately measurable and many are subjective there is no right share price at any time let alone at time of ipo each investor will estimate these values differently and so value the shares differently and their trading based on their ever changing estimates will move the share price to an level in comments to @keshlam 's answer you ask if there is enough information to work out the share price if a company buys out the company before ipo dividing the price that this other company paid by the relative ownership structure of the firm would give you an idea of what that company thought that the company was worth at that moment in time and can be used as a for market price but it will not and can not accurately represent the market price as other investors will value the firm differently by estimating the criteria above differently and so will move the share price based on their valuation

yep all of these are correct   i sat down and thought about the money ca n't buy happiness line and at the end of the day it 's only correct in the strictest sense no nobody is selling joy at the market you ca n't go down to the 7 11 and pick up a box of   you know what though money allows you to do pretty much whatever does make you happy derive joy from picking on a well if you 're fucking filthy rich you can buy dozens of 'em and do it all damned day if you want okay but what if you 're depressed what if it 's a brain chem thing well if it can be fixed you can get it fixed with money doctors prescriptions etc all cost   i thought about it for a good while and came to the conclusion that while having tons of money may not reduce the amount of problems i have it may actually increase them the vital difference is that none of the problems i 'd have if i were rich are actually terribly important every problem i could think of ended up being stuff like well i 'd have to do a lot of research to figure out exactly the best place to build my fuck off huge house or gee would it be better to rebuild my vehicle to my exact specs or simply spend time finding an expert and giving them a guideline and hoping it turns out at the end of the day if you have a shit ton of money you can always just tell your troubles to take a flying leap and worry about them another time ignore them forever or pay someone else to deal with them there are a few exceptions but every single fucking one of them would be worse if you were n't loaded

gambling is never a wise investment even assuming that the stated odds are correct there can be multiple winners and the jackpot is shared between the winners so the individual payout can be significantly less than the total jackpot if i were to take a dollar from you and a dollar from your buddy on the promise that i 'd give the two of you a total of $ 3 back if you both guessed the result of a single fair coin toss would you take the offer note also that the jackpot value is quite misleading it 's the sum of the annual payments and if you reduce that to present value it 's significantly less

dollar cost averaging is a great strategy to use for investment vehicles where you ca n't invest it in a lump sum a 401 k is perfect for this you take a specific amount out of each paycheck and invest it either in a single   fund or multiple funds or some programs let you invest it in a brokerage account so you can invest in virtually any mutual fund or stock with annual or semi annual re balancing of your investments dollar cost averaging is the way to invest in these programs if you have a lump sum to invest then dollar cost averaging is not the best way to invest imagine you want to invest 10 k and you want to be 50 bonds and 50 stocks under dollar cost averaging you would take months to move the money from 100 cash to 50/50 bonds stocks while you are slowly moving towards the allocation you want you will spend months not in the allocation you want you will spend way too long in the heavy cash position you were trying to change the problem works the other way also somebody trying to switch from stocks to gold a few years ago would not have wanted to stay in limbo for months obviously day traders do n't use dollar cost averaging if you will will be a frequent trader dca is not the way to go   no particular stock type is better for dca it is dependent on how long you plan on keeping the investment and if you will be working with a lump sum or not edit there have be comments regarding dca and 401ks when experts discuss why people should invest via a 401 k they mention dca as a plus along with the company match many participants walk away with the belief that dca is the best strategy many articles have been written about how to invest an inheritance or tax refund many people want to use dca because they believe that it is good in fact in the last few years the experts have begun to discourage ever using dca unless there is no other way

the long run goal is to eliminate poverty through wealth creation if that makes for some weird new social interactions i 'd say that 's a reasonable cost   i mention comparing to earlier periods simply as a measure of progress to determine whether or not there is a problem that needs correction such as a specific group in society experiencing real wage stagnation or truly anemic growth rates relative to earlier periods it 's the slope of the trend line for each group that i 'd be worried about where linear or exponential is good and logarithmic should indicate a potential crisis   ultimately i believe that it 's not a persons absolute circumstances that matter but the rate at which those circumstances are improving throughout their lives that most strongly affects their subjective well being but that 's just my theory   as for real estate costs you 're absolutely correct that this is a problem but it 's as easily problem supply is artificially constrained in most of the us due to the need for explicit government permission in the form of building permits and zoning laws in order to build new units basic economics says that when supply is artificially restricted prices will rise   in areas where government is restrictive such as san francisco prices rise sharply in places where government is more like houston prices remain much more reasonable

if you pay 20 tax now and none later or if you pay no tax now and 20 later it does n't make a difference   mathematically it 's the same you have to guess about which tax rate now vs later will be higher for you in order for you to make the best choice   predicting tax rates 40 years in advance is hard   everybody pretends like they can do this accurately i would suggest going half and half if you have 20k and put half in pre tax 10k in and half in post tax only 8k in you end up with 18k total in which is right in the middle of where you would be if you went with the whole 20k in either extreme   it would also leave you owing 2k in tax rather than the possible 4k in tax if you had gone with all pre tax when you split down the middle you are guaranteed to have 50 in the right side the side with the best outcome being guaranteed to be 50 on the right side is pretty good compared to maybe being 100 on the wrong side

not trying to be insulting but i would contend your response should be the one in econ 101   why because yours is the theory du jour among business interests and economic commentators in the media the fact is that this brand of free market capitalism rests on a series of impractical assumptions   first is that investors are perfectly rationale of capital   from this that excess capital is invested at all let alone in a productive fashion   next that taxation presumably what is considered high has caused unproductive investing practices when in fact the inverse is true decreases in effective income tax rates personal and corporate combined with the reduction of passive taxes like the estate tax have resulted in the incentive for investors to sit on their capital and do nothing to return it to the system    finally and perhaps most that investing profits back into expansion and worker compensation is misallocation of resources the entire article serves to demonstrate that this line of thinking is a self defeating concept giving precedence to the relatively elite investor class ensures that capital is allocated according to their whims and often times that simply means into their bank accounts this the system   so i do n't expect to change your mind but i would like others to know that what you are saying is widely debunked chicago school nonsense that gets a lot of air time from self serving interests across popular media   a few hours of unbiased research will make this evident it is somewhat ironic that the theory has limited standing academically as it works only in an academic theoretical setting

while i can appreciate you 're coming from a strongly held philosophy i disagree strongly with it   i do not have any 401k or ira i do n't like that you need to rely on government and keep the money there forever a 401k and an ira allows you to work within the irs rules to allow your gains to grow tax free additionally traditional 401ks and iras allow you to deduct income from your taxes meaning you pay less taxes missing out on these benefits because the rules that established them were created by the irs is very very misguided do you refuse to drive a car because you philosophically disagree with speed limits   i am planning on spending 20k on a new car paying cash paying cash for a new car when you can very likely finance it for under 2 means you are loosing the opportunity to invest that money which can conservatively expect 4 returns annually if invested additionally using dealership financing can often be additional leverage to negotiate a lower purchase price   if for some reason you have bad credit or are unable to secure a loan for under 4 paying cash might be reasonable   the best thing you have going for you is your low monthly expenses that is   if early retirement is your goal you should consider housing expenses as a part of your overall plan but i would strongly suggest you start investing that money in stocks instead of a single house especially when you can rent for such a low rate a 3 fund portfolio is a classic and simple way to get a diverse portfolio that should see returns in good years and stability in bad years you can read more about them here you should never invest in individual stocks people make lots of money to professionally guess what stocks will do better than others and they are still very often wrong you should purchase what are sometimes called stocks but are really very large funds that contain an assortment of stocks blended together you should also purchase bonds which again are not individual bonds but a blend of the entire bond market   if you want to be very aggressive in your portfolio go with 100 80 stocks the remainder in bonds if you are nearing retirement you should be the inverse 100 80 bonds the remainder stocks   the rule of thumb is that you need 25 times your yearly expenses including taxes but minus pension or social security income invested before you can retire since you 'll be retiring before age 65 you wo nt be getting social security and will need to provide your own health insurance

you should have separate files for each of the two businesses   the business that transfers money out should write check in its qb file   the business that receives money should make deposit in its qb file in qb you write check even when you make the payment by some other means like ach   neither business should have the bank accounts of the other explicitly represented    on each side you will also need to classify the payment as having originated from gone to some other account to know what 's correct there we 'd need to know why your transferring the money in the first place and how you otherwise have your books established   i think that 's probably beyond the scope of what 's on topic feasible here money into your business from your personal account is probably owner 's equity unless you have something else going on   for example on the s corp you should be paying yourself a salary   if you overpay by accident then you might write a check back to the company from your personal account to correct the mistake   that 's not equity it 's probably a negative expense in some other account that tracks the salary payments

also unless i missed it and someone already mentioned it do keep in mind the impact of these credit cards balances on your credit score over roughly 75 usage on a given credit account reflects badly on your score and has a pretty large impact on how your worthiness is calculated it gives the impression that you are a person that lives month to month on cards etc if you could get both cards down to reasonable balances to where you could begin paying on them regularly and work them down over time that will not only look incredible for your credit report but also immediately begin making your credit worthiness begin to raise due to the fact that you will not have accounts that i 'm assuming here are at very high usage over 75 of your total limit if you have to get one card knocked out just to get breathing room and you 're boxed in here or honestly even if the mental stress is causing you incredible hardship day to day then i suppose blow one card out of the water reassess and start getting to work on that second card i hope this helped i 'm no expert but i have had every kind of luck with credit cards and accounts you could think of so i can only give my experience from the rubber meets the road perspective good luck

this answer comes from my interpretation of publication 590 2011 individual retirement arrangements iras and particularly what are qualified distributions section please consult the sources yourself or with the help of a qualified professional before doing anything first note that due to the rollover loophole you can take out the money and repay it within 60 days missing the deadline would mean paying the taxes on the withdrawal in addition to a 10 penalty as per joetaxpayer 's notes below this applies to the earnings on the account only the contributions themselves can be withdrawn without penalties thanks joe   second you might qualify to withdraw 10k for a qualified first home house purchase qualified in this case would mean first time home purchase by yourself your spouse your child parent or made within 120 days of withdrawal see first home in the above document finally nothing is mentioned about the withdrawal affecting your yearly contribution cap any new money coming into the account is new money counted towards the contribution cap except for the 60 day loophole   to answer your question then you can make up the money only under the first scenario 60 day loophole qualified withdrawals allow you to avoid the penalties but as far as i can tell do not affect the contribution cap there are a few other details that may depend on your age status health etc read the document carefully to see if any of those apply to you

gt the logic behind qe is as follows a central bank which alone has the power to create and print money wants to spur inflation so that companies will be encouraged to borrow money and invest it creating jobs   that is not the logic of qe   the logic is that assets must remain inflated enough for banks to survive and the rich with the trading profits   made by trading ahead of central banks qe will pump up other assets with their cashflow and support banking solvency and profitability as they participate directly in the bond profits and indirectly by having their loans secured by general assets paid back due to asset inflation and stability   there was absolutely no honest hope of qe trickling down to the productive economy   no reason for new production as its only effect is a few at the top that can afford bigger cars and homes   bank stability helps jobs much better than bank failures but its more about keeping investment loan flowing than about increasing production investment demand

let 's say a stock trades at $ 100 right now and you can buy a $ 100 call option when you buy the call option and the money you paid is gone one of two things can happen the share price goes up or the share price goes down   if the share price goes up you profit if the share price goes down you do n't lose because once the shares are below $ 100 you do n't exercise the call option and you do n't lose any money   so if you have a share that is rock solid at $ 100 you do n't make money if you have a share where the company owner took some ridiculous risk and the shares could go to $ 200 or the company could go bankrupt then you have a 50 chance to make $ 100 and a 50 chance to not lose anything that 's much more preferable

none of what i say is advice directed to you it is how i would continue to analyse the situation you have were it mine first off i prefer to work in more than possibilities   saying that paying down the mortgage makes sense as i can calculate the amount i will save i also believe that rate rises are coming in the future based on the talk from the so any money i pay off now means guaranteed less interest to pay in the future also the lower my loan to value ratio the better lower interest rates i can receive in the mortgage market if i do not want to work until retirement age it 'd be nice to have as few bills as possible in the decade or so prior to retirement age i could then do early retirement or part time work in the run up to retirement i could use my savings to fund life until retirement pays out i 'd be aiming to put 15 of my gross income into future investing using isas to build up a savings pot taking advantage of retirement products that way all the money is not tied to a normal retirement age before it can accessed and it 's not by future greedy government taxation any income leftover above the 15 i 'd be throwing at the mortgage taking advantage of the 10 overpay window remortgaging as ltv comes down in theory overpaid mortgage equity is money that could still be accessed provided house prices do n't decline and remortgaging is a possibility so in short i 'd follow a plan along these lines of logic 1 make sure i have 4 6 months of living expenses as a rainy day fund insulate myself from fluctuations in my financial situation 2 put away 15 of annual gross income towards future saving isas first pension second 3 overpay the mortgage and look to remortgage as ltv drops when ltv 60 look to lock in to a longer term fix eg 2 year fixes at 90 ltv 5 year fixes at 60 4 reassess steps 2 3 as life happens circumstances change work fluctuates etc 5 once the mortgage is paid off build as much wealth as possible isas first then non tax efficient savings products aim for keeping expenses down and raising my savings rate as much as possible your analysis was thorough and shows you are thinking through consequences never forget to factor in the risk of carrying debt having no low debt as you get older means there 's more income left to build wealth ignore the american view of carrying debt for life and trusting investments to outperform the debt you have to pay monthly to keep that debt around and it ai n't a pet

i thought the other answers had some good aspect but also some things that might not be completely correct so i 'll take a shot as noted by others there are three different types of entities in your question   the etf spy the index spx and options contracts first let 's deal with the options contracts   you can buy options on the etf spy or marked to the index spx   either way options are about the price of the etf index at some future date so the local min and max of the underlying symbol generally will not coincide with the min and max of the options   of course the closer the expiration date on the option the more closely the option price tracks its underlying directly   beyond the difference in how they are priced the options market has different liquidity and so it may not be able to track quick moves in the underlying although there 's a reasonably robust market for option on spy and spx specifically second let 's ask what forces really make spy and spx move together as much as they do   it 's one thing to say spy is tied to spx but how   there are several answers to this but i 'll argue that the most important factor is that there 's a notion of authorized participants who are players in the market who can create shares of spy at will   they do this by accumulating stock in the constituent companies and turning them into the market maker   there 's also the corresponding notion of redemption by which an authorized participant will turn in a share of spy to get stock in the constituent companies see and meanwhile spx is just computed from the prices of the constituent companies so it 's got no market forces directly on it   it just reflects what the prices of the companies in the index are doing of course those companies are subject to market forces key point creation redemption is the real driver for keeping the price aligned   if it gets too far out of line then it creates an arbitrage opportunity for an authorized participant   if the price of spy gets too high compared to spx and therefore the constituent stocks an authorized participant can simultaneously sell short spy shares and buy the constituent companies stocks   they can then use the redemption process to close their position at no risk   and vice versa if spy gets too low now that we understand why they move together why do n't they move together perfectly   to some extent information about fees slight differences in composition between spy and spx over time etc do play   the bigger reasons are probably that a there are not a lot of authorized participants b there are a relatively large number of companies represented in spy so there 's some actual cost and risk involved in trying to quickly buy sell the full set to capture the theoretical arbitrage that i described and c redemption creation units only come in pretty big blocks which complicates the issues under point b. you asked about dividends so let me comment briefly on that too   the dividend on spy is more or less passing on the dividends from the constituent companies i think not completely sure that the market maker deducts its fees from this cash so it 's not a direct pass through   but each company pays on its own schedule and spy does not make a payment every time so it 's holding a corresponding amount of cash between its dividend payments   this is factored into the price through the creation redemption process   i do n't know how big of a factor it is though

a letter of credit is commonly used by importers who want to ensure that their product is shipped before paying the exporter the exporter has a guarantee that the payment for the goods will be received once the shipment has been made   it is used to resolve a game theory type situation for example you are buying a car from china for $ 40,000 usd the exporter of the car asks for the money before he will ship the car but if you give him the money then he has no incentive aside from legal pressures to ship the car instead you sign a letter of credit for the transaction which basically sends your payment to the exporters bank but puts a hold on it until the exporter proves that he has shipped the car and proved that he has insured the shipment against damages

a bank is a technology that allows society to consume now at the expense of later   think about it this way to consume later at the expense of now all you have to do is save your stuff if you want to eat pizza in a year you can buy a bunch of pizza now freeze it then eat it a year later   or you can hide money under your mattress now and buy pizza a year later from now   but what if you want to eat pizza now but you do n't have the money to buy it well you 're stuck there 's no time travel you ca n't go into the future and get resources from your future self to buy the pizza now with   well you could go to your wealthy friend who has a lot of pizza and say hey if you give me pizza money now i will pay you back with more later except then your ability to get pizza money depends on the whims of some really wealthy people who may not like you and what if your wealthy friend really wants to keep all of his pizza there is nothing you can do to get it now   a bank is an entity that can provide the resources purchasing power for you to get your pizza now without anyone in the economy eating less now as a    it does this via what is known as fractional reserve banking which is pretty simple i borrow $ 100 from person a keep $ 10 in reserve then lend the remaining $ 90 to person b who deposits it back into his bank i keep $ 9 of person b 's deposit in reserve then lend $ 89 to person c who deposits it in the bank and so on and so forth the total amount of purchasing power i can create is $ 1000 out of the initial $ 100 i borrowed from person a. as long as all my depositors do n't all try to get their money out at once society can essentially cheat time by pretending there is $ 1000 in existence when in reality there is only $ 100 thus i have increased the purchasing power of the economy now at the expense of later when the loans have to be repaid and no one has to stop consuming now for me to do it   note that this is not the typical academic answer economists will say that banks are mere intermediaries between savers and borrowers    they are wrong banks provide the ability to consume now at the expense of later even if no one in society is saving now*. that means when there is lots of lending going on that we have an economic boom but when there is little to no lending going on and people are paying back their debts we do n't have as much if any growth

johnfx and provide excellent answers researching prices others have paid being up front that you 'll go buy a junker car to hold you over if they wo n't meet your price and playing a few dealerships off of each other are all great tactics in addition i 've got a few points about timing your purchase if you 're not desperate for a car these can really help give you the upper hand in negotiations wait until the end of the month dealerships and individual salespeople usually have quotas that they 're trying to clear and the month is usually the standard cutoff the last time i bought a car the salesman made the mistake of mentioning i do n't usually work but i 'll be in this thursday thursday was the 31st i inferred from this information that he had n't made his quota for the month yet so i came back on the 31st to negotiate and managed to hammer out a pretty good deal wait until about an hour before the dealership closes to show up and shop this gives you enough time to not be obvious about the tactic but you 'll definitely be holding them past their normal quitting time if you do much negotiating the salesman will be   a little more inclined to make a deal so he can get home and have dinner bonus points if you can wait until a month that ends on a friday

are all bonds priced in such a way so that they all return the same amount on average after accounting for risk in other words do risk premiums only compensate for the amount investors might lose no ge might be able to issue a bond with lower yield than say a company from china with no previous records of its presence in the u.s. markets a bond price not only contains the risk of default but also encompasses the of the bond by the issuer with a specific stream of income location of main business any specific terms and conditions in the prospectus or not insurances against default etc else for the same payoff why would you take a higher risk the payoff of a higher risk not only default but term structure e.g. 5 years or 10 years coupon payments bond is more to compensate for the extra risk it entails for the bondholder the yield of a high risk bond will always be higher than a bond with lower risk if you travel back in time to 2011 2012 you would see the yields on greek bonds were in the range of 25 30 to reflect the high risk of a greek default some hedge funds made a killing by buying greek bonds during the eurozone crisis if you go through the efficient frontier theory your argument is a counter statement to it same with individual bonds or a portfolio of bonds you always want to be compensated for the risk you take the higher the risk the higher the compensation and vice versa when investors buy the bond at this price they are essentially buying a risk free bond logically yes but no it is n't and you should n't make that assumption

what you are looking for is a pretty terrible deal for you so i 'd say it does n't exist because there is n't a market for it or nobody has noticed there is a market for it in principle i would happily take the deal you offer from as many people as would let me put the money into treasury bills and take half the profits while doing pretty much nothing     if i had more risk tolerance i would be pretty happy to have half the value of my fund as zero cost investment capital for more aggressive investments   my business would then be a lot like an insurance company without the hassle of selling insurance to get hold of float to invest   also most insurance companies actually lose money on policies but come out ahead by investing the float so an insurance company with zero cost float is quite a good business another answer mentions berkshire hathaway   if you read one of the famous berkshire hathaway annual letters to shareholders and read the section about insurance you 'll see that very low cost float has a large role in that company 's success so back to your end of the deal if the deal is that good for me how good is it for you   i 'd have to double market returns just for you to break even   if you 're smart enough to pick a financial adviser that can beat the market by that much how come you are n't able to pick an investment strategy that ties the market

the advice you were given in the other question was do n't do it the math is not the issue the interest structure is not the issue but there is a significant chance that you could lose money on the deal if you invested your money in a nasdaq heavy position in january 2000 you are still waiting to break even in november of 2013 invest in almost anything in august 2001 and you will be down for a long time invest just before the housing collapse in 2007 and only now returning back to where you were if you take money on a monthly basis and invest it you will be better off   if want to get the loan then set up a stream of money into a bank account to make sure that when payments are due you have the cash to do so when the two years are up you will have cash to repay the loan and no need to sell the investments also if you are a bad judge of investments you wo n't have a problem repaying the loan using a loan to purchase stock reduces your gains and increases your losses use the power of dollar cost averaging by making periodic purchases

this may be a great idea or a very bad one or it may simply not be applicable to you depending on your personal circumstances and interests the general idea is to avoid passive investments such as stocks and bonds because they tend to grow by only a few percent per year instead invest in things where you will be actively involved in some form with those much higher investment returns are common but also the risk is higher and you may be tied down and have to limit the traveling you want to do so here are a few different ways to do that get a college degree but only if you are interested in the field and it ends up paying you well if you are n't interested in the field you wo n't land the $ 100k+ jobs later and if you study early childhood education you may love the job but it wo n't pay enough to make it a good investment of course it also has to fit with your life plans but that might be easier than it seems you want to travel have you thought about anthropology marine biology or pick a reputable hard to get into academic school rather than a oriented and make sure that they have at least some research program that 's one way to distinguish between the for profit schools who tend to be very expensive and land you in low paying jobs and schools that actually lead to a well paying future or if your interest runs more in a different direction start a business your best bet might be to buy a franchise many of the fast food chains such as mcdonalds will let you buy as long as you have around $ 300k net worth most franchises also require that you are qualified it may often make sense to buy not just one store but several in an area you can increase your income and your risk by getting a loan you can probably buy at least $ 5 million worth of franchises with your seed money btw i 'm only using mcdonalds as an example well known fast food franchises used to be money making machines but their popularity may well have peaked there are franchises in all kinds of industries though some tend to be very short term there is a franchise based on selling customer 's stuff on ebay while others can be very long lived many real estate brokerages are actually franchises do be careful which ones you buy some can be a license to print money while others may fail and there are some fraudsters in the franchising market out to separate you from your money advantage over investing in stocks and bonds if you choose well your return on investment can be much higher that 's generally true for any business that you get personally involved in if you do well you may well end up retiring a multimillionaire drawback you will be exposed to considerable risk the investment will be a major chunk of your net worth and you may have to put all your eggs in none basket if your business fails you may lose everything a third option but only if you have a real interest in it get a commercial driver 's license and buy an truck i hear that owner operators can easily make well over $ 100k and that 's with having to pay off a bank loan but if you do n't love culture it is likely not worth doing overall you probably get the idea the principle is to use your funds as seed money to launch something profitable and secure as well as enjoyable for you

realize that not everyone has the ability to save like that   if someone can save money that means they are being paid slightly more than they need to survive   many employers too many take that as a sign that they are over paying their workforce and can easily replace them with people who get paid less since they can also make it work by not setting anything significant aside   a lot of these people are only making it work by relying on credit too   it 's easier than you might think to get trapped in a debt spiral and a lot harder to get out when you ca nt take classes or even re education courses to help you move up

as 's answer recommends do n't give them the money make the checks payable to the credit card company or the bank that issued the student loan so that those debts get repaid for sure or else you run the risk of that money also going the way of all flesh and the debt remaining untouched next file a gift tax return form 709 which is not filed along with form 1040 all go to one irs office as described in the instructions saying that you gave your son and daughter in law gifts of $ 20 k each say and that you want to have $ 12 k excess of each gift over and above the annual exclusion of $ 14 k per recipient count against your combined lifetime estate tax and gift tax exclusion which is currently over $ 5 m so no gift tax needs to be paid as joetaxpayer 's comment points out if you are married and your spouse is willing to join in this then as much as $ 56 k can be given without anyone having to file form 709   then change your will to reduce your son 's and daughter in law 's inheritance by $ if and when they return the money as a gift to you change your will back   by removing the reduction if the repayment is is a lump sum the gift tax return can be used by your son and daughter in law while if they pay back over two years no gift tax return need be filed   so that 's it no interest to be paid by anybody no gift taxes to be paid by anybody no income to be reported on any tax return etc this will work unless you have serious concerns about reducing your combined lifetime estate tax and gift tax exclusion by $ 12 k and if you do you can afford to hire plenty of lawyers to advise you on better strategies

because i feel the answers given do not represent the answer you are expecting i 'd like to re but include more information when you own stock in a company you own some of that company when that company makes profit you usually receive a dividend of those profits if you owned 1 of the company stock you should recieve 1 of the profits if your company is doing well someone might ask to buy your stock the price of that stock is supposed to be worth a value representative of the expected yield or how much of a dividend you 'd be getting   the worth of that is what you 're betting on when you buy the stock if you buy $ 100 worth of coca cola stock and they paid $ 10 as dividend you 'd be pretty happy with a 10 growth in your wealth especially if the banks are only playing 3 so maybe some other guy sees your 10 increase and thinks heck 10 is better than 3 if i buy your stocks even as much as 6 more than they are worth $ 106 i 'm still going to be better off by that extra 1 than i would be if i left it in the bank so he offers you $ 106 and you think awesome i can sell my $ 100 of cola shares now make a $ 6 profit and buy $ 100 worth of some other share i think will pay a good dividend then cola their profits and they only made 2 profit that guy that bought your shares for $ 106 only got a dividend of $ 2 since their worth is still $ 100 and effectively he lost $ 4 as a result he bet on a better than 10 profit and lost out when it did n't hit that now imho while the stock market was supposed to be about buying shares and getting dividends people brokers discovered that you could make far more money buying and selling shares for perceived value rather than waiting for dividends to show actual value especially if you were not the one doing the buying and selling and risk but instead making a 0.4 cut off the difference between each purchase broker fees so tl;dr   many people have lost money in the market to those who made money from them but only the traders and gamblers

technically there could be a true cash fund but the issue is it would need to have some sort of cost associated with it which would mean it would have negative yield or would charge a fee   in some cases this might be preferable to having it invested in cash equivalents which as you note are not cash   it is important to note that there is nothing even cash or physical precious metals that is considered zero risk   they all just have different risks associated with them that may be an issue under certain circumstances   in severe deflation cash is king and all non cash asset classes and debt could go down in value   under severe inflation cash can become worthless one mentioned an alternative of stopping contributing to a 401k and depositing money in a bank but that is not the same as cash either   in recent decades people have been led to believe that depositing your money in the bank means you hold that in cash at the bank   that is untrue   they hold your deposit on their books and proceed to invest loan that money but those investments can turn sour in an economic and financial downturn   the same financial professionals would then remind you that while this is true there is the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic that will make you whole should the bank go under   unfortunately if enough banks went under due to lack of reserves the fdic may be unable to make depositors whole for lack of reserves   in fact they were nearing this during the last financial crisis   the sad thing is that the financial industry is bias against offering what you said because they make money by using your money   fractional reserve banking   you are essentially holding ious from your bank when you have money on deposit with them getting back to the original question you could do some searching and see if there is an institution that would act as a cash depository for physical cash in your ira   there are ira approved ways of holding physical precious metals which is n't all too different of a concept from holding physical cash 401k plans are chosen by your company and often have very limited options available meaning it 'd be unlikely you could ever hold physical cash or physical precious metals in your 401k

let 's start from the premise that the mortgage is something you will have anyway because you need it to live as opposed to say getting a bigger mortgage initially in the expectation of paying it down faster than scheduled in that case i think paying down a mortgage certainly is an investment one with a well defined interest rate and maturity that depends on the precise terms of the mortgage for example i have a uk mortgage that 's fixed for the next two years at about 5 and allows overpayments of £ 500 per month which can be withdrawn at any time so i treat those overpayments as equivalent to savings with quite a nice interest rate especially since mortgage interest is n't tax deductible and so i actually get the full benefit of that interest rate

another factor not mentioned are the rent prices in the area you are looking to live i 'd recommend buying a house of which the total monthly costs mortgage insurance repairs etc are equal to or less than renting a house in the same area if you ca n't find a property for sale that meets this requirement you might actually be better off keep on renting at least for a while because you risk paying too much for your living expenses a second point is if possible to buy when the mortgage interest rates are low and then go for a mortgage with fixed interest and fixed repayments while such a mortgage will be more more expensive than one with variable interest and house prices are higher when mortgage rates are lower future inflation is almost a certainty and if your interest rate was fixed and you are confident that you 'll be able to negotiate salary raises in pace with the inflation then inflation will gradually down the rate between the mortgage payment and your income conversely if interest rates are historically high with no lowering in sight then a variable loan might be more interesting   and do shop around for mortgages there are many banks out there the competition between them is heavy and many banks especially the smaller banks will often be willing to give you a mortgage at better conditions than their competitors

you asked specifically about the roth ira option and stated you want to get the most bang for your buck in retirement   while others have pointed out the benefits of a tax deduction due to using a traditional ira instead i have n't seen anyone point out some of the other differences between roth and traditional such as i agree with your thoughts on using an ira once you maximize the company match into a 401k plan    my reasoning is i personally prefer etfs over mutual funds for the ability to get in and out with limit stop or oco orders at open or anytime mid day if needed   however the price for that flexibility is that you risk discounts to nav for etfs that you would n't have with the equivalent mutual fund   said another way you may find yourself selling your etf for less than the holdings are actually worth   personally i value the ability to exit positions at the time of my choosing more highly than the impact of tracking error on nav also as a final comment to your plan if it were me i 'd personally pay off the student loans with any money i had after contributing enough to my employer 401k to maximize matching   the net effect of paying down the loans is a guaranteed avg 5.3 annually given what you 've said whereas any investments in 401k or ira are at risk and have no such guarantee   in fact with there being reasonable arguments that this has been an excessively long bull market you might figure your chances of a 5.3 or better return are pretty low for new money put into an ira or 401k today   that said i 'm long on stocks still but then i do n't have debt besides my mortgage at the moment   if i were n't so conservative i 'd be looking to maximize my leverage in the continued low rate environment

what 's the primary factor keeping a consumer from handing out fees as as corporations or small businesses do power can an individual or more appropriately what keeps an individual from being able to charge fine or penalize a business if it could be accomplished but at a high cost let 's assume it 's based on principal and not monetary gain and have a legal entitlement to money back   no   you are of course welcome to send your doctor a letter stating that you would like $ 50 to make up for your two hour wait last time around but there 's no legal obligation for him to pay up unless he signed a contract stating that he would do so corporations also can not simply send you a fine or fee and expect you to pay it you must have either agreed to pay it in the past or now agree to pay it in exchange for something in these cases the corporations have the power you have to agree to their rules to play ball    however consumers do have a significant power as well in well competed markets the power to do business with someone else   you do n't like the fee   buy from amazon which offers free shipping on returns   you do n't like paying a no show fee from the doctor   find a doctor without one or with a more forgiving fee or with a low enough that you do n't have to make appointments early   your ability to fine them exists as your ability to not continue to patronize them in some markets though consumers do n't have a lot of power for example cable television or other utilities the fcc has a list of customer service standards which cable companies are required to meet and many states have additional rules requiring penalties for missed or late appointments tougher than that    and in the case of the doctor if your doctor is late find one that is   or try sending him a bill   it does apparently work from time to time particularly if the doctor wants to keep your business

you mentioned three concepts 1 trading 2 diversification 3 buy and hold    trading with any frequency is for people who want to manage their investments as a hobby or profession   you do not seem to be in that category   diversification is a critical element of any investment strategy   no matter what you do you should be diversified   all the way would be best this means owning at least some of every asset out there   the usual way to do this is to own a mutual or index fund   or several   these funds own hundreds or thousands of stocks so that buying the fund instantly diversifies you buy and hold is the only reasonable approach to a portfolio for someone who is not interested in spending a lot of time managing it   there 's no reason to think a buy and hold portfolio will underperform a typical traded portfolio nor that the gains will come later   it 's the assets in the portfolio that determine how aggressive risky it is not the frequency with which it is traded this is n't really a site for specific recommendations but i 'll provide a quick idea   buy a couple of index funds that cover the whole universe of investments   index funds have low expenses and are the cheapest easiest way to diversify   buy a total stock market fund and a total bond fund in a ratio that you like   if you want also buy an international fund   if you want specific tickers and ratios another forum would be just ask your broker or 401(k provider   the bogleheads forum is one that i respect where people are very happy to give and debate specific recommendations at the end of the day responsibly managing your investment portfolio is not rocket science and should n't occupy a lot of time or worry   just choose a few funds with low expenses that cover all the assets you are really interested in put your money in them in a reasonable ish ratio no one knows that the best ratio is and then forget about it

question 2 some financial institutions can provide a way to invest small amounts with low or no cost fees over a period of time like monthly weekly etc   for instance a few brokerages have a way to buy specific etfs for no cost outside of the total expense ratio question 3 when someone says that investing is like buying a lottery ticket they are comparing an event that almost always has at least a 99.9 of no return large winnings to an event that has much better odds   even if i randomly pick a stock in the s&p 500 and solely invest in it over the course of a given year i do not face a 99.9 chance of losing everything so comparing the stock market to a lottery unless a specific lottery has much better odds keep in mind that some of these jackpots have a of no return is not the same   unfortunately nothing truly safe exists risk may but it 's always present instead the probability of something being safe and or generating a return may be true for a given period of time while in another given period of time may become untrue one may argue that holding cash is safer than buying an index fund or stock etf mutual fund etc and financially that may be true over a given period of time for instance the usd beat the spy for the year of 2008   benjamin franklin per a biography i 'm reading argued that the stock market was superior to gold from the context it sounds like the cash of his day because of what the stock market represents essentially you 're betting on the economic output of workers   it 's like saying in an example using oil that i believe that even though oil becomes a rare resource in the long run human workers will find an alternative to oil and will lead to better living standards for all of us do like the roman and empires collapse   yes and would holding the market in those days fail   yes   but cash and gold might be useless too because we would still need someone to exchange goods with and we would need to have the correct resources to do so if everyone in a city owns gold gold has little value   the only safe bet in those days would be farming skill land crops and or livestock because even without trading one could still provide some basic necessities

it certainly seems like you are focusing on the emotional factors   that 's your blind spot and it 's the surest path to a situation where your husband gets to say i told you so   i recommend you steer straight into that blind spot and focus your studies on the business aspects of buying and owning homes    you should be able to do spreadsheets 6 ways from sunday be able to every tax deduction you 'll get as a homeowner know the resale impacts of 1 bathroom vs 2 tell a dirty house from a broken house etc   everybody 's got their favorites mine are a bit dated but i like robert and robert allen 's books   for instance a philosophy of allen 's that i really like never sell   this avoids several problems like the considerable costs of money time and nerves of actually selling a house stress about house prices mistaking your house 's equity for an atm machine and rules for capital gains tax mainly if you rent out the house which vary dramatically by nation   in fact the whole area of taxes needs careful study   there 's another side to the business of home ownership and that 's renting to others   there 's a whole set of economics there and that is a factor in what you buy   now airbnb adds a new wrinkle because there 's some real money there   come to understand that market well enough to gauge whether a duplex or will be a money maker   many regular folk like you have retired early and live off the rental income from their properties   joetaxpayer has an interesting way of looking at the finances of housing if a house does n't make sense as a a rental unit maybe it does n't make sense as a live in either    so learn how to identify those fundamentals the numbers   and get in the habit of evaluating houses   work it regularly until it 's second nature   then yes you 'll see houses you fall in love with partly because the numbers work   it also helps to be handy   it really really changes the economics if you can do your own quality work because you do n't need to spend any money on labor to convert a dirty house into a clean house   and lots of people do and there 's a whole se just for that   there is a huge difference between going down to the local building supply and getting the water pipe you need vs. having to call a plumber   and please deal with local businesses please do n't go to the big box stores their service is they will sell you a gadget salad of junk that does n't work together and i ca n't imagine a colder and less inviting scene to come up as a handy person

as stated tracking fractional transactions beyond 8 decimal places makes no sense in the context of standard stock and mutual fund transactions   this is because even for the most expensive equities those fractional shares would still not be worth whole cent amounts even for account balances in the hundreds of thousands of dollars one important thing to remember is that when dealing with equities the total cost number of shares and share price are all 3 components of the same value   thus if you take 2 of those values you can always calculate the third price shares = cost cost price = shares etc   what you 're seeing in your account 9 decimal places is probably the result of dividing uneven values such as $ invested in a commodity which trades for $ results in shares   most brokerages will round this value off somewhere yours just happens to include more decimal places than your financial software allows since your brokerage is the one who has the definitive total for your account balance the only real solution is to round up or down whichever keeps your total balance in the software in line with the balance shown online

and you have hit the nail on the head of holding gold as an alternative to liquid currency there is simply no way to reliably buy and sell physical gold at the spot price unless you have millions of dollars exhibit a the stock symbol gld is an etf backed by gold its shares are redeemable for gold if you have more than 100,000 shares then you can be assisted by an authorized participant read the fund 's details less than 100,000 shares no physical gold for you with gld 's share price being $ this would mean you need to have over 15 million dollars and be financially solvent enough to be willing to exchange the liquidity of shares and dollars for illiquid gold that you would n't be able to sell at a fair price in smaller denominations the etf trades at a different price than the gold spot market so you technically are dealing with a spread here too exhibit b the futures market accepting delivery of a gold futures contract also requires that you get 1000 units of the underlying asset this means 1000 gold bars which are currently $ each this means you would need $ that you would be comfortable with exchanging for gold bars which in contrast securitized gold gold in an etf for instance can be hedged very easily and one can sell covered calls to negate transaction fees hedge and collect dividends from the fund quickly any spread tax that you encounter from opening the position also leverage no bank would grant you a loan to buy 4 to 20 times more gold than you can actually afford but in the stock market 4 20 times your account value on margin is possible and in the futures market 20 times is pretty normal initial margin and maintenance margin effectively bringing your access to the spot market for physical gold more so within reach caveat emptor

it 's slightly more complicated than that usually a country that was in greece 's situation would be able to use inflation to devalue their currency which would have the effect of lowering the value of the government 's debts and also of making greek prices more competitive in the international market or they could use quantitative easing to inject cheap cash into the economy to help stimulate it because greece is on the euro however they have no control over their own currency and their options are highly limited additionally when you join the eu especially the eurozone that 's supposed to come with additional internal responsibilities but it 's also supposed to come with additional external ones as well greece has a responsibility to get its shit together but the whole point is that more financially stable countries have a responsibility to help them right now that means germany they 're the ones with the greatest control over the euro and they 're away from their duties if the rest of europe did n't want to risk ending up in this position they should n't have let greece into the eurozone

if the market is reasonably efficient why would n't this become a self defeating prophecy with the eventual recovery priced in throughout the whole recession eventual but when   that is a big unknown   in fact even a recovery is not guaranteed   japan 's long deleveraging process is brought up often enough with regard to our current long and painful economic downturn given that the business cycle is n't predictable this is one of the big issues   if things were predictable investing would be easy and there probably would n't be as much money to be made in it owning stocks with a short time horizon is generally a bad idea agreed   however it does not mean that this does not happen   in fact it happens every day   it 's called day trading   also it is possible to make money that way else it would not occur   so strictly speaking whether it is a good or bad idea comes down to specific situations why would anyone buy stocks in the first place if they were n't prepared to ride out a recession if one happens these things tend to happen at the worst times and they have a way of compounding or piling up   e.g. you yourself the economy goes south you find yourself jobless and unable to pay the mortgage you are forced to liquidate some of your positions because you need cold hard cash benjamin graham is widely quoted to have stated that the stock market is a voting opinion machine in the short term and a weighing fact machine in the long term   this may not feel very satisfying to you but it is just the way it is while the dissemination of information may be relatively efficient the interpretation of that information is quite variable   it is not easy to put a number to most events   by put a number i mean determine the impact to the balance sheet it is a complicated system with many inputs and many actors which have varying goals   while there may be an effective like approach to investing the markets can not actually be simplified to buy low sell high in practice   or more specific to your question buy and hold is a simple idea that is not necessarily easy to implement prompted by joetaxpayer 's comment i went searching for one of my favorite quotes regarding the markets markets can remain irrational a lot longer than you and i can remain solvent john maynard keynes and i came across this one which i think applies quite well to this question the long run is a misleading guide to current affairs in the long run we are all dead john maynard keynes

thanks for replying i think we are talking at cross purposes though in your original example you were talking terms of a promise to pay at a future time in that example the asset might be destroyed but the promise to pay would still be binding under typical laws of obligations and so a court could enforce the to pay unless perhaps the promise was itself eg by being contingent on the asset the apples being harvested ie not being destroyed so my question was really whether such a contingent promise really amounts to creating new money as is suggested by the original example i do n't see a promise of this nature can be akin to creating money it is a new bargain entered into by two or more parties

the main reason for paying your mortgage off quickly is to reduce risk should a crisis happen   if you do n't have a house payment you have much higher cash flow every month and your day to day living expenses are much lower so if an illness or job loss happens you 'll be in a much better position to handle it you should have a good emergency fund in place before throwing extra money at the mortgage so that you can cover the bigger surprises that come along there is the argument that paying off your mortgage ties up cash that could be used for other things but you need to be honest with yourself would you really invest that money at a high enough rate of return to make up your mortgage interest rate after taxes   or would you spend it on other things   if you do invest it how certain are you of that rate of return   paying off the mortgage saves you your mortgage interest rate guaranteed finally there is the more intangible aspect of what it feels like to be completely debt free with no payments whatsoever   that feeling can be a game changer for people and it can free you up to do things that you could never do when you 're saddled with a mortgage payment every month

risk is reduced but is n't zero the default risk is still there the issuer can go bankrupt and you can still loose all or some of your money if restructuring happens if the bond has a callable option the issuer can retire them   if conditions are favourable for the issuer you can still loose some of your investment callable schedule should be in the bond issuer 's prospectus while issuing the bond if the issuer is in a different country that brings along a lot of headaches of recovering your money if something goes bad i.e. forex rates can go up and down ytm when the bond was bought was greater than risk free deposit rates has to be greater than the risk free rate because of the extra risk you are taking reinvestment risk is less because of the short term am assuming 2 3 years at max but you should also look at the coupon rate of your bond if it is n't a zero coupon bond and how you invest that would it be ideal to hold the bond till maturity irrespective of price change it always depends on the current conditions you can not be sure that everything is fine so it pays to be vigilant check the health of the issuer any adverse circumstances and the overall economy as a whole as you intend to hold till maturity you should be more concerned about the of the bond by the issuer on maturity and till then

accounting for this properly is not a trivial matter and you would be wise to pay a little extra to talk with a lawyer and/or cpa to ensure the precise wording how best to structure such an arrangement will depend upon your particular jurisdiction as this is not a federal matter you need someone licensed to advise in your particular state at least the law of real estate co ownership as defined on a deed is not sufficient for the task you are asking of it you need something more sophisticated family partnership we 'll call it fp is created llc llp whatever we 'll say april + a husband gets 50 and sister gets 50 equity how you should handle ownership with your husband is outside the scope of this answer but you should probably talk it over with a lawyer and this will depend on your state   a loan is taken out to buy the property in this case with all partners personally guaranteeing the loan equally but the loan is really being taken out by fp the mortgage should probably show 100 ownership by fp not by any of you individually you will only be guaranteeing the loan and your ownership is purely through the partnership you and your husband put $ 20,000 into the partnership the fp now lists a $ 20,000 liability to you and a $ 20,000 asset in cash fp buys the $ 320,000 house increase assets with a $ 300,000 mortgage liability and $ 20,000 cash decrease assets equity in the partnership is $ 0 right now the ownership at present is clear you own 50 of $ 0 and your sister owns 50 of $ 0 where 'd your money go simple it 's a liability of the partnership so you and your husband are together owed $ 20,000 by the partnership before any equity exists everything balances nicely at this point note that you should account for paying closing costs the same as you considered the down payment that money should be paid back to you before any is out as investment profit now how do you handle mortgage payments this actually is n't as hard as it sounds thanks to the nature of a partnership and proper business accounting with a good foundation the rest of the building proceeds quite cleanly on month 1 your sister pays $ 1400 into the partnership while you pay $ 645 into the partnership fp will record an increase in assets cash of $ 1800 an increase in liability to your sister of $ 1400 and an increase in liability to you of $ 645 fp will then record a decrease in cash assets of $ 1800 to pay the mortgage with a matching increase in cost account for the mortgage no net change in equity but your individual contributions are still preserved let 's say that now after only 1 month you decide to sell the property someone makes an offer you just ca n't refuse of $ 350,000 dollars we 'll pretend all the closing costs disappeared in buying and selling but it should be clear how to account for those as i mention earlier now what happens fp gets an increase in cash assets of $ 350,000 decreases the house asset $ 320,000 original purchase price and pays off the mortgage for simplicity let 's pretend it 's still $ 300,000 somehow now there 's $ 50,000 in cash left in the partnership who 's money is it by accounting for the house this way the answer is easily determined first all investments are paid back so you get back $ 20,000 for the down payment $ 645 for your mortgage payments so far and your sister gets back $ 1400 for her mortgage payment there is now $ left and by being equal partners you get to split it to you and your husband and the same amount to your sister i 'm keeping the extra dollar for my advice to talk to a lawyer cpa what about getting to live there the fact is that your sister is getting a little something extra out of the deal she get 's the live there how do you account for that well you might just be calling it a gift the problem is you are n't in any way shape or form putting that in writing assigning it a value nothing   also what do you do if you want to sell cash out or at least get rid of the mortgage as it will be showing up as a debt on your credit report and will effect your ability to secure financing of your own in the future if you decide to buy a house for your husband and yourself   now this is the kind of stuff where families get in trouble you are mixing personal lives and business arrangements and some things are not written down like the right to occupy the property and this can really get messy would evicting your sister to sell the house before you all go bankrupt on a bad deal make future family gatherings i 'm betting it might there should be a carefully worded lease probably from the partnership to your sister that would help protect you from extra court costs in trying to determine who has the rights to occupy the property especially if it 's also written up as part of the partnership agreement but now you are building the potential for eviction proceedings against your sister right into an investment deal ugh what a potential nightmare and done right there should probably be some dollar value assigned to the right to live there and use the property unless you just want to really gift that to your sister but this can be a kind of invisible and poorly quantified gift and those do n't usually work very well psychologically and it also means she 's going to be getting an awfully larger benefit from this investment than you and your husband do you think that might cause over dozens and dozens of writing out the check to pay for the property while not realizing any direct benefit while you pay to keep up your own living circumstances too in short you need a legal structure that can properly account for the fact that you are starting out in equal contributors to your scheme and ongoing contributions will be different over time too what if she falls on hard times and you make a few of the mortgage payments what if she wants to redo the bathroom and insists on paying for the whole thing herself or with her own loan etc with a properly documented partnership or equivalent such business entity these questions are easily resolved they can be handled by a court in event of family divorce death bankruptcy emergency liquidation early sale refinance you name it no percentage of simple co ownership recorded on a deed can do any of this for you no math can provide you the proper protection that a properly organized business entity can i would thus strongly advise you your husband and your sister to spend the comparatively tiny amount of extra money to get advice from a real estate investment lawyer cpa to get you set up right keep all receipts and you can pay a book keeper or the accountant to do end of the year taxes and answer questions that will come up like how to properly account for things like depreciation on taxes your intuition that you should make sure things are formally written up in times when everyone is on good terms is extremely wise so please follow it up with in person paid consultation from an expert and no matter what this deal as presently structured has a really large built in potential for as you have three partners and one of the partners is also renting the property partially from themselves while putting no money down   this has a great potential to be a train wreck so please do look into what would happen if these went wrong into some more detail and write up in advance in a legally binding way what all parties rights and responsibilities are

to answer your question point by point i 'd focus on the last point the back of my business card   let 's focus on single the standard deduction and exemption add to over $ 10k. i look at this as i can have $ 250 k in my ira and my $ 10 k 4 annual withdrawal will be tax free it takes another $ to fill the 10 and 15 brackets $ k saved pretax to have that withdrawn each year or $ m total   that said i think that depositing to roth in any year that one is in the 15 bracket or lower can make sense i also like the roth roulette concept if only for the fact that i am google 's first search result for that phrase   roth roulette is systematically converting and each year the portion of the converted assets that have fallen or not risen as far in relative terms a quick example you own 3 volatile stocks and convert them to 3 roth accounts a year later they are a down 20 b up 10 c up 50 you recharacterize the first two but keep the 3rd in the roth you have a tax bill on say $ 10 k but have $ 15 k in that roth

like pointed out fundamentally you need to decide if the money invested elsewhere will grow faster than the interest you are paying on the loan in india the safe returns from fixed deposits is around 8 9 currently factoring taxes the real rate of return would be around 6 7 this is less than what you are paying towards interest the ppf gives around 9 with tax break if there are no other options and tax free interest the real return can be as high as 12 14 there is a limit on how much you can invest in ppf however this looks higher than your average interest the stock markets in long term 7 years averages give you around 15 returns but are not predictable year to year so the suggest from is valid you would need to see what are the high rate of interest loans and if they accept early repayment you should complete it asap if there are loans that are less than average say in the range of 7 8 you can keep it and pay as per schedule

the company released its 2nd quarter revenue of $ a couple days ago however the stock did not move up in any way why if the company is making money should n't the stock go up during the time between earnings announcements analysts occasionally publish their assessment of a company including their estimate of the company 's value and future earnings and as part of an earnings report companies often include guidance their prediction for the upcoming quarter this will frequently be a conservative estimate so they 're more likely to achieve it investors make their purchase and sale decisions based on this information when the earnings report comes out investors compare these actual returns to analysts predictions and the company 's guidance if their results are in line with these predictions the stock price is unlikely to move much as those results are already incorporated into the stock price if the company is doing better than predicted it 's usually a good sign and the price often rises conversely if it 's doing worse the price will likely fall but it 's not as simple as this as others have explained for long term investors stock prices are based on expectations of future activity if the results of that quarter include some one time actions that are unlikely to repeat investors will often discount that portion

the way the question is worded it is slightly opinion based just to point out    tax benefits upto 50000 inr is tax free when invested here this is actually 200,000 inr under 80c. so if you invest max of 150,000 in other instruments in 80c you can still invest 50,000 into nps hopefully it will provide some money that i could probably use to buy a house kid 's education kid 's marriage there are very few withdrawal options generally in the current scenario by the time you retire you would already have house kid would have got married answers given the current data is it a worthwhile investment it is a good investment option available it is up to individual to select this or invest else where if yes would be better to fix choice at 50 in e and 25 in c and e or go for the auto choice as you are young it is better to have max 50 in equity and actively monitor this and change the percentage as you near the retirement age if you do n't have time or are not financial or one is plain simple lazy going with auto choice makes sense bad investment because if you put the same money into equity oriented mutual funds then you will get better returns this depends if you are currently investing everything into equity then yes at absolute level the returns are high however if you are investing into equity and debt to achieve a balance then nps is doing it automatically for you as the nps has very low costs there is substantial advantage in some years 2013 2014 the nps equity return has been excellent and exceeded leading mutual funds other aspect edits the annuities need to invest in guaranteed risk free instruments generally bonds as the rates are locked for life they need to factor things like average life expectancy demographics etc this is largely statistical similar to how the insurance premiums are decided this is adjusted periodically say they offer 6.5 for 100 people the investments into bonds is yielding only 6 then for next 100 people they would offer 5.5 however if the mortality increases i.e. 50 people die at age of 70 they just need to adjust it to 5.75 for next 100 so there are quite a few parameters that go in and models output what the rate should be offered at times the corpus manager may take a hedge to minimize downside this is a specialized subject and there no dummies that show how rates are determined it is also a trade secret

there are 3 entities in a credit card transaction typically when you swipe for 100 the merchant only gets around the 2.5 is divided amongst the 3 entities roughly around 0.5 for the merchant bank around 0.5 for the card network and a lions share to issuing bank of around 1.5 the reason issuing bank gets large share is because they take the risk and provide the credit to customer typically the issuing bank would pay the merchant bank via the card network the money in couple of days so the merchant bank is not out of funds the issuing bank on the other hand would have given you a credit of say 10 to 50 days depending on when you made the transaction and when the payment is due on an average 30 days of credit so roughly the acquiring bank is lending money at the rate of 18 it is from this money the issuing bank would give out rewards which is typically less than 1 also in cases where say merchant bank and the issuing bank are same bank would make money on both the legs of transaction and hence launch co branded cards with better rewards the above numbers are illustrative and actual practices vary from bank to bank to card network to country related question at how do credit card companies make profit

there are some nuances with hce definition to answer your questions it 's compensation as defined by the plan usually it 's gross comp but it can exclude things like fringe benefits overtime pay commissions bonuses etc the compensation test is also a look back test meaning that an ee is determined to be an hce in the current year if their compensation in the previous year was over the limit i 'm not sure how stock options affect this but i expect they would be counted probably have an esop plan at that point too which is a whole other can o the 5 owner test applies to the current year and also has a one year look back period if at any point even for a day an employee was more than 5 owner they are hce for that year and next yes there is a limit a company may limit the amount of hce 's to the top 20 of employees by pay like aganju said they can also disregard employees that may otherwise have been excluded under the plan using statutory exclusions example they can disregard employees under 21 years and with less than 1 year of service hahaha the irs does not like to concisely define things you can look here that 's probably as concise as you 'll get hope this helps

suggested way to make the decision to repair or buy figure out what it will cost to repair your car if necessary pay a garage to evaluate it as if your daughter was interested in buying it then think about whether you would pay that much to buy a car just like yours but without those problems if the answer is yes fixing it us probably your most cost effective choice even if it is a big bill if the answer is no consider a used car and again have the mechanic check it for any horrors before committing to buy it that avoids the line tax where a new car loses a significant percentage of its value the moment it leaves the dealership an almost toy car us virtually indistinguishable from a new car costs much less and realistically has about the same expected life span i bought a new car once at about $ 300 over the dealer 's real as opposed to sticker cost since i was willing to take the one he was stuck with from the previous model year thank you consumer reports for providing the dealer 's cost info and making this a five minute transaction if it had n't suffered flood damage i 'd probably still be driving it and even so i sorta regret not pricing what it would have cost go completely replace the engine if you really plan to drive it until it is completely you may be able to justify a new car but realistically buying a or two year old car would have been a better choice

there is light at the end of the tunnel but it is at least a decade off possibly more and it is going to get far worse before it gets better   we 've got an economic collapse and a depression coming still   the government has done about as much economic manipulation as it can reasonably do and those things ca n't be avoided anymore   the only thing the government can do is control the timing to a limited extent though the more they try to put it off the worse it will be   obama ca n't fix this neither can congress anymore   the time when it was possible to avoid the disaster is past   we 've been doing this to ourselves for more than 50 years and it will soon be time to pay the   all we can do is prepare for it as best we can and try to ride it out

this is several questions wrapped together how can i see the company 's financial information how strong a claim does a stockholder or have to see the company 's financials what information do i need to know about the company financials before deciding to buy in i 'll start with the easier second question which is quasi implicit   stockholders typically have inspection rights   for example delaware general corporate law 220 gives stockholders the right to inspect and copy company financial information subject to certain restrictions check the laws and corporate code of your company 's state of incorporation to find the specific inspection right   if it is an llc or partnership then the operating agreement usually controls and there may be no inspection rights   if you have no corporate stock then of course you have no statutory inspection rights   my admittedly incomplete understanding is that generally have no inspection rights unless somehow contracted for   so if you vest as a corporate stockholder it 'll be your right to see the financials which may make even a small purchase valuable to you as a continuing employee with the right to see the financials   until then this is probably a courtesy and not their obligation the first question is not easy to answer except to say that it 's variable and highly personal for small companies   some people interpret it as or the implication being that the founders are either hiding something or that you need to examine really closely the mouth of their beautiful gift horse   other people may be much cooler about the question understanding that small companies are risky and you 're being   and in some smaller companies they may believe giving you the expenses could make office life awkward if you approach it professionally directly and briefly do not over explain yourself with the responsible accountant or hr person if any then i imagine it should not be a problem for them to give some information   conversely you may feel comfortable enough to review a high level summary sheet with a founder or to find some other way of reviewing the right information in any case i would keep the request vague simple and direct and see what information they show you   if your request is too specific then you risk pushing them to show information a which they refuse to do but a vague request would've prompted them to show you information b.   a too specific request might get you information x when a vague request could have garnered xyz   vague requests are also less aggressive and may raise fewer objections the third question is difficult to say   my personal understanding is some perspective of how venture capitalists look at the investment opportunity you did n't say how new this startup is or what series stage they are on so i 'll try to stay vague the actual financials are less relevant for startups than they are for other investments because the situation will definitely change   most venture capital firms like to look at the burn rate or amount of cash spent usually at a monthly rate   a high burn rate relative to of cash suggests the company is growing rapidly but may have a risk of i.e. failing before exit   burn rate can change drastically during the early life of the startup   of course burn rate needs the context of revenues and reserves and latest valuation is helpful as a benchmark but you may be able to calculate that from the restricted share offer made to you   high burn rate might not be bad if the company is booming along towards a successful exit you might also want to look at some sort of business plan or info sheet rather than financials alone   you want to gauge the size of the market most startups like to claim or markets so even a few percentage points of market share will hit revenue into the   you 'll also have to have a sense for the business plan and model and whether it 's a good investment or a ridiculous rehash it 's twitter for dogs meets for russian orthodox singles   in other words appraise it like an investor or vc and figure out whether it 's a prospect for decent return   typical things like competition customer acquisition costs manufacturing costs are relevant depending on the type of business activity of course i would n't ignore psychology note that economists and finance people do n't generally condone the following sort of emotional thinking   if you do n't invest in the company and it goes big you 'll kick yourself   if it goes really big other people will either assume you are rich or feel sad for you if you say you did n't get rich   if you invest but lose money it may not be so painful as not investing and losing out the opportunity   so if you consider the emotional aspect of personal finance it may be wise to invest at least a little and hedge against syndrome   that 's more like emotional advice than hard financial advice so much of the answer really depends on your particular circumstances   obviously you have other considerations like whether you can afford the investment which will be on you to decide   and of course the 83(b election is almost always recommended in these situations which seems to be what you are saying to convert ordinary income into capital gain   you may also need cash to pay any up front taxes on the 83(b equity depending on your circumstances

like kind of exchanges have a list of requirements the irs has not issued formal guidance in the matter i recommend to be aggressive and claim the exchange while justifying it with a good analogy to prove good faith and persuade the irs official reading it the risk of losing in tax court would be to high worst case the irs will attempt to reject the exchange at which point you could still pony up to get rid of the problem interest being the only real risk for example past tax court rulings have stated that collectable gold coins are not like kind to gold bars and unlike silver coins but investment grade gold coins are like kind to gold bars so you could use a justification like this i hold bitcoin to be like kind to litecoin because they use the same fundamental technology with just a tweak in the math as if exchanging different grades of gold bars which has been approved by tax court ruling note that it does n't matter whether any of this actually makes sense it just has be reasonable enough for you to believe and look like it is not worth pursuing to an overworked irs official at it i have n't tried this yet so up to now this is a guess but it 's a good enough guess in my estimation that i will be using it on some rather significant amounts next year

bonds can increase in price if the demand is high and offer solid yield if the demand is low   for instance russian bond prices a year ago contracted big in price ie fell but were paying 18 and made a solid buy   now that the demand has risen the price is up with the yield for those early investors the same though newer investors are receiving less yield about percent and paying higher prices    i 've rarely seen banks pay more variable interest than short term treasuries and the same holds true for long term cds and long term treasuries   this is n't to say it 's impossible just rare   also variable is different than a set term if you buy a 10 year treasury at 18 that means you get 18 for 10 years even if interest rates fall four years later    think about the people buying 30 year us treasuries during 1980 1985   so if you have a very large amount of money you will store it in bonds as its much less likely that the us treasury will go bankrupt than your bank less likely   i do n't know about your bank but my bank does n't owe $ 19 trillion

if the buyer exercises your option you will have to give him the stock   if you already own the stock the worst that can happen is you have to give him your stock thus losing the money you spend to buy it   so the most you can lose is what you already spent to buy the stock minus the price the buyer paid for your option if you do n't own the stock you will have to buy it   but if the stock skyrockets in value it will be very expensive to buy it   if for instance you buy the stock when it is worth $ 100 sell your covered call and the next day the stock shoots to $ 1000 you will lose the $ 100 you got from the purchase of the stock   but if you had used a naked call you would have to buy the stock at $ 1000 and you would lose $ 900 since there is no limit to how high the stock can go there is no limit to how much money you may lose

disclosure was at a financial blogger conference i attended last month i had the chance to briefly meet a couple people from this company also i recognize a number of the names of their financial backers this does n't guarantee anything of course except the people behind the scenes are no the same way prosper and lending club have created a market for personal loans this is a company that offers real estate loans   the too good to be true aspect is what i 'll try to address i 've disclosed in other answers that i have my real estate license earlier this year i sold a house that was financed with a hard money loan not a bank but a group of investors they charged the buyer 10 let me state i represented the seller and when i found out the terms of the loan it would have been a breach of my own moral and legal responsibility to her to do anything to kill the deal i felt sick for days after that sale   there are many people with little credit history who are hard workers and have saved their 20 down for 25 the same way there 's a business local to my area that offered a 10 loan is doing something similar but in a crowd sourced way it seems to me that since they show the duration as only 6 24 months the buyer typically manages to refinance during that time i 'm guessing that these may be people who are selling their house but have bad timing i.e. they need to first close on the sale to qualify to buy the new home or simply need the time to get their regular loan approved   as a final side note i recalled the 10 story in a social setting and more than one person responded they 'd have been happy to invest their money at 6 i could have saved the buyer 4 and gotten someone else nearly 6 more than they get on their cash

you need to get the current tax software the 2013 filing software is out already even though it needs to update itself before filing as the final forms are n't ready yet then you will look carefully at schedule e to understand what gets written off i see you are looking at the $ 2200 rent vs your own rent of $ 2100 but of course the tax form does n't care about your rent you offset the expenses of that house against the income   the expenses are the usual suspects mortgage interest property tax repairs etc but there 's one big thing new landlords are prone to forgetting depreciation it 's not optional say the house cost you $ 400k. this is your basis you need to separate the value of land which is not depreciated for a condo with no land it can be as little as 10 when we bought our house for insurance purposes the land was nearly 40 of the full value say you do the research and decide 30 for land then 70 = $ depreciation is taken each year over a 27.5 year period or just over $ 10,000 per year note the forms will help you get your year 1 number as you did n't have a full year   this depreciation helps with your cash flow during the year as you should do the math and if you keep the house adjust your w4 withholdings for 2014 that lump sum you 'll get in april wo n't pay the bills each month but is recaptured on sale   at some point in the future you may save enough to buy a house where you wish to live but need to sell the rental consider a 1031 exchange it 's a way to sell a rental and buy a new one without triggering a taxable event what i do n't know is how long the new house must be a rental before the irs would then allow you to move in the same way you turned your home into a rental a rental can be turned back to a primary residence i just doubt you can do it right after the purchase as fellow member @littleadv would advise get professional advice and he 's right i 've just offered what you might consider the first year tax return with that schedule e is the toughest as it 's brand new the next year is simple in comparison   the question of selling immediately is tough only you can decide whether the risk of keeping it is too great you 're saying you do n't have the money to cover two month 's vacancy that scares me i 'd focus on up the emergency account and securing a credit line you mentioned the tax savings my opinion is that for any investment the tax tail should never wag the investing dog buy or sell a stock based on the stock not the potential tax bill for the sale in your situation the rent and expenses will cancel each other and the depreciation is a short term loan from a tax perspective if you sold today what do you net if you analyzed the numbers now what is your true income from the property each year is that return worth it a good property will provide cash flow principal reduction each year and normal increase in value this takes a bit of careful looking at the numbers you might feel you 're just breaking even but if the principal is $ 12 k less after a year that 's something you should n't ignore on the other hand an exact break even with little equity at stake offered you a leveraged property where any gains are a magnified percentage of what you have at risk   last welcome to money se consider adding some more details to your profile

it 's generally not possible to open a business account in the uk remotely   it 's even difficult near impossible for a non resident even if a citizen to open a business or personal bank account while visiting the uk a recent report says that it may be possible to open an account via barclays offshore in the isle of man   this requires a large deposit and probably lots of paperwork and fees most offshore locations have stricter know your customer rules than major countries note that while the isle of man is inside the uk banking system for sort codes account numbers it is a separate territory that does n't have the same deposit guarantees as the uk there is no legal reason why a uk company has to bank within the uk banking system although many companies paying the company would expect it or require it and an account in anything other than sterling would complicate the accounts it could have an account in your home country    it 's not even a legal requirement that the company has an account in its own name at all   some people use a separate personal account for this purpose   there are plenty of reasons why this is a bad idea for example it 's unclear who what owns the money in the account and can give the appearance of director 's loans but it 's a work around   most inbound electronic payments only require a sort code and account number the account owner name is not checked the uk does have a much simpler and cheaper company registry than most european countries but the near impossibility of opening a bank account for a business in the uk as a non resident has made it an unsuitable place to register a small international company

this is a scam i 'm adding this answer because i was scammed in this fashion the scammer sent me a check with which i was to deposit   when the money showed up in my account i would withdraw the scammer 's share and wire the cash to its destination however it takes a couple days for a check to clear   banks however want you to see that money so they might give it to you on good faith before the check actually clears that 's how the scam works you withdraw the fake money the bank has before the check clears   a couple days later the check does n't clear and you wake up with an account far into the negatives the scammer long gone

that sounds about right however and this is just a quibble it 's not 90 m notional of swap or at least i 've not heard it expressed quite that way for a total return instrument generally i hear the word exposure in this case the of shares purchased at a specific index level so 90 mm exposure in s&amp;p 500 at today 's closing price is = a swap on 37 shares   if you want to maintain the 90 mm exposure month to month you will structure the instrument with a variable notional at each reset the swap 's of shares will vary inversely with the index level to maintain the 90 mm exposure   you rightly point out that the financing is based on the 90 mm figure   as a final note the dealer may also guarantee some profit by quoting a spread between the swap 's initial index levels depending on whether the portfolio wants to go long or short the index

taking out your equity when refinancing means that you take out a new loan for the full value of your house perhaps less 20 as a down payment on the new mortgage otherwise you 'll be paying insurance pay off your old lender and keep the rest for yourself the result is much the same as using as a heloc or home equity loan or a second mortgage except it 's all rolled into a single new mortgage the advantage is that the interest rate on a first mortgage is going to be lower than on heloc or equivalent and the equity requirements may be lower e.g. a heloc may only let you borrow against the amount of equity that exceeds 25 or 30 while a new mortgage will require you only to have 20 equity   this is especially attractive to those whose homes have appreciated significantly since they bought them especially if they have a lot of high interest debt e.g. credit cards they want to pay off of course rolling credit card debt into a 30-year mortgage is n't actually paying it off but the monthly payments will be a lot lower and if you 're lucky and your home appreciates further you can pay it off fully when you sell the property and still have paid a lot less interest the downside is that you have turned unsecured debt into secured debt which puts your home at risk if you find yourself unable to pay in your case you do n't yet have even 20 equity in your home so i would n't recommend this   equity is simply the difference between the amount you still owe on your home and the amount you 'd get if you were to sell it until you do sell it this amount is tentative based on the original purchase price and perhaps an intervening appraisal that shows that the property has appreciated that is really all that it is and there 's nothing magic about it except that since you own your home you have equity in it while as a renter you would not it used to be decades ago when you needed 20 down to get a mortgage that selling was the only time you 'd be able to do anything with the equity in your home now you can take it out as described above or borrow against it thanks to various financial products it is sometimes tempting to consider equity roughly equivalent to profit but some of it is your own money contributed through the down payment your monthly principal payment and improvements you have made so cashing out is n't all profit it 's partly just you getting your own money back and there are many additional expenses involved in owning a home such as interest property taxes maintenance utilities and various fees not to mention the commissions when you buy or sell which the equity calculation does n't consider increasing equity reflects that you own a desirable property in a desirable location that you have maintained and maybe even improved it that you are financially responsible i.e. paying your mortgage taxes etc and that your financial interests are aligned with your neighbors all those things feel pretty good and they should otherwise it is just a number that the banks will sometimes let you borrow against

if you can qualify for two mortgages this is certainly possible   for this you can talk to a banker however most people do not qualify for two mortgages so they go a different route   they make offers on a new home with a contingency to sell the existing home   a good realtor will walk you through this and any possible side effects keep in mind that the more contingencies in an offer the less attractive that offer is to sellers   this is how cash buyers can get a better deal no contingencies and a very fast close   given the of your market a seller might reject your offer as opposed to first time home buyer that does not need to sell an old home   on the other hand they may see your contingency as low risk as the market is so hot    this is why you probably need a really good agent   they can frame the contingency in a very positive light

in a roth ira scenario this $ 5,000 would be reduced to $ 3,750 if we assume a nice and round 25 tax rate for the traditional ira the full $ 5,000 would be invested no that 's not how it works   taxes are n't removed from your roth account   you 'll have $ 5,000 invested either way   the difference is that you 'll have a tax deduction if you invest in a traditional ira but not a roth so you 'll save $ 1,250 in taxes up front if you invest in a traditional ira versus a roth the flip side is when you withdraw the money   since you 've already paid tax on the roth investment and it grows tax free you 'll pay no tax when you withdraw it   but you 'll pay tax on the investment and the gains when you withdraw from a traditional ira   using your numbers you 'd pay tax on $ from the traditional ira but no tax on $ from the roth at that point you 've saved over $ 500,000 in taxes now if you invested the tax savings from the traditional ira and it earned the same amount then yes you 'd end up in the same place in the end provided you have the same marginal tax rate   but i suspect that most do n't invest that savings and if you withdraw significant amount you 'll likely move into higher tax brackets in your example suppose you only had $ 3,750 of discretionary income that you could put toward retirement   you could put $ 5,000 in a traditional ira since you 'll get a $ 1,250 tax deduction or $ 3,750 in a roth   then your math works out the same   if you invest the same amount in either though the math on the roth is a no brainer

the expense ratio is 0.17 so does nt that mean that for every 10 k i    keep in the money market fund i lose $   not really the expense ratio is taken before distributions are paid which applies to all mutual funds should i care about this   in this case not really if it was a taxable account then other options may be more tax efficient that is worth noting the key with money market funds is that the expense ratio often represents how much money the administrators will take before paying out the rest so if your money market fund bought investments that paid .25 then you 'd likely see .08 as that is what is left over after the .17 is taken in the dividends if at the start of the year the funds nav is $ 1 and at the end of    the year the funds nav is still $ 1 i have nt lost anything right right wikipedia has a good article on money market funds keep in mind that most money market funds are run as one of a number of funds from a fund family that may have to take a little less profit on the money market funds when rates are low

how do treasury auctions work first the us government will issue a notice indicating how much money it would like to borrow below is an actual announcement issued by the treasury department that it will be having an auction to raise $ 23 billion   the announcement indicates the date of the auction march 8th 2011 in the example as well as deadlines for competitive am and noncompetitive am bids if you would like to participate in the auction then your bids must be submitted before these times competitive bid the bidder specifies the maximum price they will pay for the security all treasuries are priced in $ 100 so bids are submitted in terms of buying a security that will repay the owner $ 100 when the security matures $ 100 is the face or par value noncompetitive bid the bidder does not specify any maximum price requirement these bidders are first in line to be issued a bill but they will get whatever price is determined at auction there is a limit of $ 5 million that can be submitted as a noncompetitive bid per bidder per auction for competitive bids any one customer can be awarded a maximum of 35 of the total offering in order to better illustrate the mechanics of the auction let 's go back to the example the table below is a hypothetical list of bids for the $ 23 billion being issued the bids include the total amount the bidder is willing to purchase as well as the maximum price the bidder will pay based on a $ 100 par value note bid 1 $ 5 billion max price do n't care bid 2 $ 10 billion max price do n't care bid 3 $ 5 billion max price $ 98 bid 4 $ 5 billion max price $ 95 bid 5 $ 10 billion max price $ 92 bid 6 $ 5 billion max price $ 90 notice there is a total of $ 40 billion in bids the auction is only for $ 23 billion this means some bids will go unfilled the ratio between bids and the amount of the auction is called the bid to cover ration for our example it is $ a high bid to cover ratio indicates a strong demand for the bonds since there are a lot of bidders a low ratio indicates weak demand a ratio under 2.0 is considered weak the bids are filled in the following manner results of our example auction bid 1 $ 5 billion max price noncompetitive all $ 5 billion filled at $ 95 bid 2 $ 10 billion max price noncompetitive all $ 10 billion filled at $ 95 bid 3 $ 5 billion max price $ 98 all $ 5 billion filled at $ 95 bid 4 $ 5 billion max price $ 95 only $ 3 billion filled at $ 95 bid 5 $ 10 billion max price $ 92 not filled bid 6 $ 5 billion max price $ 90 not filled once the auction is completed the treasury will post the results of the auction below is the actual results of the auction   there are some additional items that are reported from the auction high rate this is the highest yield or the lowest price that was accepted at the auction for our example this would be $ 95 allotted at high this is the percentage of the total that was filled at the highest accepted yield or lowest accepted price for our example the last $ 3 billion we filled was at the lowest price so our allotment at high would be $ = 13 price price as determined by the auction median rate half of the competitive bids were submitted below this rate while the other half were above low rate the lowest yield or highest price submitted for the competitive bids the announcement also shows the breakdown of the amount of bids submitted versus competitively and how much was rewarded for those same categories there is an entry in the middle of the results announcement listed as this stands for system open market account this represents treasuries that are held by the federal reserve if the federal reserve has treasuries that are maturing then it is expected that they will use the proceeds from those maturing treasuries to buy new treasuries for our example auction the fed had no bills maturing at the time if they did then the fed would also get the same price determined at the auction here is an article i wrote with a little more detail on the auction process   i 've included my sources at the end of the article as for treasuries being a safe investment   i 'm not so sure   right now the yield on 10 years is around 2.5   who in their right mind would lend money to the government for 10 years at 2.5   not me

so couple of things firstly every international etf includes risk disclosure language in the prospectus covering both market disruption events as well as geopolitical risk so the sponsor would be pretty well insulated from direct liability for anything if the russian market were truly shut down there are true up mechanisms in place but in the scenario you 're describing the market is still open it 's just only a few participants can trade in it   first thing to do is shut down that is allow no new money to come into the fund this at least prevents your problem from getting bigger    second you 're going to switch all redemptions to in kind only itself ca n't trade in the underlying so they 're kind of here an etf sponsor ca n't really refuse your redemption request can delay but only for a short time but they can control the form in which they respond to it     what theoretically should happen here is an ap not subject to sanctions will step in and handle redemptions   issue is they 'll probably charge for this so you should expect the fund to start trading at a discount to nav you as an investor sell to them cheaply they submit a redemption request then sell the stocks locally someone else has pointed that market makers will start stat the fund using correlated substitute instruments which totally will help keep things in line but my guess is that you 'd still see the name trading away from nav regardless driver of this will be the amount of money desperate to get out if investors are content to wait the sanctions out who knows

nah there are some where its safe to do but they suffer the same issues as cars yeah its all on one track seems so simple but you got to deal with shit like objects on the track and trying to stop they are either way full of people or way full of goods it sounds good to think its unions but its mostly not its mostly humans are still needed to brake if the track is broken or something on it or w e   we can start to do the full auto trains that drive the general service tracks but its going to be just like trucks and cars and everything else while 99 of the time they on a nice long straight clear track once in a while they have to deal with the same shit as cars something unexpected in the way

yes on taxes it depends on the other point as you already see from ben 's comment if you 're both very western in your culture you may want to consider ben 's advice because while you will save money it may not be considered a healthy way to start a relationship   western culture tends to see marriage as more of a do it for love whereas other cultures may view marriage more pragmatically and take economics and finance as a major consideration for instance a friend of mine married his spouse and it was 100 pragmatic considering taxes and laws driving most of his family insane because it does n't sound very loving these were the exact words   unfortunately this created tension later on because family on both sides kept telling both of them that the other did n't love the partner and they used how their marriage started as proof   as surprising as it is to me non western many americans are horrified at people at the or other pragmatic ways even if it saves them thousands answering questions about relationships is very difficult because often the issue is less about money and more about culture   if you 're both from pragmatic cultures where economics and finance weigh strongly and you do n't see possible issues with family and really be honest on this point then consider the financial advantages

its worse than wo n't create jobs   it will destroy jobs   the main reasoning is partly in the article   tax rates do n't matter if an investment is a good idea   job destruction occurs because there is less of a tax deduction for spending     executive assistants newer computers phones and company cars conferences in hawaii are all non essential spending that when there is less of a tax deduction for that spending get cut   normally investments are risky   paying for a google ad if it fails at least gives a tax deduction   lower tax rates means failures cause all of that investment to be lost

yeah i 'll take the challenge how trustworthy these are and what are their sources of income these are in fact two separate questions but the answers are related how trustworthy as trustworthy as they 're clear about their own sources of income if you can not find any clue as to why what for and how they 're paying you you probably should walk away what 's too good to be true usually is indeed too good to be true for those of the sites that i know of their sources of income it is usually advertisements and surveys to get paid you have to watch advertisements and/or answer surveys i know of some sites who are legit and pay people not money but gift cards airline miles etc for participating in surveys my own kaiser in california in fact pays small amounts to members who participate in enough surveys so its legit are these sites worthwhile to consider for extra income not something you could live off but definitely can get you enough gift cards for your weekly trip to starbucks what do i need to consider tax wise usually the amounts are very low and are not paid in cash while it is income i doubt the irs will chase you if you do n't report the $ 20 amazon gift card you got from there it should strictly speaking be reported probably as hobby income on your tax return most people do n't bother dealing with such small amounts though in some cases like the i mentioned its basically a rebate of the money paid you pay your copays deductibles etc since the surveys are only for members you basically get your money back not additional income this is in fact similar to credit card rebates is there a best practice for handling the income if we 're talking about significant amounts more than $ 20 30 a year then you need to keep track of the income and related expenses and report it as any other business income on your taxes schedule c. is there a good test to determine what is and is n't a scam as i said if it looks too good to be true it most likely is if you 're required to provide your personal financial information without any explanation as to why what it will be used for and why and what for you 're going to be paid i 'd walk away otherwise you can also check internet reviews bbb ratings ftc information and the relevant state agencies and consumer for example whether they 've heard of that particular site and what is the information they have on it a very good sign for a scam is contact information do they have a phone number to call to is it in your own country if its not in your own country definitely go away for example the original link that was in the question pointed to a service whose phone number is in the uk but listed address is in los angeles ca a clear sign of a scam if they do have a phone number try it talk to them call several times and see how many different people you 're going to talk to if its always the same person run and hide do they have an address if not walk away if they do look it up is it a a virtual office or do they have a proper office set up which you can see on the map and in the listings as their office and of course your guts if your guts tell you its a scam it very likely is

what makes a credit card risky is that it requires discipline it is very easy to buy things that you can not afford with a credit card credit cards usually require a minimum payment every month if you owe them money but if you pay only the minimum amount your debt will grow quickly and since the interest rates are usually very high you can easily get into a state where you are overwhelmed by your debt the correct way to use a credit card is to pay the complete bill every month if you ca n't afford to pay the complete bill because you spent too much cut up your credit card   on the positive side there are many situations where paying by credit card will give you protection if you do n't get the goods that you paid for because the credit card company is fully responsible for those goods just like the seller so if you pay for a $ 5,000 holiday with a credit card and the company you paid to goes bankrupt the credit card company will refund your money   do not ever look at cash back on purchases you only get cash back if you spend money getting $ 50 cash back is of no use if you had to get $ 2,500 deeper in debt to get that cash back some people might contradict this but if you ask for advice on then this is the correct advice for you that you should follow

to begin i 'm not sure you understand what col refers to   it 's what you spend not what you bring in   let 's say bob makes 60k in some midwest town but spends 30k for living   if his salary and his cost of living both increase at the same rate let 's say they both double this means bob now makes 120k but spends 60k   he now saves double what he would have before   that 30k extra saved is 30k extra saved   his purchasing power has now gone greatly up especially in respect to housing outside of an expensive area like the valley   for one let me clear this up sf the city itself is expensive   i 'm talking more generally about the bay area and silicon valley as a whole   most tech jobs from the big tech companies that we think of as the bay are not in sf   they are in mountain view and that area   so this might explain some of our disagreements   most people who work for large tech companies understand they have a decision to make live in the city proper pay a lot more than the greater valley use transit into work all of the giants have regular in but get to love a more hip life or be more conservative in the valley where rental prices are on par with nyc   in talking to a lot of people who work for the big companies they know this   younger folks who want to live the city life pay the premium but by far and wide they live outside of it where it is closer to work and they take the rail up for weekends out with buddies   i 'm still not sure where you are getting a doubling of the col in the valley versus outside   yes housing as a single item is going to be a person 's largest expense   but all the rest of their expenses are not going to see a similar increase   it 's also important to remember that saving 10 of 60 v 10 of 120 is significantly different   lots of people take jobs in the valley are able to save vastly larger amounts of cash and then leave     in my calculations i evaluated the col markup to be ~30 for the valley for a 200k job   that is i spend maybe 50k of my earning on all living expenses in the midwest in a downtown nice area and would expect i 'd pay about 70k for the same standard in the valley   but i 'd be saving a more   i 've done the math i 'm not here to argue with someone who just googled sf cost of living searching for the answers i want   i 've talked to actual people out there   i appreciate your passion for this but your 100 increase in col estimate is simply wrong   but then again it depends on how you live and where you live in your current situation   i live in a large midwest city actually in the city itself

your question seems to be on your personal understanding of economics and asking that people present to you an explanation of business transactions that is consistent with your own personal worldview but your premises are flawed so an accurate answer should not accept them the basics of trade is that something is worth more to one person than another a wheat farmer has more wheat that they could possibly eat and so it has no value other than what they can get by selling it while an accountant will starve if they do not have any food and thus is willing to pay what the market demands the two parties can both be better off by having a transaction the other motivation for transactions is that parties may disagree as to what something is worth even if one party will lose from the transaction they may both believe they will profit

if you read joel greenblatt 's the little book that beats the market he says owning two stocks eliminates 46 of the non market risk of owning just one stock     this risk is reduced by 72 with 4 stocks by 81 with 8 stocks by 93 with 16 stocks by 96 with 32 stocks and by 99 with 500 stocks   conclusion after purchasing 6 8 stocks benefits of adding stocks to decrease risk are small    overall market risk wo n't be eliminated merely by adding more stocks   and that 's just specific stocks so you 're very right that allocating a 1 share to a specific type of fund is not going to offset your other funds by much you are correct that you can emulate the lifecycle fund by simply buying all the underlying funds but there are two caveats generally these funds are supposed to be cheaper than buying the separate funds individually check over your math and make sure everything is in order call the fund manager and tell him about your findings and see what they have to say if you are going to emulate the lifecycle fund be sure to stay on top of rebalancing one advantage of buying the actual fund is that the portfolio distributions are managed for you so if you 're going to buy separate etfs make sure you 're rebalancing as for whether you need all those funds my answer is a definite no consider mark cuban 's blog post wall street 's new lie to main street asset allocation although there are some highly questionable points in the article one portion is clear   let me translate this all for you i want you to invest in cash and the rest in 10 different funds about which you know absolutely nothing i want you to make this investment knowing that even if there were 128 hours in a day and you had a year long vacation you could not possibly begin to understand all of these products in fact i do n’t understand them either but because i know it sounds good and everyone is making the same kind of recommendations we all can pretend we are smart and going to make a lot of money until we do n’t standard theory says that you want to invest in low cost funds like those provided by vanguard and you want to have enough variety to protect against risk although i ca n't give a specific allocation recommendation because i do n't know your personal circumstances you should ideally have some in us equities us fixed income international equities commodities of varying sizes to have adequate diversification as defined by theory you can either do your own research to establish a distribution or speak to an investment advisor to get help on what your target allocation should be

if you want an account statement from the irs listing the taxes due and paid and confirming a zero balance remaining you want what they call a tax account transcript it sounds like you tried to submit this online but yes it would require the actual taxpayer to submit it the other option would be to fill out form requesting the form 1040 tax account transcript have the taxpayer sign it and mail it in presumably whatever method you used to have her sign the form 1040 you prepared for her you could also use to have her sign the another option could be to try to request the transcript over the phone i do n't know what authentication they require or if you would need to have been listed on the 1040 as an authorized third party according to the irs transcript faq page what if i ’m unable to use get transcript by mail if you are unable to use get transcript by mail you may try our automated phone transcript service at 800 and also receive your transcript by mail please allow 5 to 10 calendar days for delivery but unless there 's a reason to think that the tax account was n't credited properly or the irs is sending another bill or the like i do n't think there 's a lot of point in doing so in general the fact that the check cleared the bank should be sufficient documentation that the amount was paid

already touched on this but generally speaking there is a tendency in this country to lump unions together and put the shortcomings of one local or one unit or one member onto all of them an example would be the issue of corruption many people cry about rampant corruption in unions when in fact only somewhere between 1 2 of locals have ever had any corruption charges whereas i 'd be willing to bet that the corruption rate is much higher in the corporate world   gt honestly i ca nt think of any reason for minimum wage paying jobs to have a union if you think the wages are too low for cost of living then the minimum wage should be raised these people have no special skills little to no training and usually no education   genuine question what reasons do you think someone would could have for joining a union why would base pay education skill level of the job be a consideration     just so we 're on the same page collective bargaining came about because workers in certain areas were pissed off enough that they realized that to improve their situation they had to come together as a group because only as a group did they have any leverage all workers have the right to collective bargaining rights which were signed into law because pissed off workers were doing it anyway and the regulation of the practice helped smooth it out and drastically cut down on violence and debilitating drops in production     it takes quite a feeling of injustice and exploitation when not friends not family but colleagues some of which may not even like each other start seeing that they share common problems and decide to tie the fate of their working lives to one another and give up like 1 2 of their paychecks especially in a country with an culture like the us    so if workers at certain wal feel like working conditions are that bad for them then i ca n't see why they should n't organize

which option will save you the most money in the long run that is tough assuming you stay healthy do n't lose your job do n't experience a pay cut or any major emergency that drains your savings then applying the $ 6000 to the higher interest loan will save you more money in the long run however the difference in savings is a few hundred dollars not much really so in this case i 'd put the $ 6k towards the smaller loan why because then you 'd pay it off faster once that 's done you open up your cash flow by the minimum monthly payment you would have had on that loan   assuming they both have the same or similar number of months left by paying the smaller loan off sooner you 'd open up $ x month where $ x is your minimum monthly payment this could be useful to you if you want to take on some other debt like buying a house because it lowers your debt to income ratio if you put that money towards the higher loan your dti wo n't change until the normal time you would have paid off the smaller loan even if you are not looking to purchase anything that requires you to have a lower dti paying the smaller loan off sooner increases your cash flow sooner because your monthly payment on the higher loan does n't change just because you lowered the balance by $ 6k so you 'd be more robust to emergencies if your current income does n't allow for much savings a major emergency could wipe out all savings from paying down the bigger balance so i 'd suggest edit asked a question pretty much requesting more details for why i was biased towards paying off the smaller loan first what follows is my response with a bit of reorganization typically people asking these questions do n't have so much wealth that which loan to pay first is an academic question they need to make smart financial decisions while paying the highest interest loan saves the most money in interest that only occurs under the assumption that nothing bad will ever happen to you until the loans are paid off in reality other things happen tires blow out children get sick you get laid off and so the best thing to do is the one that maximizes your long term financial health even if it comes at the expense of a few $ k more interest each loan has a minimum monthly payment let 's assume barring any windfalls of additional cash you will just make the minimum payments each month towards a loan if you pay off the smaller loan first that increases your available monthly cash flow at that point you can put extra towards the other loan however if an emergency should come up or you need to save for a vacation you can do that without negatively impacting the second loan because you 'd just drop back to its minimum payment putting the money towards the higher balance loan would mean it takes you longer to reach this point as the time to reach payoff on the first loan will not change $ 6k only reduces the $ loan to $ so you never gain the flexibility of additional cash flow until the time you would have paid off the $ originally i 'd rather have a few hundred dollars each month that i can choose to use to make additional loan payments eat out pay for car repairs pay for emergencies than be forced to dip into credit or worse pay day loans should an emergency happen

my personal rule is to not loan money or co sign for any amount that i am not willing to give away   it can go wrong in so many ways and having a family or friend involved means making a business decision is difficult if a bank wo n't loan the person the money why should i   being a co signer is the same as borrowing the money in my name and giving it right over to the borrower there might be great reasons to do it   i would probably sign a loan to keep my family alive or healthy but no other reason   there are many ways to help without signing a loan   give a room and a place to live loan a car the other thing is if you really truly believe in the borrower it wo n't do long term damage to your credit or your financial goals and you are the only resort go ahead   i am thinking about helping a teenager afford their first car or student loans

depending on the day and even time you 'd get your $ 2 profit less the $ 5 commission jack 's warning is correct but more so for thinly traded options either due to the options having little open interest or the stock not quite so popular in your case you have a just in the money strike for a highly traded stock near expiration that makes for about the best liquidity one can ask for   one warning is in order sometime friday afternoon there will be a negative time premium i.e. the bid might seem lower than in the money value at exactly $ 110 why would i buy the option only if i can buy it exercise and sell the stock all for a profit even if just pennies

there are several reasons it is not recommended to trade stocks pre- or post market meaning outside of regular trading hours since your question is not very detailed i have to assume you trade with a time horizon of at least more than a day meaning you do not trade intra day if this is true all of the above points are a non issue for you and a different set of points becomes important as a general rule using 3 is the safest regardless of what and how you trade because you get price guarantee in trade for execution guarantee in the case of mid to longer term trading 1 any of those points is viable depending on how you want to do things what your style is and what is the most comfortable for you a few remarks though 2 are market orders so if the open is quite the ride and you are in the back of the execution queue you can get significant slippage 1 may require live data of the post market session which is often not easy to come by for the entire us stock universe depending on your physical execution method phone fax online you may lack accurate information of the post market if you want to execute orders based on and only want to do that after hours because of personal schedule constraints this is not really important personally i would always recommend 3 independent of the use case because it allows you more control over your orders and their fills tl;dr if you are trading long term it does not really matter if you go down to the intra day level of holding time it becomes relevant
