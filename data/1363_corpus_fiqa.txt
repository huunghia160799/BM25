federal income tax refunds received during 2016 are not taxable income for 2016 or any other year on either the federal or the state tax return the state income tax refund for 2015 received during 2016 is not taxable income on the state tax return for 2016 it is taxable income on the federal tax return for 2016 only to the extent that you received a tax benefit reduction in federal income tax due from deducting state income tax as an itemized deduction on your 2015 federal return if you did n't deduct state income tax because you deducted state sales tax instead then the state income tax refund is not taxable income on the federal tax return

since recent changes to credit scoring july 2017 it may not be to do this as more emphasis is placed on having a timely payment history and less emphasis is placed on having a low credit utilization ratio using what ’s known as data is the biggest change the phrase    means credit scores will take into account the trajectory of a    borrower ’s debts on a month to month basis in fact having a low credit utilization ratio may even negatively effect you if your available credit line value is high vantagescore will now mark a borrower negatively for having    excessively large credit card limits on the theory that the person    could run up a high credit card debt quickly those who have prime    credit scores may be hurt the most since they are most likely to have    multiple cards open but those who like to play the credit card    rewards program points game could be affected as well source

thanks for the link to the financial consumer agency of canada it explained in clear terms that i can withdraw money from and transfer money to the line of credit any time i want the only monthly payment needed is the minimum payment and yes it may have a term after which all remaining principal + interest must be paid back in full similar to a credit card as you pay off your line of credit you can    draw on it again up to the limit you are allowed however a key    difference between a line of credit and a credit card is that with a    line of credit there is no interest free grace period you will have    to pay interest on the amount you borrow from the day you take the    money out you will receive a monthly statement that shows the amount that you    owe on your line of credit you must make at least a minimum payment    on that balance every month specific terms and conditions for lines of credit vary from institution to institution

following these rules will help a poor person have a better chance to climb out of poverty or avoid poverty not finishing high school is n't going to help them find a good job having children as a teenager is n't going to put a poor person into the middle class having children without being married and having a full time job is n't going to solve poverty but make it worse you call these rules middle class values as if it is a bad thing and speak of them as an well breaking these rules is pretty much a ticket to generational poverty

this is fine and can definitely be done the bank will be perfectly fine with it since you 're paying interest on the money as long as they 're confident that you can repay the whole growing balance of course there 's the issue of the credit limit which you 'll eventually reach and then you wo n't be able to pull this off any longer problems start when the bank either loses that confidence or the credit line is term limited like heloc for example and comes to term in either case you 'll be required to cover the balance and especially in the first case as a balloon payment if they call on you when you do that you will most likely go bankrupt and the longer you keep doing it the higher are the chances of that happening

others have already made good points so i 'll just add a few more you say that if you bought it your mortgage insurance and taxes minus the rental income from the bottom floor would leave you with costs of 1/4 of your current rent that means you 're getting a fantastic deal on the purchase price i suspect you may be underestimating some of those costs so get exact figures on the mortgage insurance and taxes and do the math if it is that good go for it just make sure to get that home inspection in case there 's major problems and they 're trying to get out while the 's good also some advice be prepared to cover that entire monthly cost for a few months units can stand empty for a while also you may want to rent out slowly a good found after a couple months is much better than a bad found quickly also have some money set aside for as a renter you 've never really had to think about that before but as a homeowner you do as a landlord it 's even more important you can not fix something in your own home for a while if you needed to wait but in a unit you have to fix it immediately   finally taxes you do get to deduct interest and so on but it 'll work a little differently than you think you 'll have to split it in half if the units are the same size and deduct half the interest as a normal homeowner deduction the other half as a business expense same for pmi insurance and property taxes if you do maintenance that effects both units like fixing the roof half will be deductible the other half not however maintenance that only affects the tenant unit is fully deductible   you can claim depreciation but only for half so your starting amount you can depreciate would be purchase price land same thing here half is your home the other half is a business   note that some things you 'd think of as maintenance costs actually ca n't be deducted only depreciated over time take that leaky roof for example if you replaced it instead of repairing it you could not deduct your replacement costs it counts as an improvement and gets added to your cost basis where you depreciate it along with half the house   if your tenant 's refrigerator went out and you replaced it you could n't deduct that either however you can depreciate all of it on another schedule seperate from home depreciation if you repaired it instead you can deduct all of it immediately   taxes suck

generally no   a mortgage is a lien against the property which allows the bank to exercise certain options primarily power of sale force you to sell the property and outright seizure    in order to do this title needs to be clear which it is n't if you have half title however if you have a sales agreement you can buy your brother 's half and then mortgage the entire property   this happens all the time   when you buy a house from someone you get pre approved for that house which at the time you have no title to    through some black magic and this is all sorted out at closing time

every company has capital even if you have a one man company you probably stated something like 100 shares of $ 1 each which means you had to take that $ 100 out of your own private pocket and pay it into the company   when the company loses money and runs out of cash they have the possibilities of 1 borrowing some money from the bank or from a loan shark 2 borrowing some money from the company owners or 3 increase the share capital for example by increasing the number of shares to 10,000 and each share holder pays his part of the $ 9,900 that 's the case that you have here   however it is only a liability in the sense that it is n't money the company earned it is money that the owners paid in they have no right to get the money back the paid in capital is actually what the owners lose if a limited company goes bankrupt

a cfd is like a bet do n't own horses or but you still pay them and they pay you if the horses win if you buy a cfd the money goes to the firm you bought it from and if the stock price changes in your favour they will pay you however if it goes against you they may ask you for more money than you originally invested to cover your losses for difference are derivatives i.e. you gain on the change in the price or delta of something rather than on its absolute value someone bets one way and is matched with someone or perhaps more than one betting the other way both parties are bound by the contract to pay or be payed on the outcome one will win and the other will necessarily lose   it 's similar in concept to a spread bet although spread bets often have a fixed timescale whereas cfds do not and cfds generally operate via the payment of a commission rather than via charges included in the spread there 's more information on both cfds and spread betting here if has a lot of cfds that might affect the stock price if it 's known about as others may buy sell real stock to either make the cfd pay or may it not pay depending on whether they think they can make money on it otherwise cfds do n't have much of an effect on stock prices

the basic idea behind a derivative is very simple actually   it is a contract where the final value depends on is derived from the value of something else   stock for instance is not a derivative because the contract itself is actually ownership of part of a company   whereas car insurance is a derivative because the payout depends on the value of something else namely your and other peoples cars the problem with such a simple definition is that it covers such a broad class   it covers simple contracts like futures where the end value just depends on the price of something on a future date   but it extends to contracts complicated enough that people in finance call them exotics derivatives are broadly used for two things reducing risk sometimes called insurance and speculation   a farmer can use derivatives to make sure she gets paid a certain amount for her corn   a banker can group a bunch of loans together and sell slices to reduce the pain of a particular loan failing   at the same time people can use the same instruments to speculate on the price of for example that corn or those loans and the main advantage is that they do n't have to buy the corn or loans directly   any farmer will tell you corn can be very expensive to store derivatives generally cause problems both individually and sometimes world wide when people do n't properly understand the risks involved   the most famous example being mortgage backed securities and the recent great recession   you can start understand the instruments and their risks by this wonderful wikipedia article and later perhaps a used collection of cfa books which cover derivatives in great detail edit michael mentioned hull 's text on derivatives a wonderful middle ground between wikipedia and the cfa books that i ca n't believe i did n't think about myself

first of all the numbers you give are most probably nowhere near the total expenses you have need to budget   maybe you should have a look at the expenses you had over the last years look at how much money came in and how much went to the savings and compare this expenses to the sum of all the expenses you have on your list of expenses as check just starting on some numbers you give and assuming the house is the main goal   house of 300 500 k€ assuming downpayment of 30 40 i.e. somewhere between 90 and 200 i 'll go on calculating with 150 k€ which would be 50 of 300 k€ or 30 of 500 you want to be there in 8 15 a this means saving 10 19 k€ per year 19 is clearly impossible with 20 k€ net wage   10 k€ with 20 k€ net wage means a savings quote of 50 so for each € you spend one goes towards the house this is doable in the sense that if you continue with 4 for rent plus a 4 (= 400 € style of life that would put you to 9 k€ expenses a thus 1 k€ saving for unexpected disaster i 'd actually first get a couple of k€ together for such things and then go as much as possible towards the house still this is not the life style the rest of your goals sounds like   you can update this somewhat with the expected income of your girlfriend wife but remember that she needs food and clothes as well and you assume she 'll need a car of her own let me rephrase the savings goal of 150 k€ you 'd try to save 3 times the median german household equity within 8 to 15 years this should tell you that it is a very steep proposition on the other hand e.g. manage to have a median household equity of ca 60 k€ out of a median income that is roughly half the median income in germany so again it is somehow possible but it will be really tough to live a life style like a or between peers that spend roughly everything good approximation as we 're talking about savings rates   above 50 of net income they earn    i think the easiest way to get your savings going is to postpone lifestyle upgrades   on the other hand around 150 k€ would buy you a complete new house of the same size that costs 300 500 k€ around so if you really want to go for the house i 'd recommend not only to save as hard as you can but also to look out for possibilities to relocate to a cheaper area 8 15 years should be enough time to decide what area you 'd like and then to look for an opportunity without too much pressure and actually this should be enough time so that also your girlfriend wife could get herself transferred to another in reality saving as hard as possible will probably get you nowhere near 150 k€ there are very few people who manage to do this though they exist but if you get to 75 k€ that would mean a reasonably good position for both starting negotiations with the bank about buying a 150 k€ house plus the corresponding payment of the mortgage if you get there within less than 15 years that would also leave some air in case you change opinion with regard to kids and then leaves a reasonable amount of time to put together your pension   consider your psychology about saving towards the house even if both of you know that you want it really hard it may be good to enter a building savings contract 15 years should be reasonable for that way which will enforce you to keep up the savings rate and also does not allow you to divert money for other purposes however i 'd say that 6 months into the first job it may be a bit early to fix such savings rates maybe for the beginning a savings account that includes some hassle to get the money out again set low limit and allow any outgoing money to go only to another account of yours with an automatic savings deposit every month is a way how to safely determine the savings rate you can manage maybe you can use this to first put together your new emergency savings which should be first priority anyways   if you want to cut expenses in order to save look at the recommendations for people who try to get out of debt budget your expenses cook yourself and enjoy this maybe taking a cooking class together with your girlfriend is a lot of fun leads to food that may even be more to your taste than restaurant stuff and is much cheaper keep book pay in cash not by card and so on   if you 're not a diy person try whether you could enjoy becoming one no magic involved there   i guess the most important point is to find out how much you want the house and then how hard you are willing to save this is something only you and your girlfriend can decide together   imho you really do n't need to invest unless you drop the house plan you need to save towards your goals you may decide to invest a small part of the money while saving in order to learn slowly how that works but if the house goal is already kind of fixed in time you do n't want to find yourself in the situation that you have to get out of investments at a bad time in order to be able to buy the house even if you consider 15 years long enough to do some investing now and then get out some time during the next 15 years you do n't have any money to invest now later the risk posed by the fixed point in time when you need the money is too large considering the rather steep saving propositions the marginal costs of having less money are really large this means you do n't want to go for risky investments = > plain old saving is what you need consider also that low house prices tend to come during economic crisis people can not pay mortgage and have to sell so within the time window you want to have your money for buying if possible

hi i 'm the writer thanks for the read and the comment with the statement you quoted i 'm trying to dispute the claim that people these days ca n't afford a house because they would have to pay their entire salary just to afford the mortgage which i think is quite common in some circles the data makes no statement as to whether home ownership is more affordable or not but simply shows that those buying property are using around the same percentage of their income to pay for it which the data clearly shows to be true      as it turns out home ownership levels have remained within ~5 of their 1980 levels based on percentage of the total population i think there is an major classification flaw when comparing only sales because a great deal of people inherit property with no sale ever being made

gt i 'm a basically daily user of some of the things i mentioned and i have a job why does it matter what i do on my time off i 've had issues with depression and do see a psychologist and the aggressive way you position your argument is n't appreciated   many of these people get high before work as well and go in high i want a happy employee that is ready to work and is n't impaired   gt correct me if i 'm wrong but in your mind a weed smoker = jobless person with 0 motivation which just is n't true while there are people who fit that bill and perpetuate the stereotype it is n't everyone   i know plenty have jobs but many daily users are n't at their full potential and do n't have as much motivation which definitely holds them back    as far as insurance i know you did n't want to get into it but i was talking about liability insurance if there is an injury at work not medical insurance   while you can say it does n't cause accidents i 've heard from a few people that i smoked too much or i ate too much of an edible and i could n't move or passed out   so it does cause serious and can cause accidents in less amounts lesser than the amount that knocks you out

you seem overly fixated on dead tree documentation of purchases   they are deducting this from your account monthly the mere fact that the money was taken is enough to prove in court that they have you on their books and to hold them to paying out said insurance   the email copies is actually a better way to organize receipts in most cases ca n't be destroyed as easily etc you can cancel the insurance but do n't just stop paying you 'd owe them money then   i foresee increasing difficulty navigating the 21st century for you unless you can get past this concern about physical receipts   i doubt other companies would do much better fwiw i live in the continental us   i do n't know how different the philippines is with regard to moving everything to digital

much of this is incorrect aetna owns for starters and it 's your employer who decides which banks and brokers to offer not an hsa is a checking account with an investment account option after a minimum balance is met a majority of u.s. employers only offer an hsa option but do n't contribute a penny so you 're lucky you get anything   the easy solution is just keep the money that is sent to your hsa checking account in your checking account and once a year roll it over into a different bank 's hsa the vast majority of banks offer hsas that have no ties to a particular broker i.e. citibank pnc chase i have all my hsa funds in hsa bank which is online but services lots of employers not true that most payroll deductions or employer contributions go to a single hsa custodian bank   they might offer a single bank that either contracts with an investment provider or lets you invest anywhere but most employers making contributions are large or mid market employers offering multiple banks and that trend is growing fast because of defined contribution private exchanges and vendor product basically nobody likes having a second bank account for their hsa when their home bank offers one

just pick a good bond and invest all your money there since they 're fairly low risk no that is basically throwing away your money and why would you do that and who told you they are low risk that is a very wrong premise what factors should i consider in picking a bond and how would they weigh against each other quite a number of them to say assuming these are n't government uk etc how safe is the institution issuing the bond their income business they are in their past performance business wise and the bonds issued by them if any check for the bond ratings issued by the rating agencies read the prospectus and check for any specific conditions i.e. bonds are callable bonds can be retired under certain conditions what happens if they default and what order will you be debt take priority where are interest rates heading which will decide the price you are paying for the bond and also the yield you will derive from the bond how do you intend to invest the income coupon you will derive from the bonds what is your time horizon to invest in bonds and similarly the bond 's life i have invested in stocks previously but realized that it is n't for me bonds are much more difficult than equities stick to government bonds if you can but they do n't generate much income considering the low interest rates environment now that qe is over you might expect interest rates to rise but you can only wait or go for bonds from stable companies i.e. ge walmart and no i am not saying you buy their bonds in any imaginable way

hard pulls you give your explicit permission to run do affect your credit   soft pulls do not while hard pulls affect your score they do n't affect it much   maybe a couple few point for a little while   in your daily activities it is inconsequential   if you are prepping to get a mortgage you should be mindful similar type hard pulls in a certain time window will only count once because it is assume you are shopping   for example mortgage shopping will result in a lot of hard pulls but if they are all done in a fortnight they only count against once   i believe the time window is actually a month but i have always had two weeks in my head as the safe window the reason soft pulls do n't matter is because businesses typically wo n't make credit decisions based on them   a soft pull is so a business can find a list of people to make offers to but that does n't mean they actually qualify   only the information in a hard pull will tell them that   i do n't know but i suspect it is more along the lines of give me everybody who is between 600 and 800 and lives in zip code not what is 's credit score a hard pull will lower your score because of a scenario where you open up many many lines of credit in a short period of time   the credit scoring models assume i am guessing that you are going to implode   you are either attempting to cover obligations you ca n't handle or you are about to create a bunch of obligations you ca n't handle credit should be used as a convenient method of payment not a source of wealth   as such each credit line you open in a short time lowers the score   you are to continue opening lines and lenders at the end of your credit line opening spree will see you as riskier than the first

i would suggest you to put your money in an fd for a year and as soon as you get paid the interest start investing that interest in a investment plan this is your safest option but it will not give you a lot of returns but   i can guarantee that you will not lose your the economy fails as a whole which is unlikely   for example you have rupees if you put it in a fixed deposit for 1 year you earn in 9 compounded quarterly with this interest you can invest every month in an sip for 12 months and also renew your fd so that you can keep earning that interest so at the end of 10 years you will have 5 lacs in your fd and rs in your funds usually make 13 16 a year assuming your fund gives you 14 you make   1 at 14 for 9 years years 3 7 years 4 6 years 5 5 years 6 4 years 7 3 years 8 2 years 9 1 year total maturity value on sip = rs principal on fd =       rs interest earned on 10th year = rs total = rs lacs please note interest rates and rate of return on funds may vary this figure can only be assumed if these rates stay the same cheers

as someone with a lot of student loan debt i can relate the first thing you should do is read the promissory note on your current loans there might be information there you can use   for govt loans stafford etc made after july 1 2006 the interest rate is going to be fixed and even a federal direct consolidation is not going to lower the rates themselves   if anything consolidation will just increase the repayment period which means you 'll end up paying more in the long run    most private loans usually offer variable interest rates which today are quite low but unless your financial situation is very comfortable and stable consolidating out of federally guaranteed loans into private loans might not be the best path   you might lose options like deferment forbearance and maybe even things like a death benefit if you die your loans die with you related if you have a co signer you do n't get that death benefit but refinancing into a variable rate private loan is going to push a lot of risk to you in terms of interest rate inflation etc most financial professionals will agree that interest rates can only go up in the long run keep in mind student loans are completely unsecured meaning lenders are taking a fairly large risk in loaning money and probably why the fed govt has to guarantee most of them   i 've heard of people borrowing against their home equity to pay down student loan debt but i ca n't think of a reason you 'd want to substitute secured for unsecured debt and possibly lose the loan interest tax deduction   the bottom line is you 're unlikely to find an alternative lending source at a lower interest rate for an unsecured student loan   another option may be the income based repayment plan if you qualify it caps student loan monthly payments at 15 of your discretionary income discretionary is your income minus whatever the poverty threshold income amount is and if that 15 does n't even cover the interest on the loans the govt picks up the tab for the difference for up to 3 years you have to re qualify every year by sending in all sorts of documentation but if you somehow stay on for 25 years your loans are then forgiven obviously the downside here is that you are probably paying little to no principal but if you do the math and determine that your payment would be next to nothing and your current situation is barely paying interest only well maybe is n't a bad thing for a couple of years or 25 if you think you will never have a larger income    personally i went through all these options as well and decided that my best option was to just earn more money a 2nd job or side project here and there helps me pay down the debt faster and with less risk than moving to private variable rate loans

the short answer is with limited credit your best bet might be an fha loan for first time buyers   they only require 3.5 down if i recall the number right and you can qualify for their loan programs with a credit score as low as 580 the problem is that even if you were to add new credit lines such as signing up for new credit cards etc they still take time to have a positive effect on your credit   first your score takes a bit of a hit with each new hard inquiry by a prospective creditor then your score will dip slightly when a new credit account is first added while your credit score will improve somewhat within a few months of adding new credit and you begin to show payment history on those accounts your average age of accounts needs to be two years or older for the best effect assuming you 're making all of the payments on time a good happy medium is to have between 7 and 10 credit lines on your credit history and to make sure it 's a mix of account types such as store cards installment loans and credit cards to show that you can handle various types of credit be careful not to add too much credit because it affects your debt to income ratio and that will have a negative effect on your ability to obtain mortgage financing i really suggest that you look at some of the sites which offer free credit scores because some of them provide great advice and tips on how to achieve what you 're trying to do   they also offer credit score which can help you understand how your score might change if for instance you add new credit cards pay off existing cards or take on installment loans   it 's well worth checking out i hope this helps   good luck

the reason the article recommends a roth 401k for those who have a long time until retirement is based on your salary marginal tax rates and effective tax rates and some assumptions you want to contribute to roth iras when your marginal tax rate now is better than your effective tax rate at the time of withdrawal   that is most likely to be true when your salary is smaller for you and your salary is most likely to be smaller compared to your future salaries when you have more years until retirement the article is presenting a rule of thumb    it wo n't hold true for everyone in every situation

i have bought and sold 18 homes yes it sounds like a lot some were flips some turned to rentals and we have moved many many times i have had home warranties when the seller offered them in my experience the warranty company does as little as possible   for example hot water heaters you call the warranty company because the hot water heater is making ticking and its running the gas all the time and you still ca n't take a 5 minute shower with out running out of hot water these are all signs that the water heater is full of slide and its gong to blow and flood where ever it happens to be will you get a new hot water heater no you will pay the $ 75 for the service call the warranty company will not replace it because it still works now after it has flooded you basement or garage front hall or where ever then they will replace it but not pay for any damage that has occurred   same for other things you can pay that service fee over and over for some slap stick repair that after all the fees and hassle of missing work to wait on the repair person well it would have been cheaper to just pay for a replacement

you 're right about fica i forgot it is calculated on gross income and not adjusted gross income state tax rate in that bracket still should be nominal or zero depending on the state sales tax things cost what they cost   gt regardless 70 of minimum wage is n't enough to cover a car a child a good vacation a serious health care problem an aging parent or a modest retirement   social safety nets are impossible to address via a minimum wage you could make the minimum wage $ 30/hr and some people will still become bankrupt by our ridiculous healthcare system why not lobby for single payer healthcare and a universal basic income like $ 1000/mo adult and $ 500/mo child

instead of going to the dealership and not knowing if you will be able to get a loan or what the interest rate might be go to a local credit union or bank first before you go car shopping and talk to them about what you would need for your loan   if you can get approval for a loan first then you will know how much you can spend and when it comes time for negotiation with the dealer he wo n't be able to confuse you by changing the loan terms during the process   as far as the dealer is concerned it would be a cash transaction that having been said i ca n't recommend taking a car loan   i of course do n't know you or your situation but there are lots of good reasons for buying a less expensive car and doing what you can to pay cash for it   should you choose to go ahead with the loan i would suggest that you get the shortest loan length that you can afford and aim to pay it off early

the best reason for endorsing a check is in case it is lost if the back is blank a crooked finder could simply write pay to the order of on it and deposit it in his own account you do not need a signature for the endorsement the safest way to endorse a check is to write for deposit only followed by an account number in which case the signature is not needed most businesses make up rubber stamps with this and stamp it the minute they receive a check that way it has no value to anyone else depositing checks is increasingly going the way of the many businesses today use check the business scans the check in sends the digital image to the bank and stores the check i was surprised that chase already has an for iphones that you can use to deposit a check by taking a picture of it

simply put it makes sense from the moment you can afford the loss without negative consequences for example if your car costs $ 20000 and you happen to have another $ 20000 laying around you can choose not to insure your car against damage in the worst case you can simply buy a new one however not insuring your car has a hidden cost you ca n't long term invest that money anymore if your insurance costs $ 500 a year and you can invest those $ 20000 with a return on investment of more than 2.5 it still makes sense to invest that money while having your car insured

the value will certainly fluctuate up and down but on average gain more than a savings account but so long as you have enough liquid assets for emergencies then yes it 's a perfectly good alternative to savings accounts how risky in general are index income funds how are you defining risk if you mean probability that i 'll lose it all then it 's virtually zero   if you mean how much the value can fluctuate then it 's certainly not risk free but it has less volatility that individual stocks   if you take the s&p 500 as a proxy you might expect the change in value over any given year to fluctuate between -30 like 2008 and + 40 with an average change of around 8 there will be funds that have less volatility but produce less return and funds that have more volatility but higher average returns

the question is how do you quantify investment risk as michael s says one approach is to treat investment returns as a random variable bill yale finance professor told me that if you accept that markets are efficient or that the price of an asset reflects it 's underlying value then changes in price represent changes in value so standard deviation naturally becomes the appropriate measure for riskiness of an asset essentially the more volatile an asset the riskier it is there is another school of thought that comes from ben graham and warren buffett which says that volatility is not inherently risky rather risk should be defined as the permanent loss of capital so the riskiness of an asset is the probability of a permanent loss of capital invested   this is easy to do in casino games based on basic probability such as    roulette or slots but what has been done with the various kinds of    investment risks my point is saying that certain bonds are low risk    is n't good enough i 'd like some numbers or at least a range of    numbers and therefore one could calculate expected payoff in the    statistics sense or can it not be done and if not why not investing is more art than science in theory a triple a bond rating means the asset is riskless or nearly riskless but we saw that this was obviously wrong since several of the aaa mortgage backed securities mbs went under prior to the recent us recession more recently the current threat of default suggests that bond ratings are not entirely accurate since us treasuries are considered riskless assets   investors often use bond ratings to evaluate investments a bond is considered investment grade if it 's or higher to adequately price bonds and evaluate risk there are too many factors to simply refer to a chart because things like the issuer credit quality liquidity risk systematic risk and risk all play a factor   another factor you have to consider is the overall portfolio markowitz showed that adding a riskier asset can actually lower the overall risk of a portfolio because of diversification this is all under the assumption that risk = variance which i think is bunk   i 'm aware that wall street is nothing like roulette but then again    there must be some math and heavy economics behind calculating risk    for individual investors this is after all what quants are paid    to do in part is it all voodoo i suspect some of it is but not all    of it quants are often involved in high frequency trading as well but that 's another note there are complicated risk management products such as the system by blackrock which incorporate modern portfolio theory markowitz fama sharpe etc and financial formulas to manage risk   's risk management covers some of the concepts applied   i also tend to think that when people point to the last x number of    years of stock market performance that is of less value than they    expect even going back to 1900 provides only 110 years of data and    in my view complex systems need more data than those data    points 10,000 years worth of data ok but not 110 any books or articles that address these issues or your own informed    views would be i fully agree with you here a lot of work is done in the santa fe institute to study complex adaptive systems and we do n't have any big clear theory as of yet conventional risk management is based on the ideas of modern portfolio theory but a lot of that is seen to be wrong behavioral finance is introducing new ideas on how investors behave and why the old models are wrong which is why i can not suggest you study risk management and risk models because i and many skilled investors consider them to be largely wrong there are many good books on investing the best of which is benjamin graham 's the intelligent investor although not a book on risk solely it provides a different viewpoint on how to invest and covers how to protect investments via a margin of safety lastly i 'd recommend against the gods by peter bernstein which covers the history of risk and risk analysis it 's not solely a finance book but rather a fascinating historical view of risk and it helps but many things in context hope it helps

my point was that we have the safest debt for right i agree that we can still afford to spend money to fix the economy the problem is that the spending we have been doing so far is n't doing a whole lot considering what we are investing we have spent trillions and our gdp growth rate is two thirds what it was over the last 70 years if we were still at the beginning of the recovery that could be acceptable but it 's been three and a half years now we are going to need to start getting some bang for our buck to turn this around   if we are still doing the same thing two years from now investors may not have faith in the safety of the united states anymore they will realize we have taken on 30 years of deficits and then taken trillions more to save the economy if we are still stagnant the world will start to question how great our economy really is and whether we even deserve the world reserve currency   so yes i agree that we currently have the safest debt in the world and can try to save our economy through deficit spending i did off on a tangent but i think it was a necessary point we need to make sure that the deficit spending we do from here on in actually creates real value for the economy and gets real gdp growth    the reason i am sick of the argument is that many people seem to have this idea that the u.s. will always have the reserve currency and the world will always consider it to be the safest debt we can keep going this way for now but if we do n't back up that claim then sooner or later they wo n't buy it anymore i agree with the government spending but we need to spend in areas that are going to generate real gdp growth rather than randomly building projects and hoping for the best   edit so in other words i think i agree with you i just want to make sure people understand how things can get in the future and we do n't all buy into a sense of entitlement that we can spend whatever we want forever

you need to know that the loan will cost you additional money every month you need to know how you are going to pay that overhead in addition to what you 're already paying the best answer is to reduce your spending to build up a reserve you feel comfortable with and then not spend that reserve except in emergencies if you need a short term answer i 'd suggest borrowing from relatives failing that i 'd suggest talking to a bank about establishing a line of credit but not drawing upon it until and unless you have absolutely no other choice that gives you a option when you need it at usually a much much better rate than credit cards without costing you anything until and unless you actually do need the money and if you do n't have it set up to kick in automatically on overdrafts without making it so easy to get to that you 're tempted to use it before you must

when you sell the stock your income is from the difference of prices between when you bought the stock and when you sold it there 's no interest there the interest is in two places the underlying company assets which you own whether you want it or not and in the distribution of the income to the owners the dividends you can calculate which portion of the interest income constitutes your dividend by allocating the portions of your dividend in the proportions of the company income that would very roughly and of course give you an estimate what portion of your dividend income derives from the interest underlying assets include all the profits of the company that have n't been distributed through dividends but rather reinvested back into the business these may or may not be reflected in the market price of the company bottom line is that there 's no direct correlation between the income from the sale of the stake of ownership and the company income from interest if any correlation at all exists why would you care about interest income of salesforce its not a bank or a lender they may have some interest income but that 's definitely not the main income source of the company if you want to know how much interest income exactly the company had you 'll have to dig deep inside the quarterly and annual reports and even then i 'm not sure if you 'll find it as a separate item for a company that 's not in the lending business

fica taxes are separate from federal and state income taxes as a sole proprietor you owe all of those   additionally there is a difference with fica when you are employed vs. self employed   typically fica taxes are actually split between the employer and the employee so you pay half they pay half but when you 're self employed you pay both halves this is what is commonly referred to as the self employment tax if you are both employed and self employed as i am your employer pays their portion of fica on the income you earn there and you pay both halves on the income you earn in your business edit as @joetaxpayer added in his comment you can specify an extra amount to be withheld from your pay when you fill out your w-4 form this is separate from the calculation of how much to withhold based on dependents and such see line 6 on the linked form this could allow you to avoid making quarterly estimated payments for your self employment income i think this is much easier when your side income is predictable personally i find it easier to come up with a percentage i must keep aside from my side income for me this is about 35 and then i immediately set that aside when i get paid i make my quarterly estimated payments out of that money set aside   my side income can vary quite a bit though if i could predict it better i would probably do the extra withholding yes you need to pay taxes for fica and federal income tax   i ca n't say exactly how much you should withhold though if you have predictable deductions and such it could be lower than you expect i 'm not a tax professional and when it comes doing business taxes i go to someone who is you do n't have to do that but i 'm not comfortable offering any detailed advice on how you should proceed there i mentioned what i do personally as an illustration of how i handle withholding but i ca n't say that that 's what someone else should do

cfd 's are highly speculative so they should represent a very small proportion of your asset or less if you need the 100 for food or rent then definitely not   however if you have some money spare that you could afford to will definitely need more than 100 and you are prepared to put the time and effort it to learn and manage your risks carefully then there is no reason why you should n't try it   i would advise against trading on a demo account for learning most of what you need to learn is how to stick to your plan while under emotional pressure i also would n't call it gambling but managing risk the best traders only win half of their trades so they might have a losing streak of 5 10 or 20 trades if they are trading 5 of their capital with each trade then poof they 're out their winning trades might make 10 100 times the amount risked so they know that it is more profitable to always only risk around 1 sticking to that requires discipline    this page has a pretty comprehensive introduction

as i understand it us federal gift tax does n't kick in at all until one person gives more than about $ 14,000 in a single year so a couple can give someone $ 28,000 if you want to give more than that in a lump sum while avoiding gift tax one workaround is to structure it as an intra family loan basically you write and formally register a loan for the amount then gift them with up to the limit for them to pay off that loan the irs requires that you charge interest on this loan but the rates are pretty minimal and of course you can incorporate that in the gift the downside is that the interest income you 're required to take is taxable but that 's a small sum on the other hand if the loan is a mortgage against real property and properly filed as such the interest paid may be deductable for the person you 're giving the money to doing this properly requires a tax accountant or lawyer who has a clue about the right legalese to make it work however there are starting to be some services which specialize in this doing it for a fixed fee i used one of those recently which is why i 'm somewhat familiar with this process they made it about as much of a fill out the forms process as they could but it still took a few weeks for me to figure out which options were best for my needs

i 'm no accountant but i think the way i 'd want to approach this kind of thing in gnucash would be to track it as an asset since it is it sounds like your actual concern is that your tracked asset value is n't reflecting its current market value presumably because it 's risky it 's also illiquid so you 're not sure how much value it should have on your books your approach suggested here of having it as just as expense gives it a 0 value as an asset but without tracking that there 's something that you own the two main approaches to tracking an investment in gnucash are of course both of these approaches do assume that you have some notion of your investment 's current value which is what you 're tracking as the section on estimating valuation of the concepts guide says of valuing illiquid assets there is no hard rule on this and in fact different accountants may prefer to do this differently if you really think that the investment is n't worth anything at the moment then i suppose you should track it at 0 but presumably you think it 's worth something or you would n't have bought it right even if it 's just for your personal records part of a regular maybe annual review of your investments should include coming up with what you currently value that investment at perhaps your best guess of what you could sell it for assuming that you could find a willing buyer and updating your records accordingly of course if you need a valuation for a bank or for tax purposes or the like they have more specific rules about how they are tracking what things are worth but presumably you 're trying to track your personal assets for your own reasons to get a handle on what you currently own so do that take the time to get a handle on the worth of what you currently own and do n't worry about getting the value wrong just take your best guess since you can always update it later when you learn new information about what your investment is worth

yes   the simplest option to track your spending over time is to familiarize yourself with the reports menu on the   take a look specifically at the reports > income expense > income statement report which will sum up your income and spending over a time frame defaults to the current year in each report that you run there is an options button at the top of the screen   open that and look on the general tab you 'll be able to set the time frame that the report displays if you wanted to set it for the 2 week block since your last paycheck for example   other features you 're going to want to familiarize yourself with are the expense charts statements the cash flow report and the budgeting interface which is relatively new although there is a bit of a learning curve to using this last feature most of the good ideas when it comes to tracking your spending are independent of the software you 're using but can be augmented with a good financial tracking program   for example in our household we have multiple credit cards which we pay in full every month   we selected our cards on specific benefits that they provide such as one card which has a category for cash back at certain business types   we keep that card set on restaurants and put all of our eating out expenses on that card   we have other cards for groceries gas etc   this makes it easy to see how much we 've spent in a given category and correlates well with the account structure in gnucash

i 'm not the op but i 'm happy to give a brief overview   basically pre jobs act there were a lot of limits on who could make an equity investment in a non public company i.e. a startup or even a hedge fund there were some loopholes but basically you had to be an accredited investor an accredited investor was someone who either has made $ 200,000 + $ 300,000 + for married people for the past two years and expects to make that much again in the current year alternately they could have a net worth of $ 1 million excluding the value of their primary residence there was also a limit of 500 investors for a non public company before the company had to become public they did n't really have to ipo but they did have to file their financials with the sec so the effect was basically the same finally non public companies were prohibited from seeking investment through advertising basically they could n't take out an ad in a paper or event send a mass email and say hey we 're looking to raise a $ 1 million funding round contact us if you 're interested   okay now after the jobs act   the jobs act changed a the number and type of investors who could make equity investments in a non public company b the regulation of advertising for investments   post jobs private companies could have 2,000 shareholders and 500 of those could be unaccredited e.g. regular people like you and i the change in the number of shareholders is n't really that important because it 's just shareholders of record but that 's another post for another day there are still some requirements for unaccredited shareholder which i do n't remember off the top of my head i think you have to have income of at least $ 40k they also changed the solicitation ban so it 's possible that you might see an ad in the wsj someday for a startup company venture capital fund hedge fund etc   there are some other things it changed but imo those are the two most important

this sounds very like disguised employment you act like an employee of the company but your official relationship with them is as a contractor you gain none of the protection you get from being an employee and this may make you cheaper less risky and more desirable for the company who is hiring you   depending on your country you may also pay corporation tax rather than income tax which may represent a very significant saving also the company hiring you may not have to pay paye national insurance stakeholder pension etc this arrangement is normal and legal providing you genuinely are acting as a subcontractor however if you are behaving as an employee desk at the company company email have to work specific hours in a specific location no ability to subcontract etc you may be classified as a disguised employee in the uk it used to be common practice for highly paid employees to set up shell companies to avoid tax this will now get you into hot water google it sounds like your relationship in this case is directly with the recruiter you will have to consider if the recruiter is acting as your employer or if you remain a genuinely independent agent the duration of your contract with the recruiter will have a bearing on this in the uk there are a whole series of tests for disguised employment this is a good arrangement provided you go in with your eyes open and an awareness of the legislation   however you should absolutely check the rules that apply in your country before entering into this agreement you could potentially be very badly indeed

i wrote about the dynamic of why either of a lower or higher exchange rate would be good for economies in would dropping the value of its currency be good for an economy a strong currency allows consumers to    import goods cheaply from the rest of    the world   a weak currency allows    producers to export goods cheaply to    the rest of the world   people are    both consumers and producers     clearly there have to be trade offs strong or weak mean relative to purchasing power parity i.e. you can buy more or less of an equivalent good with the same money governments worrying about unemployment will try and push their currencies weaker relative to others no matter the cost   there will be an inflationary impact imported inputs cost more as a currency weakens but a country running a major surplus like china can afford to subsidise these costs

but i do n't see how it 's any different than buying a stock at a low price and holding on to it for some months based on your question i would say the difference is time day trading by its nature is a endeavor if you buy low and are planning to sell high then you only have a few hours to make this happen as a previous poster mentioned there is a lot of white noise that occurs on a weekly daily hourly min basis long term investors have the time to wait it out although as a side note if you were a buy and hold investor from the 1960s early 1980s then buy and hold was not very good is it just the psychological addictive aspect of it this is the biggest reason day trading is stressful and stress can cause financially destructive decisions such as over leveraging over trading etc why is day trading stressful because you are managing hundreds to thousands of trades a year when combined with the lack of time in a day to make moves it becomes stressful also many day traders do it full time which adds to the pressure to be correct and to be incredible at money a lot of buy and hold investors have full time jobs and may only check their positions every month or so

hopefully is a very good term    it remains a fact because in the current scenario of low growth companies do n't see much of a reason to invest and all evidence points agrees    so what are companies doing with all the extra cash they are getting from the rich they are either buying back their own shares which is a or they are doing mergers and buyouts which are both at record highs at the moment here too evidence points that neither of these are actual productive activities share buy backs only inflate the share price without actually changing the market cap as there are less shares in the market mergers have a strong track record of being expensive and ultimately bad investments that do more to erode value than they do to increase it    then of course there are the fees from the finance industry that are from these investments share buy backs and mergers that are just added into the spinning wheel without actually impacting the real economy

i see a lot of answers with incomes that are much higher than yours here is something for your situation if you would keep your current income for the rest of your life here is approximately how things would turn out after 40 years all interest is calculated relative to the amount in your portfolio therefore lets start with 1 dollar for 40 years with your current income 15 would be dollar at 12 this would over 40 years get you almost 1 million dollar i would call a required return of more than 12 not likely the good news is that your income will likely increase and especially if this happens fast things will start to look up   the bad news is that your current salary is quite low so it basically means that you need to make some big jumps in the next few years in order to make this scenario likely if you can quickly move your salary towards ranges that are more common in the us then 15 of your income can build up to a million before you retire however if you just follow gradual growth you would need to get quite lucky to reach a million   note that even if reaching a million appears unlikely it is probably still a good idea to save

this comment is too long to put in comments sorry i suggest you also do a dry run of your taxes with the rental as part of it when you rent a house you take depreciation each year this means that even if you are breaking even the rent paying the mortgage property tax etc you may still show a tax loss in which case planning and knowing this might suggest you adjust your withholding so instead of a large refund you get better cash flow each month   also pull a copy of schedule e and the instructions you 'll be wiser for having read them   last if you have decent equity in the existing house it may pay to refinance to save a bit there or even pull some cash out when you buy the new one you want to be in the best position you can be and not risk cutting it too close

this depends on what the alternative is your loan of .99 is very favorable rate if you have the 15,000 right now but only hold it in your checking account or cash then you might as well just pay it all you have an adequate emergency fund paying the debt off sooner will save you on interest currently if you pay the minimum you will pay a total of $ by the end of the loan a $ 230 premium to $ 15,000 math credit goes to   joe if you have an investment vehicle you feel can successfully yield more then .99 you might want to consider investing that money instead while paying the minimum on your car loan also be sure to check the .99 is not an introductory rate which increases later on it comes down to whether you can get a better return then .99 investing that money or whether you rather just pay off the debt and not worry about it if you do n't want to bother investing the money than just pay it off i also assumed you have no other revolving debt with a higher apr if you do first pay off the higher apr debt

i would put about a month 's worth of expenses in the highest paying savings account that you find convenient to access for the rest i recommend ally 's high yield cds specifically the 5-year option normally 5 years would be way too long to commit short term savings to a cd however the ally cds allow you to break them for a penalty of only two months worth of interest if you look at the graph below from when the rates were apy you can see the effective interest rate at every possible time you break the cd early doing the math if you can keep your savings in the account for at least four months it will outperform any other current fdic backed investment that i am aware of for the length of time the money was invested   credit

i separate them out simply because they 're for different purposes with different goals and time frames and combining them may mask hidden problems in either the retirement account or the regular account consider an example a young investor has been working on their retirement planning for a few years now and has a modest amount of retirement savings say $ 15,000 allocated carefully according to one of the usually recommended schemes a majority exposure to large cap u.s. stocks with smaller exposures to small cap international and bond markets years before however they mad an essentially emotional investment in a struggling manufacturer of niche personal computers which then enjoyed something of a renaissance and a staggering growth in shareholder value lets say their current holdings in this company now represent $ 50,000 combining them their portfolio is dominated by large cap u.s. equities to such an extent that the only way to rebalance their portfolio is to pour money into bonds and the international market for years on end this utterly changes the risk profile of their retirement account at the same time if we switch the account balances the investor might be that their asset allocation is fine and diversified even though the assets they have access to before retirement are entirely in a single risky stock in neither case is the investor well served by combining their funds when figuring out their allocation especially as the goal allocations may very well be different

consider the opportunity cost of the extra repayment on a 15 year loan   if you owe money at 30 p.a and money at 4 p.a then it is a no brainer that the 30 loan gets paid down first consider too that if the mortgage is not tax deductable and you pay income tax that you do not pay tax on money you save i.e. in the extreme $ 1 saved is $ 2 earned forward thinking is key if you are paying for someone 's college now then you would want to pay out of an education plan for which contributions are tax deductable money in money out in my country most mortgages be they years tend to last 6 8 years for the lender people move or flip or re finance   i would take the 15 for the interest rate but only if i could sustain the payments without hardship maybe a more modest home    if you can not afford the higher repayments you are probably sailing a bit close to the wind anyway    another thing to consider is that tax benefits can be altered with the stroke of a pen but you may still have to meet repayments

the rule of thumb i have always heard and what we rent our rental house at is 1 per month at the minimum in the us the rent has to cover the mortgage the property taxes the homeowners insurance your income taxes on the rent the maintenance of the property and the times when the property is vacant even at 1 per month that does n't leave a whole lot of profit compared to what you put in   i have no idea why anybody would buy a rental property in australia if all they could get is 5 per year before expenses they could n't possibly be making money in that investment not to mention the of getting late night phone calls because something broke in the rental house no way i would make that investment

even though this is n't really personal finance related i still feel like there are some misconceptions here that could be addressed i do n't know where you got the phrase pass through insurance from   what you 're describing is a self funded plan   in a self funded arrangement an employer contracts a third party administrator tpa usually one of the big health insurance carriers to use it 's provider network process and claims etc   in addition to the tpa there will be some sort of stop loss insurance coverage on each participant   stop loss coverage usually provides a maximum amount of risk on a given member and on the entire population for a given month and/or year and/or lifetime   the employer 's risk is in between the plan deductible and the stop loss coverage assuming the stop loss does n't have a maximum almost all of the claim dollars in a given plan will come from very very few people   these costs typically arise out of very unforeseen diagnoses not chronic issues   a cancer patient can easily cost $ 1,000,000 in a year   someone 's diabetes maintenance medicine or other chronic maintenance will cost no where near what a surgery will in a year if we take a step back there are really four categories of employer insurance small group is tightly regulated   usually plan premiums are filed with a state authority there is no negotiating your group 's underwriting performance has zero impact on your premiums    employers have no way of obtaining any medical claim information on employees mid market is a pooled arrangement   the overall pool has a total increase and your particular group performs better or worse than the pool which may impact premiums   employers get very minor claims data things like the few highest claims or number of claims over a certain threshold but no employee specific information large group is a mostly arrangement   generally your group receives it 's own rating based on its individual underwriting performance   in general the carrier is some risk to a stop loss carrier and employer 's get a fair amount of insight in to claims though again not with employee names self funded is obviously self contained   the employer sets up a claims checking account   the tpa has draft authority on the account   the employee 's typically have no idea the plan is self funded their id cards will have the carrier logo and the carrier deals with them just as it would any other member   generally when a company is this size it has a separate benefits committee those few people will have some level of insight in to claims performance and stop loss activity   this committee will have nothing to do with the hiring process there are some new partially self funded arrangements which is just a really low threshold   and relatively expensive stop loss program that 's becoming somewhat popular in the mid market group size as employers attempt to reduce medical spend    i think when you start thinking on a micro single employee level you really lose sight of the big picture   why would an employer hire this guy who has this disease chronic problem that costs $ 50,000 per year   and logically you can get to the conclusion that with a self funded plan it literally costs the company the money so the company has an incentive not to hire the person   i understand the logic of the argument but at the self funded level the plan is typically costing north of half a million dollars each month   so a mid level hr hiring manager 1 is n't aware of specific plan claims or costs and is not part of the benefits executive committee 2 wo n't be instructed to screen for health deficiencies because it 's against the law 3 a company generally wo n't test the water here because $ 50,000 per year is less than 1 of the company 's annual medical expenses 4 $ 50,000 is well below the cost to litigate a discrimination law suit     really the flaw in your thought process is that $ 50,000 in annual medical expense is a lot   a harsh child birth can run in the $ 250,000 range so these companies never hire women   or never hire men who could add a spouse who 's in child bearing years   or never hire women who might have a female spouse who could be in child bearing years   a diagnosis will ratchet up $ 1,000,000 in a year   spend a bit of time in intensive care for $ 25,000 per day and you 're fired   a few thousand bucks on diabetes meds is n't anything relative to the annual cost of your average self funded plan the second flaw is that the hiring managers get insight in to specific claims   they do n't third you do n't hand over medical records on your resume anyway i typed this out in one single draft and have no intention of editing anything   i just wanted paint a broad picture i 'm sure things can be nit picked or focused on

it depends on how much equity you have in your home scenario 1 your home is worth $ 100 k and your current mortgage is for $ 100 k or more which means you are underwater in this case you ca n't get a 2nd mortgage because that being said you can use different portions of equity in your home as collateral for multiple mortgages as long as none of the equity overlaps but you may need permission from the primary mortgage bank first for example scenario 2 your home is worth $ 100 k and your current mortgage is for $ 80 k meaning you currently have $ 20 k in equity it is possible to get a 2nd mortgage or home equity line of credit for $ 20k. as a side note if your loan agent is telling you to use a different bank it sounds like she is trying and willing to do something shady if you are in scenario 1 i 'd find a new agent

a bailout is money from the government to keep open a business that is no longer viable and by rights deserves to fail   what happened in this case was different all banks rely on the overnight bank lending market for liquidity it is the grease that oils the wheels of international banking that is not a sign of weakness or it is just standard banking practice in 2008 during the failure of bear stearns and the lehman shock the overnight lending market simply stopped operating as nobody knew who they could trust and as a result nobody trusted anybody something needed to temporarily replace this overnight lending until the crisis was over this is what that cash infusion was it was not a bailout

i concur with pretty much what everyone else said let me break it down in a concrete plan of action   first though note that at least the minimum payments for the credit cards needs to be on this list of fixed expenses also you have $ remaining in a normal month food could be $ 500 or more easily for a family so find out how much   adding in just those 2 things and you 're already at your max and there are other expenses in life    ok cutting from the top gone pure luxury and between netflix hulu and your    internet connection hook your computer to the tv there 's no need    for it $ 80 savings   cell phones you 're already moving in the right direction but not    far enough in a financial crunch why does your stay at home wife have    a cell especially when she could just as easily use google voice for    free both plans gone replaced by one of the $ 105    savings total $ savings   529 plans of course you want to save for your kids college but it    does n't help them for you to drown financially gone until your credit    card debit is too $ 50 savings $ total ok we 're already up to $ in savings just cutting items you do n't need that probably gets you back into the black but why stop there   trimming expenses   electric ok i know it 's summer but can you cut this back is the    thermostat set as high as you can comfortably bear are you diligent    in turning of lights especially incandescent do you turn off your    computer when you 're not using it see if you can get the electric    down by 10 that 's $ savings does n't seem like much but it    adds up   gas same with gas do you have gas hot water if so cut shower    length saves on water too   food this one you did n't list but as i said you could be spending    $ 500 or $ 600 a month easily for a family do you guys plan meals and    thus plan shopping trips if not do it you 'll be surprised how much    you can save either way 10 reduction should be doable that 's    $ 50/month if you do n't plan now 20 is within reach that 's    $ 100/month ok that may have added as much as $ 130 or so if so you 're now up to $ savings that 's like a 15 raise   simply cutting however is only half the plan you want to improve your situation so you can get the back assuming you 'll even want it at that point and the wife 's cell phone for starters   to do that you 've got to nail down that debt i figure you 've got minimum $ in debt payments that 's not including your mortgage and including an assumed $ minimum credit card payments you pay over 21 of your take home to short term and consumer debt   yea that 's why you 're hurting here 's what you do   in both cases apply the extra payments entirely to one balance at a    time pick either the smallest balance psychologically best because    you quickly see a loan it 's payment or the highest    interest mathematically the best roll each regular payment that 's paid off into the extra debt payments you did n't list total debt balances but you did say you had $ 4000 in    credit card debt applying an extra $ to debt out of that    $ savings plus two extra paychecks of $ 1300 each is $    paid off in under a year you could have those credit cards paid off and likely that window loan too start the 529s again but keep going    paying down the rest when you have the car paid off bring back the    wife 's cell you and i both know that 's going to be 1 on the list     then finish off those student loans   then in the extra $ 21 of your income you 'll have in sweet sweet green cash

i think the issue you are having is that the option value is not a flow but rather a liability that changes value over time it is best to illustrate with a balance sheet the $ 33 dollars would be the premium net of expense that you would receive from your brokerage for having shorted the options this would be your asset the liability is the right for the option owner the person you sold it to to exercise and purchase stock at a fixed price at the moment you sold it the marked to market value of that option is $ 40 hence you are at a net account value of $ $ which is the commission over time as the price of that option changes the value of your account is simply $ 33 since each option contract is for 100 shares in your example above this implies that the option price is 20 cents so if i were to redo the chart it would look like this if the next day the option value goes to 21 cents your liability would now be = $ 42 dollars in a sense 2 dollars have been debited from your account to cover your potential liability since you also own the stock there will be a credit from that line item not shown at the expiry of your option since you are selling covered calls if you were to be exercised on the loss on the option and the gain on the shares you own will net off the final cost basis of the shares you sold will be adjusted by the premium you 've received you will simply be selling your shares at strike + premium per share 0.20 cents in this example

i use two measures to define investment risk what 's the longest period of time over which this investment has had negative returns what 's the worst case fall in the value of this investment peak to trough i find that the former works best for long term investments like retirement as a concrete example i have most of my retirement money in equity since the has had zero returns over as long as a decade since my investment time frame is longer equity is risk free by this measure for short term investments like money put aside to buy a car next year the second measure works better for this purpose i might choose a debt fund that is n't the safest and has had a worst case 8 loss over the past decade i can afford that loss putting in more money from my pocket to buy the car if needed so i might choose this fund for this purpose taking a slight risk to earn higher return in any case how much money i need for a car can only be a rough guess so having 8 less than originally planned may turn out to be enough or it may turn out that the entire amount originally planned for is insufficient in which case a further 8 shortfall may not be a big deal these two measures i 've defined are simple to explain and understand unlike academic stuff like beta standard deviation information ratio or other jumbo and they are simple to apply to a practical problem as i 've illustrated with the two examples above on the other hand if someone tells me that the standard deviation of a mutual fund is 15 i 'll have no idea what that means or how to apply that to my financial situation all this suffers from the problem of being limited to historical data and the future may not be like the past but that affects any risk statistic and you ca n't do better unless you have a time machine

some of the other answers have commented on this but i particularly want to comment on the your expenses go down at retirement stay the same or go up assumption people often make we assume we 'll spend less in retirement but as david points out in the wealthy barber it 's a myth that present day retired people spend much less money than their working counterparts he cites that reduced expenses like paid off mortgages and children leaving the home usually happen several years before retirement so the last few years at work are characterized by good income levels and reduced expenses in all likelihood disposable income is at its highest point ever furthermore some expenses go up e.g. golfing hobbies traveling all of which cost money healthcare costs often increase as well and goes on to discuss a retiree 's number one enemy inflation so in my mind the answer to that question assumption would be costs will probably go up and 60 80 of retirment income wo n't cut it

so if i understand your plan right this will be your situation after the house is bought total debt here 's what i would do wait until your house sells before buying a new one   that way you can take the equity from that sale and apply it towards the down payment rather than taking a loan on your retirement account    if something happens and your house does n't sell for as as you think it will you 'll lose out on the gains from the amount you borrow which will more than offset the interest you are paying yourself at worst pay off the 401(k loan the instant your sale closes take as much of the remaining equity as you can and start paying down student loans   there are several reasons why they are a higher priority than a mortgage some are mathematical some are not should i look to pay off student loans sooner even if i refi at a lower rate of 3.5 or so or the mortgage earlier    my thoughts are that the student loans follow me for life but i can always sell and buy another home so you want this baggage for the rest of your life   how will it be when you get that off your back   how much investing are you missing out on because of student loan payments   what happens if you get lose your license   what if you become disabled   student loans are not but you can always sell the asset behind a mortgage or car loan   they are worse than credit card debt in that sense   you have no tangible asset behind it and no option for forgiveness unless you decide to practice in a high need area but i do n't get the sense that that 's your path the difference in interest is generally only a few payment worth over 15 years is the interest amortized the same as a 15 year if i pay a 30 year mortgage in 15 years   yes however the temptation to just pay it off over 30 years is still there   how often will you decide that a bigger car payment or a vacation or something else is more important   with a 15-year note you lock in a plan and stick to it some other options

your heart is in the right place especially since they 've got a kid if you really want to help them have the uncomfortable conversation with them that they need to have about money specifically how to develop and stick to a budget it is a painful but valuable lesson for life   depending on what type of relationship you have with them you can approach it in different ways just giving them friendly advice is perhaps the touch you could have but might not make the impression you need   if they are asking you for money i would personally make it a condition that they work through their personal budget with you and then start living within that budget if you 're lending money it 's not too much to ask to follow their accounts or finances so that you can see that they 're on the right track if you 're a close enough friend you could really walk them through it and help them to develop the habits of estimating how much they will earn in a month estimating how much they should spend in a month   tracking how much they are actually spending and   comparing how much they actually earn with how much they actually spend   doing this every month until they get out of the weeds they should at least do it every 3 months when they 're in good financial shape but even then each month does n't hurt setting them up with something like mint.com if they 're in the us would be a handy place to start you can share the login information with them if they trust you and then they can change it once whatever agreed upon terms come around   it sounds weird i know but i have helped two friends out of credit card debt this way the hardest part is getting around the discomfort taboo shame of them knowing they need help and not wanting to accept it

from my reading of the wikipedia page crt this only happens if you deposit or withdraw currency not checks   the idea behind this is that checks ach etc leave paper trails that can be tracked   cash does n't so it gets this extra level of scrutiny   if get a cashiers check or a money order to pay a bill i do n't think a crt is created   if you withdraw $ 15,000 to buy a car in cash 1 stack of $ 100 bills then a crt would be generated   it still is n't a problem as long as you can show a bill of sale showing where the money went or came from if you are the seller the irs has a faq about this   it says taken from several spots at that page cash is money it is currency and coins of the united states and any other country   a cashier ’s check bank draft traveler ’s check or money order with a face amount of more than $ 10,000 is not treated as cash and a business does not have to file form when it receives them these items are not defined as cash because if they were bought with currency the bank or other financial institution that issued them must file a currency transaction report the exception to this is if you are buying something with a resale value of more than $ 10k with a check money order etc of less than $ 10k

seek professional advice as duffbeer703 has suggested already   very important consider incorporating   if your income will fluctuate year to year you can keep profit in the corporation taxed in its hands at the canadian small business rate since such corporate income below $ 500,000 would likely qualify for the small business deduction you could pay   retained earnings to yourself as dividends over more than one year in order to lessen the personal tax burden if you do n't incorporate all your profits in the year they are earned are taxed at personal income tax rates and with our progressive income tax system taking the tax hit all in one year can be expensive   however if this project is a one off and you 're not likely to continue working like this you might not want the overhead of a corporation   taxes aside there are also legal issues to consider vis a vis incorporating or not a professional can help you make this decision    yes you can claim deductions for reasonable business expenses whether or not you are incorporated no you ca n't do free work on the side and claim it as donations   it 's nice to volunteer but you would n't get a charitable tax credit for your time only for money or goods donated consider opening an rrsp so you can start saving for retirement and get a tax deduction for any contributions you make   this is but one strategy to reduce your tax   there are others   for instance if you are a student you perhaps have some unused tuition credits that you could claim in your first year with higher income oh and seek professional advice

the difference is that for the one year time frame the data is represented based on daily data and the sma is 20 days whilst for the 5 year timeframe the data is automatically represented as weekly data with the sma represented by 20 weeks not 20 days anymore this happens due to daily data on this chart being too much data to represent over a 5 year period so the data defaults to weekly data over such a long period if the chart is represented as weekly data then any indicators will also have to be represented in weekly data if you use a more sophisticated charting program you can actually select to see daily or weekly data over longer periods such as 5 years or more

you do n't want to set up your investment account as a savings or spending budget account   there are a couple of reasons   first investment account balances change daily based on the market   if you set it up as a budget account then your budget category balances would need to have money added or removed from them daily as the market value changes   second because you are investing for retirement this money will be untouchable for many years there is no need to include that in your spending budget instead enter your monthly investment amount as an expense transaction not a transfer to another budget account   if for example you are sending $ 400 per month to your retirement account just enter that as a monthly $ 400 expense out of your checking account assigning it to a retirement category   that money then leaves your budget if you want to see the value of your investment account in ynab so that your net worth is accurate add the account as an investment account   the value will not affect your budget categories but it will affect the net worth on the all accounts page   either set it up as an online account so that the balance will update automatically or add it as a manual account and simply update the balance manually when you get your monthly statement

there is n't a single rate that works in both directions   there are two rates one for each direction   so if $ 1 = inr you may find that 100 inr = $    in fact it 's even worse than that   the rates are just the average values at which transactions occur   what happens in the real world is that someone presumably your bank in this instance offers to sell 100 inr for some amount perhaps $   other traders may either accept this price or refuse to trade   if they refuse to trade the bank may accept one of their offers perhaps $    anyway the answer to your question is that whomever does the actual conversion keeps the difference   of course they may then lose that money if the value falls before they sell   more either your bank or your friend 's bank could do the conversion itself   either or both could hold balances in various currencies so that they do n't have to rely on the of the exchange market   this is called a money market account and banks let their customers invest in them    it is a bit more likely to be your bank that gets the money than your friend 's bank   your friend 's bank does n't actually need to know that your account is in usd   they just transfer the amount in inr   it 's your bank that has to convert that into usd to deposit in your account

okay so i am going to break this answer into a couple sections okay so first things first did you get a good deal this is challenging to answer for a number of reasons first a good deal is relative to the buyers goals if you 're attempting to buy an asset that provides passive income then maybe you met your goal and got a good deal if you 're attempting to buy an asset that provides long term growth and you purchased above market i 'm speculating of course then you may have made a bad deal so how do you determine if you got a good deal does your gross rental multiplier equal that or is less than that of the average in your area the lower the better   so how do you use the to determine if you 're getting a good deal divide your purchase price by the average city or area and that will tell you what you should be getting annually in rent   you can also use the to determine if a future purchase is over or under priced just replace purchase price with asking price   alright so these are the tools you can use to decide if you made a bad business deal or not there are many ways to skin a cat so to speak these are the tools i use before i purchase a home many people are penny wise and pound foolish take your time when making large purchases it 's okay to say pass   okay next thing is this new purchase you 're looking at the number one rule when working a franchise is you do n't open a second store until you have a perfect working model to go off of if you 've never had to file a tax return for your current rental then you need to wait if you 've never read your local and state rental laws then you need to wait if you 've never had to leave an event early wake up in the middle of the night or get a text while you 're on a date from one of your tenants then you need to wait give it a year or two just learn the unknown about rental properties use your first as your test bed it 's way more cheaper then if you make a bad mistake and roll it over multiple properties   finally i will leave you with this no one on this site myself included knows everything there is to know about real estate anyone that claims they do send their ass packing this is a complex complex business there is always something to learn and if you do n't have the passion to continue learning then hand it off to someone who does there is tax law rental law city repair law contract law and this does n't even include the stuff that makes you money like knowing how to leverage low or no money down loans   please take some time and go out and learn   good luck

of the two an option is a more reliable but more expensive means to get rid of a stock as sdg said a put option is basically an insurance policy on the stock you pay a certain price for the contract itself which locks in a sale price up to a particular future date if the stock depreciates significantly you exercise the option and get the contract price otherwise you let the contract expire and keep the stock long term these are bad bets as each expired contract will offset earnings but if you foresee a near term steep drop in the stock price but are n't quite sure a put option is good peace of mind a sell stop order is generally cheaper but less reliable you set a trigger price say a loss of 10 of the stock 's current value if that threshold is reached the stop order becomes a sell order and the broker will sell the stock on the market take his commission or a fixed price depending on your broker and you get the rest however there has to be a buyer willing to buy at that price at the moment the trigger fires if a stock has lost 10 rapidly it 's probably on the way down hard and the order might not complete until you realize a 12 loss or a 15 or even 20 a sell stop limit a combination stop order and limit order allows you to say that you want to sell if the stock drops to $ x but not sell if it drops below $ x y. this allows you to limit realized losses by determining a band within which it should be sold and not to sell above or below that price these are cheaper because you only pay for the order if it is executed successfully if you never need it it 's free or very cheap some brokers will charge a token service fee to maintain a stop or stop limit however if the price drops very quickly or you specify too narrow a band the stock can drop through that band too quickly to execute the sell order and you end up with a severely depreciated stock and an unexercised order this can happen if the company whose stock you own buys another company very quickly both stocks will adjust the buying company will often plummet inside a few seconds after news of the merger is announced based on the steep drop in working capital and/or the infusion of a large amount of new stock in the buying company to cover the equity of the purchased company you end up with devalued stock and a worthless option but one company buying another is not usually reason to sell if the purchase is a good idea their stock will recover another option which may be useful to you is a swaption this basically amounts to buying a put option on one financial instrument and a call on another rolled into one option contract specifying a swap this allows you to pick something you think would rise if your stock fell and exchange your stock for it at your option for example say the stock on which you buy this swaption is an airline stock and you contract the option to swap for oil if oil surges the airline 's stock will tank sharply and you win both ways avoiding loss and realizing a gain you 'd also win if either half of this option realized a gain over the option price oil could surge or the airline could tank and you could win you could even do this naked since its your option if the airline 's stock tanks you buy it at the crashed price to exercise the option and then do so the downside is a higher option cost the seller will be no fool so if your position appears to be likely anyone who 'd bet against you by selling you this option will want a pretty high return

why do people keep talking about 401 k 's at work   that is not dollar cost averaging   dca refers to when you have a large sum of money   do you invest it all at once or spread it out over several smaller purchases over a period of time   there really is n't a when should i use it   it is simply a matter of where your preferences lie on the risk reward   dca has lower risk and lower reward than lump sum investing   in my opinion i do n't like it   dca only works better than lump sum investing if the price drops   but if you think the price is going to drop why are you buying the stock in the first place example your uncle wins the lottery and gives you $ 50,000   do you buy $ 50,000 worth of apple now or do you buy $ 10,000 now and $ 10,000 a quarter for the next four quarters if the stock goes up you will make more with lump than you will with dca if the stock goes down you will lose more with ls than you will with dca if the stock goes up then down you will lose more with dca than you will with ls if the stock goes down then up you will make more with dca than you will with ls so it 's a tradeoff   but like i said the whole point of you buying the stock is that you think it 's going to go up so why pick the strategy that performs worse in that scenario

there is no formula for calculating a stock price based on the financials of a company a stock price is set by the market and always has a component built into it that is based on something outside of the current valuation of a company using its financials essentially the stock price of a company per share is whatever the best price it can get on the open market if you are looking at how to evaluate if a stock is a good value at the current price then look at some of the answers but i wanted to answer this based on the way you phrased the question

it seems that you 're interested in an asset which you can hold that would go up when the gold price went down it seems like a good place to start would be an index fund which invests in the general stock market when the gold market falls this would mainly affect gold mining companies these do not make up a sizable portion of any index fund which is invested broadly in the market unfortunately in order to act on this you would also have to believe that the stock market was a good investment    to test this theory i looked at an etf index fund which tracks the s&p 500 and compared it to an etf which invests in gold   i found that the daily price movements of the stock market were positively correlated with the price of gold this result was statistically significant   the weekly price movements of the stock market were also correlated with the price of gold this result was also statistically significant   when the holding period was stretched to one month there was still a positive relationship between the stock market 's price moves and the price of gold this result was not statistically significant   when the holding period was stretched to one year there was a negative relationship between the price changes in the stock market and the price of gold   this result was not statistically significant either

the government wants money and is n't particularly interested in you getting your deductions right doing the worksheet on the back of the w-4 will give you a much better idea of how many deductions you can take while many people are excited to get a tax refund a refund means you loaned the government money all year long without getting paid interest for your generosity the irs will penalize you for underpaying your taxes in amounts larger than $ 1000 or 10 of your income but a good ballpark estimate aiming for about ~$100 in payment at tax time is a relatively safe way to get all your money sooner than later

i agree that high volatility just means the underlying stock price fluctuates more and it does not imply if the stock is going up or down but a high volatility in the price of an underlying also means that there is a higher chance that the underlying price could reach extreme prices albeit in either direction however if you purchased a call option then if the underlying price reached an extremely high value then you will be rewarded but if the underlying price reached an extremely low value you wo n't lose any more than the initial premium that you paid there is no additional risk on your side it 's capped to the premium that you paid for the call option it 's this asymmetric outcome heads i win tails i do n't lose combined with high volatility that means that call options will increase in value when the underlying price becomes more volatile if the optionality was n't there then the price would n't be related to the volatility of the underlying but that would be called a future or a forward

do you want to split expenses of the new apartment or split your income assets equally too as for instance with a marriage where no sort of yours mine and ours are split out i 'm going to assume you have beliefs similar to me in my answer in that you desire to split expenses of the new place but do n't suddenly want to split all of your assets and income 50/50 too so here 's how i 'd approach this i am somewhat unsure of what you mean by living expenses for your flat does this mean the cost of ownership per month what it takes to not get rid of the place and no portion of this is interest mortgage to make the calculations a little simpler i 'll assume that all the money you pay out as expenses is just gone none of it remains as equity or is dis proportionally accumulating value in some other such way so you move in with your girlfriend the cost for her place the place itself taxes utilities whatever is per month so since you are both getting equal use of the place you would split this into 3946 per month for each of you that 's it well i do n't see how that really matters at all anymore than if you owned a company or stocks and bonds if you rent it out for less per month than it costs you i do n't see why your girlfriend should take any part of the loss conversely if you make more money per month than it costs you that is your investment profit the payment you get for owning the apartment and dealing with renting it out now if your girlfriend is going to partner with you in handling renting out the apartment you own and you want to look at this as an investment partnership then you should pay all expenses out of the income first and then you can split the profit if you really want one question to ask would be what if you just sold your apartment completely would you give your girlfriend have the money from the sale if not then i do n't see why you would split the investment profit from holding on to the place while this is what i recommend and would feel comfortable with personally and if the situation was reversed and it was my girlfriend that owned a place and was moving in with me ultimately this is about your personal values beliefs and relationship you are very wise to seek something that both of you will find fair and so you should discuss a proposed arrangement with your girlfriend and see if you are on the same page if you are both fine with the agreement and feel ok with it then great none of us have to like or agree with it because we are n't a part of your relationship psychologically and financially this situation seems the most reasonable to me but ymmv after some more thought and from comments i realize that it 's probably best to explore a few possibilities numerically so i 'll run a few sets of numbers which may help pick which one is right for your relationship this is approximately the same as paying her rent for getting to live with her you pay her for sharing her place splitting the expense 3946 paid to you she pays the other 3946 for her place financially it 's like being room mates you can do whatever you want with your place rent or sell hold on to it for security etc this deal makes your girlfriend financially better off by 3946 the financial advantage to you is wholly dependent on what you do with your place   this option would give you each the most financial independence which is why i like it but you might be keen on being more interdependent   which leads us to the next option here you behave as before in splitting her expenses but you include renting out your place as part of the deal let 's say you get 10k a month for it you pay the expenses on that place from the rent then you have left as profit you split the profits monthly to each of you   there 's a bit of problem here though what happens when the place is vacant do you share the full expense of the rent so she 'd actually be paying you each month while it sits open what about repairs taxes costs and credits etc   i would recommend instead what you do if you go this way to account for the apartment as an investment and do n't pay out any of the profits right away all rents stay in their own account and you pay expenses from that same account for you both it 's like it does n't exist accept it is a nice earning asset when you decide it has accumulated more than enough to pay for itself and has enough money to cover vacancy repairs etc then when you pull out money for the duration you are together you just pay it out to both of you equally you might also pull this equity out and spend it on something for both of you like a nice vacation etc something you both enjoy so you are still sharing the profits i do n't object to this and it could be a nice arrangement i would only note that this makes you have a personal relationship you live together as roommates and now you are co landlords business partners that 's a lot of types of relationships and i can tell you from personal experience each type has it 's own stresses and this sort of stress can stack or if you do n't handle it well multiply so just make sure you are both clear what sort of responsibility you are really both signing up for up front and what you 'd do if you part   combine your apartment expenses which would equal so that 's cost to each of you a month if you rent your place then whatever money you get you split and whatever costs come up repairs cleaning etc you would also split so if you get an average of 10000 a month for the apartment you each are paying living expenses of total   but notice that this is n't exactly equal either you will pay less per month than you are now and she will pay less than she was before   there 's nothing morally wrong with this or anything it 's a 100 partnership across the board yet advantage is still not equal you actually will see a larger benefit to your budget than she will but if you seek equal benefit you will have to pay a month more than she does   this sort of thing is basically the model marriage uses a pure 50/50 partnership or communal property and note that one of you will either be paying more than the other will be benefiting more than the other no matter what you do it 's impossible to balance both costs and benefits because your income and expenses are not the same going in if you go this way you 'll need to choose what is most important splitting the expenses income equally or benefiting financially equally so i say again ultimately you have to choose based upon your individual and shared values and also on just what sort of relationship and layers of commitment you want to have together you could start slow with option 1 then progress to sharing more that 's what i 'd recommend because i like the idea of developing things one layer at a time rather than jumping in head first like i have personally done in the past haha once bitten twice shy i might just be more risk averse or careful than you desire to be but that 's a personal choice   i personally believe the relationship can be far more valuable than any investment but at the same time i 'll take $ 1 over a relationship that has turned sour any day of the week this is why i suggest the more gradual careful approach to let your love bloom and grow deeper one layer at a time without the complexities of fully shared finances or investment partnership relationships are hard enough so this is why i favor trying to protect them aggressively from unnecessary complexity some favor the sink or swim model of seeking out trials and challenges while i favor the relationship as tender growing model i hope seeing these options laid out more is helpful to you and good luck to you your relationship and lastly to your investments

what are pivot points pivot points indicate price levels that are of significance in technical analysis of securities pivot points are used to provide clarity for a trader as they are a predictive indicator of where a security might go there are at least 6 different types of pivot points pivot point fibonacci pivot etc and they are different based on their formulas but generally serve the same concept i will be answering your question using the pivot point formula pivot point formula generally any pivot point formula uses a combination of the open high low and close of the previous timeframe since you are technically a swing trader indicated by   say between a couple of days to a couple of weeks as i do n't want to    do day trading you should use a weekly 5 to 30 minute chart but you can also use a daily chart as well so for example if you use a daily chart you would use the open high low and close of the previous day example of fictitious stock money stack exchange open high low close 11.50 on level level r2 level level pivot point s1 level s2 level s3 level s4 level r = resistance s = support   how to identify these pivot points most charting software already have built in that will identify the pivot points for you but you can always find and draw them yourself with an tool since we are using the pivot point formula the important pivot point levels are the which is considered as the breakout pivot the s4 which is considered as the breakdown pivot and s3 are reversal pivot points once identify the pivot points how should you proceed in a trade this is the million dollar question and without spoon feeding you requires you to come up with your own strategy to distinguish yourself from being a novice and pro trader is to have a strategy in a trade now i do n't really have the time to look for actual charts to provide examples with but generally this is what you should look for to proceed in a trade potential buy short signals potential sell signals if a stock moves above the level but then crosses below it this would be a sell signal this is confirmed when their is a lower lower then the candle that first crosses below it sell a stock when s4 level is confirmed see above for the confirmation other useful tips use the pivot point as your support or resistance the pivot point levels can be used for your stop loss for example with an s3 reversal buy signal the s4 should be used as a stop loss conversely the pivot point levels can also be used for your target prices for example with an s3 reversal buy signal you should take some profits at level you should also use a combination of other indicators to give you more information to confirm if a signal is correct examples of a good combination is the rsi macd and moving averages read that book in my comment above

as someone that works in and with the ag and commodity markets my understanding is limited but i hope it helps    aside from needing an infrastructure built to maintain the vast amounts of data communication pricing banking information having a closing time for our markets helps to ensure value and fair trade capitalism is centralized around creating a fair value for ventures to sell where prospective buyers opt to purchase or invest for example where i attended university there were many coffee shops close to campus but only one stayed open all night and as such had operational cost much higher than other shops forcing them to charge more for a cup of coffee while this example is crude the idea is the same by hours product or strategies and developments meant to increase projected value are allowed to occur    i imagine that if the markets did not close my coffee prices would skyrocket for an increased demand that of which the supply and farmers would struggle to meet the same would be said of grain salt oils etcetera

rebalance is across asset classes which are mutually independent like stocks and bonds they may be inversely correlated at times as when stocks go down bonds go up stock bond split is good for a young investor say in 30s some suggest as a good stock allocation percentage here rebalance is done when say the asset away more than say 3 to 5 again just a rule of thumb e.g. if due to a recent run up in stocks aa could become then you sell stocks to buy bonds to make the aa and since this method always sells the winner you automatically make gains selling high and buying low s&p 500 index gives decent diversification within stocks you want a total bond fund to take care of the bond side of your aa

maybe everyone who has responded needs to look closer at the income base repayment plan for student loans what this means is he payment does not even cover his interest rate so each month he makes his payment the loan grows does not decrease this is not a simple interest loan which is irritating because car dealerships do not even use a non simple interest loan any longer so well your suggestions are well intended what is your suggestion now knowing that his monthly payments is not reducing his loan but actually his loan is growing exponentially each month i also like the comment where the average student loan is $ 30,000 i would like to know in what state that is that may work for a community college or a student who is reliant on parents to supplement their income so they can go to classes however for someone who is working and going to school that person must opt out for night classes and online classes which definitely increases the cost of your classes right now the cost per credit hour is in the $ range

in a roth ira scenario this $ 5,000 would be reduced to $ 3,750 if we assume a nice and round 25 tax rate for the traditional ira the full $ 5,000 would be invested no that 's not how it works   taxes are n't removed from your roth account   you 'll have $ 5,000 invested either way   the difference is that you 'll have a tax deduction if you invest in a traditional ira but not a roth so you 'll save $ 1,250 in taxes up front if you invest in a traditional ira versus a roth the flip side is when you withdraw the money   since you 've already paid tax on the roth investment and it grows tax free you 'll pay no tax when you withdraw it   but you 'll pay tax on the investment and the gains when you withdraw from a traditional ira   using your numbers you 'd pay tax on $ from the traditional ira but no tax on $ from the roth at that point you 've saved over $ 500,000 in taxes now if you invested the tax savings from the traditional ira and it earned the same amount then yes you 'd end up in the same place in the end provided you have the same marginal tax rate   but i suspect that most do n't invest that savings and if you withdraw significant amount you 'll likely move into higher tax brackets in your example suppose you only had $ 3,750 of discretionary income that you could put toward retirement   you could put $ 5,000 in a traditional ira since you 'll get a $ 1,250 tax deduction or $ 3,750 in a roth   then your math works out the same   if you invest the same amount in either though the math on the roth is a no brainer

the various levels of government have laws determining what a protected class is    federally wiki are the protected classes under federal law it is illegal to discriminate against someone based on their membership of any   of those demographics on the state and local level many states have additional protections for example my home state of il explicitly forbids discrimination based on someone 's sexual orientation or gender identity classes which are not explicitly forbidden on the federal level   hate speech is protected under the first amendment so long as you 're not violence that caveat is very murky and i am not qualified enough to speak on what is and is n't violence from a legal perspective i just know that the caveat exists   the key distinction that i think a lot of people misunderstand and are confused about is that while hate speech is protected under the first amendment like all other forms of speech it is not a protected class meaning i can say whatever hateful rhetoric i want but non government entities are free to discriminate against me     i can absolutely be fired if my employer finds out i am posting on facebook advocating for the death of black lives matter activists or saying stuff like terrorist immigrant go home because political speech is not a protected class i can not be fired for posting a photo of my gay wedding in il because in il sexual orientation is a protected class    does that make sense

mbs is a fairly general term mortgage backed securities which simply means that the bond is collateralized with mortgages   pass are a type of mbs that is all bond holders of the deal are receiving the same interest and principal payments there is no senior or subordinate class of bonds    agency bond holders receive any principal and interest payments paid by the loans in the pool minus a slice of the interest payment that pays billing and insurance fees servicing and guarantee fees usually a .5 slice of the mortgage interest rate   on agency product including if a loan defaults it will be bought out of the pool with the bondholder receiving all of the expected principal and any interest due on the loan   agency deals with different classes of bonds are usually called   passthrough may also be split into   principal only po and interest only pieces    there is also a huge forward market in soon to be issued called the market   ginnie mae has two slightly different programs referred to as ginnie i and ginnie ii   ginnie also has commercial and construction loan financial products   freddie and fannie have the same type of financial products as ginnie but there are differences in the sort of loans that ginnie has vs the other agencies as well as subtle minor differences between the contract terms of the securities   ginnie is also more explicitly guaranteed by the federal government   you may want to look at   especially the for investors and for issuers sections   wikipedia 's mbs may be more clear than my description

i 've had a mortgage changing hands with mid size companies for many years with no problems   i 've handled many complex financial and technical transactions with multiple parties with no problems over the course decades then after my last refinance my mortgage fell into the hands of jp morgan chase the bank sent one letter to let me know of the transfer and in the next week they sent my loan to collections for what i later found to be chase 's process error in the transfer    for the next three months i ended up in customer service hell as one chase group threatened to foreclose on my house while another group told me to ignore the imminent foreclosure notices one started to investigate the transfer while the collections group tried to make me pay my mortgage payment twice   the mess only ended up being taken care of after i tracked down the old owner of my loan and had them refund the lost payment directly to me normally they would have sent it to the company buying the loan but could not get chase to accept the payment then i paid chase that exact same mortgage payment     all the time the chase internal investigations and collections department were completely incapable of a simple call to previous holder of the loan a company handling millions of mortgage transactions is somehow incapable of handling a minor glitch in a mortgage transfer it 's either utter incompetence or total malice in picking up extra penalty fees or maybe an occasional if homeowners did n't say on top of the details this is what we used our collective tax dollars to bail out

i 'm adding to @dilip 's basic answer to cover the additional points in your question   i 'll assume you are referring to publicly traded stock options such as those found on the cboe and not an option contract entered into privately between two specific counterparties e.g. as in an employer stock option plan since you are not obligated to exercise a call option you purchased on the market you do n't need to maintain funds on account for possible exercising   you could instead let the option expire or resell the option neither of which requires funds available for purchase of the underlying shares however should you actually choose to exercise the call option and usually this is done close to expiration if at all you will be required to fund your account much like if you bought the underlying shares in the first place   call your broker to determine the exact rules and timing for when they need the money for a call option exercise and to expand on the idea of cancelling an option you purchased no you can not cancel an option contract per se   but you are permitted to sell the call option to somebody else willing to buy via the market   when you sell your call option you 'll either make or lose money on the sale depending on the price of the underlying shares at the time are they in- or of the money volatility in the market and remaining time value   once you sell you 're back to no position   that 's not the same as cancelled but you are out of the trade whether at profit or loss furthermore the option writer i.e. the seller who sold to open a position in writing the call in the first place is also not permitted to cancel the option he wrote   however the option writer is permitted to close out the original short position by simply buying back a matching call option on the market   again this would occur at either profit or loss based on market prices at the time   this second kind of buy order i.e. made by someone who initially wrote a call option is called a buy to close meaning the purchase of an offsetting position   the other kind of buy is the buy to open then consider since an option buyer is free to re sell the option purchased and since an option writer who sold to open the new contract is also free to buy back an offsetting option a process known as clearing is required to match remaining buyers exercising the call options held with the remaining option writers having open short positions for the contract   for cboe options this clearing is performed by the options clearing corporation   here 's how it works see here what is the occ the options clearing corporation is the sole issuer of all securities    options listed at the cboe four other u.s. stock exchanges and the    national association of securities dealers inc. nasd and is the    entity through which all cboe option transactions are ultimately    cleared as the issuer of all options occ essentially takes the    opposite side of every option traded because occ basically becomes    the buyer for every seller and the seller for every buyer it allows    options traders to buy and sell in a secondary market without having    to find the original opposite party       emphasis above is mine when a call option writer must deliver shares to a call option buyer exercising a call it 's called assignment   i have been assigned before and it is n't pleasant to see a position called away that otherwise would have been very profitable if the call were n't written in the first place also re i know my counter party can not sell his shares that 's not strictly true   you are thinking of a covered call   but an option writer does n't necessarily need to own the underlying shares   look up naked call wikipedia   naked calls are n't frequently undertaken because a naked call is one of the riskiest options strategies because it carries unlimited risk   the average individual trader is n't usually permitted by their broker to enter such an order but there are market participants who can do such a trade finally you can learn more about options at the options industry council

when you buy a stock and sell a covered call the call ca n't be valued higher than the stock right how can a call on a $ 10 stock sell for more than the stock   so the initial position of a covered call will cost you something the transaction is a debit   to you the net amount of the deal usually prices as per stock option single share   for the image showing net credit it 's as if you expect to get paid for you to take this deal

coming to london at this point of time is not a wise decision not that i mean to discourage you the job market is quite competitive because loads of developers are in the markets because of the layoffs so be ready to wait for some time to land a role banks are n't recruiting that heavily but that might change if the economy picks up regarding salaries the contract rates you quote are primarily for banking sector jobs some outside banking also pay those rates but they are few   you can quote what you want to a recruiter most contracts are through them as most managers have a get go between recruiters and themselves recruiters take their cut what they bill 400 + a guess so the more they take from the 400 better is their margin so they try to decrease the 400 portion but the important point is be ready to keep your chair warm for some time i am not sure why you have to move to london keep your current job get a skype number or something and get the calls diverted to your phone in germany you can come down to london for interviews and schedule them so you come in a week and give all your interviews london is a costly place you can find cheap places to stay too but without a job and searching for one will get you there and experienced it

scenario 1 assume that you plan to keep the parking space for the rest of your life and collect the income from the rental you say these spaces rent for $ 250 per month and there are fees of $ 1400 per year are there any other costs like would you be responsible for the cost of at some point but assuming that 's covered in the $ 1400 the net profit is 250 x 12 1400 = $ 1600 per year so now the question becomes what other things could you invest your money in and what sort of returns do those give if say you have investments in the stock market that are generating a 10 annual return and you expect that rate of return to continue indefinitely than if you pay a price that gives you a return of less than 10 i.e. if you pay more than $ 16,000 then you would be better off to put the money in the stock market that is you should calculate the fair price backwards what return on investment is acceptable and then what price would i have to pay to get that roi oh you should also consider what the occupancy rate on such parking spaces is is there enough demand that you can realistically expect to have it rented out 100 of the time when one renter leaves how long does it take to find another and do you have any information on how often renters fail to pay the rent i own a house that i rent out and i had two tenants in a row who failed to pay the rent and the legal process to get them evicted takes months i do n't know what it takes to evict someone from a parking space scenario 2 you expect to collect rent on this space for some period of time and then someday sell it in that case there 's an additional piece of information you need how much can you expect to get for this property when you sell it this is almost surely highly speculative but you could certainly look at past pricing trends if you see that the value of a parking space in your area has been going up by whatever say 4 per year for the past 20 years it 's reasonable to plan on the assumption that this trend will continue if it 's been up and down and all over the place you could be taking a real gamble if you pay $ 30,000 for it today and when the time comes to sell the best you can get is $ 15,000 that 's not so good but if there is some reasonable consistent average rate of growth in value you can add this to the expected rents like if you can expect it to grow in value by $ 1000 per year then the return on your investment is the $ 1600 in rent plus $ 1000 in capital growth equals $ 2600 then again do an roi calculation based on potential returns from other investments

capping the upside while playing with unlimited downside is a less disciplined investment strategy vis a vis a stop loss driven strategy whether it is less risky or high risky also depends on the fluctuations of the stock and not just long term movements for example your stop losses might get triggered because of a momentary sharp decline in stock price due to a large volume transaction esp more so in small cap stocks although the stock price might recover from the sudden price drop pretty soon causing a seemingly preventable loss that being said playing with stop losses is always considered a safer strategy it may not increase your profits but can certainly cap your losses

i work on a buy side firm so i know how these small data issues can drive us crazy hope my answer below can help you   reason for price difference 1 vendor and data source basically data providers such as google and yahoo redistribute eod data by aggregating data from their vendors although the raw data is taken from the same exchanges different vendors tend to collect them through different trading platforms for example yahoo is getting stock data from which was acquired by morningstar which is not the most accurate source of eod stocks google gets data from deutsche   to make the process more complicated each vendor can choose to get eod data from another eod data provider or the exchange itself or they can produce their own open high low close and volume from the actual trade tick data and these data may come from any exchanges   2 price adjustment   for equities data the re distributor usually adjusts the raw data by applying certain customized procedures this includes adjustment for corporate actions such as dividends and splits for futures data rolling is required and back ward and for rolling can be chosen different adjustment methods can lead to different price display   3 extended trading hours   along with the growth of electronic trading many market tends to trade during extended hours such as pre open and post close trading periods futures and fx markets even trade around the clock this leads to another freedom in price reporting whether to include the price movement during the extended trading hours    conclusion to cross verify the true price we should always check the price from the exchange where the asset is actually traded given the convenience of getting eod data nowadays this task should be easy to achieve   in fact for professional traders and investors alike they will never reply price on free providers such as yahoo and google they will most likely choose bloomberg reuters etc however for personal use yahoo and google should both be good choices and the difference is small enough to ignore

with no numbers offered it 's not like we can tell you if it 's a wise    purchase joetaxpayer we can however talk about the qualitative tradeoffs of renting vs owning the major drawback which you wo n't hear enough about is risk you will be putting a very large portion of your net worth in what is effectively a single asset this is somewhat risky what happens if the regional economy takes a hit and you get laid off chances are you wo n't be the only one and the value of your house will take a hit at the same time a double whammy if you need to sell and move away for a job in another town you will be taking a financial hit that is if you can sell and still cover your mortgage you will definitely not be able to walk away and find a new cheap apartment to scrimp on expenses for a little while buying a house is putting down roots on the other hand you will be free from the opposite risk rising rents once you 've purchased the house and as long as you 're living in it you do n't ever need to worry about a local economic boom and a bunch of people moving into town and making more money than you pushing up rents the san francisco bay area is an example of where that has happened gentrification has its most of the rest is a numbers game do n't get fooled into thinking that you 're throwing away money on renting if you really want to you can save money yourself and invest a sum approximately equal to your down payment in the stock market in some diversified mutual funds and you will earn returns on that at a rate similar to what you would get by building equity in your home you wo n't earn outsized housing bubble returns but you should n't expect those in the housing market of today anyway also if you own you have broad discretion over what you can do with the property but you have to take care of the maintenance and stuff too

i ca n't say specifically about charities to help greece if someone on here has specific knowledge please chime in the only shortcut i know to tell if a charity is legitimate is to consult one of the ratings type groups that monitor charities for example for explicitly christian charities there 's a group called the council for financial accountability to be a member in good standing a charity has to meet a bunch of criteria like having an independent board of directors i.e. you ca n't start a charity make yourself the president and your brother in law the vice president and you 're not answerable to anyone else their fund raising and administrative costs ca n't be more than a certain percentage of total income etc there are similar groups with similar standards for more general charities i 'm not naming any of those groups because there 's a potential catch how reputable is the group that rates other people 's reputations and i do n't want to recommend someone without knowing years ago i came across a news story about an organization that rated colleges and that had given one particular college their top rating but the news story said investigators found that that one college was the only college they ever gave a rating to and that their address was the same as the college 's address it turned out of course that the college was a scam the other method is to take some time to investigate the charity   for starters get a copy of their annual report or their newsletter if they 're total frauds often they do n't have an annual report or a newsletter of course a fraud could make up beautiful flyers describing all the wonderful work they do with pictures of people they helped and detailed case histories and it 's all complete fiction but that 's more work than most con men go to i 've gotten lots of for contributions from people who call on the phone or come to my door or send an email if the message does not have a logo a mailing address and phone number reasonably coherent english and a fair amount of text describing what they do i do n't give them anything they could be a new start up that has n't had time to prepare these things they could believe that pretty flyers are a waste of money and they want to put all their resources into helping the needy but more likely it 's a scam that somebody through together in his basement of course the best thing is if you personally know people who are officers in the organization well assuming you personally know them and you know that they are honest people if you know the president and you know he 's a sleazy con man you might want to stay away from that group see if you can find information about the charity in the news or on line if they 're being investigated for fraud by the justice department you might want to avoid them etc maybe you 've thought this through but you also might want to think about exactly who in greece you want to help and what your philosophy of charity is do you want to help people who lost their jobs because of the economic problems there and who are now unemployed do you want to donate to the government to help them balance the budget do you want to help support an or a homeless shelter or give money directly to needy people etc and one piece of unsolicited advice unless you have millions to give and i 'm assuming you do n't as you said your first gift would be $ 50 i 'd pick one or two charities and give regularly to them i think you can do more good by giving $ x per month to a single charity than to give to a different charity every month you make more difference

none of those things sounded like concessions i suspect if you negotiated health care in terms of percentage of the cost instead of in raw dollars deducted it 'd actually come out that the company was taking a hit since the last contract i have no numbers to back this up it 's just that health care costs have been skyrocketing the last few years   seniority rights kinda suck because they 're just determined by time on the job and not merit i 'll take someone with 5 years in who 's been getting better the whole time over someone with 20 who 's been doing the negotiated minimum since the beginning i 'd like to be able to give the new people incentive to kick ass at their job   the thing i do n't like about unions is that they take the individual out of the game solidarity leads to one size fits all thinking which is also the kind of thinking that gets companies thinking that everybody is replaceable really be better off if good people were hard to replace and average people could get by but not excel

apy stands for annual percentage yield a calculation done by the financial institution to make simple comparisons of account value after 1 year between competing accounts the apy includes the effects of compound interest regardless of the rate of interest so the simple answer is no your return is only your principle multiplied by the apy after a year credit unions are more member than a bank so the name share implies that you own a share of the credit union and it 's future it 's possible that the cu could elect to pay a dividend on top of your interest rate since you have the option to credit the dividend to the share certificate account or another place it seems that interest would be paid on the dividends left in the sc on the compounding schedule at the contracted rate   you would have to look at the terms of the account to verify precisely when the dividend is payed whether it 's a value above and beyond the interest and how it is compounded into our account

while the us hosts most of the world 's innovative startups its own financial and banking systems are very slow to change   the infrastructure exists however the ach transfers are not wide spread between individuals banks much prefer the option of bill pay i.e. as you said mailing a check something in other countries people would n't even think of than letting you do it yourself   why because they can there 's no real competition over consumers and the consumers themselves are not educated or sophisticated thus the banks are comfortable with the lack of innovation since as long as they are all lacking innovation consumers wo n't demand it because they wo n't even know things are possible and it is definitely cheaper for the banks not to innovate and keep your money for a week while the bill pay check is en route than try and develop new things in other countries the regulator would step up and force banks to develop new infrastructure and widen the options but in the us regulation is considered a bad thing and people are easily swayed being uneducated and uninformed by the corporations to support politicians who act against their people 's best interest in protecting the corporations and reducing and limiting the regulators even further

there is no hard and fast rule if there was people could cleverly arrange to make money just often enough to stay on the ok side it 's a judgement call by the cra and it probably starts with an audit and depends on the reasons for the loss simple example your business is selling your time at x an hour and you have expenses that you will cover if you sell y hours a year where y is a lot less than the 2000 hours we have to sell each year maybe 300 and you had a big contract but it fell through and though you tried and tried you could n't get another contract this will probably be considered a reasonable loss another example your business is selling art or antiques most of which are kept in your house where you can look at them every day and enjoy them your expenses include lots of flights to places where these art or antiques come from or perhaps are inspired by along with hotel and restaurant costs and you would need to sell your entire inventory every year just to cover these expenses yet you only sell one or two pieces a year or none and there 's no indication that you 're particularly trying to sell more than that this will probably be considered an unreasonable loss and if the situation persists for many years in a row the expenses may end up being disallowed side businesses often lose money at first in fact once they stop losing money they stop being side businesses if you have spin up costs like buying hardware developing software or acquiring inventory and you can show how long those extra costs can be expected to last your expenses are less likely to be disallowed that 's the issue not how many years in a row the loss occurred this archived cra document gives examples of startup expenses that were allowed in years that did n't have revenue never mind profit

gt but the buying power of that money can be significantly reduced to the point where it 's fundamentally useless i.e. inter war germany and many countries in south and central america   that 's true but how does that come about the effect on buying power stems from the level of spending in the present period too little leaves you anywhere from outright deflation and contraction to weaker growth falling short of capacity too much reaches capacity and keeps spending bidding up prices and driving down purchasing power   it has nothing to do with debt gdp or interest payments   gt germany managed to skate by by creating a new in a confidence trick and it worked because germany is a solid iron clad manufacturing powerhouse of a lot of stuff    there are two important differences between inter war germany and the us first is that inter war germany lost a this real shock is kind of important when you 're talking about buying power of money one side of it is the amount of money in circulation but the other side of it is how much real output there is to buy and german real output capacity collapsed after the war their most productive regions were occupied territory and they were no longer a powerhouse manufacturing a lot of stuff driving down the value of their currency   so lesson number one from germany real output collapse harms your currency   the second problem is that losing a war left germany saddled with war denominated in foreign currency when you 're on the hook for something you do n't print you 're in a situation where you can run out of money and that 's exactly what happened to them they tried printing more of their own currency to buy the foreign stuff with but that quickly drove down the value of german currency   so lesson number two from germany is you do n't want to be on the hook for a currency you do n't issue   put the two together and you have a real supply shock + foreign denominated debt the buying power of german currency it was n't debt gdp but the real basis for their economy collapsing out from under them pushed along by a need for foreign currency   gt;my question is at what point do we engage washington 's unlimited money printing presses until we reach that point   in answer to your question the printing presses are what funds the real economy the worry in terms of avoiding that point is in making sure we keep that real economy productive and fully funded ironically taking our eye off the ball to focus on budget balance at the expense of real output pushes the economy in the direction you 're afraid of going see also the euro zone today

401k plans are required to not discriminate against the non hce participants and one way they achieve this is by limiting the percentage of wages that hces can contribute to the plan to the average annual percentage contribution by the non hce participants or 3 whichever is higher   if most non hce employees contribute only 3 usually to capture the employer match but no more   then the hces are stuck with 3 however be aware that in companies that award year end bonuses to all employees many non hces contribute part of their bonuses to their 401k plans and so the average annual percentage can rise above 3 at the end of year some payroll offices have been known to ask all those who have not already maxed out their 401k contribution   for the year yes it is possible to do this even while contributing only 3 if you are not just a hce but a whether they want to contribute the usual 3 or a higher percentage or to contribute the maximum possible under the rules so you might be able to contribute more than 3 if the non hces put in more money at the end of the year with regard to you pretty much have their properties pegged correctly that money is considered to be deferred compensation and so you pay taxes on it only when you receive it upon leaving employment the company also gets to deduct it as a business expense when the money is paid out and as you said it is not money that is segregated as a 401k plan is on the other hand you have earned the money already it is just that the company is holding it for you is it paying you interest on the money accumulating in the not paid out in cash or taxable income to you   would it be better to just take the money right now pay taxes on it and invest it yourself some deferred compensation plans work as follows the deferred compensation is given to you as a loan in the year it is   earned and you pay only interest on the principal each year since   the money is a loan there is no tax of any kind due on the money when you receive it now you can invest the proceeds of this loan and hopefully earn enough to cover the interest   payments due the interest you pay is deductible on schedule a as an investment interest expense   when employment ceases   you repay the loan to the company as a lump sum or in five or ten annual installments whatever was agreed to while the company pays you your deferred compensation less taxes withheld the net effect is that you pay the company the   taxes due on the money and the company sends this on to the various tax authorities as money withheld from wages paid   the advantage is that you do not need to worry   about what happens to your money if the company fails you have received it up front   yes you have to pay the loan principal to the company but the company also owes you exactly that much money as unpaid wages in the best of all worlds things will proceed smoothly but if not it is better to be in this mexican rather than standing in line in bankruptcy court and hoping to get pennies on the dollar for your work

if you do business in a state then you need to register your business in that state   i suspect that you have a misconception of what it means to do business in a state   if you are a shop then you very likely are not doing business in any state except the one state where you work examples of when you are doing business in a state include having an office in the state or having employees in the state   merely selling something to a client in that state is not enough to be doing business in the state each state is different but unless you are doing something that is in some sense close to having an office or an employee in a state then you have nothing to worry about   for example if you regularly travel to a state to do work for a client then it is possible that you could be doing business in that state i have no idea if that would be sufficient in any state   but if you are just working out of your basement running a website then you are only doing business in your own state

buying or selling a futures contract means that you are entering into a contractual agreement to buy or sell the contracted commodity or financial instrument in the contracted amount the contract size at the price you have bought or sold the contract on the contract expire date maturity date   it is important to understand that futures contracts are tradeable instruments meaning that you are free to sell or buy back your contract at any time before the expiry date for example if you buy 1 lot 1 contract of a gold future on the comex exchange for the contract month of december 2016 then you entering into a contract to buy 100 ounces the contract size of gold at the price at which you buy the contract not the spot price on the day of expiry when the contract comes to maturity   the december 2016 gold futures contract has an expiry date of 28 december   you are free to trade this contract at any time before its expiry by selling it back to another market participant   if you sell the contract at a price higher than you have purchased it then you will realise a profit of 100 times the difference between the price you bought the contract and the price you sold the contract where 100 is the contract size of the gold contract   similarly if you sell the contract at a price lower than the price you have purchased it then you will realise a loss commissions paid will also effect your net profit or loss if you hold your contract until the expiry date and exercise your contract by taking or making delivery then you are obliged to buy or sell 100 ounces of gold at the price at which you bought or sold the contract not the current spot price so long as your contract is open i.e. prior to the expiry date and so long as you own the contract you are required to make a good faith deposit to show that you intend to honour your contractual obligations   this deposit is usually called initial margin   typically the initial margin amount will be about 2 of the total contract value for the gold contract   so if you buy or sell one contract for 100 ounces of gold at say $ an ounce then the total contract value will be $ and your deposit requirement would be about $ 2,500   the initial margin is returned to you when you sell or buy back your futures contract or when you exercise your contract on expiry in addition to initial margin you will be required to maintain a second type of margin called variation margin   the variation margin is the running profit or loss you are showing on your open contract for the sake of simplicity lets look only at the case where you have purchased a futures contract   if the futures price is higher than your contract buy price then you are showing a profit on your current position and this profit the variation margin will be used to offset your initial margin requirement conversely if the futures price has dropped below your contracted buy price then you will be showing a loss on your open position and this loss the variation margin will be added to your initial margin and you will be called to put up more money in order to show good faith that you intend to honour your obligations   note that neither the initial margin nor the variation margin are accounting items   in other words these are not postings that are debited or credited to the ledger in your trading account   so in some sense you do n't have to pay anything upfront but you do need to put up a refundable deposit to show good faith

there 's really not a simple yes no answer   it depends on whether you 're doing short term trading or long term investing   in the short term it 's not much different from sports betting and would be almost an exact match if the also got a percentage of the team 's ticket sales in the long term though your profit mostly comes from the growth of the company   as a company apple say or tesla increases sales of iphones or electric cars it either pays out some of the income as dividends or invests them in growing the company so it becomes more valuable   if you bought shares cheaply way back when you profit from this increase when you sell them   the person buying it does n't lose as s he buys at today 's market value in anticipation of continued growth   of course there 's a risk that the value will go down in the future instead of up of course there are also psychological factors say when people buy apple or tesla because they 're popular instead of at a rational valuation   or when people start panic selling as in the 08 crash   so then their loss is your gain assuming you did n't panic of course

if you have a negative balance on your credit card you can call the issuer and have them send you a check for the amount some will do it automatically for large amounts or if it stays negative over some period of time usually credit card issuers do n't let paying more than the current balance but it still can happen sometimes if you pay off your balance and then get a refund for example

the fact that you are planning to move abroad does not affect the decision to contribute to a 401(k the reason for this is that after you leave your employer you can roll all the money over from your 401(k into a self directed traditional ira that money can stay invested until retirement and it does n't matter where you are living before or after retirement age   so when deciding whether or not to use a 401(k you need to look at the details of your employer 's plan does your employer offer a match if so you should definitely take advantage of it   are there good investments available inside the 401(k some plans offer very limited options if you ca n't find anything good to invest in you do n't want to contribute anything beyond the match instead contribute to an ira where you can invest in a fund that you like   the other reason to use a 401(k is that the contribution limits can be higher if you want to invest more than you are allowed to in an ira the 401(k might allow that   in your case since there is no match it is up to you whether you want to participate or not an ira will allow more flexibility in investing options if you need to invest more than your ira limit the 401(k might allow that when you leave your employer you should probably roll any 401(k money into an ira

capital is an asset decreasing value of capital is the decreasing value of an asset when you buy the forex asset dr forex asset cr cash when you sell dr cash   cr forex asset the difference is now accounted for here is how gains and losses are modifications to your financial position balance sheet at the end of the period you take your financial performance profit and loss and put it into your balance sheet under equity meaning that afterwards your balance sheet is better or worse off because you made more money = more cash or lost it whatever you are wanting to make an income account to reflect the forex revaluation so at the end of the period it is reflected in profit then pushed into your balance sheet capital gains directly affect your balance sheet because they increase decrease your cash and your asset in the journal entry itself when you buy and sell it if making money this way is actually how you make you make an income it is possible to make an account for it if you do this you periodically the asset and write off the changes to the revaluation account you would do something like dr asset cr forex revaluation account depending on the method you take businesses mostly do this because if the capital gains are their line of business they will be taxed on it like it is income for simplicity just account for it when you buy and sell the assets because you as an individual will only recognise a profit loss when you enter and exit its easier to think about income and expenses are extensions of equity income increases your equity expenses decrease it this is how they relate to the accounting formula assets = liabilities + owners equity

a couple of thoughts from someone who 's kind of been there is the business viable at all a lot of people do miss the jumping off point where the should stop throwing good money after bad and just pull the plug on the business if the business is not that viable then selling it might not be an option if the business is still viable and i 'd get advice from a good accountant on this then i 'd be tempted to try and pull through to until i 'd get a good offer for the business do n't just try to sell it for any price because times are bad if it 's self sustaining and hopefully makes a little profit i does sound like their business is on the up again and if that 's a trend and not a fluke imho pouring more energy into not money would be the way to go do n't make the mistake of buying high and selling low so to speak i 'm also a little confused re their house do they own it or do they still owe money on it if they owe money on it how are they making their payments if they close the business do they have enough income to make the payments still before they find another job even if it 's just a part time job as to paying off their debts or at least helping with paying them off i 'd only do that if i was in a financial position to gift them the money anything else is going to wreak havoc with the family dynamics including co signing debt for them and everybody will wish they did n't go there ask me how i know re debt consolidation i do n't think it 's going to do much for them apart from costing them more money for something they could do themselves bankruptcy well are they bankrupt or are they looking for the get out of debt free card sorry to be so blunt but if they 're so deep in the hole that they truly have no chance whatsoever to pay off their debt ever then they 're bankrupt from what you 're saying they 're able to make the minimum payments they 're not really what i 'd consider bankrupt are your parents on a budget as duffbeer703 said depending on how much money the business is making they should be able to pay off the debt within a reasonable amount of time which again does n't make them bankrupt

just to clarify in wikipedia when it says   it is defined as a market in which money is provided for periods longer than a year they are referring to the company which is asking for money so for example the stock market provides money to the issuing company of an ipo indefinitely meaning the company that just went public is provided with money for a period longer than a year the definition in investopedia basically says the same thing wikipedia does it is just phrased slightly different and leaves out the for periods longer than a year   for example wikipedia uses the term business enterprises and governments while investopedia uses the term private sector and public sector in this context business enterprise is private sector and governments is public sector   so in the sense of the length debt is issued yes money market would be the opposite of a capital market but both markets still offer a place for governments and companies to raise money and both are classified as financial markets

i 'll answer in general terms since i 'm not familiar with the price ranges in florida the llc formation costs $ 125 state fee in addition you 'll need a registered agent registered agent could be your cpa ea bookkeeper property manager local friend or you can pay firms specializing in providing registration and agents services such as northwestern or legalzoom there are many others you 'll need to pay an annual fee of in florida if you are using someone to do the formation they 'll charge more usually the on line services are cheaper than a local cpa or attorney by $ bookkeeping will probably be charged by the hour but some charge flat fees for small accounts per hour would be probably in the range of $ you 'll have to pay taxes both in florida where the property is and on the federal level to the irs you 'll be paying them as a non resident individual your cpa ea will charge you anywhere between $ 150 to $ 500 for that if they charge more run away unless there 's some specific complication that requires extra costs you will need a itin for that your cpa ea can help you get one or you can apply yourself   be careful with all those people selling about organizing in delaware wyoming nevada like cqm in his answer organizing in a state other than where the properties are located or off shore wo n't save you a dime and not only that it will add to the costs because you 'll have to pay to the state where you organized cqm mentioned wyoming $ keep registered agent in the state of organization + $ 99 and also do all the things i 've described above about florida as a foreign out of state entity which may mean higher fees it wo n't save you any taxes as well because you pay taxes to the state from which you derive income which is florida either way remember that what you call llc in italy may be in fact a corporation as defined in the us and there 's a huge difference you should probably not put a real estate property in a corporation in the us you must get a legal advice from a florida lawyer $ consultation and a tax advice from a florida cpa ea $ consultation do not consider anything i write here as a legal or tax advice because it is not you need a professional to help you because as an italian you do n't know how things work exactly and relying on and half truths that you may find and get over the internet may end up costing you significantly in damages also talk to a reliable real estate agent and property manager before making any purchases

gt you also have to think about tax on dividends from these stock options which is only 15 which is paltry to regular rate that the rich pay on their salaries   dividends is just cash being removed from companies and being paid out directly to the stockholder   if dividends get taxed at a higher rate every company would just use that same cash to buy back shares since that would be more tax efficient the stockholder would receive compensation in higher stock prices which they could then sell instead of receiving a dividend thus they would pay capital gains rate instead of your new dividend rate   the dividend rate must be the same as capital gains rate for this reason they are not free money since the stock price gets decreased when a dividend is paid out the company gets poorer when they pay out the dividend

based on your information   the house is $ 130,000 all in this might not be the case   your payment term is 30 years   your interest rate is about   your payments are about $   your total payments will total $   that 's not a very good interest rate for a mortgage but this might be due to poor credit or limited credit history too low income or too much home value being financed or a combination of the above and other factors   northern alabama may not specifically be higher interest rate it might honestly just be you   the reason that you 're paying $ 320,000 is that you 're taking $ 130,000 from a bank and promising to pay it back with interest keep in mind that 's over thirty years that 's a long time and the bank needs to earn enough interest to combat inflation roughly 2 annually generally during that time the bank ca n't invest that money elsewhere return it to depositors etc   a good rule to keep in mind is the rule of 72 it 's a simple trick to determine based on an interest rate how quickly the value of something will double in this case the value of your loan payments if your interest rate was exactly 7.2 this method would calculate 10 years until doubling    in your case 72 = years    now you 're paying off your loan simultaneously which lowers your interest over time so your payments total of loan value at origination that still sucks but remember it 's over a time

ultimately you are as stuck as all other investors with low returns which get taxed however there are a few possible you can put up to 15k p.a into a normal isa either cash or stocks shares or a combination if your target is to generate the over 5 years you should maximise the amount you put in an isa then when you come to buy you cash in that part needed to top up your other savings for a deposit i.e. keep the rest in for long term savings the help to buy isa might be helpful but yes there is a limit on the purchase price which in london will restrict you several banks are offering good interest on limited sums in current accounts santander is probably the best you can get 3 taxed on up to 20 k this is a good safe return just open a 123 account arrange to pay out a couple of dds and pay in £ 500 a month you can take the £ 500 straight out again i think lloyds and tsb also offer similar but on much smaller be warned this strategy taken to the limit will involve some complexity checking your various accounts each month after that you will end up trading better returns for greater risk by using more volatile stock market investments rather than cash deposits

my dad owned a steel drum barrel recycling company where we would get barrel from food companies and them sometimes we would get drums from one company for free and they would call us to buy drums many times we would sell them the same drums that we got from them for free that 's the beauty of recycling    after some time we started doing plastic drums and we had to find a way to salvage the plastic drums that we were not able to refurbish so we started contacting plastic companies and started talking to a company in middle tennessee     he was a huge plastic processor that was shipping hundreds of thousands tons of plastic every week he was from india and had a huge plant about 70 miles from memphis were i was living he would process the plastic rods or here in the u.s. and ship them too be made into products in india i was in the process of securing a processing machine from him one from a company in northern california and one from a company in florida all three where going to place a processing machine in my dads plant in memphis and create a coast to coast pipeline with memphis as the center point they where going to let us pay for the machinery by paying us to process a percentage of their plastic since much of it was coming through memphis that way all they had to do was ship the material once it arrived from our plant since memphis is the gateway to the west and a main truck route it was perfect    this type of arrangement is easy to make if you can convince the major players that you can deliver their product as promised i also made arrangements with the processor close to me to relocate 2 of his employees to memphis to manage the equipment until we got failure with the equipment and act as for him he was agreeing to everything i asked because it would have relieve production pressure off his employees and help him with his bottom line    make sure you investigate the type of machines you need to process the many types of plastics your processor needs or wants there are different types of plastics and different ways of processing it    1 pet polyethylene 2 high density polyethylene 3 pvc 4 low density polyethylene 5 pp 6 ps   i also know that california has a lot of air quality laws what i would do is get to know your local epa reps and run your plans by them they will be able to tell you all you can and ca n't do also you processor is going to want to see your feasibility study and business plan before he does this type of arrangement once you let me know if this is something that you are still interested in doing i will send you my old business plan      here is a video to really get an idea of what 's involved

at what point does my investment benefit from compounded interest monthly quarter yearly does it even benefit i think you are mixing things there is no concept of interest or compounding in mutual funds when you buy a mutual fund it either appreciates in value or depreciates in value both can happen depending on the time period you compare now let 's assume at the end of the year i have a 5 return my $ 10,000 is now $ 10,500 the way you need to look at this is given you started with $ 10,000 and its now $ 10,500 the return is 5 now if you want to calculate simple return or compounded return you would have to calculate accordingly you may potentially want to find a compounded return for ease of comparison with say a bank fd interest rate or some other reason   so if $ 10,000 become $ 10,500 after one year and $ 11,000 after 2 year the absolute return is 10 the simple yearly return is 5 or the simple rate of return for first year is 5 and for second year is 4.9 or the average year on year return is

so back in the day dos had different types of memory   the first was called conventional memory and dos made it available to everything to use as they will   after that was uma upper memory area that ran from to   uma was generally reserved for mapping various system devices to memory   after that ignoring some system stuff there was expanded memory that went from to you 'll remember the max memory size was 4 gig   this is why called expanded memory   in the there was a various combination of device drivers system features and extremely clever programming that allowed the user to move most device drivers and other system stuff into expanded memory so more of that first is available   doom was a huge game at the time and required almost all the 640 k so you would have to make a boot floppy or a bunch of clever stuff that would boot the system into almost bare minimum mode and run doom     doom would fill up most of that 640 k and then load up and get at that sweet expanded memory for loading assets and such     if you had enough expanded memory you could just all those drivers into expanded memory by default and still have enough left for doom to load in that 640 k and have enough expanded for the assets to load

you wo n't get taxed twice because it 's different money going into each account type in the roth you 've put after tax earnings and those will continue to grow tax free assuming you wait til 59.5 to start your withdraws the traditional ira is going to be funded with your old 401k which was funded with pre tax dollars they took from your paycheck so you 'll still pay taxes on the back end for the traditional ira money you 've never been taxed on but your roth has money where tax has already been taken out so no extra tax there you can have both types of accounts it 's pretty common considering most 401k plans are pre tax but many people see the benefit of a roth as greater than the tax write off you get from the 401k but if your company matches you 're not gon na leave free money on the table hope that helps

if the price has gone up from what it was when the person bought he may sell to collect his profit and spend the money if someone intends to keep his money in the market the trick is that you do n't know when the price of a given stock will peak if you could tell the future sure you 'd buy when the stock was at its lowest point just before it started up and then sell at the highest point just before it started down but no one knows for sure what those points are if a stockholder really knows that demand is increasing and the price will go up sure it would be foolish to sell but you can never know that or if you have some way that you do know that please call me and share your knowledge

as the name says its for income earned in a foreign country if you have been paying us income tax on this while living in the us nothing is going to change here you should be informing yourself on how to avoid double taxation in your new country of residence passive income earned abroad dividends interest also do not fall under this exemption   the purpose of the foreign earned income exclusion is to make it easy for expats who work abroad to avoid double income taxation without going through the complicated process of applying for tax credits the us is the only industrial country that taxes its residents regardless of where they reside that is also why it only goes to about $ 100,000 a year if you are a high earner they want to make it more difficult also as a side note since you are going to be abroad for a year i will point out that if you have more than $ 10,000 in foreign accounts at any point in the year you need to declare this in an fbar form this is not advertised as well as it should be and carries ridiculous penalties for non compliance i ca n't count the number of times i have heard a us expat say that they were unaware of this

you ca n't calculate how many houses it will take to do so you would have to know how much you can charge in rent compared to how much is costs to run that particular location if the desirability of that location changes so does the ability to rent the place and so does the amount you can charge it is possible to create a business in real estate that would allow you to generate retirement income but you would be focusing all your income in your retirement years on one segment of the entire investment universe the diversification would have to come from spreading the money through different types of real estate condo apartments houses commercial warehouse light industrial you would even have to decide whether you want them all in one micro market or spread throughout a larger market or an even wider area diversification   as your empire grew and you approached retirement age you would have to decide if you wanted to liquidate your investments to minimize risk the long leases that provides stability of income would make it hard to sell quickly if the market in one area started to weaken

a true 0 loan is a losing proposition for the bank that 's true   however when you look at actual 0 loans they usually have some catches there might also be late payment fees prepayment penalties and other clauses that make it a good deal on average to the bank   individual borrowers might be able to get away with free money but the bank does not look to make money on each loan they look to make money on thousands of loans overall for a retailer including new car sellers the actual financing costs will be baked into the sales price   they will add say 10 to the sales price in exchange for an interest free loan they can also sell these loans to an investment bank or other entity but they would be sold at a deep discount so the difference will be made up in the sales price or other fees it 's possible that they would just chalk it up to promotional discounts or customer acquisition costs but it would not be a good practice on a large scale

if you even qualify for a no down payment usda loan which i 'm not sure you would it would be extremely risky to take on a $ 250 k house loan and have near zero equity in the house for a good while if property values drop at all you are going to be stuck in that house which likely has a pretty high monthly payment insurance taxes hoa fees maintenance costs etc   my rule of thumb is that if you ca n't come up with a down payment then you ca n't afford the house especially with that much debt hanging over your head already if one major thing goes wrong with the house roof a c electrical etc you are going to put yourself in a world of hurt with no clear path out of that financial trap my suggestion keep renting until you have enough money for a downpayment even if this means downsizing your price range for houses you are considering

gt vouchers pay the private schools what the public school would have received in the first place the public school does n't pay as much in taxes and has a government supported administration that cuts waste at every chance so the private schools collect all the voucher money figure out they ca n't turn a profit and go bankrupt sending all the kids they had enrolled back to the public schools or forcing another issuance of another voucher costing the school system double to triple for every kid that gets screwed that way which means the public school system does n't have that money in their budget either forcing further cuts    i have never considered this before i can see the issue with it you 've changed my view on vouchers being a good system   it also causes self segregation at the schools because all the affluent parent can afford to drive their kids to another school poor kids need a bus that 's not covered by a voucher so we end up with schools that are 90 black hispanic with only 50 speaking english in a county that is 66 white while around the corner is a 90 white school where only 5 speak spanish when over 25 of the population does and that 's just the racial demographics that are immediately obvious the poverty levels are harder to get data on   i do n't consider this is necessarily a bad thing though if schools are self segregated it allows for teachers to teach in a certain way that is better for their demographic    school security officer bob on a power trip or the delinquent in the hall the problem is the same fearing for safety when there really should n't be a problem   you do n't get either of those at schools where there is almost no poverty you will have the same problem in canada if you move to a school district that has a significant amount of poverty   gt;and i get the feeling you do n't live near a population center   i do n't live in a big city but i live in a suburban area

concerning the general problem of short selling and the need to borrow shares to complete the transaction selling short is a cash transaction   unlike a futures contract where a short seller is entering into a legal agreement to sell something in the future in the case of short selling a share the buyer of the share is taking immediate delivery and is therefore entitled to all of the benefits and rights that come with share ownership   in particular the buyer of the shares is entitled to any dividends payable and where applicable to vote on motions at   if the short seller has not borrowed the shares to sell then buyer of non existent shares will have none of the rights associated with ownership the cash market is based on the idea of matching buyers and sellers   it does not accommodate people making promises consider that to allow short sellers to sell shares they have not borrowed opens up the possibility of the aggregate market selling more shares than actually exist   this would lead to all sorts of problematic consequences such as heavily distorting the price of the underlying share   if everyone is selling shares they have not borrowed willy nilly then it will drive the price of the share down much to the disadvantage of existing share holders in this case short sellers who have sold shares they have not already borrowed would be paying out more in dividends to the buyers than the total dividends being paid out by the underlying company there are instruments that allow for short selling of shares on a futures basis   one example is a cfd = contract for difference   in the case of cfds sellers are obliged to pay dividends to buyers as well as other   costs related to financing edit regarding your comment note that borrowing shares is not a market transaction   your account does not show you buying a share and then selling it   it simply shows you selling a share short   the borrowing is the result of an agreement between yourself and the lender and this agreement is off market   you do not actually pay the lender for the shares but you do pay financing costs for the borrowing so long as you maintain your short position edit i realise that i have not actually read your question correctly   you are not actually talking about naked short selling   you are talking about selling shares you already own in a hope of maintaining both a long and short position gross   the problem with this approach is that you must deliver the shares to the buyer   otherwise ask yourself what shares is the buyer actually buying if you want the bought shares to remain in your account if you are not going to deliver your long position shares then you will need to borrow the shares you are selling short for the reasons i have outlined above

holding pure cash is a problem for 401 k companies because they would then have follow banking rules because they would be holding your cash on their balance sheets they do n't want to be in that business instead they should offer at least one option as a cash equivalent a money market fund this way the money is held by the fund not by 401 k administrator money market funds invest in ultra short term paper such as overnight loans between banks and other debt instruments that mature in a matter of days so it is all extremely liquid as close to money as you can get without actually being money   it is extremely rare for a money market fund to lose value or break the buck during the crisis of 2008 only one or two funds broke the buck and it did n't last long they had gotten greedy and their short term investments were a little more aggressive as they were trying to get extra returns in short your money is safe in a money market fund and your 401 k plan should offer one as the cash option or at least it should offer a short term bond fund if you feel strongly that your money should be in actual cash you can always stop contributing to the 401 k and put the money in the bank this is not a good idea though unless you 're close to retirement you 'll be much better off investing in a well diversified portfolio even through the ups and downs of the market

the vanilla advice is investing your age in bonds and the rest in stocks index funds of course so if you 're 25 have 75 in stock index fund and 25 in bond index of course your 401k is tax sheltered so you want keep bonds there assuming you have taxable investments when comparing specific funds you need to pay attention to expense ratios for example vanguard 's sp 500 index has an expense ratio of .17 many mutual funds charge around 1.5 that means every year 1.5 of the fund total goes to the fund and that is regardless of up or down market since you 're young i would start studying up on personal finance as much as possible everyone has their favorite books and websites for sane no nonsense investment advise i would start at bogleheads.org i also recommend two books   this is assuming you want to set up a strategy and not fuss with it daily weekly monthly the problem with so many financial strategies is they 1 do n't work i.e. try to time the market or 2 are so overly complex the gains are not worth the effort i 've gotten a lot of help at the boglehead forums in terms of asset allocation and investment strategy good luck
