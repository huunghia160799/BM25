not sure how authoritative it is but according to this site yes can a corporation partnership or other non living entity make the contribution to an esa yes the tax law does not restrict the ability to make contributions to living individuals corporations and other entities may make contributions without regard for the usual donor income limit   however the same site indicates that you can just give the child the $ 2 k and have them contribute to their own esa so yes the income limit is pretty easy to get around

the government forced jpm to buy bear stearns essentially acquire its assets otherwise the bank 's liquidity would have which would have threatened the entire system basically bear stearns could n't service its own loans or leverage so it had to be bought otherwise those loans and leverage would appear as a default consequently the us government gave them the money to do it and forced them to do so without regard to what jpm wanted to do the government the treasury and the fed then proceeded to attack jpm for being too big to fail something that the government literally forced it to become i 'm not a banking apologist or a crazy libertarian i would vote democrat if i lived in the us but this is not accurate the purchase of bear stearns was forced it would've made more sense for jpm to just let bear stearns fail   following your analogy it 's actually more like you already having a million dollar house while the government forces you to take money to purchase the house across the street while leaving you with the bill for your properties into one huge estate then the government tells you your property is too big that you are a threat to the neighbourhood and have to all over again

not the same   if walmart were to actually make a product and then let the same people who made it buy the product before any customers that is a problem   heck it even pisses me off when a new product comes out not made by walmart say star wars ships and walmart employees buy all of them up before they hit the shelves that 's fucked up   they are n't customers at that point they are taking unfair advantage of their employment to buy things not yet available to real customers   also it has been long standing practice to not let employees buy the first x products off the line   why   because they might put more into the product that what they are paying for    imagine if all the employees were to buy the new 3s before tesla let a real customer get one imagine how many customers who put deposits down would be pissed    imho personally and professionally it 's just wrong to let your employees have first

as a landlord for 14 years with 10 properties i can give a few pointers be able and skilled enough to perform the majority of maintenance because this is your biggest expense otherwise   it will shock you how much maintenance rental units require do n't invest in real estate where the locality state favors the tenant e.g. new york city in disputes   a great state is florida where you can have someone evicted very quickly require a minimum credit score of 620 for all tenants over 21   this seems to be the magic number that keeps most of the nightmare tenants out makes sure they have a job nearby that pays at least three times their annual rent every renewal adjust your tenant 's rent to be approximately 5 less than going rates in your area   use zillow as a guide   keeping just below market rates keeps tenants from moving to cheaper options do not rent to anyone under 30 and single   trust me trust me trust me   you ca n't legally do this officially but do it while offering another acceptable reason for rejection there 's always something you could say that 's legitimate bad credit or chose another tenant etc charge a 5 late fee starting 10 days after the rent is due   20 days late file for eviction to let the tenant know you mean business do n't sink yourself too much in debt put enough money down so that you start profitable   i made the mistake of burying myself and i have n't barely been able to breathe for the entire 14 years   it 's just now finally coming into profitability do n't get adjustable rate or balloon loans under any circumstances   fixed 30 only   you can pay it down in 20 years and get the same benefits as if you got a fixed 20 but you will want the option of paying less some months so get the 30 and treat it like a 20 do n't even try to find your own tenants   use a realtor and take the 10 cost hit   they actually save you money because they can show your place to a lot more prospective tenants and it will be rented much sooner   empty place = empty wallet   also block out the part of the realtor 's agreement to lease where it states they keep getting the 10 every year thereafter   most realtors will go along with this just to get the first year but if they do n't find another realtor buy all in the same community if you can then you can use the same vendor list the same lease agreement the same realtor the same documentation spreadsheets etc   much much easier to have everything a clone   they say do n't put all your eggs in one basket but the reality is running a bunch of properties is a lot of work and the more similar they are the more you can duplicate your work for free   that 's worth a lot more day to day than the remote chance your entire community goes up in flames

you have two problems money exchange commissions and currency risk commissions are always exorbitant first you must find the cheapest way to get your money converted to the foreign currency and into your brokerage account the absolute cheapest way may involve some research and financial institution also i 'd forget about anything other than usd for the foreseeable future any other foreign currency will probably have higher commissions and a weaker market once you have that down you must avoid needlessly exchanging currencies keep a balance in the foreign currency keep all dividends and capital gains there and only take local money out of your brokerage account right before using it   that means of course that you need to keep enough local currency to pay taxes on any gains etc as for currency risk there are two solutions one solution is to buy your risk away using forex you sell an amount of usd lots that is mostly equivalent to your current investments and then just make sure you do n't get margin calls i 'm not sure just how cheap your rates would be in the uae but on average your investments should still have positive returns the other solution is to just stop seeing exchange rate fluctuations as losses if you had usd 100k and now you have usd how are you losing money exchange rates can go the other way just fine you know and holding usd is a good way to hedge against your country going south

bond mf etf comes in many flavour one way to look at them is corporate govt gilt money market short term overnight lending etc govt backed bonds the etf that invest money in these are also different types one way to evaluate an etf mf is to see where they invest your money corporate debts are by the highest coupon paying bonds however the chance of default is also greater if you wish to invest in these it is preferable to look at the etf mf 's debt portfolio financial ratings etc govt bonds are more stable and unless the govt defaults which happens more often than we would like to think here also look for higher rating bonds portfolio that the fund scheme carries the govt backed bonds are somewhat similar to bonds however these are by institutions which are backed by govt e.g. national railways municipal bodies etc any fund scheme that invests in these bonds could also be considered and similarly measured the last are the short term money market related which provides the least return but are very liquid it is very difficult to answer how you should invest large sum on etf that are bond oriented however from any investment perspective it is better to spread your money if i take your case of i would divide it into pieces and invest in 10 different etf mf schemes of different flavour hope this helps

as others have noted us law says that if you have over half the bill it 's worth the full value under half is worth nothing i presume if it is very close to half if even careful measurements show that you have you 'll have difficulty cashing it in precisely because the government and the banking system are n't going to allow themselves to be easily fooled by someone cutting bills in half and then trying to redeem both halves i 've seen several comments on here about how you 'd explain to the bank how so many bills were cut in half what if you just told them the truth not the part about killing someone of course but tell them that you made a deal neither of you wanted to bother with complex contracts and having to go to court if the other side did n't pay up so your buddy cut all the bills in half etc as you now have both halves and they clearly have the same serial number this no real evidence of fraud okay this is technically illegal 18 us code section whoever cuts or or or together or does any other thing to any bank bill draft note or other evidence of debt issued by any national banking association or federal reserve bank or the federal reserve system with intent to render such bank bill draft note or other evidence of debt unfit to be shall be fined under this title or not more than six months or both but you did n't do it the other guy did i presume the point of this law is to say that you ca n't get a hold of currency belonging to someone else and it so as to make it worthless as he 's now given you both halves i doubt anyone would bother to track him down and prosecute him just btw while checking up on the details of the law i stumbled across 18 usc 336 which says that it 's illegal to write a check for less than $ 1 with penalties of 6 months in prison i just got a check from at&t for 15 cents for one of those class action suits where the lawyers get $ 100 million and the victims get 15 cents each apparently that was illegal

one alternative to is the permanent portfolio concept do not buy the mutual fund behind this idea as you can easily obtain access to a low cost money market fund stock index fund and bond fund and significantly reduce the overall cost   it does n't have the huge booms that stock plans do but it also does n't have the crushing blows either   one thing some advisers mention is success is more about what you can stick to than what traditionally makes sense as you may not be able to stick to what traditionally makes sense all people differ this is an excellent pro and con critique of the permanent portfolio read the whole thing that does highlight some of the concerns with it especially the big one how well will it do in a world of high interest rates   assuming we ever see a world of high interest rates it may not provide a great return the authors make the assumption that interest rates will be rising in the future thus the permanent portfolio is riskier than a traditional 60/40   as we 're seeing in europe i think we 're headed for a world of negative interest rates something in the past most advisers have thought was very unlikely   i do n't know if we 'll see interest rates above 6 in my lifetime and if i live as long as my father that 's a good 60 + years ahead i realize people will think this is crazy to write but consider that people are willing to pay governments money to hold their cash that 's how crazy our world is and i do n't see this changing

i am going to add in an opinion here from the wall street journal that i read this morning in what 's at stake in the greek vote in light of current events and elections in greece the article claims that if the election results make it sound like a break from the euro is imminent then we will see a full fledged bank run greek banks would collapse the market exchange rate would likely be two or three drachmas to the euro which would double or triple the greek price of imported goods within a few days prices of assets including real estate assets would crumble those who moved their deposits abroad would be able to buy these assets cheaply leading to a significant regressive redistribution of greek wealth in short you 'd lose two thirds of your savings unless you were storing them somewhere safe from the conversion the article also predicts difficulty importing goods other nations will demand to be paid in euro not drachma leading to disruption of trade and various supply shortages   i will note that the predictions here seem to be in opposition to some other advice here which suggests that real estate will be an effective hedge

it depends a lot on your investment period and the quality of the bonds that you want to invest for example if you want to invest until the maturity of the bonds and the bonds are very safe i.e. they are not expected to default it does not matter that the interest rate rise that is because at the maturity of the bond it will converge to its maturity value which will be independent of the change of the interest rates although on the middle of the life the price of the bond will go down but the coupon should remain constant is a floating coupon an option could be to invest in an etf with short term bonds e.g. 1 year with aaa credit rating high quality so very low default rate it wo n't yield much but is more than 0 if you hold it until maturity

for starters the risk free rate has nothing to do with stocks   it would be independent of anything   it pays out the same return in all states of nature   the definition of a risk free asset is that regardless of how the universe turns out including a striking the earth killing everyone but the recipient then the payout would happen exactly as planned   one could imagine a computer still being on connected to a power supply and printing a check   most people use the 90-day t bill as the risk free rate   a beta greater than one implies it is more volatile than the market not that it moves more perfectly the capm should not be used for this   cryptocurrencies should not be used with this model because they have valuation dynamics related to the new issue of coins   in other words they have non market price movements as well as market price movements in general you should not use the capm because it does n't work empirically   it is famous but it is also wrong   a scientific hypothesis that is not supported by the data is a bad idea   my strong recommendation is that you read the intelligent investor by benjamin graham   it was last published in 1972 and it is still being printed   i believe warren buffett wrote the current forward for it   always go where the data supports you and never anywhere else no matter how elegant finally unless you are doing this like a trip to vegas for fun and willing to take the losses i would avoid cryptocurrencies because you do n't know what you are doing yet   it is obvious from the posting   i have multiple decades working in every type of financial institution and at every level bottom to top   i also have a and i am an incredible researcher   i am professionally qualified in three different disciplines if you want to learn how to do this start with the intelligent investor   get a basic book on accounting and learn basic accounting   pick up economics textbooks at least through intermediate for both microeconomics and macroeconomics   get william 's book introduction to bayesian statistics   you will need them for reasons that go very far beyond this post   trust me you want to master that book   find a statistician and ask them to teach it to you as a special topics course   it will help you as both either a marine officer or a naval officer   then after that pick up a copy of security analysis   either the 1943 copy yes it is in print by benjamin graham if you feel good about accounting or the 1987 copy by under the graham dodd   then if you are still interested in cryptocurrencies and they will be by then then pick up an economics textbook on money   if i were you i would learn about money commodity money and prison money first then you might understand why a cryptocurrency may not be an investment for you

how can someone use the account number to withdraw money without my    consent they can use your account number to game your banks phone support and try to their way into your account banks have gotten very good at this but theoretically with just the address he lives in your name and a bad bank phone rep he could get into your business the account number would just be one more piece of information to lead with i have 1 savings and 3 checking accounts with the same bank would they be able to gain access to the other accounts dependent on how incompetent the bad bank rep i referenced above is sure but the odds are incredibly low and if anything were to happen the bank would be falling over itself to fix it and make so that you do n't sue for a whole crap ton more is there a more secure and still free option that i have overlooked opening up yet another checking account solely for accounts receivable and transfer to accounts payable would keep your financial records more transparent also banks are doing money transfer by email now so i do n't know how great that is for business transactions but in that instance you 're just giving out an email linked to a money receiving account instead of an actual account number paypal is also a pretty good eft middleman but their business practices have become shady in the past 5 years

i like muro questions no i do n't think they do   because for me as a personal finance investor type just trying to save for retirement they mean nothing if i can not tell what the basic business model of a company is and how that business model is profitable and makes money then that is a no buy for me   if i do understand it they i can do some more looking into the stock and company and see if i want to purchase i buy index funds that are indexes of industries and companies i can understand   i let a fund manager worry about the details but i get myself in the right ballpark and i use a simple logic test to get there not the word of a rating agency if belong in the system as a whole i could not really say   i could not possibly do the level of accounting research and other investigation that rating agencies do so even if the business model is sound i might lose an investment because the company is not an ethical one   again that is the job of my fund manager to determine   furthermore and i mitigate that risk by buying indexes instead of individual stock

yes this is possible in the most liquid securities but currently it would take several days to get filled in one contract at that amount there are also position size limits set by the occ and other self regulatory organizations that attempt to prevent people from a market through the options market getting loads of contacts without effecting the price of the underlying asset exercising those contracts and suddenly owning a huge stake of the asset and nobody saw it coming although this is still very very possible so for your example of an option of $ 1.00 per contract then the position size limits would have prevented 100 million of those being opened by one person account that is realistically you would spread out your orders amongst several options strike prices and expiration dates stock indexes are some very liquid examples so for the standard poors you can open options contracts on the spy etf as well as the s&p 500 futures as well as many other s&p 500 products that only trade options and do not have the ability to be traded as the underlying shares and there is also the saying liquidity liquidity meaning that because you are making the market more liquid other large market participants will also see the liquidity and want to participate where they previously thought it was too illiquid and impossible to close a large position quickly

amortization is the process by which your loan balance decreases over time for both mortgages and credit card balances your interest charges are based on what you owe   the calculation of the balance is a little different but it still is based on what you owe you 're observing correctly that most of the first payments on a mortgage are interest   this stands to reason since an amortization schedule for a fixed rate mortgage is constructed on the assumption that you 're making your payments equally over the course of the mortgage   since you owe more at the beginning you accrue more interest and a larger fraction of your payment is interest   near the end you owe little and most of your payment therefore is principal

this is great thanks so just assuming a fund happened to average out to libor plus 50 for a given year would applying that rate to the notional value of the index swaps provide a reasonable estimate of the drag an etf investor would experience due to the cost associated with the index swaps   for instance applying this to the hypothetical i linked to in the original question they assumed fund assets of $ 100 m with 2x leverage achieved through $ 85 m of s&amp;p500 stocks $ 25 m of s&amp;p500 futures and a notional value of the s&amp;p500 swaps at $ so the true costs to an etf investor would be expense ratio + commissions on the $ 85 m of s&amp;p500 holdings + costs associated with $ 25 m of futures contracts + costs associated with the $ 90 m of swaps and the costs associated with the $ 90 m of swaps might be roughly libor plus 50

i think you 're missing the point in terms of profit margin the trucks actually pay a larger percentage of their gross in overhead that is their net is a larger proportion of their gross than it is on average for restaurants they pay more for inspections they pay for services and many other things and licenses and permits than restaurants typically pay   what you are proposing is a law that would also bar another brick and mortar restaurant in your own words one that sells the same product for cheaper due to the lack of overhead say for example a chain fast food restaurant   are you saying that new businesses should n't be allowed to open next door to established businesses of the same type or does your argument only apply to food trucks   i am not a flag waving libertarian or anything but i do n't think that choosing which types of business model to protect should be on the list of things that city governments should be doing especially in the case of states like california and texas where the state vehicle code clearly states that the only regulation a municipality may enact on otherwise legal mobile vendor are rules that serve the public health and/or safety not competition   just because some people may not agree with you does n't mean that they are either simple minded or misread your point i understand your argument very well i just do n't happen to agree with it that does n't mean i think you are simple minded either i just think you 're a name calling jerk

plenty of retired people do stay in the us for longer than 60 days and do n't pay taxes in this irs document 60 days stay appears to be the test for having a substantial presence in the us which is part of the test for determining residency however the following is also written even if you meet the substantial presence test you can be treated as a nonresident alien if you are present in the united states for fewer than 183 days during the current calendar year you maintain a tax home in a foreign country during the year and you have a closer connection to that country than to the united states   in other words if your property in the us is not your main one you pay tax in another country and you stay there less than half the year you should be treated as a non resident i am not a lawyer and this is not advice this irs webpage describes the tax situation of nonresident aliens as i understand it if you are not engaged in any kind of business in the us and have no income from us sources then you do not have to file a tax return you should also look into the subject of double tax agreements if your home country has one and you pay taxes there you probably wo n't need to pay extra tax to the us but again do n't take my word for it

what would happen if you was to cash a check did n’t realize it was    to you and your finance company take it to a local business that has    a money center they cash the check without even having you sign let    alone having the finance companies endorsement on it the money    cleared my account like a couple months ago and it was just brought up    now the reason why the check was made out the owner and the lender is to make sure the repairs were done on the car the lender wants to make sure that their investment is protected   for example you get a six year loan on a new car in the second year you get hit by another driver the damage estimate is $ 1,000 and you decide it does n't look that bad so you decide to skip the repair and spend the money on paying off debts what you do n't know is that if they had done the repair they would have found hidden damage and the repair would have cost $ 3,000 and would have been covered by the other persons insurance   jump ahead 2 years the rust from the skipped repair causes other issues now it will cost $ 5,000 to fix the insurance wo n't cover it and now a car with an outstanding loan balance of $ 4,000 and a value of $ 10,000 if the damage did n't exist needs $ 5,000 to fix   the lender wants the repairs done they would have not signed the check before seeing the proof the repairs were done to their satisfaction but because the check was cashed without their involvement they will be looking for a detailed receipt showing that all the work was done they may require that the repair be done at a certified repair shop with manufacturer parts   if you do n't have a detailed bill ask the repair shop for a copy of the original one

i do n't know of a guideline to how often you can ask for an increase you can ask as often as you like as for consequences refer to is there a downside to asking for a credit increase where the consensus is that aside from a possible temporary hard pull on your credit report there 's probably no risk to asking depending on your credit score history and especially in the current economy you may get no as an answer most often you can try talking to your card 's credit department or even customer retention department as they may have more leverage they may say yes or no or that they need to review your account when you do ask for an increase i would make sure to ask if there will be a hard pull on your report if there is any cost or downside to applying and to make sure that this would be an increase to your current credit line not a new account

the best way to use your new credit card to establish credit history is to use it for small medium purchases and pay it off in full each month there is no reward for using it more than once a month if you are getting some sort of rewards for using the credit card to pay your health insurance air miles points etc then you could go ahead and use it your credit score will take a temporary hit for high utilization you can actually avoid this by making a partial payment before the end of the billing cycle so that your utilization is never reported as near 100

then the brick and mortar stores will just switch to delivery walmart could deliver pretty much anything to you in 15 minutes as well as cvs or walgreens and a few other stores they do n't though because it is much more profitable to have you come into the store and buy some shit you do n't need if it ever reaches a tipping point where online is really taking away that much then they will easily change the going into a store and shopping is n't going anywhere though because there is certain brain chemistry at play that gets you to spend more money and enjoy it more not just because of getting the item sooner but the inspection process etc   what 's probably more likely is that you will end up going into small local very close to you demo stores and checking out the items deciding what you want using your smartphone to build a cart going through a cart confirmation and then the items will be delivered to your home in ~20 minutes or so there will also be things you can buy directly at the demo store and take home such as new items that are being promoted you may even be able to select items at home that you want to checkout and have that bundled with your delivery from the demo store

this is potentially a real risk to google the odds of such a huge success it decreases google 's profits are tiny i think but there is a real risk that the increase in google 's profits going forward are materially affected by a well done competitor to adsense   if amazon took away 10 of what google 's adsense business 4 years from now would have been that is likely material to google 's earning not huge but real   even losing the ads on amazon 's web site is likely noticeable though not a huge deal i would guess to google though to most companies it would be a huge lose   there is even the potential google has to reduce their profitability on adsense to compete giving web sites a better cut of revenue   that said i think amazon has plenty of challenges to making it an effective competitor to google but they have a chance and there is even a small chance very small i think that amazon could create a competitor that actually results in noticeably say over 15 declining revenue to google via adsense likely even in this case google continues to grow profit as a company overall   google revenue from ads from their own websites are the most important earnings and likely to continue to be so also new business non web ad income is growing and i think will continue to do so this is likely an area some might find more questionable

bob should treat both positions as incomplete and explore a viewpoint which does a better job of separating value from volatility so we should start by recognizing that what bob is really doing is trading pieces of paper say stocks from fund 1 or bonds from fund 2 to pick historically volatile and non volatile instruments for pieces of paper   in the end this is a trade and should always be thought of as such   does bob value his stocks more than his bonds   then he should probably draw from fund 2   if he values his bonds more he should probably draw from fund 1 however both bob and his financial adviser demonstrate an assumption that an instrument whether stock bond or dollar bill has some intrinsic value which may raise over time   the issue is whether its perceived value is a good measure of its actual value or not from this perspective we can see the stock fund 1 as having an actual value that grows quickly 6.5 = and the bond fund 2 as having an actual value that grows slower 4.5 1.15 $ = $   now the perceived value of the stocks is highly volatile   the chairman of the fed and a high velocity trader drives a stock up or down at a rate that would give you this perspective aligns with the broker 's opinion   if the stocks are low it means their perceived value is artificially low and selling it would be a mistake because the market is those pieces of paper as being worth less than they actually are   in this case bob wins by keeping the stocks and selling bonds because the stocks are perceived as undervalued and thus are worth keeping until perceptions change on the other hand consider the assumption we carefully into the argument without any the assumption that the actual value of the stock aligns with its historical value   past performance does not predict future results   its entirely possible that the actual value of the stocks is actually much lower than the historical value and that it was the perceived value that was artificially higher   it may be continuing to do so who knows how overvalued the perceived value actually was   in this case bob wins by keeping the bonds   in this case the stocks may have underperformed to drive perceptions towards their actual value and bob has a great chance to get out from under this market the reality is somewhere between them   the actual values are moving and the perceived values are moving and the world mixes them up enough to make lottery tickets look like a decent investment instrument   so what can we do bob 's broker has a smart idea he 's just not fully explaining it because it is unprofessional to do so   historically speaking bobs who lost a bunch of money in the stock market are poor judges of where the stock market is going next arguably you should be talking to the joes who made a bunch of money they might have more of a clue   humans are emotional beings and we have an emotional instinct to cut ties when things start to go south   the market on emotional thinkers happily giving them what they want in exchange for taking some of their money   bob 's broker is quoting a well recognized phrase that is a polite way of saying you are being emotional in your judgement and here is a phrasing to suggest you should temper that judgement of course the broker may also not know what they 're doing   i 've seen arguments that they do n't   plenty of people listened to their brokers all the way to the great crash of 2008   brokers are human too they just put their emotions in different places   so now bob has no clear voice to listen to   sounds like a trap however there is a solution   bob should think about more than just simple dollars   bob should think about the rest of his life and where he would like the risk to appear   if bob draws from fund 1 liquidating stocks then bob has made a choice to realize any losses or gains early specifically now   he may win he may lose   however no matter what he will have a less volatile portfolio and thus he can rely on it more in the long run if bob draws from fund 2 liquidating bonds instead then bob has made a choice not to realize any losses or gains right away   he may win he may lose   however whether he wins or loses will not be clear perhaps until retirement when he needs to draw on that money and finds fund 1 is still under performing so he has to work a few more years before retirement   there is a magical assumption that the stock market will always continue rewarding risk takers but no one has quite been able to prove it once bob includes his life perspective in the mix and does n't look just at the cold hard dollars on the table bob can make a more educated decision   just to throw more options on the table bob might rationally choose to do any one of a number of other options which are not extremes in order to find a happy medium that best fits bob 's life needs i intentionally chose to label fund 1 as stocks and fund 2 as bonds even though this is a terribly crude assumption because i feel those words have an emotional attachment associated to them which 1 and 2 simply do not   given that part of the argument is that emotions play a part it seemed reasonable to dig into underlying emotional biases as part of my wording   feel free to replace words as you see fit to remove this bias if desired

i 'll chime in as someone who started a business after my first year in college that business kept me going for a couple decades and allowed me to retire young   first thought you do n't just start a business with no idea what you 're going to do when you have a true passion you 'll know it    once you discover something that you love to do you will find that you dedicate your time to it and it wo n't feel like work you 'll spend countless hours on it becoming great at it it will be obvious that you should pursue it if you do n't feel like this then you 'll very likely give up when you need to double down or if it 's really a good business idea you wo n't be competitive    starting and running a business may be the hardest thing you 'll ever do when your friends are out partying you 'll be coding or stocking shelves or writing ad copy or paying bills or cleaning toilets when the business has a bad month you 'll forgo your income so you can pay your employees or other bills but you 'll love it and believe in what you 're doing so you 'll keep going    it seems trite but so much will just come down to persistence and hard work over time you 'll become one of the best at what you do but that will take years years before you 'll likely make enough money to survive so for most people you 'll have to get a conventional job to pay the bills   as you try to sell yourself or your product you have to keep asking yourself would i spend my money on this if you would n't why would anyone else always remember that    the positive thing is if you find your calling you 'll keep thinking i have the best job in the world and it wo n't feel like work it will just be what you do

creditworthiness is proven over time the longer your track record of making payments on time the more probable you will stick to credit agreements in future or so the reasoning goes conversely someone who has only just started applying for credit could be someone whose finances were previously stable but have now started to get into difficulty obviously this is not necessarily the case but it is one possible inference this inference is strengthened when same person applies for further credit in a short space of time   ultimately what is considered positive is a stable credit record over a reasonable period of time because it indicates you stick to payment schedules and do n't suddenly need credit due to money problems credit card accounts are considered a good indicator of credit status because they imply what kind of borrower you are whereas many credit arrangements present a straightforward case of arrears no arrears e.g. think of a mobile phone account either you pay your bill or you do n't with credit cards there is an element of flexibility in how much you borrow and how much of that you repay if you run up four figure monthly balances but clear them in full each month without fail that is a good sign if your average balance is increasing and you are paying on time but just the minimum amount that is a potential flag in other words credit cards are of particular interest because they paint a more nuanced picture provided you use one responsibly getting and using a credit card may improve your status with credit reference agencies

you 're going to have a huge problem getting approved for anything as long as you have an unpaid bill on your report pay it and make sure its reported as paid in full asap once that settled your credit will start to improve slowly ca n't do anything about that it will take time you can make the situation improve a bit faster by lending money to yourself and having it reported regularly on your report how easy get a secured credit card what does it mean you put x amount of money in a cd and the bank will issue you a credit card secured by that cd your credit line will be based on the amount in that cd and you 'll probably pay some fees to the bank for the service shop around you might get lucky and find a secured card without fees if you look hard enough secured cards are reported as revolving credit just as any other credit card and are easy to get because the bank does n't take the risk you do   if you default on your payments your cd goes to cover the debt and the card gets cancelled but make absolutely sure that you do not default charge between 10 and 30 of the credit limit each month not more pay the balance shown on your credit card statement in full every month and by the due date shown on your monthly statement   it will take a while but you would typically start noticing the improvement within ~6 12 months stop applying for stuff not store cards not car loans you 're not going to get anything and will just keep dragging your scores down each time you have a pull on your report the score goes down a lot of pulls frequent pulls the score goes down a lot lenders can see when one is desperate and no one wants to lend money to desperate people   optimally lenders want to lend money to people who does n't need loans but in order to keep the business running they 'll settle for slightly less people who do n't usually need loans and pay the loans they do have on time you fail on both as you 're desperate for a loan and you have unpaid bills on your report

publication covers this in a fairly specific manner page 11 section are you covered by an employer plan specifies the form w-2 you receive from your employer has a box    used to indicate whether you were covered for the year    the retirement plan box should be checked if you were    covered so by default if that 's checked you 're covered   590 does go into more detail though assuming you 're covered under a defined contribution plan a 401k for example defined contribution plan generally you are covered    by a defined contribution plan for a tax year if amounts are    contributed or allocated to your account for the plan year    that ends with or within that tax year   tax year tax year your tax year is the annual accounting period    you use to keep records and report income and expenses    on your income tax return for almost all people the tax    year is the calendar year further they cover issues related to an employee leaving dec. 31 very specifically a special rule applies to certain plans in which it is not    possible to determine if an amount will be contributed to    your account for a given plan year if for a plan year no    amounts have been allocated to your account that are attributable    to employer contributions employee contributions    or by the last day of the plan year and    contributions are discretionary for the plan year you are    not covered for the tax year in which the plan year ends if    after the plan year ends the employer makes a contribution    for that plan year you are covered for the tax year in    which the contribution is made example example mickey was covered by a profit sharing plan    and left the company on december 31 2014 the plan    year runs from july 1 to june 30 under the terms of the    plan employer contributions do not have to be made but    if they are made they are contributed to the plan before    the due date for filing the company 's tax return such contributions    are allocated as of the last day of the plan year    and allocations are made to the accounts of individuals    who have any service during the plan year as of june 30    2015 no contributions were made that were allocated to    the june 30 2015 plan year and no had been    allocated within the plan year in addition as of that date    the company was not obligated to make a contribution for    such plan year and it was impossible to determine    whether or not a contribution would be made for the plan    year on december 31 2015 the company decided to    contribute to the plan for the plan year ending june 30    2015 that contribution was made on february 15 2016    mickey is an active participant in the plan for his 2016 tax    year but not for his 2015 tax year mickey is in a similar but different circumstance and it 's clear from the irs 's treatment of his circumstance that you would be in the same boat just a year less off but be aware given mickey 's situation that it 's theoretically possible for them to make another contribution next year as mickey had depending on when their plan year etc ends so from the irs 's point of view everything you said the company did is correct   they paid you in january contributed to your 401k as a result of that paycheck and thus you were officially considered covered for 2015

in general lump sum investing will tend to outperform dollar cost averaging because markets tend to increase in value so investing more money earlier will generally be a better strategy   the advantage of dollar cost averaging is that it protects you in times when markets are overvalued or prior to market corrections    as an extreme example if you done a lump sum investment in late 2008 and then suffered through the subsequent market crash it may have taken you 2 3 years to get back to even   if you began a dollar cost averaging investment plan in late 2008 it may have only taken you a 6 months to get back to even dollar cost averaging can also help to reduce the urge to time the market which for most investors is definitely a good thing

yes the value of a stock is completely 100 determined by what people are willing to pay for it in conjunction with what people who have it are willing to sell it for if something really bad happened to a company like their only factory burned to the ground and the traders did n't care then i guess in that scenario the value of the stock would not change but you can spin all sorts of hypotheticals of that sort if dogs could talk would german speak german etc any answer is pretty meaningless because the premise is wildly unlikely as cqm notes traders in this context means everyone who buys or sells stock if you buy stock that includes you they 're not some cabal somewhere if you see a stock listed at whatever $ 50 and you are not willing to pay more than $ 40 for it then you refuse to buy and so you tend to force the price down if you 're not a billionaire then your impact on the market is tiny but the market is made up of millions of people each with tiny influence note that all this is true not just of the stock market but of every product on the market a product is worth whatever the owner is willing to sell it for and people are willing to pay this is what determines the price of everything from houses to it 's a little theory i 've invented that i like to call the law of supply and demand

sovereign states borrow money explicitly in a two primary ways a sovereign can not be compelled to repay debt and there is n't a judicial process like bankruptcy to erase debt when sovereigns default they negotiate new terms with creditors and pay back some fraction of the actual debt owed   they can also print money to repay debt which has other nasty consequences but while a state can not be compelled to repay a debt creditors can not be compelled to loan money to the state either any enterprise of sufficient size needs access to capital via loans to meet daily obligations in anticipation of revenue even when times are good defaulting makes borrowing impossible or expensive and is avoided regarding using your military to avoid repaying debt remember what napoleon said an army travels on its stomach military campaigns are expensive no borrowing ability means the soldiers do n't get paid and the food fuel and ammo do n't get delivered smaller countries have other risks as well many nations are essentially forced to use us dollars as a reserve currency or are forced by the market to borrow money in a foreign currency this creates a situation where any risk of non payment results in a deep devaluation of the local currency when your debt is denominated in dollars these shifts can dramatically increase your debt obligations from a local currency point of view you also run the risk that a larger or richer company will park in your harbor and seize assets as payment the us and britain engaged in this several times during the 19th and 20th centuries in general not paying the bills has a effect bad situations get worse and they do so quickly

i dunno the problem with a great depression taking place today is that we 're all interconnected    despite the massive debt burdens amp imf knocking on doors things are not as tough as they could be most of us will not starve to death and have a roof over our heads be looked after when sick and can afford basics which were once considered luxuries i.e. tv internet microwave etc   yet that 's the kind of picture you paint when you mention the great depression walking around barefoot worrying about where the next meal will come from it 's at best and it allows the people with cash to demand higher interest payback so it 's in their best interests to keep the shit out of doom amp gloom news   it 's all getting a bit see through imo and people are beginning to question whether the markets and bondholders are real people or whether they 're some make believe god

let 's ask another question   why do you buy x at price $ y here are some answers now another question   are you guaranteed to get at least $ y worth of value when you buy x of course not   a lot of things can happen   your car can be a lemon   your can get run over by a   or the prices of the underlying commodity or security can go against your futures contract you can raise your chances of getting appropriate value out of x by doing your homework and hedging your risk   the more homework you do the less of a gamble you 're taking

i think the best advice you could get would be to find a lawyer if that foreign company has any presence in the us they should be the ones signing off as the successor otherwise you may find yourself in a limbo that would require some legal assistance generally in most states a corporation can not be dissolved without resolving issues like this which is probably why they told you the plan is terminating someone asked them to terminate it you need to find that someone

it depends on how immediately you think you 'll need your emergency fund cash if you anticipate running into problems where you need cash right away e.g. you live paycheck to paycheck and your car breaks down a lot put it into a checking or money market account if you do n't think your emergencies will require immediate access to cash e.g. unemployment then put it in a savings account or cd if there is a lot of money in your accounts that goes unused and you want a bigger safety net then consider investing it though it 's generally a better idea to pay off debts at this point i think the best idea is to split your emergency fund between your checking and savings maybe 20 checking and 80 savings that way you have some extra cash on hand when you need it while most of your money is growing in savings

that would be great i 'm just skeptical that it 's possible to make green energy cheaper than fossil fuels i guess you could do this by subsidizing research on green energy which is not a bad idea   gt;if you make conventional energy artificially expensive to nudge people towards renewables then you open the door to politicians gaining power by promising to reduce energy costs to the consumer via removing those taxes you 're advocating for   this is actually a great criticism but i do n't see any better solution unless we are going to create an alternative to state capitalism

you can hire a builder to build for you on a lot that you would be happy to live on with utilities already connected a large piece of land gets a little more complicated what easements exist and what new easements would need to be created when connecting utilities would all of the lots already have street access or do you need to dedicate some of the land to building a new road in the also i edited your post because is 1.9 acres building homes on acre parcels assuming no need for a road to take another 15 of the lot reduces the value of the homes that you are building you should run the numbers with 6 houses and see how attractive the math looks also you should look for updated numbers on cost to build custom homes are likely closer to $ where an architect is involved with drawing the plans

i would also check into whether you can keep using your credit card instead of switching to a debit card tied to your checking account   the credit card provides you protection from someone wiping your account out   most banks will help you get the money back if this happens while using a debit card   but you are out the money while the bank figures out who is wrong   in the credit cards case none of your money is actually taken from your account while you dispute the charge i also agree with the others that having all your money in one account is more difficult to keep real spending money separate from emergency fund money

rather than automating it why not just create a listing that you maintain and display on your site yourself   that way you do n't have to give out credentials or anything else it also presents a bit of a marketing opportunity   you could group contributors by the size of their contributions and thank them publicly   for example maybe your top contributors could be members of the heroes club and you could come up with names for other groups   it 's a way of publicly acknowledging their contributions in a way that they appreciate and perhaps it motivates others to up their own contributions to get into one of the more prominent   it becomes a competitive one thing if that makes sense i understand your desire to be transparent and that 's admirable but see the marketing and public relations opportunity it brings to you as well i hope this helps good luck

yes it is a very good idea to start your credit history early   it sounds like you have a good understanding of the appropriate use of credit as a substitute for cash rather than a supplement to income   as long as you keep your expenses under control and pay off your card each month i see no problems with the idea try to find a card with no annual fees a low interest rate if possible which will be difficult at your age and with some form of rewards such as cash back   look for a reputable issuing bank and keep the account open even after you get a new card down the road   your credit score is positively correlated with having an account open for a long time having a good credit usage to credit limit ratio and having accounts in good standing and paid on time

i 'm a manager of a charity shop so work with a wide range of unpaid volunteers which requires an especially soft touch most of the time everyone is different or people will just leave   it takes longer but the overall results are better and more long lasting     think of it like pushing a boat from the with your hand always applying a small pressure to get the boat to gradually move where you want rather than ramming into the side of a boat with a truck sure it 'll get you there quicker but will cause lasting damage   it 's also best to take it slow as you need time to learn the business and people   be clear about your approach with your boss managing their expectations is important   anyway here is what i 've learnt in my first year or so doing this job plus things i 've learnt along the way in my previous career as a software engineer radical career change where i 've managed people and been managed   1 be yourself   do n't pretend to be someone you 're not everyone will see right through you in an instant   you 'll change over time as you get used to managing people that 's fine but always be yourself through that   1 say thank you to everyone at the end of each day as you say goodbye   mean it   think of all the work they 've done today for you   1 spread the shit evenly   every job has crap parts make sure you and everyone else gets their fair share and no more   i regularly hoover clean the bathroom wash up and so on   1 ask do n't tell   if you orders people will do them but they 'll put no effort into it and you 'll distance yourself from them   ask if they could do something for you   it 's a nobody ever says no unless there is an issue which you need to deal with anyway   1 pick your battles   is it worth moaning at someone for that little   or can you get over that message another way   i.e. i do n't like people having drinks on the till counter so when i take over to cover for them for a break i just move it   after a while no drinks appear on the counter   1 be honest   if you do n't know say so ask for input   weigh up the options out loud then pick one explain why and go for it or better yet get the person that thought of it working with you not for you to implement it   if you 're wrong hold your hand up and try the other   1 always take responsibility when things go wrong that is actually your job   when things go well use you and   if things go badly sometimes i sometimes we but never   1 always be pro active with money   if you owe your staff money for any reason chase them to give it to them never let them chase you   if there even might be any problems at all with money let everyone know as soon as you know   go out of your way to ensure they get what they 're owed now not later   i just did this today actually i forgot to do expenses for someone and switched over the till so there was n't enough cash in the new till to cover it so i just took it from the money to bank and marked down why there was a discrepancy on the paperwork and will do the same tomorrow when that does n't match by the opposite amount   i should not do this at all but it 's the right thing to do   1 listen carefully   often employees have problems but wo n't bring them up either they do n't think anything will get done or they do n't want to get someone in trouble or something else   however if you listen and observe carefully often there are clues to the things that are bothering them and you 'll find ways to tackle them   1 do n't run a team meeting until you know everyone if you can avoid it   you do n't know shit about how the company works who the people are what makes them tick what they do and so on   all you 'll do is come across as a bit of a tool and distance yourself from them as boss   when you do run one just guide it do n't lead it   always hand over control of the conversation as much as possible except of course where you 've got things that they need to hear   1 never joke about your power   i.e. do n't mess about saying how you 'll fire them if blah or how you 'll give them all the shit work or mention pay etc   i had a boss that did that when drunk not in a serious way at all and he was very widely hated for pretty well nothing other than that   it served as a constant reminder that he 's separate from us   1 give people room but do n't be taken for a ride   if someone is late once fine i would n't even mention it   late again maybe i 'd make a light joke of it   late again we 'll have a chat always listen to what they have to say is there any way you can help   but do n't be taken for a ride   i 've had people pick me up on being late the very first time i was late and you know what i was more late for that job from then on than i 've ever been before or since   1 try to get your employees to come up with ideas to move the business forwards   it 's very easy to look at a business and say we need this that and the other doing like this   but you need to get your employees to buy into it or they just wo n't do it properly   it 'll be like getting blood out of a stone to start with but if you 're patient and support their ideas most people will come around   you need their input as they know their job better than you   1 edit always be clear what you want from people when   speak with them about the before hand to make sure they 're comfortable with it and think it can be done in the time   so many times i 've been given tasks with unrealistic deadlines the manager has n't wanted to listen to my protests then wonders why it did n't get done in time   it 's crazy really wanting something to be possible does n't make it so   a not so quick example   one volunteer said to me that we should halve the price of all the fiction books to .99 to compete with other shops   i personally do n't think that 's a good idea our shop has better quality stock and is much more organised but i have no evidence to the contrary and i honestly do n't really know so i say go for it and support it completely as a good idea   we tried it for a month and we made exactly the same amount of money sold twice as many books but no extra cash   so it was valuable to do and we discovered that maybe 1.49 might be a good option to try   but far more importantly they saw their ideas put into action right away and saw the results of that   it empowered them which is incredibly important for a wide variety of reasons that are too much to go into here but basically it makes them feel more respected enjoy their job more think more about the business and so on you know what it 's like when you 're empowered how good it feels   however it 's being empowered with the support that 's important something which you personally going into your new job do n't feel you have which leads to the anxiety and so on i 'm sure you 're feeling now   do n't put your employees in that position if you can help it   there is also another reason why i outright supported their idea from the offset   it did n't work although we did n't loose anything and i thought it would n't but i can say we tried   it was n't down to that one person they did n't feel bad that it did n't work because i was right behind it and it 's my job to take responsibility   if it had been their idea that had failed they would n't give any ideas ever again and everyone else would be put off too   as soon as anyone tries to take personal responsibility and they will stick to your guns in supporting them stronger than ever   now we 're getting a lot of ideas all the time they 're having in depth discussions amongst each other they 're pro active and so on   as a business we 're doing much better now because of it profits are up 15 from last year and we 've only just begun to kick things off and that 's going against a national trend downwards   we 've had several critical changes to our shop layout back room organisation results reporting stock handling processes and so on all from volunteer ideas and feedback   so the 15 is actually the tip of the iceberg what we 've got in place now should allow us to grow more quickly too   and remember you can make suggestions too of course but they 're just that suggestions   suggest them to your employees speak with several of them then get back to them when you 've made a decision   do n't say i 'm thinking of trying this say i was just thinking what about this   do you think it would work and talk about it   think of arguments against your idea see if they counter them and so on   now how many of these changes did i think of before hand and want to enact   about half so we 've got a significant number of successful ideas that i personally had n't thought of everyone 's happier and working harder for the business and we have a bright future   i have more ideas too and people listen to and respect them now just like i have with them   i think that 's the key to it all really   show your employees respect and they 'll show you it in return

you ask a question is there any real purpose in purchasing bonds and then appear to go off on a rant before the question is closed by members here let me offer this   this chart reflects the 10 year bond rate from 1960 2004 give or take the coupon rate was over 4 asset allocation suggests a mix of stocks and bonds seeking to avoid the risk of having all of one 's eggs in one basket to that end the simplest approach is a stock bond mix over time a 70/30 mix provides nearly 95 of the long return but with a much lower volatility   i 'm not going to suggest that a 2 10 year bond is an exciting investment but bonds may have a place in one 's portfolio i 'm not going to debate each and every point you attempted but 5 is especially questionable if you feel this is true you should short bonds or you should at least 99 of the time do you have data to back up this statement

1 there is no logic in this question because when there is an increase in net income for the year it will be in the form of something ie it can be cash and cash equivalent like cash in hand or cash at bank so as your says if there is increase in net income of 20 then asset side also increase by which makes the equation   asset = liability + share capital tally 2 balance sheet is a statement of assets liabilities and capital of a business or other organization expenditure or income related items wo nt come under balance sheet it comes under profit and loss account 3 stockholders equity can increase just as easy when a firm issues bonus to the existing share holders from free reserve a c or capital redemption reserve a c or security premium this will increase the share holders equity and also decreases the reserve a c

generally speaking the lower credit score trumps   in the case you cite the lower credit score will prevail   however you may need to do exactly that in order to qualify for the loan income wise    there are two factors when obtaining a mortgage really all loans but more so with a mortgage   the to repay credit score   and your ability to service the debt   this last one is a combination of income and debt to income ratio if you do n't have enough income to qualify for the loan or fail to meet the debt to income ration you may have to use your gf 's income to qualify despite her poor credit you might want to see past posts about buying property with non spouses   it could work but generally it requires a lot of legal work before closing on the deal   avoiding this will lead to tales of woe

first of all never is too late to develop good habits so you know what you want to do and you are going about the how now first you should pay off any consumer debt except from mortgage which should be planned for prioritize your consumer debt credit cards consumer loans etc according to the interest rates starting with the one with the highest interest and going to the one with the lowest one because you should make quite the investments to pay off this interest debt and still make a profit second you should start saving some money the 10 rule of thumb is a good one and for starters having aside the money you need to get by for at least 3 months is quite okay as they say cash is king now that you actually realize the amount you can spare each month to start investing assuming you had to do something of the aforementioned it 's time to see the risk you are comfortable taking different risk taking views lead to different investing routes so assuming once again that you are risk averse having a newborn baby and all and that you want something more than just a savings account you can start looking for things that do n't require much attention even more so if you are going on you own about it such as low risk mutual funds etf exchange traded funds and index funds to track indexes like ftse and s&p500 you could get an average annual return of 10 12 just google top safe etfs for example and you could take a quick look at credible sites like forbes etc also you can take a look at fixed income options such as government bonds last but not least you can always get your pick at some value companies stocks usually big companies that have proven track record check warren buffet on this you should look for stocks that pay dividends since you are in for the long run and not just to make a quick buck   i hope i helped a bit and as always be cautious about investing since they have some inherent risks if you do n't feel comfortable with making your own investment choices you should contact a specialist like a financial planner or advisor no matter what the case may be on this you should still educate yourself on this just to get a grasp on this

when people even people in the media say the stock market is up because of x or the stock market is down because of y they are often engaging in what nicolas taleb calls the narrative they see the market has moved in one direction or another they open their newspaper pick a headline that provides a plausible reason for the market to move and say oh that is why the stock market is down very rarely do statements like this actually come from research asking people why they bought or sold that day sometimes they may be right but it is usually just story telling in terms of old fashioned logic this is called the post hoc ergo proper hoc fallacy now all the points people have raised about the us deficit may be valid and there are plenty of reasons for worrying about the future of the world economy but they were all known before the s&p report which did n't really provide the markets with much new information note also that the actual bond market did n't move much after hearing the same report in fact the price of 10 year us treasury bonds actually rose a tiny bit take these simple statements about what makes the market go up or down on any given day with several of salt

it looks like it has to deal with an expiration of rights as a taxable event i found this link via google which states that   not only does the psec shareholder have a taxable event but he has    two taxable events the net effect of these two taxable events has    different consequences for different shareholders depending upon their    peculiar tax situations the correct statement of the tax treatment of unexercised rights    is in the on page 32 which reads in relevant part as follows if you receive a subscription right from psec and do not sell or    exercise that right before it expires you should generally expect to    have 1 taxable dividend income equal to the fair market value if    any of the subscription right on the date of its distribution by psec    to the extent of psec ’s current and accumulated earnings and profits    and 2 a capital loss upon the expiration of such right in an amount    equal to your adjusted tax basis if any in such right which should    generally equal the fair market value if any of the subscription    right on the date of its distribution by psec please note for quarterly estimated taxes purposes that the    dividend taxable events occur on the date of its distribution by psec    my emphasis while the capital loss occurs upon expiration of such    right my emphasis they do not occur on 31 december 2015 or some    other date however to my knowledge neither of the taxable events he mentions would be taxed by 4/15 if you are worried about it i would recommend seeing a tax professional otherwise i 'd wait to see the tax forms sent by your brokerage

the dynamics of land value tax are oppressive it 's up to the owner if they want to make the maximum money from land the tax is telling you what you must do with the land it also sets the authorities up as infallible banks get earning potential wrong all the time there is also the assumption that if you have land that you have wealth that 's not true many peoples land or house is their wealth money they can only access if they make themselves homeless or move to a cheaper neighbourhood and then we 're back to gentrification and cleansing the poor from high value areas

how long you need to keep tax records will depend on jurisdiction in general if you discard records in a period of time less than your tax authority recommends it may create audit problems down the road ie if you make a deduction supported by business expense receipts and you discard those receipts next year then you wo n't be able to defend the deduction if your tax authority audits you in 3 years generally how long you keep records would depend on a how much time your tax authority has to audit you and b how long after you file your return you are allowed to make your own amendments in your case us based the irs has straight forward documentation about how long it expects you to keep records period of limitations that apply to income tax returns keep records for 3 years if situations 4 5 and 6 below do not apply to you keep records for 3 years from the date you filed your original return or 2 years from the date you paid the tax whichever is later if you file a claim for credit or refund after you file your return keep records for 7 years if you file a claim for a loss from worthless securities or bad debt deduction keep records for 6 years if you do not report income that you should report and it is more than 25 of the gross income shown on your return keep records indefinitely if you do not file a return keep records indefinitely if you file a fraudulent return keep employment tax records for at least 4 years after the date that the tax becomes due or is paid whichever is later note that the above are the minimum periods to keep records for your own purposes you may want to keep them for longer periods than that for example you may be in a position to discover that you would like to a prior tax return because you forgot to claim a tax credit that was available to you if you would have been eligible to in that period but no longer have documentation you are out of luck

regarding interest on idle cash   brokerage firms must maintain a segregated account on the brokerage firm 's books to make sure that the client 's money and the firm 's money is not intermingled and clients funds are not used for operational purposes source    thus brokerage firms do not earn interest on cash that is held unused in client accounts regarding exchanges pay firm for liquidity i am not aware of any circumstances under which an exchange will pay a brokerage any such fee   in fact the opposite is the case   exchanges charge participants to transact business see how the nyse makes money similarly market makers do not pay a broker to transact business on their behalf   they charge the broker a commission just like the broker charges their client a commission   of course a large broker may also be acting as market maker or deal directly with the exchange in which case no such commission will be incurred by the broker   in any case the broker will pay a commission to the clearing house

a home is an investment but the value it returns is n't primarily financial $ $ they are consumption a place to live this gives it different characteristics than other investments e.g. increasing the amount invested by buying a more expensive home does n't do much to assist your financial well being and future income and is n't necessarily the responsible thing to do you may get some capital gains typically in line with inflation sometimes less sometimes more but those are n't the most reliable and it 's difficult to realize them it involves selling your house and moving its main value as a hedge is a hedge against rising rent but if you 're still working full time and can expect cost of living increases that hedge may not be as valuable to you as it would to say someone living on a fixed income but as for treating it as a low risk investment that 's very problematic real low risk investments are things like government bonds where you ca n't lose principal unless you 're going to live into your house until the day you die the real estate crash should have you of any notion that housing values never go down rather your house is a single illiquid investment imagine if you will going to your brokerage and borrowing a hundred thousand dollars or more on margin to invest in a single real estate investment trust then take away whatever diversification the trust offered by holding multiple properties also you ca n't sell any of it until you move away and the transaction fee will take something like 3 still sound safe moreover it 's exactly the wrong kind of risk your house 's value is tied to what people are willing to pay for housing where your house is which is usually subject to the whims of the local economy this means that in a recession and housing bust in the local economy you can lose your job and have your mortgage go underwater at the same time it totally makes sense to treat your house as an investment to some extent and it makes double sense for a financial adviser to consider it as part of your investment recommendations safety is not the way you should be thinking of it though

check the terms of your mortgage if you are in a fixed term mortgage you can likely over pay a fixed amount of the capital each year typically 10 eg if you owe £ 300,000 on the mortgage you can pay off an additional £ 30,000 this year next year you 'd owe something like £ so could pay off £ 26,000 you 'd need to check the terms of your mortgage to see what this limit is you can actually pay off more than this but would become liable to pay an early repayment fee or similar which is usually something like 3 5 of the mortgage amount note that this usually means you would need to re finance the mortgage anyway if you are not on a fixed term mortgage than in the uk at least you are pretty much free to over pay as much as you would like or refinance the mortgage if you are in a fixed term mortgage it is usually better to simply over pay by that maximum allowed amount until the fixed period ends at which point you can re finance onto a mortgage that allows higher overpayments this is n't always the case though depending on your interest rate how high the early repayment charge is and how much you are able to over pay at the very least you 're going to need to do some sums if you do choose to over pay up to the limit then you 'd want to over pay as much as you can at the start of the year ie do n't divide the over payment by 12 pay it all as early as you can to reduce interest payments then once you hit the limit put the rest into a savings account once you are out of the fixed term you can then pay the rest as a lump sum when refinancing

hindsight is 20/20 but i offer some suggestions for how this might have gone down if you had told the bank what was going on they might have extended the terms of your loan until the truck was ready alternatively you might have taken the loan was it secured on the truck and put the money in a savings account until the truck showed up while asking the dealer to pay the interest on it until the truck showed up or you might asked the dealer to supply you with a rental truck until yours showed up i 'm not saying i would have thought of these under the circumstances but worth trying

so with any debt be it a loan or a bond or anything else you have two parts the principal and the interest the interest payment is calculated by applying the interest to the principal most bonds are bullet bonds which means that the principle remains completely outstanding for the life of the bond and thus your interest payments are constant throughout the life of the bond usually paid semi annually typically part of the purpose of these is to be indefinitely refinanced so you never really pay the principal back though it is theoretically due at expiration   what you are thinking of when you say a loan from a bank is an amortizing loan with these you pay an increasing amount of the principal each period calculated such that your payments are all exactly the same including the final payment   bonds just like bank loans can be bullet partially amortizing you pay some of the principle but still have a smaller lump sum at the end and fully amortizing one really common bullet structure is 5 non call 3 which means you are n't allowed to pay the principle down for the first three years even if you want to this is to protect investors who spend time and resources investing in you

i think people in general tend to unnecessarily over complicate this issue   here 's what i think you should do in any situation like this first and foremost put all tax considerations aside and decide whether it makes sense to sell the stock now or hold on to it for the long term based on its merits as an investment   tax considerations have absolutely nothing to do with whether the stock is a good investment   if you consider all non tax factors and decide to hold on to it for the long term then you can use the tax considerations as a very minor input to how long you should hold it in other words do n't set your time horizon to 17.5 months if waiting another 2 weeks gives you better tax treatment you 're going to pay taxes on your gains no matter what   the only difference is whether you pay capital gains tax or income tax   granted the income tax rate is higher but would n't it suck if you pay a lot less tax only because you have a lot less value in your stock so to answer your question i would say absolutely not tax consequences do not make it worthwhile to hold on to your espp shares   if you decide to hold on to your espp for other reasons and they better be good ones to put that much free profit at risk only then should you look at the tax consequences to help fine tune your strategy

p e can use various estimates in its calculation as one could speculate about future p e and thus could determine a future valuation if one is prepared to say that the p e should be x for a company course it is worth noting that if a company is n't generating positive earnings this can be a less than useful tool e.g. amazon in the 1990s lost money every quarter and thus would have had a n a for a p e. peg would use p e and earnings growth as a way to see if a stock is overvalued based on projected growth if a company has a high p e but has a high earnings growth rate then that may prove to be worth it by using the growth rate one can get a better idea of the context to that figure another way to gain context on p e would be to look at industry averages that would often be found on yahoo finance and other sites

i am not sure how anyone is answering this unless they know what the loan was for   for instance if it is for a house you can put a lien on the house   if it is for the car in most states you can take over ownership of it    point being is that you need to go after the asset    if there is no asset you need to go after you friend   again we need more specifics to determine the best course of action which could range from you suing and wages from your friend to going to small claims court   part of this process is also getting a hold of the lending institution   by letting them know what is going on they may be able to help you they are good at tracking people down for free also the lender may be able to give you options   for example if it is for a car a bank may help you clear this out if you get the car back plus penalty   if a car is not in the red on the loan and it is in good condition the bank turns a profit on the default   if they can recover it for free they will be willing to work with you   i worked in repo when younger and on more than a few occasions we had the cosigner helping   it went down like this co signer gets pissed like you and calls bank bank works out a plan and tells cosigner to default cosigner defaults banks gives cosigner rights to repo vehicle cosigner helps or actually vehicle bank gets car back bank car bank asks cosigner for x amount sometimes nothing but not usually cosigner pays x bank does not hit credit bank releases loan and sells car   i am writing this like it is easy but it really requires that asset is still in good condition that cosigner can get to the asset and that the friend still is around and trusts cosigner   i have seen more than a few promise to deliver and come up short and couple conspiring with the friend    i basically think most of the advice you have gotten so far is crap and you have n't provided enough info to give perfect advice   seeking a lawyer is a joke   going after a fleeing party could eat up 40 50 billable hours   it is n't like you are suing a business or something   the lawyer could cost as much as repaying the loan and most lawyers will act like it is a snap of their fingers until they have you dry just really advice for the most part i would suggest talking to the bank and defaulting but again need 100 of the details    the other part is cosigning the loan   why the hell would you cosign a loan for a friend   most parents wo n't cosign a loan for their own kids   and if you are cosigning a loan you write up a simple contract and make the non payment penalties extremely costly for your friend   i have seen simple contracts that include 30 interests rates that were upheld by courts

the short answer is that it depends on the industry in other words margin alone even in comparison to peers will not be a sufficient index to track company success   i 'll mention apple quickly as a special case that has managed to charge a premium margin for a mass market product   few companies can achieve this as with all investment analysis you need to have a very clear understanding of the industry i.e. what is normal for debt equity gearing margin cash on hand as well as of the barriers to entry which competitors face a higher than normal margin may swiftly be undermined by competitors apple aside   any company offering perpetual above the odds returns may just be a ponzi scheme bernie etc   more important than high margins or high profits over some short term track is consistency of approach an ability to whether adverse cyclical events and deep investment in continuity i.e. the entire company does n't come to a grinding halt when a crucial staff member retires

there are many reasons for buying new versus used vehicles price is not the only factor   this is an individual decision although interesting to examine from a macro perspective each vehicle purchase is made by an individual weighing many factors that vary in importance by that individual based upon their specific needs and values i have purchased both new and used cars and i have weighted each of these factors as part of each decision and the relative weightings have varied based upon my individual situation read freakonomics to gain a better understanding of the reasons why you can not find a good used car the summary is the imbalance of knowledge between the buyer and seller and the lack of trust although much of economics assumes perfect market information margin profit comes from uncertainty or an imbalance of knowledge   buying a used car requires a certain amount of faith in people and you can not always trust the trading partner to be honest price the price or more precisely the value proposition of the vehicle is a large concern for many of us larger than we might prefer that it be selection a buyer has the largest selection of vehicles when they shop for a new vehicle finding the color features and upgrades that you want on your vehicle can be much harder even impossible for the used buyer and once you have found the exact vehicle you want now you have to determine whether the vehicle has problems and can be purchased at your price preference a buyer may simply prefer to have a vehicle that looks new smells new is clean and does not have all the that even a gently used vehicle would exhibit this may include issues of pride image and status where the buyer may have strong emotional or psychological needs to through ownership of a particular vehicle with particular features reviews new vehicles have mountains of information available to buyers who can read about safety and reliability ratings learn about problems from the trade press and even price shop and compare between brands and models contrasted with the minimal information available to used vehicle shoppers unbalanced knowledge the seller of a used car has much greater knowledge of the vehicle and thus much greater power in the negotiation process buying a used car is going to cost you more money than the value of the car unless the seller has poor knowledge of the market and since many used cars are sold by dealers who have often taken advantage of the less knowledgeable sellers in their transaction you are unlikely to purchase the vehicle at a good price fear risk many people want transportation and buying a used car comes with risk and that risk includes both the direct cost of repairs and the inconvenience of both the repair and the loss of work that problems knowing that the car has not been abused that there are no hidden or problems waiting to leave you stranded is valuable placing a price on the risk of a used car is hard especially for those who only want a reliable vehicle to drive placing an estimate on the risk cost of a used car is one area where the seller has a distinct advantage warranties new vehicles come with substantial warranties and this is another aspect of the fear risk point above a new vehicle does not have unknown risk associated with the purchase and also comes with peace of mind through a manufacturer warranty you can purchase a used car warranty but they are expensive and often come with different problems finance terms a buyer can purchase a new vehicle with lower financing rate than a used vehicle and you get nothing of value from the additional finance charges so the difference between a new and used car also includes higher finance costs own versus rent you are assuming that people actually want to own their cars and i would suggest that people want to own their car until it begins to present problems repair and maintenance issues and then they want a new vehicle to replace it but renting or leasing a vehicle is an even more expensive and less flexible means to obtain transportation expense allocation a vehicle is an expense as the owner of a vehicle you are willing to pay for that expense to fill your need for transportation paying for the product as you use the product makes sense and financing is one way to align the payment with the consumption of the product and to pay for the expense of the vehicle as you enjoy the benefit of the vehicle capital allocation a buyer may need a vehicle either to commute to work school doctor or for work or business but either lack the capital or be unwilling to commit the capital to the vehicle purchase vehicle financing is one area banks have been willing to lend so buying a new vehicle may free capital to use to pay down other debts credit cards loans the buyer may not have savings but be able to obtain financing to solve that need remember people need transportation and they are willing to pay to fill their need but they also have varying needs for all of the above factors and each of those factors may offer value to different individuals

to me the most important thing for young people to learn about personal finance is the connection between service and income   most rightly look for a way to earn money and advance the lifestyle of their home life   how does one do that   grinding it out in a 9 5 does not seem attractive while living the lifestyles of those on tv would be awesome    the temptation is to try all these tricks to get money but absent from their plan is how they serve their fellow man in order to receive that money stars like the are a marketing machine despite the life displayed on the tv   they have served many budding companies well by selling their products to certain demographics   most young people do not make that connection    so they try things like trading forex gold or whatever the latest thing is   it does not work as there is no service to their fellow man   they get a job at a fast food chain and complain about their pay in accordance with their work   well sure but again they are serving such few people that one can only expect a small income    the better and more people one can serve in general the higher a person 's income

that is again very shortsighted if you   if you can quantify an influence or give it good enough boundaries to account for the non quantifiable you can develop a much better system   capitalism is imperfect both because perfect capitalism can never exist and because capitalism fails to account for its forces most easily seen in the more feeling side of life but also evident in the very fact that we are having this disagreement   you bring up brownie points again which makes me think you only have two views   the way you were fed guessing republican and the way you were told everyone else was bad touchy special brownie points and participation   all of that means you have n’t actually thought for yourself   otherwise it would be obvious that all these views are incorrect   democrats republicans and libertarians all have it wrong because they are more interested in telling others how wrong they are than really looking at the problem   gods forbid they even slightly agree with the other side on anything   we have a real trust issue here between all sides   and a lot of that stems from this false idea that people are selfish of any form could not emerge from a purely selfish source   but i ’ll be damned if there is any way to prove anything is

i might be missing something but i always understood that leasing is about managing cash flow in a business you have a fixed monthly out going as opposed to an up front payment my accountant here in germany recommended pay cash take a loan often the manufactures offer good rates or lease in that order the leasing company has to raise the cash from somewhere and they do n't want to make a loss on the deal they will probably know better than i how to manage that and will therefore be calculating in the projected resale value at the end of the leasing period i ca n't see how an electric car would make any difference here these people are probably better informed about the resale value of any type of car than i am my feeling is to buy using a loan from the manufacturer the rates are often good and i have also got good deals on insurance as a part of that package here in germany the sales tax vat can be immediately claimed back in full when the loan deal is signed

one key piece missing from your theory is the bid ask spread if you buy a stock for $ 10 you usually ca n't immediately turn around and sell it for $ 10 you can only sell it for whatever someone is willing to pay for it   so virtually any random investment stocks bonds forex whatever immediately loses a small amount of value and over the long run you will almost certainly lose money if you buy sell at random

i 'm going to start with your title question how can home buying be considered a sound investment with all of that interest that needs to be paid if taken literally this is a loaded question because if you pay cash for a home you do n't pay any interest furthermore if your interest rate is 3 for 10 years you wo n't pay nearly as much interest as you will if your rate is 10 for 30 years so all of that interest is relative to your personal situation having said that of course i understand what you mean most people pay interest and interest is expensive so how do you calculate if it 's worth it that question has been asked and answered but for your particular situation you really have two separate questions i believe you should answer these questions independently if you move far away it 's probably the case that you can save a lot of money by either renting or buying in that location so you should first consider if it 's worth it to move and then if it is decide if it 's worth it to rent or buy if you decide not to move far away then decide if maybe you can save money by renting somewhere near your current home since it sounds like if you move you may have to become a landlord living close by to your tenant may also make it easier to deal with problems when they arise

you asked for simple and i promise you this is it just looks a bit math heavy to start with because we have to handle a couple of different scenarios bear with me i find the best way to deal with these kinds of questions is to put together a total cost for each option for a sensible amount of time and see what the difference is we 'll include the current cost for both options plus the subsequent costs for 12 months i find that more useful than a straight which is more expensive right now because it includes the potential costs of the next upgrade and any changes to the plan let 's throw some numbers together for the next 12 months if your current plan is longer than 12 months read the note at the bottom first first write down the cost of these things the above assume that you have two options if you take the repair option and only one option if you use the buy out option the two options we 're assuming here are that you can either   if you 'd choose the same new plan regardless of whether you take the $ 100 or $ 150 option there 's no need to include both options to simplify things you can just use the same numbers for both b c and pu and the calculation below will still work when you 've found and written down the above just do the sums below to find your two total costs over 12 months nothing fancy just plug the numbers above into the equation eg if pe ebay value of the phone is $ 80 replace pe with 80 do n't forget to do the parts in brackets first that 's your total cost for both options for the next year note i 'm assuming that your plan ends within the next 12 months if not just replace 12 in the above calculations with another term you can also do this if you want to find out the price difference over a longer period noting that if you upgrade to the same plan regardless of choice you 'll get the same answer for any period longer than your current contract

i 'll give the credit to in the comments section of the question   you put out $ 10k you got back $ 20k that 's a cash gain of $ 10k how the asset was valued between your purchase and sale is n't relevant from an accounting perspective the company is the only party that is realizing the loss as they have sold the asset for 40 k less than par you the buyer only get to see the initial buy and sale of such capital asset   example a company purchases a car for $ 20,000 and after depreciation it is worth book valued at $ 2,000 it is then sold to a customer for $ 3,000   does the customer realize a loss of $ 1,000 no   does the company realize a gain of $ 1,000 yes   your bank analogy is flawed in two ways

i will expand on bacon 's comment when you are married and you acquire any kind of property you automatically get a legal agreement   in most states that property is owned jointly and while there are exceptions that is the case most of the time    when you are unmarried there is no such assumption of joint acquisition   while words might be said differently between the two parties if there is nothing written down and signed then courts will almost always assume that only one party owns the property   now unmarried people go into business all the time but they do so by creating legally binding agreements that cover contingencies   if you two do proceed with this plan it is necessary to create those documents with the help of a lawyer   although expensive paying for this protection is a small price in relation to what will probably be one of the largest purchases in your lives however i do not recommend this   if clayton can and wants to buy a home he should   emma can rent from clayton   that rent could any amount the two agree on including zero   if the two do get married well then emma will end up owning any equity after that date   if they stay together until death it is likely that she or her heirs will own half of it anyway   also if this house is sold the equity pass into larger house they buy after marriage then that will be owned jointly if they do break up the break up is clean and neat   presumably she would have paid rent anyway so nothing is lost   many people run into trouble having to sell at a bad time in a relationship that coincides with a weak housing market   in that case both parties lose    so much like bacon 's advice i would not buy jointly   there is no upside and you avoid a lot of downside do n't play house by buying a home jointly when you are unmarried

this question drives at what value a shareholder actually provides to a corporation and by extent to the economy if you subscribe for new shares like in an initial public offering it is very straightforward to say i have provided capital to the corporation which it is using to advance its business if you buy shares that already exist like in a typical share purchase on a public exchange your money does n't go to the company instead it goes to someone who paid someone who paid someone who paid someone etc who originally contributed money to the corporation   in theory the value of a share price does not directly impact the operation of the company itself apart from what noted employee stock options are affected by share price impacting morale etc this is because in theory the true value of a company and thus the value of a share is the present value of all future cashflows dividends + final liquidation this means that in a technical sense a company 's share price should result from the company 's value the company 's true value does not result from the share price but what you are doing as a shareholder is impacting the liquidity available to other potential investors also as mentioned by in reference to the desirability for future financing the more people who invest their money in the stock market the more liquid those stocks become this is the true value you add to the economy by investing in stocks you add liquidity to the market decreasing the risk of capital investment generally the fewer people there are who are willing to invest in a particular company the harder it is for an investor to buy or sell shares at will if it is difficult to sell shares in a company the risk of holding shares in that company is higher because you ca n't cash out as easily this increased risk then does change the value of the shares because even though the corporation 's internal value is the same the projected cashflows of the shares themselves now has a question mark around the ability to sell when desired whether this actually has an impact on anything depends on how many people join you in your declaration of ethical investing like many other forms of social activism success relies on joint effort this goes beyond the direct and indirect impacts mentioned above if ethical investing becomes more pronounced it may begin to the   target companies fewer people wanting to work for blacklist corporations fewer people buying their products etc

your simplest option and probably the only reasonable one is to dispute the original charge with your bank   since you used a debit card and not a credit card you do n't have quite as much protection but you still can dispute the charge and ask your bank to step in and help   see this debit card dispute article for more information on disputing a charge for a debit card you may or may not have a case here depending on the specifics   if the merchant accepted your payment without letting you know you should have used paypal you may have a shot at getting the full refund but if it was clearly labelled that you should have used paypal it may be harder

it 's good to ask this question because this is one of the fundamental in market at any time t for each product on a typical exchange there are two well defined prices at time t there is literally no person in the market who wants to sell below the ask so all the people who are waiting to buy at the bid or below could very well be waiting there forever   there 's simply no guarantee that any seller will ever want to part with their product for a lesser price than they think it 's worth so if you want to buy the product at time t you have a tough choice to make you get in line at the bid price where there 's no guarantee that your request will ever be filled and you might never get your hands on the product you decide that owning the product right now is more valuable to you than ask bid quantity so you tell the exchange that you 're willing to buy at the ask price and the exchange matches you with whichever seller is first in line now if you 're in the market for the long term the above choice is completely immaterial to you   who cares if you pay $ 10.00 1000 shares or $ 10.01 1000 shares when you plan to sell 30 years from now at $ 200 or $ but if you 're a day trader or anyone else with a very short time horizon then this choice is extremely important if the price is about to go up several cents and you got in line at the bid and never got filled then you missed out on some profit if you cross the spread to buy at the ask and then the price does n't go up or worse goes down you 're screwed   in order to get out of the position you 'll have to cross the spread again and sell at at most the bid meaning you 've now paid the spread twice plus transaction fees and regulatory fees for nothing all of the above also applies in reverse for selling at the ask versus selling at the bid but most people like to learn in terms of buying rather than selling

in 2010 the restore online shoppers confidence act was passed which prohibited certain activities most of which had to do with online sites sharing your cc info with third parties   however the final part of the act deals with negative option marketing which is basically what you 're describing we will charge you unless you say no it requires three components to allow a negative option if you did not explicitly enroll in automatic payment and made the initial purchase online or made your most recent purchase online i suspect then it sounds like this was a violation of this act   on the other hand the act is n't terribly careful about defining terms and is really quite vague in a lot of places so it 's possible they would argue they are not using a negative option scheme but instead simply charging your bill similar to how your phone company might use autopay if it was not online then this probably does n't apply   instead the ftc 's rule on negative option with regard to sale of goods applies   title 16 part covers this this law is much less limiting as to what the marketer can do

i do n't think so in your case unless the account generates so much interest income that it became reportable i do n't know the exact limit but i think it 's in the hundreds if not thousands of dollars you might get a 1099 form if it generates over $ 10 of interest income but you do n't have to file taxes if your overall income is too low anyways the us does not typically tax assets only income there are some states florida is the only one i can think of that has odd tax treatment of intangible assets but i doubt that would apply in your case if this were a large enough amount usually over $ 10,000 it might trigger some reporting requirements possibly by your home country

your question implies that you are 70 1/2 and not employed by this company note if you remain employed the mandatory distribution is delayed the best thing to do is to open an ira and transfer the 401(k to it you then have all the investing choices you can ask for including low risk gov securities right up to high risk leveraged etfs do n't buy those just saying   make sure the transfer is direct so no tax withholding make sure you request it goes to a traditional ira not roth if you wish to transfer to roth over time that 's another discussion

in the same way that you are taxed on the actual amount of money you convert from the traditional ira to the roth ira rather than on the amount of money that you initially contributed to your 401(k or on the amount of money that you rolled over to your traditional ira that converted amount becomes the contributions to your roth so 3 is the correct answer it does n't matter how you accumulated the money in the first place as long as the irs has had the opportunity to dig their into it it counts as a contribution to your roth

the short answer is you are not required to   the longer answer depends on whether you are referring to your organization as a sole proprietorship in your state or for federal taxation   for federal tax purposes i would suggest filing each side job as a separate sch c though   the irs uses the information you provide about your sole proprietorship to determine whether or not your categorization of expenses makes sense for the type of business you are   this information is used by the irs to help them determine who to audit   so if you are a service based business but you are reporting cost of goods sold you are likely to be audited

i 'm not expert here but a method used by quite a few people i went to school with was to save as much as possible before starting and continue to save as you go better explained if you are able to save a years worth of tuition or in a better case save even more you can pay as you or in this case your child classes and continue to add money to that account if your child can hold down a part time job during school as many college students do they can even help by saving some money into that account and it can allow them to exit college free and clear of any loans or at least mostly clear should you fall a little short   it 's not the best option but given a short time frame it can work and i 've seen it work

that really depends on the lender and in the current climate this is extremely unlikely in the past it was possible to get a loan which is higher than the value of the house deposit considered usually on the basis that the buyer is going to improve the property extend renovate etc and this increase the value of the property responsible lenders required some evidence of the plans to do this but less responsible ones simply seem to have given the money here in the uk this was often based on the assumption that property value tends to rise relatively quickly anyway so a seemingly reasonable addition to the loan on top of the current value of the property will quickly be covered that meant that indeed some people have been able to get a loan which is higher than the cost of the purchase even without concrete plans to actively increase the value of the property today the situation is quite different lenders are a lot more careful and i ca n't see this happening all that aside had it been possible is it a good idea i find it difficult to come up with a blanket rule it really depends on many factors   on the one hand   mortgage interest rates tend to be significantly lower than shorter term interest rates and from that point of view it makes sense right however they are usually very long term often with limited ability to overpay which means the interest will be paid over a longer period of time

here 's an article on it that might help one of the tricky things is that you probably have the value of the vested shares and withheld taxes already on your w-2 this confuses everyone including the irs they sent me one of those audits by mail one year where the issue was they wanted to double count stock compensation that was on both 1099-b and w-2 a quick letter explaining this and they were happy the general idea is that when you first irrevocably own the stock it vests then that 's income because you 're receiving something of value so this goes on a w-2 and is taxed as income not capital gains conceptually you 've just spent however many dollars in income to buy stock so that 's your basis on the stock for tax paid if your employer withheld taxes it should be included in your w-2 in that case you would not separately list it elsewhere

the 3 and 9 figures are based on the cost of borrowing money and all the other ownership costs associated with real estate   from the same article because it 's usually still much cheaper to rent than to own the same    size and quality house in the same school district in rich    neighborhoods annual rents are typically only 3 of purchase price    while mortgage rates are 4 with fees so it costs more to borrow the    money as it does to borrow the house renters win and owners lose    worse total owner costs including taxes maintenance and insurance    come to about 8 of purchase price which is more than twice the cost    of renting and wipes out any income tax benefit imagine you are renting a house if the cost of your annual rent is lower than x then renting is obviously the best idea from a monetary calculation if rent is greater than y being a landlord makes more sense in the middle it is debatable and the non monetary reasons need to be considered

if you have been putting savings away for the longer term and have some extra funds which you would like to take some extra risk on then i say work yourself out a strategy plan get yourself educated and go for it if it is individual shares you are interested then work out if you prefer to use fundamental analysis technical analysis or some of both you can use fundamental analysis to help determine which shares to buy and then use technical analysis to help determine when to get into and out of a position you say you are prepared to lose $ 10,000 in order to try to get higher returns i do n't know what percentage this $ 10,000 is of the capital you intend to use in this kind of investments trading but lets assume it is 10 so your total starting capital would be $ 100,000 the idea now would be to learn about money management position sizing and risk management there are plenty of good books on these subjects if you set a maximum loss for each position you open of 1 of your capital i.e $ 1,000 then you would have to get 10 straight losses in a row to get to your 10 total loss you do this by setting stop losses on your positions i 'll use an example to explain say you are looking at a stock priced at $ 20 and you get a signal to buy it at that price you now need to determine a stop price which if the stock goes down to you can say well i may have been wrong on this occasion the stock price has gone against me so i need to get out now i put automatic stop loss conditional orders with my broker you may determine the stop price based on previous support levels using a percentage of your buy price or another indicator or method i tend to use the percentage of buy price lets say you use 10 so your stop price would be at $ 18 10 below your buy price of $ 20 so now you can work out your position size the number of shares to buy your maximum loss on the position is $ 2 per share or 10 of your position in this stock but it should also be only 1 of your total capital being 1 of $ 100,000 = $ 1,000 you simply divide $ 1,000 by $ 2 to get 500 shares to buy   you then do this with the rest of your positions with a $ 100,000 starting capital using a 1 maximum loss per position and a stop loss of 10 you will end up with a maximum of 10 positions if you use a larger maximum loss per position your position sizes would increase and you would have less positions to open i would not go higher than 2 maximum loss per position if you use a larger stop loss percentage then your position sizes would decrease and you would have more positions to open the larger the stop loss the longer you will potentially be in a position and the smaller the stop loss generally the less time you will be in a position also as your total capital increases so will your 1 of total capital just as it would decrease if your total capital decreases using this method you can aim for higher higher return investments and reduce and manage your risk to a desired level one other thing to consider do n't let tax determine when you sell an investment if you are keeping a stock just so you will pay less tax if kept for over 12 months then you are in real danger of increasing your risk considerably i would rather pay 50 tax on a 30 return than 25 tax on a 15 return

suppose that the etf is currently at a price of $ 100   suppose that the next day it moves up 10 to a price of $ 110 and the following day it moves down 5 to a price of $   over these two days the etf has had a net gain of 4.5 from its original price the inverse etf reverses the daily gains losses of the base etf   suppose for simplicity that the inverse etf also starts out at a price of $ 100   so on the first day it goes down 10 to $ 90 and on the second day it goes up 5 to $   thus over the two days the inverse etf has had a net loss of 5.5 the specific dollar amounts do not matter here   the result is that the etf winds up at = of its original price and the inverse etf is at = of its original price   a similar example is given here as suggested by your quote this is due to compounding   a gain of x% followed by a loss of y% compounded on the gain is not in general the same as a loss of x% followed by a gain of y% compounded on the loss   or more simply put if something loses 10 of its value and then gains 10 of its new value it will not return to its original value because the 10 it gained was 10 of its decreased value so it 's not enough to bring it all the way back up   likewise if it gains 10 and then loses 10 it will go slightly below its original value since it lost 10 of its newly increased value

it 's definitely a racket but safety is a pretty good reason to implement regulation and filters on who can be a driver some places have had illegal taxis operating for years which might be fine a lot of the time but can also lead to drivers robbing hurting people this is the thing that taxi drivers keep trying to remind us of while they try to keep their jobs it 's also why a lot of people would be scared to try in fact my previous manager went on a work trip to africa years ago was met at the airport by a taxi driver got driven into the middle of nowhere and robbed at gunpoint similar might have happened to me and my mum after landing in kuala lumpur years ago having a taxi driver offer us his services which we accepted only for him to run away before we got to his car because the airport police saw him and gave chase on sight   do n't forget when you get into a car you are at the mercy of the driver if taxis were just any dude who happens to be in a car then it could easily be a bad guy pretending to be a taxi driver to find victims but if taxis are uniquely marked and drivers have special licenses you at least get some assurance that their main motivation is to provide a taxi service   a key thing that uber changed is making it feel like the drivers and passengers are easily identified by being on the app while making a strong public case for their service making drivers and passengers seem legitimate but imagine getting into strangers cars a few years ago when it was n't common or even easier imagine getting into a strangers car that you did n't book through uber imagine standing at a bus stop and having some dude in a camry pull up and ask if you need a ride or seeing some guy on craigslist advertising himself as a private taxi who does n't want to use uber   if you 're asking why taxis are so expensive everywhere well that 's probably more to do with them being scummy protectionist businesses than anything else but until a few years ago the service that uber and airbnb provide was highly sketchy outside the proper channels

yes your basic math is correct if your tax bracket never changes then either type of retirement account will end up in the same place assuming that there are no income restrictions that will limit your ability to contribute to the type of account you want now your job is to guess what your tax bracket will be each and every year for the next 3 or 4 decades events that will influence your bracket getting married having children buying a house selling a house paying for college the cost of medical care moving to a state with a different state tax structure of course that assumes that you do n't get a big bonus one year or that congress changes the tax brackets that is why many people have both types of retirement accounts roth and non roth

i 'm being taxed at a 40 rate then i can give $ 500,000 to charity write it off and save $ 200,000 on my taxes that 's a net loss of $ 300,000 i may have paid less taxes but it cost me 300 grand your logic is correct however here 's another way to think about it suppose you are being taxed at a 40 rate you wish to purchase $ 500,000 worth of diamonds   how much do you have to make in income to do so   you need to make $ in income pay 40 of that $ in taxes and then spend the $ 500,000 on the diamonds   but to spend that $ 500,000 on a charitable donation you only need to make an income of $ 500,000 taxed at a rate of 0 because donations to charity count against your taxable income or yet another way to think about it is that if you make $ in income you can spend it on $ 500,000 worth of diamonds or $ worth of charitable contributions effectively you get to purchase $ worth of charitable contributions for free over the equivalent purchase that is not a charitable donation

i think this is really two questions dumbcoder has already answered part 1 in a comment either just wire the money from the japanese bank account to the uk bank account either bank should be able to help you with the details of this or if your bank also has a uk operation you may be able to do it within the same bank   as for part 2 if you are looking for a mortgage then many high street mortgage providers banks will want proof of your savings up front they may or may not accept japanese bank statements all you can do is ask the question you would probably also need to ask your japanese bank if they can provide statements in english   if you find that most or all of the high street banks will not accept this as proof of assets or that they demand that the money is in the uk for a period of time first then you might have more luck with a mortgage broker who can deal with the specialist requirement if you do find a mortgage provider who is happy to accept japanese bank statements as proof of assets then you would simply need to wire the money direct from your bank in japan to the uk bank of your solicitor at or shortly before the point when the deposit becomes due usually at exchange of contracts

the optimal way to pay off all cards in the least amount of time is a approach with the most money going to the account with the highest interest rate or in the event of a tie the lowest balance then when that account is paid off go to the next one there 's a bit of wiggle room if one is tax deductible but in this case there should n't be so what you should do is pay off card 2 then 1 then 3 using the scheme you have correctly identified that card 2 will be paid off in 18 months figure out what the balance will be on card 1 at that time and how long the new payment of $ will take to get it paid off then figure out how long it 'll take to pay off card 3 with $ without crunching the numbers myself i 'm guessing you 'll be debt free in about 26 months or so that card 3 will be paid off before you are done with card 1 so what you 'd do in that case is pay off card 1 using the combined total payment

big question   i am going to answer part of it but not as directly as you might like you mention 4 6 cents per unit per month but fail to give a unit price so it is hard to tell how much return you are really looking for given the amount you have to invest depending on your time horizon you will do much better outside of mutual funds   many funds in this category have fees in the 2 range   you actually have enough money to have a diversified portfolio on your own without recourse to funds if you want to use a fund like product i encourage you to look at well established etfs exchange traded funds   they are basically like mutual funds that trade on the open stock market   one good example in this category is ishares good luck

this is too lengthy for a comment the following quoted are from this money se post before electronic trading and hfts specifically trading was thin and    onerous no the nyse and amex were deep liquid and transparent for nearly 75 years prior to high frequency trading hft in 2000 or so the same is true for nasdaq but not for as many years as nasdaq is newer being an electronic market the point is that it existed and thrived prior to hft the nasdaq can be active and functional with or without high frequency trading   this is not historically true nor is it true now   without a bid or ask at any given time there could be no trade market makers also known as specialists were responsible for hitting the bid and taking the offer on whatever security they covered they had a responsibility assigned to them by the exchange yes it was lucrative there was risk and they were rewarded for bearing it there is a trade off though specialists provided greater stability on a systemic level although other market participants paid for that cost prior to hft traders who were not market makers were often bounded by boxed in by the toll paid to market makers market makers had different much higher capital and solvency requirements than other traders most specialists market makers had seats or shared a seat on the nyse or amex remember that market makers specialists are specific to stock markets whereas hft is not if this is true then we are in trouble hfts have supplanted the traditional market maker why because trading volume is lower now than it was in the 1990 's edit in the comments i noticed that op was asking about the difference between   i suggest reading this very accurate well written answer to a related question the spread goes to the market maker is the market maker the exchange that explains the difference between

what is never mention was that even though top marginal taxes were high even extreme nobody paid them reagan lowered taxes but also made lots of people pay taxes that had never had to pay them before you could essentially write off losses from a business indefinitely failing to earn money on an investment was also a loss my dad on the advice of an irs tax auditor built a greenhouse and we started selling flowers but it was intended to never make any money it 's sole purpose was to reduce tax liability   these tax shelters were geared as personal tax shelters so what was done to service bigger business was to create what was called holding corporations these corporations would take investors money and basically just sit on it which could then be claimed as a loss but if these spread between bank interest cds paid on the holdings of this corporation and the interest cost of borrowing against those holdings hit a sweet spot they would build a strip mall or something similar this was the trigger to the boom bust when the feds raised lowered the interest rates and had a lot to do with stagflation at the time they would turn key the project and reinvest in holdings people could essentially bring their taxes down as much as they wanted even to zero it just meant that they had to put more money into holding corporations   when reagan changed the tax code to disallow these tax write offs he put lots of very wealthy people in the poor house overnight they went to bed one night and woke up with all their investors wanting their money i know a guy that operated a holding corporation that still cries about it to this day of course he has never really financially recovered either      the point is that what the tax code listed as your top marginal tax had no bearing on what you paid in tax prior to reagan 34 tax was way more than most of these people ever dreamed of paying in taxes prior to reagan

when you sell a stock that you own you realize gains or losses short term gains realized within a year of buying and selling an asset are taxed at your maximum or marginal tax rate long term gains realized after a year are taxed at a lower preferential rate the first thing to consider is losses losses can be cancelled against gains reducing your tax liability losses can also be carried over to the next tax year and be redeemed against those gains when you own a bunch of the same type of stock bought at different times and prices you can choose which shares to sell this allows you to decide whether you realize short- or long term gains or losses this is known as lot matching or order matching you want to sell the shares that lost value before selling the ones that gained value booking losses reduces your taxes booking gains increases them if faced with a choice between booking short term and long term losses i 'd go with the former since net short term gains are taxed at a higher rate i 'd want to minimize the short term tax liability before moving on to long term tax liability if my remaining shares had gains i 'd sell the ones purchased earliest since long term gains are taxed at a lower rate and delaying the booking of gains converts short term gains into long term ones if there 's a formula for this i 'd say it 's   profit loss x tax bracket = tax paid

i 'm not sure you are paying attention to your own comments if you go back up to the first comment to which i reply that comment is you out scandinavia as an example of what is right   that aside when you say a lot of workers you are discounting the scale of migrant work in scandinavia vs just california let alone the whole usa the population of sweden is 9 million people there are over 11 million people living in the us as illegal immigrants let alone the other 37 million legal immigrants living here the us admits roughly 1 million immigrants per year and there are roughly 1.5 million immigrants total living in sweden   and before you use anywhere in the eu as an example for immigration you should take note of the escalating nationalism across every election everywhere in the eu your utopia is n't adjusting well to having a few around   and after all of that almost none of it is relevant to what i was actually talking about which was this fact through geographic happenstance and political coincidence the us has millions of people who literally risk their lives to come work in conditions you as and unacceptable they risk life and limb and family to sneak here to get this work by the millions we as americans do not have the will to totally shut them out and as a result there is a black market for cheap labor when you see these words i bet you think i am justifying something just as much as i think you think you are defending something when you say this is bad here this i am not making a moral judgement i am stating a fact and as long as there is a supply of millions of people willing to work for less than minimum wage there will be a black market for labor paying less than minimum wage   i 've actually erased several closing paragraphs because i am unclear as to the point you even contend to make right now based on your statement that you never singled out scandinavia and then proceeded to talk about scandinavia   i hope you can understand that history geography and politics all influence the situations counties experience uniquely and that wages are a market driven phenomenon these are not moral statements

you can have as many ira accounts as you want whether roth or traditional so you can have a roth ira with american funds and another roth ira with vanguard if you like one disadvantage of   having too many ira accounts with small balances in each is that most custodians   including vanguard charge an annual fee for maintaining ira accounts with small balances but waive the fee if the balance is large so it is best to keep your roth ira in just one or two funds with just one or two custodians until such time as investment returns plus additional contributions made over the years makes the balances large enough to diversify further remember also that you can not contribute the maximum to each ira the sum total of all your ira contributions does n't matter whether to roth or to traditional iras for any year must satisfy the limit for that year you can move money from one ira of yours to another ira of the same type of yours without any tax issues to worry about such movements called rollovers or transfers are   not contributions and do not count towards the annual contribution limit the easiest way to do move money from one ira account to another ira account is by a trustee to trustee transfer where the money goes directly from one custodian american funds in this case to the other custodian vanguard in this case the easiest way of accomplishing this is to call vanguard or go online on their website tell them that you are wanting to   establish a roth ira with them and that you want to fund it by transferring money held in a roth ira with american funds give vanguard the account   number of your existing american funds ira tell them how much   you want to transfer over $ 1000 or $ 20,000 or the entire balance as the case may be and tell vanguard to go get the money   in a few days time the money will appear in your new vanguard roth ira and the american funds roth ira will have a smaller balance possibly a zero balance or might even be closed if you told vanguard to collect the entire balance   do not approach american funds and tell them that you want to transfer money to a new roth ira with vanguard they will bitch and and drag their heels about doing so because   they are unhappy to lose your business and will probably screw up the transfer talk to vanguard only they are eager to get their hands on your ira money and will gladly take care of the whole thing for you at no charge to you do not cash in any stock shares or mutual fund shares or whatever is in your roth ira in preparation for cashing out of the old account there is a method where you take a rollover distribution from your american funds roth ira and then deposit the money into your new vanguard roth ira within 60 days but i recommend most strongly against using this because too many people manage to screw it up it is 60 days not two months the clock starts from the day american funds cuts your check not when you get the check and it is stopped when the money gets deposited into your new account not the day you mailed the check to vanguard or the day that vanguard received it   and so on in short do not try this at home   stick to a trustee to trustee transfer and avoid the hassles

but what about the following scenario which is my paraphrasing of a nanex article i 'm hoping you can help clarify this for me   1 i observe a 1,000 lot advertised for sell on a lit exchange   2 i try to lift the 1,000 by placing a limit order   3 my order goes through some kind of order routing process first 3 orders get executed on a dark pool let 's say i got a 50 lot filled so available offer reduces to 950   4 my order hits a lit exchange i get a partial fill for 100 offer shrinks to 850 but the offered size shrinks instead to 500 or 0   5 now in order to execute my trade i will have to take a higher price than the original advertised liquidity   my question maybe you can answer this is why did my original order size of 1,000 appear in smaller blocks is this because the order routing algorithm breaks up the size   or is it that market makers only post offers in small block sizes e.g. 100 so even if the order book looked like   100 10   100 10   100 10   100 10   100 10   100 10   all the way to 1,000 total as soon as the first 100 shares were lifted the mm can immediately cancel the remainder of the advertised liquidity in practical terms making it impossible to execute large orders at an advertised price

i 'm not looking to contradict a fact i 'm contradicting the view that the fact is bad it 's not investors need an incentive to keep investing in the short and long term   if for example pharma companies were to invest only in r&amp;d which is a high risk high reward long term prospect it 'd be exposed to only one kind of risk which is open to a single risk factor at which point the entire equity will be wiped off in one single sweep   at the end of the day all businesses have to create share holder value in the short and long term the only contemporary exceptions are startups like amazon and uber and we know from dotcom bust yahoo etc that this is hardly a strategy

one major concern with moving out on your own is can you afford rent each month be it an apartment or a house payment you 'll hear people say that anywhere from 25 to 40 of your monthly after tax income should go to housing 40 seems very high to me and quite risky i 'd go for closer to 30 of your monthly after tax income and not any higher but that 's just my opinion   i had a friend that moved out of his parents house about the same time that i did he bought himself a house and then he immediately started looking for roommates to help pay for his house it really was a good idea and i wish that i 'd been in a position to do the same because i 'm sure that it saved him a lot of money for the first couple of years apart from that my only advise would be to get a house if you can afford it 1 interest rates are very low right now and 2 if you 're paying rent to someone for an apartment or whatever then you 're just throwing your hard earned money away good luck

basically what @littleadv said but let me amplify what i think is the most important point as he she says one thing you 're paying them for is their expertise if the title on record at the county office had a legal flaw in it would you recognize it in a way your question is like asking why should i go to a doctor when i could just make my own medicine out of i grow in my garden and treat myself maybe you could but the doctor and the pharmacist have years of training on how to do this right you probably do n't is it possible for you to learn everything you need to do it right sure but do you want to spend the time to study all that for something that you will do buy a house maybe once every ten years will you remember it all next time or have to learn it all over but really most important is title companies offer insurance in case the title turns out to be flawed that to me is the big reason why i would use a title company even if i was paying cash and there was no bank involved to insist on it if there 's some legal flaw in the title and it turns out that someone else has a claim to my house and i lose in court i would be out about $ 100,000 your house might be costing you much more that 's a huge risk to take paying the couple of hundred dollars for insurance against that risk seems well worth it to me and by the way i do n't think the due diligence is easy it 's not just a matter of making sure a title is really on file at the court house and has the proper stamp on it it 's all about does someone else have a legal claim to this property like maybe three owners ago someone forged a signature on a deed so the sale is fraudulent and now the person who was defrauded or his heirs discover the issue and claim the property or maybe the previous owner failed to pay a contractor who did repairs on the house and now he goes to court and gets a lien on the property it 's unlikely that you have the expertise to recognize a forged document you almost surely have no way to recognize a forged signature of someone you never met on an otherwise valid looking document and you 'd have to do a lot of research to find every contractor who ever worked on the house and insure none of them have a claim etc

not sure i fully understand your question but my take on it is this there a lot of people out there that admire companies and own the stock just because they like the company for example i know some kids who own disney stock they only have a share or two but they keep it because they want to say i own a part of disney   realistically speaking if they hold or sell the stock it is so minuscule to have any affect on the overall value of the stock which does not really make the company look better from an investor perspective however if a company has people that just want to own the stock just like your uncle are indeed better because they must have provided a product or service that is valued intrinsically

selling as well as buying a stock are part science and part art form   i remember once selling a stock at its 52 week high too that particular stock in value over the next 52 weeks   mind you i made 50 roi on the stock but my point is that none of us have a crystal ball on whether a particular stock will ever stop or start going up or stop or start going down if someone had those answers they would n't be telling you they would be practicing them to make more money make up your mind what you want to make and stick by your decisions   bulls make money when stocks go up and bears make money when they go down but pigs do n't make money

i contend that there is great value in over paying during the year and reaping a bigger refund   i 'm an engineer and understand the concept interest earned blah blah but for most of us this is n't reality the reality is that we spend what we earn plus a little more   at the end of each month if the typical american has money left over we spend it we do n't faithfully put that money that we would have payed into taxes to good use such as savings or paying off that credit card   getting that big refund at the end of the year tends encourage us to make that one time large payment to that high interest account or to purchase that item that we otherwise would n't have saved for or purchased with a credit card   i say give uncle sam the free interest you 'll have wasted that money during the year anyway and enjoy a nice healthy refund that you can put to use for something you enjoy   life is just too short   edit for the nose that ca n't think beyond the possibility of a different perspective post

first off with startups forget that you know about common structures of debt and equity just try to think of this money as a generic investment that meets the investors risk and return objectives   startups are unique in that they are high risk but generally have almost no assets or security for an investor investors generically want two things 1 return and 2 limited risk    without speculating too much consider that the investor might be viewing the return component as the 30 equity and the 8 dividend and he views the risk management component as the additional 30 equity until repaid   a different way of looking at this might be that the investor would require an equity stake greater than 30 with greater than a 8 dividend if he did not get the initial investment back in return for the reduced stake   in other words this structure is debt and equity because that is what the investor can demand   maybe you can get around this by offering a higher equity stake or offering something else although this structure is common because it aligns interests of the investor and the startup

for safety if something catastrophic happens to your bank and your money is in there you will lose any not covered by fdic so if you have a very large amount of money you will store it in bonds as its much less likely that the us treasury will go bankrupt than your bank i also literally just posted this in another thread certain rules and regulations penalize companies or institutions for holding cash so they are shifting to bonds and bills fidelity for example is completely converting its $ 100 billion dollar cash fund to short term bills its estimated that over $ 2 trillion that is now in cash may be converted to bills and that will obviously put upward on the price of them the treasury is trying to issue more short term debt to balance out the demand read more here

the stock market 's principal justification is matching investors with investment opportunities   that 's only reasonably feasible with long term investments   high frequency traders are not interested in investments they are interested in buying cheap and selling expensive   holding reasonably robust shares for longer binds their capital which is one reason the faster paced business of dealing with options is popular instead   so their main manner of operation is off actually investments by letting the investors pay more than the recipients of the investments receive by now the majority of stock market business is indirect and tries guessing where the money goes rather than where the business goes for one thing this leads to the stock market 's evaluations being largely inflated over the actual underlying committed deals happening   and as the commitment to an investment becomes rare the market becomes more volatile and it 's money running in circles fast trading is about running in front of where the money goes anticipating the market   but if there is no actual market to anticipate only people running before the imagination of other people running before money the net payout to zero as the ratio of serious actual investments in tangible targets declines by and large high frequency trading to a ponzi scheme and you try being among the winners of such a scheme   but there are a whole lot of people competing here and essentially the net payoff is close to zero due to the large volumes in circulation as opposed to what ends up in actual tangible investments it 's a completely different game with different rules riding on the original idea of a stock market   so you have to figure out what your money should be doing according to your plans

debt consolidation is basically getting all your debt into one loan this is possibly more convenient and lets you close the other accounts in the case of credit cards preventing you from incurring any more debt ideally your consolidated debt will have a better interest rate so it saves you money as well if you 're defaulting on your debt already you 're likely combining this process with some negotiation with your existing creditors

the etf is likely better in this case the etf will generally generate less capital gains taxes along the way   in order to pay off investors who leave a mutual fund the manager will have to sell the fund 's assets   this creates a capital gain which must be distributed to shareholders at the end of the year   the mutual fund holder is essentially taxed on this turnover   the etf does not have to sell any stock when an investor sells his shares because the investor sells the shares himself on the open market   this will result in a capital gain for the specific person exiting his position but it does not create a taxable event for anyone else holding the etf shares

you are at the point that many millions of people are at and where i used to be you have no idea where your money is going you just spend spend spend until there 's nothing left and/or you borrow more to keep going   there are general rules of thumb on how much house and car you can afford but there is a great deal of personal variation housing and utility costs vary greatly from location to location city dwellers can use public transit instead of buying and maintaining a car how much other debt do you have that you need to pay off do you have expenses that are not common e.g. medical bills a more personal approach would be to figure out your own budget the first step is creating a written budget figure out how much you can spend in total i.e. your take home pay and the start allocating that money to expenses until you run out i started by looking backwards   look back at how much you spent on each category each month list them in order of priority e.g. food health housing utilities transportation entertainment everything else if the money runs out you either stop spending or reduce spending in another category e.g. can you cook a few extra meals at home instead of going out can you take lunch to work instead of a drive through the amount you have left over now indicates how much more house and car you can afford once you get to a point where you can budget comfortably then you can start looking at saving for retirement and other long term goals this worked for me and highlighted some areas where i overspent because i had good categorized records ironically because i used credit cards which i mostly stopped once i created a budget if you do n't have good records then you have to estimate   how much do you think you spend on food gas etc each month   then set aside that much and once it 's gone do n't spend anymore   now obviously you 're not going to stop eating but the idea is to plan ahead and realize i have only $ 20 left to spend on food this month maybe i should n't go to the movies it takes lots of practice and you wo n't get it right very often if you have enough left over you can set aside some as a cushion in case you do go over your budget but if you want true financial discipline you should start by reducing other categories first this is not easy by any means it will take of practice and trial and error to get to a point that you 're comfortable with the lifestyle that you can afford    so in the end there are only two variables in your equation income and outflow   do you want more house either spend less on other things or increase your income

in answer to your last formulation no in a perfectly efficient market different investors still have different risk tolerances or utility functions they 're maximizing expected utility not expected value   the portfolios that maximize expected utility for different risk preferences are different and thus generally have different expected values look up mean variance utility for a simple ish example   suppose you have log utility for money = and your choice is to invest all of your money in either the risk free bond or in the risky bond in the risky bond you have a positive probability of losing everything achieving utility = your expected utility after purchase of the risky bond is   +   since your expected utility is also negative infinity and you would never make this investment instead you would purchase the risk free bond   but another person might have linear utility = x and he would be indifferent between the risk free and risky bonds at the prices you mention above and might therefore purchase some in fact you probably would have bid up the price of the risk free bond so that the other investor strictly prefers the risky one so two different investors portfolios will have different expected returns in general because of their different risk preferences risk averse investors get lower expected value this should be very intuitive from portfolio theory in general stocks have higher expected returns but more variance risk tolerant people can accept more stocks and more variance risk averse people purchase less stocks and more bonds the more general question about risk premia requires an equilibrium price analysis which requires assumptions about the distribution of risk preferences among other things maybe john cochrane 's book would help with that i do n't know anything about financial economics i would think that in the setup above if you have positive quantities of these two investor types the risk free bond will become more expensive so that the risky one offers a higher expected return this is the general thing that happens in portfolio theory anyway i 'm not a financial economist or anything   here 's a standard introduction to expected utility theory

something that is missing from the discussion is the actual market for the lottery ticket if a market existed for the tickets themselves that would make this far more obvious but since there is n't one buying a single ticket gives different expected values but since the ticket has a defined game instance a single ticket is a gamble playing the lottery in the long run could be part of a high risk investment portfolio edited for clarity

well duh   notice that the complaining about the wage gap make statements that imply that it 's all women and all men and that the jobs are the same in all cases   really   got any examples of a female minimum wage being less than the state mandated minimum wage   no   did n't think so   so at the bottom end of the scale the people getting paid next to nothing are earning just as little as the other people getting paid next to nothing   and at the top of the scale   well the players do n't earn as much as the nba players   big surprise   but that 's the problem with group assessment   you take 100 pro making millions and add them to a hundred thousand people making basically crap and the whole scale slides

the most common use of non deductible traditional ira contributions these days as joetaxpayer mentioned is as an intermediate step in a backdoor roth ira contribution contribute to a traditional ira and then immediately convert it to a roth ira which if you had no previous pre tax money in traditional or other iras is a tax free process that achieves the same result as a regular roth ira contribution except that there are no income limits this is something you should consider since you are unable to directly contribute to a roth ira due to income limits also i want to note that your comparison is only true assuming you are holding tax efficient assets ones where you get taxed once at the end when you take it out if you are holding tax inefficient assets like an interest bearing cd or bond or a stock that regularly produces dividends in a taxable account you would be taxed many times on that earnings and that would be much worse than with the non deductible traditional ira where you would only be taxed once at the end when you take it out

when you buy a property the house or the building goes down in value every year it gets depreciated similar to when you drive a new car out of the lot however it is the land that increases in value over time as land becomes the value of land in that area will increase in value as does land in sought after areas if more people want to live in a particular suburb the land value will keep on increasing year after year sometimes established areas with houses built in the 1980s or even earlier can be worth much more than newly built areas it comes down to the supply and demand of land and houses in a particular area you might even get a situation where a run down dilapidated house in a very sought after suburb sells for more than a brand new house in a less sought after suburb nearby properties can be a very good investment and they can be a very poor investment it can largely depend on the decisions you make in buying your investment property the first thing you need to make a decision on is the location of the property if you buy a property in a good area that is well sought after you can make good capital and rental returns over the long run if you buy poorly in an area no one wants to live in then you might have problems renting it out or only be able to rent it out to bad tenants who cause damage and you may not get any capital gains over many years the second thing you need to decide on is when in the property cycle you buy the property if you buy at the right time you can get higher rents and make some quick capital gains over a relatively short time i can provide a personal example of this situation i had bought a house in australia in 2007 for $ 240,000 at a time when interests where at their highest 9 no one was buying property and rents were on the increase with low vacancy rates today eight years after we are getting $ 410 per week rent and the house next door in worse condition than ours has been put on the market asking for between $ 500,000 to $ most houses in the area had been selling during this year for over $ 500,000 so you can say that our house has more than doubled in 8 years however up to a few months ago houses were selling within 2 weeks of being listed the house next door however has been listed for over a month and has not had very much interest so from this you can conclude that in 2007 we had bought near the bottom of the market whilst now we are near the top of the market what you also need to remember is that different areas of a country can have different cycles so there is not just one property cycle but many property cycles in the same country

note i am the currency units   while i strongly suspect it 's us$ i do n't know from the chart   the system works the same no matter what the currency a call or a put is the right to sell put or buy call shares at a certain price on a certain day this is why you see a whole range of prices   not all possible stock values are represented the number of possibilities has to be kept reasonable   in this case the choices are even units for an expensive stock they may be spaced even farther apart than this the top of the chart says it 's for june   it 's actually the third friday in the month june 15th in this case   thus these are bets on how the stock will move in the next 10 days while the numbers are per share you can only trade options in lots of 100 the left side of the chart shows calls   suppose you sell a call at 19 the top of the chart   the last such trade would have gotten you a premium of per share the flip side of this is when the third friday rolls around it will most likely be exercised and they 'll be paying you only 19 a share for a stock now trading at something over 26   note the volume bid and ask columns though you're not going to get for such a call as there is no buyer   the most anybody is offering at present is a share now lets look farther down in the chart say a strike price of 30   the last trade was only .10 think it 's very unlikely that fb will rise above 30 to make this option worthwhile and thus you get very little for being willing to sell at that price   if fb stays at 26 the option will expire worthless and go away   if it 's up to 31 when the 15th rolls around they 'll exercise the option take your shares and pay you 30 for them   note that you already gave permission for the trade by selling the call you ca n't back out later if it becomes a bad deal going over to the other side of the chart with the puts here the transaction goes the other way come the 15th they have the option of selling you the shares for the strike price   lets look at the same values we did before   19   there 's no trading you ca n't do it 30   here you will collect 3.20 for selling the put   come the 15th they have the right to sell you the stock for 30 a share   if it 's still 26 they 're certainly going to do so but if it 's up to 31 it 's worthless and you pocket the 3.20 note that you will normally not be allowed to sell a call if you do n't own the shares in question   this is a safety measure as the risk in selling a call without the stock is infinite   if the stock somehow up to 10,000 when the 15th rolls around you would have to come up with the shares and the only way you could get them is buy them on the open market you would have to come up with a million dollars   if there simply are n't enough shares available to cover the calls the result is catastrophic whoever owns the shares simply gets to dictate terms to you   and in the days of old this sometimes happened

there is a measure of protection for investors it is not the level of protection provided by fdic or ncua but it does exist securities investor protection corporation what sipc protects sipc protects against the loss of cash and securities such as stocks    and bonds held by a customer at a financially troubled sipc member    brokerage firm the limit of sipc protection is $ 500,000 which    includes a $ 250,000 limit for cash most customers of failed brokerage    firms when assets are missing from customer accounts are protected    there is no requirement that a customer reside in or be a citizen of    the united states a non u.s. citizen with an account at a brokerage    firm that is a member of sipc is treated the same as a resident or    citizen of the united states with an account at a brokerage firm that    is a member of sipc sipc protection is limited sipc only protects the custody function of    the broker dealer which means that sipc works to restore to customers    their securities and cash that are in their accounts when the    brokerage firm liquidation begins sipc does not protect against the decline in value of your securities    sipc does not protect individuals who are sold worthless stocks and    other securities sipc does not protect claims against a broker for    bad investment advice or for recommending inappropriate investments it is important to recognize that sipc protection is not the same as    protection for your cash at a federal deposit insurance corporation    fdic insured banking institution because sipc does not protect the    value of any security investments in the stock market are subject to fluctuations in market    value sipc was not created to protect these risks that is why sipc    does not bail out investors when the value of their stocks bonds and    other investment falls for any reason instead in a liquidation sipc    replaces the missing stocks and other securities when it is possible    to do so

for insight on what will happen i suggest looking at the situation from the lender 's perspective if your setbacks are temporary and you are likely to get back on your feet again they will protect their investment by making accommodations and probably charging you extra fees along the way if your financial hardship seems they probably try to squeeze you for as much as possible and then eventually take your house protecting their investment as best they can if they are going to foreclose they may be reluctant to do it quickly as foreclosure is expensive takes man power and looks bad on their books   so it may get pushed off for a quarter or a fiscal year but if you are asking if they 'll help you out from the goodness of their heart well a bank has no heart and creditors are interested in roi   they 'll take the easiest path to profit or failing that the path to minimum financial losses    the personal consequences to you are not their concern once you realize this it may change your thinking about your own situation    if you think you have a path to financial recovery then you need to make that clear to them in writing with details   make a business case that working with you is in their own best interests if you can not make such a case recognize that they 'll likely squeeze you for as much as possible in penalties fees interest payments etc before eventually foreclosing on you anyway   do n't play that game if your home is a lost cause financially plan how to get out from it with the smallest losses possible   do n't pay more than you need to and do n't throw good money after bad

according to what little information is available currently this fund is most akin to an actively managed exchange traded fund rather than an investment trust an investment trust is an actively managed closed end fund that is tradeable on the stock market   closed end means that there are a fixed number of shares available for trading so if you wish to buy or sell shares in a closed end fund you need to find someone willing to sell or buy shares   actively managed means that the assets are selected by the fund managers in the belief that they will perform well   this is in contrast to a passively managed fund which simply tracks an underlying index    the closed end nature of investment trusts means that the share price is not well correlated to the value of the underlying assets   indeed almost all uk investment trusts trade at a significant discount to their net asset value   this reflects their historic poor performance and relatively weak liquidity   of course there are some exceptions to this examples of open end funds are unit trust us = mutual funds and etfs exchange traded funds   they are open end funds in the sense that the number of shares units available will change according to demand   most importantly the price of a share unit will be strongly correlated to the net asset value of the underlying portfolio   in general for an open end fund if the net asset value of the fund is x and there are y shares units outstanding then the price of a share unit will be x y.   historic data shows that passively managed funds index trackers always outperform actively managed funds in the long term   one of the big issues with actively managed funds is they have relatively high management fees   the peoples trust will be charging about 1 with a promise that this should come down over time   compare this to a fee of 0.05 on a large major market index tracking etf   further the 1 headline fee being touted by peoples trust is a somewhat misleading since they are paying their employees bonuses with shares in the fund   this will cause dilution of the net asset value per share and can be read as addition management fees by proxy   since competent fund managers will demand high incomes bonus shares could easily double the management fees depending on the size of the fund in summary history has shown that the promises of active fund managers rarely if ever come to fruition personally i would not consider this to be an attractive investment and would look more towards a passively managed major market index etf with low management fees

instead of giving part of their profits back as dividends management puts it back into the company so the company can grow and produce higher profits when these companies do well there is high demand for them as in the long term higher profits equates to a higher share price so if a company invests in itself to grow its profits higher and higher one of the main reasons investors will buy the shares is in the expectation of future capital gains in fact just because a company pays a dividend would you still buy it if the share price kept decreasing year after year lets put it this way company a makes record profits year after year continually keeps beating market expectations its share price keeps going up but it pays no dividend instead reinvests its profits to continually grow the business company b pays a dividend instead of reinvesting to grow the business it has been surprising the market on the downside for a few years now it has had some profit warnings lately and its share price has consistently been dropping for over a year which company would you be interested in buying out of the two i know i would be interested in buying company a and i would definitely stay away from company b. company a may or may not pay dividends in the future but if company b continues on this path it will soon run out of money to pay dividends most market gains are made through capital gains rather than dividends and most people invest in the hope the shares they buy go up in price over time dividends can be one to investors but they are not the only one

they are not required to fulfill the trade that they have intended to execute   they are able to cancel or modify the trade at any point   example this is how insiders are able to manipulate the price of shares through there buying and selling intentions   a ceo would be able to disclose a buy order for a month from now or whatever time period is required   this would most likely increase the price of the stock as investors would see this as a good sign of company performance   up until the point when the buy order is scheduled to execute the ceo can then cancel the order and create a new sell order   since the stock is high in price his new order is likely to make him money based on the manipulation from his trading intentions    i am not an expert on the subject and only know as much as i do through personal research here is an interesting article about this kind of insider trading and manipulation fine line between legal and illegal insider

the classic nigerian scam involves sending fraudulent cashier 's checks to recipients who then deposit them in their account   the bank reverses these deposits once they discover the check is not valid   at least in the us and in the parts of the eu i 'm familiar with the netherlands the method of the nigerian scam is consistent and banks will reverse the deposit after some holding period given this it 's unlikely that most banks will convert an arbitrary cashier 's check to cash without any means to recover the amount should the check be fraudulent

it 's likely impossible to determine why premiums are increasing in a meaningful way not only is the between the various data points very complex but some of the increases are likely due to decisions by people who do not and will not publicly post what they decided and why however it is possible to compare health insurance premium increases over time to see if the increases in employer sponsored health insurance premiums are comparable or not to the pre aca timeframe since the aca phased in over a few years we can compare the period 2008 2010 pre aca and 2013 2015 post aca ignoring 2011 2012 as being affected by the aca phase in   for this i will look at single coverage premiums only for the purpose of simplifying the analysis i found a good table of 2008 2010 premiums from the they list the following kaiser had a good list for 2013 2015 here from 2008 2010 the average growth was around 6 per year   from 2013 2015 the growth averaged about 3   in both of these cases we are comparing total premiums sum of employer and employee contributions so from a data driven look it seems that the premium growth is lower post aca than pre aca so it 's unlikely that the aca could be accused of causing increased premium growth   of course this is us wide average and on a state by state basis there may well be significant differences that may or may not be related to the aca one thing that is covered on the page linked above that is interesting while the premium growth has slowed significantly about 50 of the growth pre aca health insurance premiums are a higher proportion of employee 's wages and that growth is continuing because wage growth has not kept pace with inflation recession   employee contributions also may be higher post recession many companies reduced their contribution percentage as my then employer did for example    finally increases in the aca plans are also commonly overstated   they largely are in line with employer plans or even less    in 2015 premiums were basically flat decreasing slightly in fact see the analysis here   2016 saw a 3.6 by this methodology see the 2016 analysis    it 's very easy to examples that are favorable to any interpretation from the data though there are such big swings as a result of the different conditions in the marketplaces that it 's easy to pick a few that have high swings and claim the aca has massive premium increases or pick a few that have low swings and claim it 's reducing costs

similar to what adam f says above except instead of just transfering the amount you spend on the credit card into the high interest account why not keep the majority of your funds apart from a small amount say a couple of hundred for emergencies in the high interest account until the credit card needs to be paid off even better if you have a mortgage with an 100 offset account keep all your funds in this and pay off your credit card in full from it on or before the due date being a 100 offset to your mortgage interest rate you will be saving at a higher rate than a high interest rate savings account and you will be able to do all your normal banking from it unlike a high interest account which you usually have to link to an additional account to deposit and withdrawl money to and from if you are to use a credit card keep these simple rules in mind hope this has helped regards victor

the most relevant aspect of islamic banking that distinguishes it from non islamic banking is the prohibition of charging interest there is no prohibition on the utilization of technology    since banks that comply with sharia make direct investments sharing of profit loss and leasing many banks that are sharia compliant are very modern sophisticated and behave very much like private equity or even in some cases hedge funds there is a prohibition in sharia to avoid excessive risk so many modern islamic financial institutions deploy and trade financial derivatives to provide the means to risk management this is done on a very technological level with expertise   london has become a hub of islamic banking and there have been efforts by the financial sector to push to make london the center of islamic banking these institutions are as advanced as any non islamic banks    here is a source to check out   here is an article discussing the streamlining of banking through technology

you would appear to be a swing trader like myself i have been trading futures and futures options for 29 years and have both made and lost a lot of money in that time my trades last hours to days to at most a few weeks from my experience the most important skills are 1 money management keeping trade size small in relation to total capital i typically risk 2 3 of my capital on a trade so a loss is fairly immaterial 2 risk management limit your loss on every trade either by using stop orders options or a combination of these 2 3 emotional discipline be prepared to exit a position or reverse from long to short or short to long   on a moment 's notice the market does n't care where you entered or whether you make or lose money do n't let your or the news influence your decisions but follow the market 4 methodology discipline test your analysis trade entry method to ensure that it is objective and has a reasonably good probability of success then stick with it variation will inevitably lead to indecision or emotional reactions 5 flexibility consider trading anything which can make you a profit but ensure that there is a lot of liquidity i trade 30 different futures markets as well as various option writing strategies in these markets   feel free to reach out if you want to discuss further i have about 500 yes 500 trading e books as well on every trading subject you can think of

the long term view you are referring to would be over 30 to 40 years i.e. your working life yes in general you should be going for higher growth options when you are young as you approach retirement you may change to a more balanced or capital guaranteed option as the higher growth options will have a larger proportion of funds invested into higher growth assets like shares and property they will be affected by market movements in these asset classes so when there is a market crash like with the gfc in and share prices drop by 40 to 50 then this will have an effect on your superannuation returns for that year i would say that if your fund was invested mainly in the australian stock market over the last 7 years your returns would still be lower than what they were in due to the stock market falls in late 2007 and early 2008 this would mean that for the 7 year time frame your returns would be lower than a balanced or capital guaranteed fund where a majority of funds are invested in bonds and other fixed interest products however i would say that for the 5 and possibly the 10 year time frames the returns of the high growth options should have outperformed the balanced and capital guaranteed options see examples below first state super   amp super   both of these examples show that over a 5 year period or less the more aggressive or high growth options performed better than the more conservative options and over the 7 year period for first state super the high growth option performed similar to the more conservative option maybe you have been looking at funds with higher fees so in good times when the fund performs well the returns are reduced by excessive fees and when the fund performs badly in not so good time the performance is even worse as the fees are still excessive maybe look at industry type funds or retail funds that charge much smaller fees also if a fund has relatively low returns during a period when the market is booming maybe this is not a good fund to choose conversely it the fund does n't perform too badly when the market has just crashed may be it is worth further investigating you should always try to compare the performance to the market in general and other similar funds remember super should be looked at over a 30 to 40 year time frame and it is a good idea to get interested in how your fund is performing from an early age instead of worrying about it only a few years before retirement

yesterday there were a pair of shoes a deer and a bushel of apples in the world today of those three things there is only a pair of shoes and a deer   your legal expertise might be able to find some kind of recoverable asset to get the shoemaker back his money but even the supreme court can not rule the destroyed value back into existence the economy is poorer than it was before the fire no matter how we move the loddars the loddars are just markers for the underlying value of actual stuff goods and services that are actually useful    analogies are problematic because they are inaccurate but as a half measure explanation you could imagine that the loddars are poker chips   four people down to play a game of poker and each puts $ 20 cash into a kitty and takes out $ 20 worth of chips    a freak of wind comes along and blows one of the $ 20 bills out the window    now there is only $ 60 in the kitty even though we each have $ 20 in chips as a lawyer you might be able to identify some person who is liable for that $ 20 shortage but as an economist i see that this little economy is now $ 20 poorer and no matter how well anyone plays the total output of the poker play is going to produce less than $ 80 value    now go back and pretend that the poker chips are instead cash currency and the cash in the kitty is actual goods and services again analogies are problematic you can move the markers around however you want but but some part of the underlying value has been destroyed

to add on to the other answers in asking why funds have different price points one might be asking why stocks are n't normalized so a unit price of $ in one stock can be directly compared to the same price in another stock   while this might not make sense with aapl vs. goog it would be like comparing apples to oranges pun intended not to mention how would two different companies ever come to such an agreement it does seem like it would make more sense when tracking an index   and in fact less agreement between different funds would be required as some natural price points exist such as dividing by 100 like some s&p funds do however there are a couple of reasons why two different funds might price their shares of the same underlying index differently demand if there are a lot of people wanting the issue more shares might be issued at a lower price   or there might be a lot of demand centered on a certain price range pricing shares that are priced higher will find fewer buyers because it makes it harder to buy round lots 100 shares at $ 100/share is $ 10,000 while at $ 10/share it 's only $ 1000   while not everyone buys stock in lots it 's important if you do anything with standardized options on the stock because they are always acting on lots   in addition even if you do n't buy round lots a higher price makes it harder to buy in for a specific amount because each unit share has a greater chance to be further away from your target amount conversely shares that are priced too low will also find fewer buyers because some holders have minimum price requirements due to low price e.g. penny stocks to be more speculative and volatile so different funds tracking the same index might pick different price points to satisfy demand that is not being filled by other funds selling at a different price point

first is population density you did n't say where exactly but for example here in tampa wells fargo has 25 branches in the area   though that is a bit larger then what i would think of the tampa area as a local second we can mix in service expectation i expect that in addition to good online service great phone service great email service that when i have a problem do n't understand something or want to talk about my options for investing or choosing account types that i am able to go into a branch that i can walk in and see someone quickly or schedule an appointment and see some one right away at my appointment time   together these two options means that on a busy day the nearest wells fargo branch to me has at any one time 50 60 people in it smaller branches of course have less and larger branches exist so it just takes that many branches to address the number of people and their expected needs   as to why there are so many different brands banks well that 's just the usa we believe in capitalism we have believed in it much stronger in the past but banks are the central to capitalism so why should n't they serve as an example   at it 's core a very simplistic look capitalism and a free market means that we as customers are better served by having lots of different brands fighting for our business it should drive more consumer desired features   like lower prices higher interest rates better fee schedules etc while forcing those brands to operate better just ignore the bail out that 's a loaded topic so for some of us we want a big bank like wells fargo because we want the rates structure and service they can provide as a big bank for others they want the more personal touch of a small bank there are benefits both ways   for example there may be a bank that only allows people with excellent credit to open accounts that allows they to have lower over all mortgage rates but means their checking accounts have higher minimums while the next bank may be more inclusive and have smaller minimum balances but as a result charge more for loans   we like our options and rest assured all those brands offer products that have differences that attract customers

let 's start with income $ $ the 28/36 rule suggests you can pay up to $ for the mortgage payment and $ total debt load payment on the full $ 260 k is $ well within the numbers the 401(k loan for $ 12,500 will cost about $ i used 4 for 10 years the limit for the loan to buy a house but that will also take the mortgage number down a bit   the condo fee is low and the numbers leave my only concern with the down payment have you talked to the bank most loans charge pmi if more than 80 loan to value ltv an important point here the 28/36 rule allows for 8 or more to be other than house debt so in this case a $ student loan payment would n't have impacted the ability to borrow when looking for a mortgage you really want to be free of most debt but not to the point where you have no down payment   pmi can be expensive when viewed that it 's an expense to carry the top 15 or so of the mortgage try to avoid it the idea of a split mortgage 80 + 15 makes sense even if the 15 portion is at a higher rate let us know what the bank is offering   i like the idea of the roommate if $ 700 is reasonable it makes the numbers even better does the roommate have access to a lump sum of money $ 700 24 is $ 16,800 tell him you 'll discount the rent to $ 15000 if he gives you it in advance this is 10 which is a great return with rates so low to you it 's an extra 5 down by the way the ratio of mortgage to income is n't fixed of the 28 let 's knock off 4 for tax insurance so a $ 100 k earner will have $ for just the mortgage at 6 it will fund $ k at 5 $ 404 k at 4.5 $ so the range varies but is within your 3 5 your ratio is below the low end so again i 'd say the concern should be the payments but the downpayment being so low   by the way taxes if i recall correctly utah 's state income tax is 5 right so about $ 4000 for you since the standard deduction on federal taxes is $ 5800 this year you probably do n't itemize unless you donate over $ 2k yr in which case you do this means that your mortgage interest and property tax are nearly all deductible the combined interest and property tax will be about $ 17 k which in effect will come off the top of your income you 'll start as if you made $ 63 k or so can you live on that
