i 'm not sure about reimbursement you 'll have to talk to a tax adviser cpa ea licensed in your state from what i know if you pay your own insurance premiums they 're not deductible and i do n't think reimbursements change that but again not sure verify however since you 're a salaried employee even if your own you can have your employer cover you by a group plan even if the group consists of only you then you 'll pay your portion as part of the pre tax salary deduction and it will be deductible the employer 's portion is a legitimate business expense thus since both the employee and the employer portions are pre tax the whole cost of the insurance will be pre tax the catch is this this option has to be available to all of your employees so if you 're hiring an employee a year from now to help you that employee will be eligible to exactly the same options you have you can not only cover owner employees if you do n't plan on hiring employees any time soon this point is moot for you but it is something to keep in mind down the road as you 're building and growing your business

the answer seems to depend on where you live   perhaps you already found this but the summary from the irs is the insurance laws in some states do not allow a corporation to purchase group health insurance when the corporation only has one employee therefore if the shareholder was the sole corporate employee the shareholder had to purchase his health insurance in his own name the irs issued notice 2008 1 which ruled that under certain situations the shareholder would be allowed an above the line deduction even if the health insurance policy was purchased in the name of the shareholder notice 2008 1 provided four examples including three examples in which the shareholder purchased the health insurance and one in which the s corporation purchased the health insurance notice 2008 1 states that if the shareholder purchased the health insurance in his own name and paid for it with his own funds the shareholder would not be allowed an above the line deduction on the other hand if the shareholder purchased the health insurance in his own name but the s corporation either directly paid for the health insurance or reimbursed the shareholder for the health insurance and also included the premium payment in the shareholder ’s w-2 the shareholder would be allowed an above the line deduction the bottom line is that in order for a shareholder to claim an above the line deduction the health insurance premiums must ultimately be paid by the s corporation and must be reported as taxable compensation in the shareholder ’s w-2 i understand this to mean that you can only get the deduction in your case having purchased it in your own name if your state does not allow your s corp to purchase a group health plan because you only have one employee i do n't know specifically if illinois fits that description or not   in addition there are rules about reporting health insurance premiums for taxes for s corp share members that you should also check   personally i think that it 's complicated enough that advice from a cpa or other tax advisor specific to your situation would be worth the cost

additionally the original commenter i was responding to was making an argument that they do n't make money therefore they 're a failure which is n't a bad argument to make if you 're talking about   companies that make no revenue are generally considered to be failures so in that context he would be correct to say they 're a failure because they make no money and you would n't really need any other points to back up your argument   that being said plenty of businesses start ups especially burn through more money than they make the lack of profit does n't necessarily make them a failure provided they are still generating which tesla is and a lot of it   so if you 'd like to have a discussion about whether they 're making enough revenue or whether they 're poorly re investing the revenue they are making and how those factors might determine whether or not they should be considered a failure then i 'd be happy to participate   but if you 're only interested in making replies that try to to me because you 're too quick to jump to conclusions about what i 've written then have at it i guess whatever floats your boat

you can have a positive expected return on a lottery ticket purchase but only if the lottery requires all players to pick their own numbers and does n't have an option to buy a ticket with a randomly generated set of numbers this is because people are very bad at picking random numbers and will tend to pick numbers that are fairly evenly spaced or based on dates rather than genuinely random numbers for example in january 1995 the uk national lottery happened to have fairly well spaced numbers 7 17 23 32 38 42 and there were 133 winners with all six numbers so they way to win is to wait for a draw where a rollover jackpot is high enough that your expected winnings are positive if you are the only winner and pick a set of numbers that looks stupidly non random but is not so very non random that people will have picked it anyway like 1 2 3 4 5 6 for a pick 6 in the range from 1 49 lottery you might pick something like 3 42 43 44 48 49 but it does n't work if there 's a random option since a significant number of players will use it and get genuinely random numbers and so your chances of being the only winner get much smaller

the reality that the share price did not move shows that there is nothing nefarious going on   it is most likely some mutual fund their position to another fund    you can commonly see the play out at market openings if you have access to level ii data   you will see a big block sitting on both sides of the same bid ask   if you put in a higher bid or vice versa the two positions will move to match yours   and when the market opens their trade will be transacted before yours even though you are thinking well i put in my bid first   obviously they have agreed to swap and agreed to use whatever value the market decides

to follow up on quid 's comment the share classes themselves will define what level of dividends are expected note that the terms common shares and preferred shares are generally understood terms but are not as precise as you might believe   there are dozens hundreds of different characteristics that could be written into share classes in the company 's articles of incorporation as long as those characteristics are legal in corporate law in the company 's jurisdiction so in answering your question there 's a bit of an assumption that things are working as usual note that private companies often have odd quirks to their share classes things like weird small classes of shares that have most of the voting rights or shares with shotgun buyback clauses as long as they are legal clauses they can be used to help control how the business is run between various shareholders with competing interests things like parents anticipating future family infighting and trying to prevent familial struggle you are unlikely to see such weird quirks in public companies where the company will have additional regulatory requirements and where the public wo n't want any shock at unexpected share clauses in your case you suggested having a non cumulative preferred share with no voting rights but that does n't impact dividend payment there are two salient points left related to payout that the articles of incorporation will need to define for the share classes 1 what is the redemption value for the shares this is usually equal to the cost of subscribing for the shares in the first place it represents how much the business will need to pay the shareholder in the event of redemption recall 2 what is the stated dividend amount this is usually defined at a rate that 's at or a little above a reasonable interest rate at the time the shares are created but defined as $ share for example the shares could have $ 1 share dividend payment where the shares originally cost $ 50 each to subscribe this would reflect a rate of payment of about 2 typically by corporate law dividends must be paid to preferred shares to the extent required based on the characteristics of the share class some preferred shares may not have any required dividends at all before any dividends can be paid to common shares so if $ 10k in dividends is to be paid and total preferred shares require $ 15k of non cumulative dividends each year then $ 0 will be paid to the common shares the following year $ 15k of dividends will once again need to be paid to the preferred shares before any can be paid to the common shares

their algorithm may be different and proprietary but how i would to it is to assume that daily changes in the stock are distributed normally meaning the probability distribution is a bell curve the green area in your chart   i would then calculate the average and standard deviation volatility of historical returns to determine the center and width of the bell curve it to expected returns and implied based on option prices then use standard formulas for distributions to calculate the probability of the price exceeding the strike price so there are many assumptions involved and in the end it 's just a probability so there 's no way to know if it 's right or wrong either the stock will cross the strike or it wo n't

in essence the problem that the op identified is not that the fx market itself has poor liquidity but that retail fx brokerage sometimes have poor counterparty risk management the problem is the actual business model that many fx brokerages have most fx brokerages are themselves customers of much larger money center banks that are very well capitalized and provide ample liquidity by liquidity i mean   the ability to put on a position of relatively decent size long eurusd say at any particular time with a small price impact relative to where it is trading for spot fx intraday bid ask spreads are extremely small on the order of fractions of pips for majors eur usd gbp jpy chf even in extremely volatile situations it rarely becomes much larger than a few pips for positions of 1 to 10 million usd equivalent notional value in the institutional market given that retail traders rarely trade that large a position the fx spot market is essentially very liquid in that respect the problem is that there are retail brokerages whose business model is to encourage excessive trading in the hopes of capturing that spread but not guaranteeing that it has enough capital to always meet all client obligations what does get retail traders in trouble is that most are unaware that they are not actually trading on an exchange like with stocks every bid and ask they see on the screen the moment they execute a trade is done against that fx brokerage and not some other trader in a transparent central limit order book this has some deep implications one is the nifty attribute that you rarely pay commission to do fx trades unlike in stock trading why because they build that cost into the quotes they give you in markets buyers and sellers cancel out they just capture that spread which is the desired outcome when that business model functions well   there are two situations where the brokerage 's might lose money and capital becomes very important in extremely volatile markets every one of their clients may want to sell for some reason this forces the fx brokers to accumulate a large position in the opposite side that they have to offload they will trade in the institutional market with other brokerages to net out their positions so that they are as close to flat as possible in the process since bid ask spreads in the institutional market is tighter than within their own brokerage by design they should still make money while not taking much risk however if they are not fast enough or if they do not have enough capital the brokerage 's position might move against them too quickly which may cause them lose all their capital and go belly up the brokerage is net flat but there are huge offsetting positions amongst its clients in the example of the swiss franc revaluation in early 2015 a sudden pop of 10 20 would have effectively meant that money in client accounts that were on the wrong side of the trade could not cover those on the other side when this happens it is theoretically the brokerage 's job to close out these positions before it wipes out the value of the client accounts however it would have been impossible to do so since there were no prices in between the instantaneous pop in which the brokerage could have terminated their client 's losing positions and offload the risk in the institutional market since it 's extremely hard to ask for more money than exist in the client accounts those with strong capital positions simply ate the loss such as oanda those that fared worse went belly up the irony here is that the more leverage the brokerage gave to their clients the less money would have been available to cover losses in such an event using an example to illustrate say client a is long 1 contract at $ 100 and client b is short 1 contract at $ 100 the brokerage is thus net flat if the brokerage had given 10:1 leverage then there would be $ 10 in each client 's account now instantaneously market moves down $ 10 client a loses $ 10 and client b is up $ 10 brokerage simply closes client a 's position gives $ 10 to client b. the brokerage is still long against client b however so now it has to go into the institutional market to be short 1 contract at $ 90 the brokerage again is net flat and no money actually goes in or out of the firm had the brokerage given 50:1 leverage however client a only has $ 2 in the account this would cause the brokerage close client a 's position the brokerage is still long against client b but has only $ 2 and would have to eat the loss for $ 8 to honor client b 's position and if it could not do that then it technically became insolvent since it owes more money to its clients than it has in assets this is exactly the reason there have been regulations in the us to limit the amount of leverage fx brokerages are allowed to offer to clients to assure the brokerage has enough capital to pay what is owed to clients

advantage of cash you can spend the money without having to pay any fees or taxes to get it out disadvantage when inflation is greater than zero which it has been for many decades your cash is continually losing value advantages of an ira roth or classic your money will usually grow as the investments return a profit you get special tax benefits disadvantages there 's risk you may lose money there are tax penalties for withdrawing the money before retirement in general you should only put money in an ira if you expect to leave it there until you retire or at least for a long time whole life is a combination of a life insurance policy and an investment advantages combines insurance and investment into one convenient monthly payment disadvantages the investment portion typically has lower returns than you could get elsewhere if you have no need for life insurance if you 're not supporting anyone or you 're they could get along without you or you do n't like them and do n't care what happens to them when you 're gone or whatever then there 's no point buying life insurance whole or term you 're paying for a product that you do n't need it 's pretty common advice to tell people that instead of buying a whole life policy they should buy a term policy with the same coverage and then invest the difference in the premium for example if you were considering getting a $ 100,000 whole life policy that costs $ 50 per month just making up numbers of course it depends on your age health etc and you see you could get a $ 100,000 term life policy for $ 30 per month you will almost certainly do better in the long run to buy the $ 30 term policy and put the other $ 20 into investments the catch to this plan is that there are usually transaction costs to investing even a discount broker like ameritrade or scott trade charges around $ 10 per transaction so if you tried to invest $ 20 each month you 'd lose half of it to transaction fees which means that in practice you 'd have to save that money up until you had at least a few hundred and at that point many people find other things always seem to come up to spend the money on so that while they start out with every intention of investing this money they do n't

you should certainly look into investments if you do n't expect to need the money until retirement then i 'd put it in an ira so you get the tax advantages it makes sense to keep some money handy just in case but $ 23k is a very large amount of money for an emergency fund of course much depends on your life situation but i 'm hard pressed to think of an unexpected emergency that would come up that would require $ 23k if you 're seriously planning to go back to school then you might want to put the money in a non retirement fund investment as i write this september 2015 the stock market is falling so if you expect to need the money within the next few months putting it in the stock market may be a mistake but long term the stock market has always gone up so it will almost certainly recover sooner or later the question is just when investing versus paying off debts is a difficult decision what is the interest rate on the debt if it 's more than you 're likely to make on an investment then you should pay off the debt first my broker recently told me that over the last few decades the stock market has averaged 7 annual growth so i 'm using that as my working number if the interest rate is low some people still prefer to pay off the debt because the interest is certain while the return on an investment is uncertain and they 're unwilling to take the risk

here 's what i 'd do   show these figures to your bank and ask if they can offer you some type of account with a small overdraft say up to $ 2000   typically this wo n't pay the same kind of interest as your savings account but it does n't matter if such an account is available then yes dump most of your savings into the student loan and keep a few hundred in your new account   the overdraft on this account is your emergency fund   this means that in the more likely scenario no emergencies you 're saving yourself 6 interest on something like $ 4000 to $ 4500   in the case of an emergency you 're still covered but you 'll be paying a larger amount of interest   let 's say you have an emergency cost and need to dip into the overdraft for $ 1000   if the interest is 15 then you 've cost yourself an extra 9 on that $ 1000 over leaving that debt in the student loan   this seems to me like a really good gamble more likely to gain 6 of $ 4000 less likely to lose 9 of $ 1000 if your bank wo n't give you a low interest account with a small overdraft then use your credit card as your emergency fund   the same kind of logic applies but since credit card interest rates are typically higher than overdraft interest rates you 'll want to keep slightly more in your savings account   about $ 1200 to $ 1500 feels right to me and move the remaining $ 3500 to $ 3800 to your student loan    so yes pay off the student loan   that 6 interest really is worth having even if you 'd be taking a small gamble edit alexander has suggested that i should compare this to matched retirement plans   the 100 gain in a matched retirement plan is n't 100 per annum it 's 100 divided across the length of time you have to wait until you can get your hands on that money   suppose the money is accessible when you turn 60 a matched plan is a good deal if you 're in your 50 's but not so good if you 're in your 20 's   the 100 matching is equivalent to 6 interest per annum compounded over slightly under 12 years    so if you 're less than 12 years away from retiring go for the matched plan   otherwise pay off your student loan first

i can think of a few simple and quick techniques for timing the market over the long term and they can be used individually or in combination with each other there are also some additional techniques to give early warning of possible turns in the market the first is using a moving average ma as an indication of when to sell simply if the price closes below the ma it is time to sell obviously if the period you are looking at is long term you would probably use a weekly or even monthly chart and use a relatively large period ma such as a 50 week or 100 week moving average the longer the period the more the ma will lag behind the price but the less false signals and there will be as we are looking long term 5 years + i would use a weekly chart with a 100 week exponential ma the second technique is using a rate of change roc indicator which is a momentum indicator the idea for timing the markets in the long term is to buy when the indicator crosses above the zero line and sell when it crosses below the zero line for long term investing i would use a 13 week ema of the 52 week roc the ema out the roc indicator to reduce the chance of false signals the beauty of these two indicators is they can be used effectively together below are examples of using these two indicators in combination on the s&p500 and the australian s&p asx200 over the past 20 years   s&p500 1995 to 2015   asx200 1995 to 2015 if i was investing in an etf tracking one of these indexes i would use these two indicators together by using the ma as an early warning system and maybe tighten any stop losses i have so that if the market takes a sudden turn downward the majority of my profits would be protected i would then use the roc indicator to sell out completely out of the etf when it crosses below zero or to buy back in when the roc moves back above zero as you can see in both charts the two indicators would have kept you out of the market during the worst of the in 2000 and 2008 for the s&p500 and 2008 for the asx200 if there is a false signal that gets you out of the market you can quite easily get back in if the indicator goes back above zero using these indicators you would have gotten into the market 3 times and out of it twice for the s&p500 over a 20 year period for the asx200 you would have gone in 6 times and out 5 times also over a 20 year period for individual shares i would use the roc indicator over the main index the shares belong to to give an indication of when to be buying individual stocks and when to tighten stop losses and stay on the sidelines my philosophy is to buy rising stocks in a rising market and sell falling stocks in a falling market so if the roc indicator is above zero i would be looking to buy fundamentally healthy stocks that are up trending and place a 20 trailing stop loss on them if i get stopped out of one stock then i would look to replace it with another as long as the roc is still above zero if the roc indicator crosses below zero i would tighten my trailing stop losses to 5 and not buy any new stocks once i get stopped out some additional indicators i would use for individual stock would be trend lines and using the macd as a momentum indicator these two indicators can give you further early warning that the stock may be about to reverse from its current trend so you can tighten your stop loss even if the roc is still above zero here is an example chart to explain   3 year weekly chart basically if the price closes below the trend line it may be time to close out the position or at the very least tighten up your trailing stop loss to 5 if the price breaks below an established uptrend line it may well be the end of the uptrend the definition of an uptrend is higher highs and higher lows as gem has broken below the uptrend line and has maid a lower low all that is needed to confirm the uptrend is over is a lower high but months before the price broke below the uptrend line the macd momentum indicator was showing bearish divergence between it and the price in early september 2014 the price made a higher high but the macd made a lower high this is called a bearish divergence and is an early warning signal that the momentum in the uptrend is weakening and the trend could be reversing soon notice i said could and not would in this situation i would reduce my trailing stop to 10 and keep a eye on this stock over the coming months there are many other indicators that could be used as signals or as early warnings but i thought i would talk about some of my and ones i use on a daily and weekly basis if you were to employ any of these techniques into your investing or trading it may take a little while to learn about them properly and to implement them into your trading plan but once you have done that you would only need to spend 1 to 2 hours per week managing your portfolio if trading long term or about 1 hour per nigh after market close if trading more medium term

open an account with a us discount online broker or with a european broker with access to the us market   i think etrade allow non resident accounts for instance amongst others   the brokerage will be about $ 10 and there is no annual fee   so you 're ~1 down out of the gate but that 's not so much    brokers may have a minimum transaction value but very few exchanges care about the number of shares anymore and there is no per share fee as notes putting all your savings into a single company is not prudent but having a with fun money on apple is harmless paul is correct that dividend cheques may be a slight problem for non residents   apple do n't pay dividends so there 's no problem in this specific case   more generally your broker will give you a cash account into which the dividends can go you may have to deal with us tax which is more of an annoyance than a cost

the obvious answer for savings costs with a car is not to have a car    of course that must be balanced against other expenses bicycle taxi public transport to do things generally speaking if you need a car ways to contain expense are to buy the least expensive vehicle with the most economical engine that meets your needs keep it reduces damage or wear due to exposure proactively maintain it maintenance is cheaper in the long run than the costs of dealing with a breakdown and cost of repairs and lack of maintenance accelerates depreciation and shop around for a good mechanic who will maintain it at a fair price if you do a lot of milage or do a lot of towing or drive under load consider a diesel   a diesel engine often costs more each service sometimes has a shorter service interval but it also gets greater milage    there may be a differential cost of fuel diesel is often a bit more expensive per volume    for towing a diesel is often more economical due to low end power greater torque at lower which does result in better fuel economy    it is no accident that most large transport vehicles consume diesel    do the sums based on your usage before you buy accelerate as gently as possible to get to speed within traffic conditions less fuel to get to a speed    change up to higher gears as soon as possible as at a given speed economy will be better as long as the engine has enough to handle it so do n't try to start from stationary in a high gear    do n't drive faster than necessary as drag increases with speed and hurts economy    similarly reduce speed gradually to reduce undue wear on breaks and reduce fuel consumption sharp breaking with power assisted breaks does affect fuel economy drive close to legal limits if conditions permit    this reduces chances of annoying other drivers who if they get impatient may throw rocks at your car or or subject you to road rage which contribute to damage and insurance costs    it also reduces chances of being pulled over by police and fined for obstructing other traffic do n't    this both consumes fuel in keeping up and means needing to slow sharply    and increases chance of accident do n't idle more than necessary   allow stop start systems on your car to operate particularly if you 're in stop start traffic    however there is a break even point where stopping and consumes more fuel than so get to know your vehicle    that depends on how much the engine needs to restart which is affected both by engine design and maintenance    maintain it yourself if you have the skills but account for the cost of parts and equipment to be sure it is cost effective   modern cars are software driven so equipment to diagnose and maintain can be expensive combine trips do n't get into the car for every little thing wait until you can do a few things during a single drive and car pool if fuel prices vary e.g some places have regular cycles try to refuel near the bottom of a pricing cycle take unnecessary weight out of the vehicle    do n't load it up with tools unless you need them frequently

swimming clubs exist    treat it as a start up business and it 's easier to figure out    once you know about what people are willing to pay to join you know about how much you can spend    our family business invites tenants to use a private pool located at one of our properties we maintain the facility and have appropriate signs posted and a balloon insurance policy specifically for the pool in 1975 the pool cost 25,000 to install and we spend about $ to operate and heat it each season    the downside is that there is likely a lot less support for the idea than you think you 're going to have to limit access to it with a membership and that 's going to be a pain to figure out because it will almost certainly require an employee or a very expensive electronic access control   you ca n't really open it up to the entire community without some sort of contract or no one has an incentive to pay every time a home sells in the community you either lose a customer or gain a headache if you do n't have some sort of deed restriction or membership fee

i think we are roughly in agreement but i should stress   gt ca n't blame capitalism for shitty politicians   shitty politicians are a natural result of capitalism out of control the big owners call the shots the politicians that take the bribes win elections bc the money buys exposure thru once again private media    the politicians with any amount of ethics or servitude to their electorate will be starved of funds they tend to lose the evolution of the honorable politician to the corrupt one has been a consequence of obscene money the sort of money that apple et al make or the most insidious the federal reserve which is privately owned by a cabal of the richest bankers they get to print money to lend to the government at interest whenever the gov needs to issue bonds they determine interest rates their objective is to make more money for themselves they are not there to provide a service to the people    tl;dr you can not get non shitty politicians without controlling capitalism adam smith warned us 250 years ago in his seminal wealth of nations that a business dominated political system would allow a conspiracy of businesses and industry against consumers   the interest of manufacturers and merchants in any particular branch of trade or manufactures is always in some respects different from and even opposite to that of the public the proposal of any new law or regulation of commerce which comes from this order ought always to be listened to with great precaution and ought never be adopted till after having been long and carefully examined not only with the most but with the most suspicious attention

since you seem determined to consider this i 'd like to break down for you why i believe it is an incredibly risky proposition 1 in general picking individual stocks is risky individual stocks are by their nature not diversified assets and a single company wide calamity a la volkswagen emissions etc can create huge distress to your investments the way to mitigate this risk is of course to diversify invest in other types of assets such as other stocks index funds bonds etc however you must accept that this first step does have risks   2 picking stocks on the basis of financial information called fundamental analysis requires a very large amount of research and time dedication it is one of the two main schools of thought in equity investing as opposed to technical analysis which pulls information directly from stock markets such as price volatility this is something that professional investors do for a living and that means that they have an edge you do not have unless you dedicate similar resources to this task that information imbalance between you and professional traders creates additional risk where you make against the grain   3 any specific piece of public information and this is public information regardless of how esoteric it is may be considered to be already factored into public stock prices i am a believer in market efficiency first and foremost that means i believe that anything publically known related to a corporation opec just lowered their oil production exxon will be able to increase their prices has already been considered by the professional traders currently buying and selling in the market for your new information to be valuable it would need to have the ability to forecast earnings in a way not already considered by others 4 i doubt you will be able to find the true nature of the commercial impact of a particular event simply by knowing ship locations so what if you know is shipping aluminium to cuba is this one of 5 shipments already known to the public is this replacement supplies that are covering a loss due to damaged goods previously sent is the boat only 1/3 full where this information gets valuable is when it gets to the level of corporate espionage yes if you had ship manifests showing tons of aluminum being sold and if this was a massive secret shipment about to be announced at the next shareholders meeting you could illegally profit from that information 5 the more massive the company the less important any single transaction is that means the super you may see transporting raw commodities could have dozens of such ships out at any given time not to mention news of new mine openings and closures price changes volume reports etc etc so the most valuable information would be smaller companies where a single shipment might cover a month of revenue but such a small company is a less likely to be public meaning you could n't buy shares in the company and profit off of the information and b less likely to be found by you in the giant sea of ship information in summary while you may have found some information that provides insight into a company 's operations you have not shown that this information is significant and also unknown to the market not to mention the risks associated with picking individual stocks in the first place in this case it is my opinion that you are taking on additional risk not adequately compensated by additional reward

it 's a problem from hell because all solutions have drawbacks unintended consequences and because they are all pretty complex to implement in practice   breaking up the big banks so that no bank is enough to bring down the economy with it is the strongest move but is riddled with problems when you start looking at it practically how do you determine the maximum size a bank should have should it be based on assets systemic importance i.e. interconnectedness with other banks how do you enforce it banks will find ways to offload assets etc into special purpose corporations to get around the laws somehow how do you compensate for the fact that size does help financial efficiency in some ways   imposing higher capital requirements is the next solution but that too is not so easy to implement with full success in practice what should be classified as a low risk asset how much capital do you require against a cdo vs a mexican government bond how often do you need to revise these standards at what point does the cost of higher capital requirements start to strangle lending and financial flows   the weaker maneuvers are things like constant government imposed stress tests orderly resolution mechanisms higher standards for internal risk management practices etc but those may not be adequate and also have their implementation problems

you seem to have a little confusion over terminology that should be cleared up you are calling this day trading day trading is the term for performing multiple trading actions in a single day while it appears that the coo has performed a buy and a sell on the same day most people would consider this a single trade in reality it seems that the coo had stock options a contract providing the option for the holder to buy stock at a specific price at some point in the future provided as part of his compensation package he decided or was required to exercise those options today this means he bought the shares using his special option price it is extremely common for employees who exercise stock options to sell all of the resulting stock immediately this is very different from usual day trading which implies that he would have bought stock in the morning at a low price and then sold it later at a high price you are calling this insider trading that term specifically often implies some level of unethical behavior in general stock options offered to executive employees are strictly limited in how they can be exercised for example most stock option plans require employees to wait x number of years before they can exercise them this gives the employee incentive to stay longer and for a high level executive with the ability to strongly impact company performance it gives incentive to do well technically you are correct this is likely considered an insider trade but given that it seems to have been a stock option exercise it does not necessarily imply that there was any special reasoning for why he did the trade today it could simply be that today was the first day the stock option rules allowed him to exercise as to your final question no these profits are the coo 's to do with as he likes

here i thought i would not ever answer a question on this site and boom first ten minutes   first and foremost i am in the automotive industry specifically one of our core is finance department management consulting and the sales process both for the sale of the care as well   as   the financial transaction first and foremost new vehicle gross profits are nowhere near 20 for the dealership   in an entry level vehicle like say a toyota corolla there is only a   few hundreds of dollars in markup from invoice to   there is also something called that dealers get for achieving certain goals such as sales volume these are usually pretty easy to hit as a matter of fact i have never heard of a dealer not getting the hold back on a deal   this hold back is there to cover overhead for the car the cost of getting it ready to sell having a lot to park it on making it ready for delivery offset some of the cost of sales labor   etc   most dealerships consider the portion of the invoice to not be part of the deal when it comes to   negotiations   certain brands such as kia and chrysler have something called dealer cash these payouts are usually stepped according to volume and vary by dealer location past history how the guys at the factory feel that day and any number of combinations   then there is csi or customer service index payments these payments are usually made every 1/4 are on the parts statement not the sales doc and while they effect the dealers bottom line they almost never affect the sales managers or sales persons payroll so they are not considered a part of the cost of the car   they are however extremely important to   the dealer and this is   why after you have your new car they want you to bring in your survey for a free oil change or something   if you are going to give a bad survey they want to throw it away and not send it in if you are going to give a good survey they want to   make sure you fill it out correctly   this is because lets say they ask you on a scale of 1 10 how was your sales person and you put a 9 that is a failing score dumb i know but that is how every factory csi score system i have seen worked   according to nada the average new vehicle gross profit including hold back and dealer cash is around $   no where near 20   dealerships would love it if they made 20 on your new diesel at around $   one last thing there is something on the invoice called wholesale finance reserve   this is the amount of money the factory forwards to the dealership to offset the cost of financing vehicle on the floor plan so they can have it for you to look at before you buy   this is usually equal to around 3 months of interest and while you might buy a vehicle that has been on the lot for 2 days they have plenty that have been there much longer so this equals out in a fair to run store general that know what they are doing can make this really pad their net profit to statement on to incentives there are basically 3 kinds   cash to customer in the form of rebates dealer cash in the form of incentives to dealerships based on volume or the of a vehicle and incentive rates or leases   the rates are pretty self explanatory as they advertised as such example 0 for 60 months   leased are harder to figure out and usually not disclosed as they are hard to explain and also a source of increased profit   leases are usually powered by lower cost of money called a money factor think of it as an interest rate that is discounted from the lease company or a subsidized residual   subsidized are virtually on domestic vehicles due to their poor resell values   a subsidized residual works like this you buy a toyota camry and the automotive lease guide says it has a residual at 36 months of 48   well toyota motor credit says we will give you a residual of 60 basically subsidizing a 2 increase in residual   since they do not expect to be able to sell the car at auction for that amount they have to set aside the 2 as a future expense   what does this mean to you it means a lower payment   also a good rule of thumb if you are told a money factor by your salesperson to figure out what the interest rate is just multiply it by 2400   so if a money factor is give of you know your actual interest rate is a little bit lower than illustration purposes only money factors are much lower than that right now so how does this save you money well a lease is basically calculated by multiplying the msrp by the residual and then subtracting that amount from the capitalized cost which is the price paid for the car trade in + payoff + rebate down payment   that is the depreciation   then you divide that number by the term of the loan and you have the depreciation amount   so if you have 20 k cc and 10 k r your d = 10 k 36 = monthly payment   for the rest of the monthly payment you add i think been a long time since i did this with out a computer the residual plus the cc for $ 30,000 mf of = 107 for a total payment of 404 ish   this is not completely accurate but you can use it to   make sure a salesperson finance person is not trying to do one thing and   say another as so often happens on leases 0 how the   heck do   they make money at that well its simple   first in 2008 the fed made all the captive lenders into actual banks instead of whatever they were before   so now they have access to the fed 's discounting window which with todays monetary policies make it almost free money   in the past these lenders had to go through all kinds of hoops to raise funds and   securitize loans even for super prime credit   those days are essentially over   now they get their short term money just like bank of america does   eventually they still bundle these loans and sell them   so in the short term you pay for the 0 by giving up part or all of your rebate   this is really important do not give up your rebate for 0 unless it makes sense to do so   when you can get the money at 2.5 and get a $ rebate customer cash on that or 0 take the cash   first of all make the finance guy gal show you the the difference in total cost they can do do this using the federal truth in lending disclosures on a finance contract   secondly how long will you keep the vehicle   if you come out ahead by say $ 1500 by taking the lower rate but you usually trade out every three years this is not going to work   also and this is important if you are involved in a situation with a total loss like a stolen car or even worse a bad wreck before the breakeven point you lose that price break   finally on judging what is right for you just know that future value of the vehicle on for resell or trade in will take into effect all of these past rebates and value the car accordingly   so if a vehicle depreciates 20 a year for the first 3 years the starting point will essentially be $ less than you actually paid   using rough numbers how does this help the dealers and car companies   well while a dealer struggles to make money on new cars the factory makes all of their money on the   new cars and the new car financing   while your individual loan might lose money that money is offset by the loss of rebate and i think ford does actually pay ford motor credit company the difference in the rate   the most important thing is what happens later now has 2500 loans with people with perfect credit   they can now use those loans to with people with not so perfect credit that they financed at and buy that money with interest rates in the range   well that is a hell of a lot of profit   how does it help the dealership well the more super prime credit they have in their portfolio the more subprime credit the banks will buy for them   this means they have more loans originated that are more profitable for them   say you come in for the 0 but have 590 credit score they get to buy the deal because they have a good portfolio and you win because the dealer gets to buy the money at say 9 and sell it to you at say 12 making the spread   you win there because you actually qualified for a rate of around 18 with a subprime company like santander or capital one yes that capital one so   you save a ton on your overall cost of the car any dealership that is half way well run makes as much or money in the finance and insurance office than the rest of the dealership   when you factor in what a good director can do to get deals done with favorable terms that really goes up   think about that the guys sitting a desk drinking coffee making more than the   service department guys all put together well that was long winded but there i broke down the car business for whoever read this far

here 's an example that i 'm trying to figure out   etf firm has an agreement with gs for blocks of ibm they have agreed on daily vwap + 1 for execution price   further there is a commission schedule for 5 mils with gs   come month end etf firm has to do a monthly rebalance as such must buy 100,000 shares at ibm which goes for about $ 100   the commission for the trade is 100,000 5 mils = $ 500 in commission for that trade i assume all of this is covered in the expense ratio such that if vwap for the day was 100 then each share got executed to the etf at 101 1 + 5 mils per share = for a resultant cost basis   the etf then turns around and takes out let 's say 1 as the expense ratio $ per share   i think everything so far is pretty straight forward let me know if i missed something to this point   now this is what i 'm trying to get my head around etf firm has a revenue sharing agreement as well as other relations with gs one of which is 50 back on commissions as soft dollars on top of that gs has a program where if you do a set amount of vwap + trades you are eligible for their corporate well being programs and other sponsorship of etf 's interests including helping to pay for marketing rent computers etc    does that happen do these disclosures exist somewhere

i think your approach of looking exclusively at usd deposits is a prudent one here are my responses to your questions 1 it is highly unlikely that a usd deposit abroad be converted to local currency upon withdrawal the reason for offering a deposit in a particular currency in the first place is that the bank wants to attract funds in this currency 2 interest rate is a function of various risks mostly supply and demand central bank policy perceived risk etc in recent years low interest rate policy as led by u.s. european and japanese central banks has led particularly low yields in certain countries disregarding their level of risk which can vary substantially thus e.g. eastern europe has very low yields at the moment in spite of its perceived higher risk some countries offer depository insurance   3 i would focus on banks which are among the largest in the country and boast good corporate governance i.e. their ownership is clean and transparent and they are true to their business purpose thus ownership is key then come financials country depository insurance low external threat low war risk is also important most banks require a personal visit in order to open the account thus i would n't split much further than 2 3 banks assuming these are good quality

in the current system it would be irresponsible to pay more than they have to but if corporations get to be amoral people they need tighter regulation because what 's good for maximizing profits is rarely good for people if you want to argue that businesses are more important than people then perhaps profits should receive favorable treatment to people but i highly doubt lincoln was talking about walmart when he was talking about a government by the people and for the people there 's plenty of businesses out there charging a fair markup for a quality product or service and paying a fair wage it 's not highly profitable but i think we 've been watching the race to the bottom by publicly traded companies maximizing quarterly returns at the expense of literally anything and everything else something 's got ta give   also your argument implies that you 're ok subsidizing walmart 's profit margin with your tax money their employees are receiving government benefits because walmart does n't pay them well enough to afford it on their own figure $ split 190 m ways we us workers all gave walmart a little over $ 30 each

well it 2008 was six years ago over time we would expect some price inflation however it 's only really a good thing for people who already own houses it increases their net worth on paper and people who want to sell and move to a cheaper area   if you are n't selling it does n't help you much    if you 're a young person trying to get into the housing market it 's obviously bad a housing market where young people ca n't afford to get in is unhealthy if you already own and you want to move up and buy a bigger house that 's hard if no one is willing to buy your existing house   i do n't know why the govt is helping create a new bubble but if the underlying issues that caused the last crash are not fixed well the bigger the bubble the bigger the pop

this depends on what your definition of the word is is strictly speaking you are only investing in a company when you buy stock from them somehow   this is usually done during an ipo or a secondary offering   or if you are someone like warren buffet or an institutional investor you strike a deal with the company to buy shares directly from them   otherwise your money goes to someone else merriam webster defines speculate as 1b to review something or casually and often however it also defines it as 2 to assume a business risk in hope of gain especially to buy or sell in expectation of profiting from market fluctuations   the typical use of the term stock speculation vs stock investing involves definition 1b   this to the idea that little to no research was done about the stock   this may be due to a lack of time interest knowledge etc or it may be due to a lack of information   the former usually has a negative connotation   the latter may have a negative connotation though usually the connotation is one of greater risk strictly speaking definition 2 includes investing as you define it along with investing in securities commodities

from my knowledge credit card balance can not be transfered like that on the other hand debit card balance can all banks have an online portal where you can log in and see all of your accounts another options is to call or go to the bank and go through the same process to transfer to banks in other countries you need both their account details person 's name account number and the bank 's international identifiers exact name swift number if you have that information you can simply transfer the money and then your parents or you can use it to pay the debt another option would be to assign yourself as the debt payer if the bank allows it and other options would be simple money lending services like for example western union also be sure that your bank will know all the possible ways you could proceed hope this helps robert

in the us section of the uniform commercial code sets the rules for how any confusion in checks or other business transactions is handled if an instrument contains contradictory terms terms prevail over printed terms handwritten terms prevail over both and words prevail over numbers   if there was any ambiguity in the way you wrote out the amount the institution will compare the two fields the written words and the courtesy box digits to see if the ambiguity can be resolved   the reality is that the busy tellers and atm operators typically are going to look at the numeric digits first so even if they happen to notice the traditional and missing it seems highly unlikely that such an would cause enough ambiguity between these the two fields to reject the payment common sense dictates here i would n't worry about it

you are not the person or entity against whom the crime was committed so the casualty loss theft deduction does n't apply here you should report this as a capital loss the same way all of the enron shareholders did in their 2001 tax returns your cost basis is whatever you originally paid for the shares the final value is presumably zero you can declare a maximum capital loss of $ 3000 so if your net capital loss for the year is greater than that you 'll have to carry over the remainder to the following years irs publication states decline in market value of stock    you ca n't deduct as a theft loss the decline in market value of stock acquired on the open market for investment if the decline is caused by disclosure of accounting fraud or other illegal misconduct by the officers or directors of the corporation that issued the stock however you can deduct as a capital loss the loss you sustain when you sell or exchange the stock or the stock becomes completely worthless you report a capital loss on schedule d form 1040 for more information about stock sales worthless stock and capital losses see chapter 4 of pub 550

you do n't need an mba to evaluate the performance of a bar    there is usually a dumb ratio for any industry which sets the expected turnover and bottom line basically one figure that can be given to an experienced bar owner and he 'll know that the top and bottom line should be not knowing the bar industry your area or grade of location etc i 'd guess cost of sales i.e. drink you apply that against the typical gross margin and you 'll know what the turnover figure should be and apply it to the typical net profit and know what the bottom line should be would n't surprise me if an experienced guy could figure all that out just from the area and rent with a bit of local knowledge   it should go without saying that if these are underperforming it does n't tell you why maybe your manager is you maybe he 's crap maybe the owners took crappy decisions like inappropriate fit out crap marketing crap location etc forcing manager to price low   also bear in mind that the average includes all the really experienced bar owners so it can already be a tough target

you 'd probably have to sue them to get the money in most cases those statements have disclaimers all over them telling you about the vesting period and technically that extra money was probably never really in your account   normally the statements also break out the actual contributions from the employer match part and have a footnote about the vesting policy unless the employer was completely incompetent in their management of this account i am betting they will have documentation of the policy that you supposedly were given   you probably have very slim chances of prevailing on this unless they were very lax in their documentation i 'd say re check the statements and your employee manually carefully for any mention of vesting if you do n't find it ask the employer nicely where you were notified of this if they still ca n't produce any documentation then sue them

insurance is to mitigate risk you ca n't handle yourself   all insurance not just car insurance   the expected value of the insurance will always cost more than the expected value of your loss that 's how the insurance company makes money   but sometimes the known fixed cost is better for your ability to sleep at night than the unknown though likely lower variable cost if you were suddenly hit with a bill the size of your car tomorrow would you be ok   if so then you can handle the risk yourself and do n't need insurance   if not then you need the insurance the insurance company sells thousands of policies and it 's much easier to predict the number out of 1000 people that will get in an accident tomorrow than the chance that you specifically will get in an accident tomorrow   so they can manage the risk by making a small amount of money from people and buying the other guy a new car

as others have said getting on a written budget before each month starts is the most important part also i 'm a big fan of cash budgets as well they are n't for everyone and they take a little getting used to but once you get used to them you 'll never want to go back   in a cash budget you take whatever you have budgeted for the month for each category and withdraw the amount needed from the bank these go into an envelope for each category i.e. food clothes entertainment etc if a 3 weeks into the month you run out of money in that envelope you are done spending money in that category for example if it 's the food envelope and you run out it 's time for you to start eating leftovers and whatever you 've got in the pantry you lose out on advantages like points gained on credit cards and whatnot but statistically people that spend cash spend much less overall and you get some enforced self control that you otherwise might not have

i guess the opposite of being hedged is being unhedged typically a hedge is an additional position that you would take on in order to mitigate the potential for losses on another position i 'll give an example say that i purchase 100 shares of stock xyz at $ 10 per share because i believe its price will increase in the future   at that point my full investment of $ 1000 is at risk so the position is not hedged if the price of xyz decreases to $ 8 then i 've lost $ 200   if the price of xyz increases to $ 12 then i 've gained $ 200 the profit loss curve has a linear relationship to the future stock price suppose that i decide to hedge my xyz position by purchasing a put option i purchase a single option contract corresponding to my 100 shares with a strike price of $ 10 and an expiration date in january 2013 for a price of $ this means that until the contract expires i can always sell my xyz shares for a minimum of $ 10   therefore if the price of xyz decreases to $ 8 then i 've only lost $ 50 the price of the option contract compared to the $ 200 that i would have lost if the position was unhedged   likewise however if the price increases to $ 12 then i 've only gained a net total of $ 150 due to the money i spent on the hedge the details of how much money you would actually lose in the hedged scenario are simplified out above even out of the money options retain some value before expiration but pricing of options is outside of the scope of this post so as a more pointed answer to your question i would say that the hedged unhedged status of a position can be characterized by its potential for loss if you do n't have any other assets that will increase in value to offset losses on your position of interest i would call it unhedged

in the netherlands its cheaper in some cases to have a mortgage then to own a house    example if you own a house you pay more taxes because you own something expensive you have to pay < owners tax so if you instead of owning the house   keep the mortgage low and only pay the mortgage interest the interest will be much lower then the tax you would have to pay the sweet spot for lowest interest and not having to pay the owners tax is different for any mortgage but by grandparents use this method and they pay a really small amount for a rather large house

it seems very risky have all of your net worth in this one home if i were to buy the house i 'm not sure i would put that much down consider 20 and keep cash on hand in retirement assets etc i would look at how much a mortgage plus interest taxes insurance etc would cost with 50 down and with 20 down and see how that impacts your cash flow renting may make more sense it 's hard to tell without more specifics nytimes rent buy calculator is a nice tool but regardless i would not want to have so much net worth tied into one asset and so would opt for less money down if i were to buy focus on rebuilding some retirement assets

you can withdraw from your rrsp to pay your taxes while not necessarily advisable it is permitted yet the tax consequences are no different just because you happen to be using the money to pay a prior year 's income tax balance due when you make the withdrawal from your rrsp an amount will be withheld towards your income tax for the withdrawal year assuming you have other income then you are likely to owe cra even more than the amount withheld because the withdrawal is effectively taxed at your marginal rate in that case consider the withholding tax merely a downpayment you 'll figure the final amount due when you file your next income tax return e.g. if you were to withdraw money from your rrsp today in 2015 to pay your 2014 income tax balance due then on your 2015 income tax return you 'll need to declare the withdrawn amount as income for 2015 you 'll get credit for the withholding taxes already paid when you made the withdrawal your tax return will indicate how much more you 'll need to pay to settle your 2015 taxes if you then pay your 2015 income tax balance due with an rrsp withdrawal in 2016 then repeat better to save up funds elsewhere e.g. in a bank account or a tfsa to cover an anticipated income tax balance owing

first i want to be sure op understands how credit utilization is scored as this confuses many folks here in the us   there is no reward for charging money or carrying balances only penalty   if you have one credit card with a $ 10,000 limit and owe $ 8,000   you have an 80 utilization which will signal to banks that you are having financial difficulties   anything over 30 on a single card is usually penalized significantly   the ideal utilization is something around 0 which is in the ballpark of the 5 op mentioned   again there is never any direct benefit to your credit of spending a penny on any of your credit cards    banks offer the best rates to people that pay off their balances each month or do n't use their cards in the first place   why despite the system being imperfect in many ways utilization is a good indicator   example if you have a card with a   $ 10,000 limit and pay it off every month that speaks to you being a good risk if you compared this person to the person above who do you think would be the most likely to pay back a car loan finally utilization is a small part of the credit score   i would call it more of a hurdle than a factor at least concerning good rates and approvals   most of your credit is based on length of history paying on time and having multiple types of credit real life example i had a relative that had perfect payment history for decades   they got divorced and started accumulating a balance   the person got other cards with 0 apr to avoid the interest but their balance only grew   had to use the card to make ends meet etc   3 kids single parent   they ended up filing a sizable bankruptcy a few years later   this was one of the most responsible people i 've ever known   yes that statement will seem far fetched to someone else   it was almost impossible to get them to file bankruptcy even though there was no way to ever pay the money back the point   utilization shows a more current picture than some of the other portions due     had those banks used the high utilization as a warning sign they would have saved a lot of money    a fun way of looking at credit sometimes i describe credit score as a popularity contest   if you really need money banks are not going to help you   however if your credit shows everyone is lining up to loan you money other banks are going to want in too   banks only make loans to people that do n't need them spending a lot on credit cards does sometimes have the indirect effect of getting balance increases that could have a slight increase in your score   this happens   less than it did prior to the financial fiasco   also the effect of this is on the score negligible unless carrying a balance   and the person carrying a balance also has a lower score anyways   additionally someone charging less could probably get a similar raise if they asked for it   raises vary greatly by issuer

the short answer is no if what you 're doing is working well enough for you then you do n't need to do anything more with your website   the long ish answer is you can use your website as the platform for all your social media instead of posting all of your writing on each social account you may be better off putting your original content in a platform you control your website and then it out to social platforms this has a number of advantages you can customize the way you present it for the audience of each social platform in the introduction you give it you can bring the interested traffic and clicks back to your website where you can influence them to your and not to be dismissed if your business is highly dependent on 3rd party services like social media platforms then that is a risk they may change their policies at any time and affect your business as a result

also keep note some companies have a combined ceo chairman of the board role while he she would not be allowed to negotiate contracts or stock plans some corporate governance analysts advocate for the separation of the roles to remove any opportunity for the ceo to unduly influence the board   this could be the case for dysfunctional boards however the alternate camps will say that the combined role has no negative effect on shareholder returns    sec regulations require companies to disclose negotiations between the board and ceo as well as other named executives for contracts employee stock plans and related information sometimes reading the proxy statement to find out for example how many times the board meets a year how many other boards a director serves on and if the ceo sits on any other board usually discouraged to serve on more than 2 will provide some insight into a well run or not well run board

why should n't i just keep my money in the savings account and earn the same amount both accounts have the same apy in this case i will assume that you are transferring money from your savings account into a traditional ira and deducting the contribution from your income   while you may think that the money that is being transferred is yours already it is sitting in your savings account for pete 's sake you are deducting that amount in getting to your taxable income and so you are effectively contributing it from current income and not paying taxes on the amount contributed so consider the same amount of money sitting in your savings account versus the same amount of money sitting in your traditional ira account while you will earn the same amount of interest in both accounts you will have   to pay taxes each year on the interest earned in the savings account you might   choose as most people do to not take money out of the savings account to pay theses taxes but just pay them from ready cash checking account current income etc or these taxes might just reduce the refund that you will getting from the irs and your state income tax authority but in either case you have paid taxes on the interest earned in your non ira savings account and of course long ago you also paid taxes on the original amount in the non ira savings account   so if you take any money out of the non ira savings account you do n't pay any taxes on the amount withdrawn except possibly for the interest earned from january 1 till the date of withdrawal which you are paying from ready cash on the other hand consider the traditional ira the original deposit was not taxed in the sense that you got a deduction reduced tax or increased refund when you made the contribution the annual interest earned was not taxed each year either   so when you make a qualified withdrawal after age 59.5 or by meeting one of the other exceptions allowing withdrawal before age 59.5 you are taking money on which you have not paid any taxes at all and the irs wants its cut   the money withdrawn is taxable income to you furthermore the money withdrawn is not eligible for any kind of favorable treatment such as having it count as qualified dividends or as long term capital gains even if your ira was invested in stocks and the money in the account is all qualified dividends or long term capital gains   if you make an unqualified withdrawal you owe a penalty technically named an excise tax in addition to income tax on the amount withdrawn if you are investing in a roth ira you will not be getting a deduction when you make the contribution and qualified withdrawals are   completely tax free and so the answer is completely different from the above

as well as paying 8 interest on your loan i.e. $ you 're also wasting money on the car depreciation insurance etc so it 's worth a lot to you to get out of it set against that is the risk of having to borrow the $ 3000 you 'll be taking from your emergency fund at a higher interest rate say 30 for at most 6 months which would only cost you $ 300-$400 even if it happens you 'll also be giving up a small amount of interest on the $ 3000 but at current interest rates that pretty much negligible there is a small chance that an emergency would also cause the available credit on your credit cards to disappear but in the short term that should be pretty unlikely so i think the balance is overwhelmingly in favour of getting out of the loan as soon as you can

it 's a trade off the answer depends on your risk tolerance seeking higher rewards demands higher risk if you want advice i would recommend hiring an expert to design a plan which meets your needs as a sample point not necessarily right for anyone else i'm considered an aggressive investor and my own spread is still more conservative than many folks i 'm entirely in low cost index funds distributed as with the money tied up in a defined contribution pension fund being treated as a low yield bond some of these have beaten the indexes they 're tracking some have n't my average yield since i started investing has been a bit over not including the company match on part of the 401k which i consider good enough certainly good enough for something that requires near zero attention from me past results are not a guarantee of future performance this may be completely wrong for someone at a different point in their career and/or life and/or finances i 'm posting it only as an example not a recommendation   regarding when to rebalance set some at which things have too far from your preferred distribution value of a fund being 5 off its target percentage in the mix is one rule i 've sometimes used and/or pick some reasonable usually fairly low frequency at which you 'll actively rebalance once a year 4x year whenever you change your car 's oil something like that and/or rebalance by selecting which funds you deposit additional money into whenever you 're adding to the investments note that that last option avoids having to take capital gains which is generally a good thing you want as much of your profit to be long term as possible and to avoid triggering the wash sales rule generally you do not have to rebalance very frequently unless you are doing something that i 'd consider unreasonably risky or unless you 're managing such huge sums that a tiny fraction of a percent still adds up to real money

an offset account is simply a savings account which is linked to a loan account instead of earning interest in the savings account and thus having to pay tax on the interest earned it reduces the amount of interest you have to pay on the loan example of a 100 offset account loan amount $ 100,000 offset balance $ 20,000 you pay interest on the loan based on an effective $ 80,000 loan balance example of a 50 offset account loan account $ 100,000 offset balance $ 20,000 you pay interest on the loan based on an effective $ 90,000 loan balance the benefit of an offset account is that you can put all your income into it and use it to pay all your expenses the more the funds in the offset account build up the less interest you will pay on your loan you are much better off having the offset account linked to the larger loan because once your funds in the offset increase over $ 50,000 you will not receive any further benefit if it is linked to the smaller loan so by offsetting the larger loan you will end up saving the most money also something extra to think about if you are paying interest only your loan balance will not change over the interest only period and your interest payments will get smaller and smaller as your offset account grows on the other hand if you are paying principal and interest then your loan balance will reduce much faster as your offset account increases this is because with principal and interest you have a minimum amount to pay each month made up of a portion of principal and a portion of interest as the offset account grows you will be paying less interest so a larger portion of the principal is paid off each month

this works even better when you have a good credit score when you want to arbitrarily inflate it for bragging rights or lowest interest rates i 'm only pointing this out because it has nothing to do with your current score and ck 's recommendation the presence of an installment loans is 10 of your credit score according to some credit scoring models so theoretically someone with a solid 720 score could gain 72 points while someone with a 480 score would only gain 48 points but the scores are weighted so you would n't get that kind out outcome regardless it will have less of an impact you can do this amongst other things but if that installment loan alters your utilization of credit it will more greatly lower your score and the hard inquiry to apply for the loan will also temporarily hurt your score and you also might not be approved these are the things to consider but fortunately utilization has no history yes you can pay the loan off with a monthly payment the loan 's interest will cost slightly more than the monthly payments by the end of the loan term i 've done this with a 5 year $ 500 installment loan at a credit union as others pointed out you do n't have to spend money to raise your credit score unnecessary interest in this case but you certainly can

your friend probably can not deposit the check to your u.s. bank account u.s. banks that i 've worked with will not accept a deposit from someone who is not an owner of the account i do n't know why not if some stranger wants to make unauthorized deposits to my account why should i object but that 's the common rule   you could endorse the check your friend could then deposit it to his own account or cash it and then transfer the money to you in a variety of ways   but i think it would be easier to just deposit the check in your account wherever it is you live most banks have no problem with depositing a foreign check there may be a fairly long delay before you can get access to the money while the check clears through the system   i do n't know exactly what you mean by a prize check but assuming that this is taxable income yes i assume the u.s. government would want their hard earned share of your money these days you can pay u.s. taxes on line if you have a credit card if you have not already paid u.s. taxes for the year you should make an estimated payment i.e. you ca n't wait until april 15 of the next year you have to pay most or all of the taxes you will owe in the calendar year you earned it

this might not map well because personal finance is not the global economy but let 's start by talking about this in terms of the cost of a loan vs the gain of an investment    if you can buy a house with a mortgage at 3 but make 7 on average in the stock market you should take as as possible to pay that off and invest every penny you can spare in the markets   heck if you can take on even more debt at 3 you should still do the same   now imagine you have the power to literally print money but doing so is effectively a form of loan to yourself   we call the interest on that loan inflation and it comes out to roughly 2 basically the same rate that us treasuries pay they are n't strictly locked but they rarely drift far apart   so if you can print money at 1 you should rationally print as much money as you possibly can to buy us treasuries at   but someone has to take that money off your hands pallets of money in a warehouse are n't worth any more than the paper they 're made of   there we get into trade imbalances whether printing money costs you 0.1 or 10 or 1000 per year depends on whether your country is on average making or losing money on international trade i 'm glossing over a hell of a lot there as full disclosure and by how much   if you 're printing money as fast as you can just to buy food to stay alive with zero exports you 're screwed if your country exports $ 10 to the us or equivalents for every $ 1 you import the rest of that is essentially invested in usd in that you did n't need to print it yourself just to feed your people

the tax deferred status of a 401k plan helps you in theory because your tax rate will be lower once you retire and start drawing the money   this theory could prove incorrect also the money you add to a 401k lowers your taxable income today so you end up paying less taxes to the government right now   depending on where you are in the tax bracket scale that could have the affect of lowering your tax bracket which will save you money in other areas each person 's situation is different by my general theory is to contribute towards retirement in the following order hope this helps

almost any financial institution has the technical ability to do this simply called sweeps auto sweeps or deposit sweeps the issue you face is finding an institution that is willing to do it for you   i think you will have the most luck at your primary financial institution where you currently keep the majority of your banking relationship   you will have better luck at small town banks and credit unions   the mega banks will likely not from their established policies deposit sweeps are common for business accounts   they are usually tied to a savings account which is usually held within the same institution however this is not a requirement   the sweep can send money to any us bank if you can provide the routing number and account number   the sweep will establish a peg balance or floor balance on the checking account   at the end of the day any amount above the peg is swept into the savings account automatically i doubt you will find what you ’re asking for within an online banking system   you will likely have to go into a branch and speak with a personal banker   explain to them you want to establish a sweep on your checking account and want to send the funds to another financial institution   you will have better luck asking for a peg of $ 100 or some other small amount   they may not take your request seriously if you want to completely empty the checking account to zero

whenever one takes a distribution from an ira it can not be put back into an ira unless one is doing something like a take a distribution from the ira as a rollover where the owner gets cash in hand to be sent to the new ira custodian within 60 days and b deposit the money with the new ira custodian within the prescribed time period for distributions taken by a first time home purchaser to buy or rebuild a home the money can be put back and treated as a rollover up to 120 days after receiving it publication 590 page 51 column 2 note also that distributions taken for   first time lose their qualified distribution status if not paid to the seller or bank for closing costs etc within 120 days of receipt of the distribution publication 590 page 51 column 1 however one   can not take a distribution from an ira no matter whether the sum comes from contributions earnings or previous rollovers and put the money back into the ira a few years down the road as having been unnecessarily withdrawn    what you want to do take out some money out of your ira to buy a house and   put the money back into the ira later is effectively an interest free loan from your ira even if you do n't call it a loan or think of it as a loan and you   are not allowed to do this except in the special circumstances described above on the other hand unless you have a very atypical 401k plan you can take a loan from your 401k you will have to pay interest though and pay it back over several years thus taking a loan from your 401k might be something you could consider as an alternative to withdrawing money from your ira but be aware that there are restrictions on how much you can borrow from your 401k and usually you can not withdraw employer match money even if it has vested also the loan becomes immediately due upon termination of employment even if the termination was involuntary i.e. the   employee was laid off or fired

in addition to the other answers here 's a proper strategy that implements your idea if the options are priced properly they should account for future dividend payments so all other things aside a put option that is currently at the money should be in the money after the dividend and hence more expensive than a put option that is out of the money today but at the money after the dividend has been paid the unprotected futures if priced correctly should account for dividend payments based on the dividend history and since maturing after the payment should earn you you sell them less money because you deliver the physical after the dividend has been paid the protected ones should reflect the expected total return value of the stock at the time of maturity i.e. the dividend is mentally calculated into the price and any dividend payments that happen on the way will be debited from your cash and credited to the counterparty now that 's the strategy that leaves you with nearly no risk the only risk you bear is that the dividend is n't as high as you expected   but for that comfort you have to pay premiums   so to see if you 're smarter than the market subtract all the costs for the hedging instruments from your dividend yield and see if your still better than the lending rate   if so do the trade

if you know that you want that advanced degree and there is a way to have your employer pay for some of it or all of it and you are reasonably certain that you will not be quitting for x years after completing the degree then it is financially sound to consider having the company pay for it if you are interested in finding out if an advanced degree in that field is possible feasible for you but you are n't 100 sure and it is possible for your company to pay for the first few classes then it is financially sound to consider having them pay for the first semesters worth of classes the key is to determine if the company has a requirement that you must complete the degree or you will owe them the money in many cases you are not committed to having them pay for all semesters i have known employees who used the company to pay for the early classes then paid for the last few on their own   keep in mind that most employers only pay you for the classes that you have good grades they require you to submit paperwork before the semester but do n't pay you back until after the semester because of a rolling time frame you can protect yourself by keeping in reserve the maximum amount that you would have to repay the employer if you quit for the companies i have worked for you only had to stay an extra year you would only have owed them for that last year if you quit keeping a years tuition in reserve allows you to mitigate the risk of having to quit if the question is about risk then hedging make sense

according to the sec shareholder reports a mutual fund and a closed end fund respectively must provide    shareholders with annual and semi annual reports 60 days after the end    of the fund ’s fiscal year and 60 days after the fund ’s fiscal    mid year these reports contain updated financial information a list    of the fund ’s portfolio securities and other information the    information in the shareholder reports will be current as of the date    of the particular report that is the last day of the fund ’s fiscal    year for the annual report and the last day of the fund ’s fiscal    mid year for the semi annual report   other reports a mutual fund and a closed end fund must file a form n q each quarter    and a form n each year on the sec ’s edgar database although funds    are not required to mail these reports to shareholders funds disclose    portfolio holdings on form n q. form n identifies specific    proposals on which the fund has voted portfolio securities over the    past year and discloses how the fund voted on each this disclosure    enables fund shareholders to monitor their funds’ involvement in the    governance activities of portfolio companies which means that sixty days after the end of each quarter they will tell you what they owned 60 days ago this makes sense why would they want to tell the world what companies they are buying and selling

as a venezuelan who used to buy usd i believe there is not better explanation than the one given to someone who actually lives and works here in venezuela back in 1998 when took the presidency we had a good economy fast forward 10 years and you could see how poor management corruption and   communist measurements had havoc in our economy it was because most of the money usd coming in venezuela were not invested here but instead given away to countries like cuba remember communism lasts while you have money back then we had an oil barrel going over 100 $ and crazy amounts of money were coming in the country however little to no money was invested in the country itself that is why some of the richest people with bank account in swiss are who stole huge amounts of oil money   i know this is a lot to take in but all of this led to venezuelan economy being the worst in the american continent and because there is not enough money inside the country to satisfy the inner market people would pay to have anything that is bought abroad you have to consider that only a very small amount of people can actually buy usd here in venezuela back in 2013 i was doing it i could buy about 80 usd month with my monthly income however that 's nearly impossible for about 99 of   to illustrate minimum wage = 10.000 month black market exchange rate as of january 2016 = per = usd    < < < that is what about 50 of earn every month that 's why this happens   the guy is holding a huge stack of money of the highest venezuelan note which he got from exchanging only 100 usd i am a computer science engineer the monthly income for someone like me is about so that is about 34 $ a month oh dear so finally answering your question q why do people buy usd even at this unfavorable rate a there are many reasons but being the main 2 the following inflation in venezuela is crazy high the inflation from 2014 2015 was which means that having the venezuelan currency in your bank account makes no sense in two weeks you wo n't be able to buy half of the things you used to with the same amount of money a huge amount of dream with living abroad me included why you ask well sir it is certain that life in this country is not the best i hope you can understand better why people in 3rd world countries and crappy economies buy usd even at an unfavorable rate the last question was q why would venezuela want to block the sale of dollars a centralized currency management is an economic measure that should last 6 months tops this was argentina 's case in 2013 but at this point reverting that would take quite a few years   however 's wikipedia link explains that very well regards

the answer is the next sentence from the wikipedia article the precise manner in which interest is charged is usually detailed in a cardholder agreement which may be summarized on the back of the monthly statement   your previous question on credit card interest rates quotes the sentence after this you have to review what the agreement for your card says also keep in mind the bank wants to make money from you the more interest and fees they collect they better they like you if enough card holders adjust their behavior to minimize interest and fees the bank will then adjust the credit card agreement to get money a different way   yes you are right it would seem fair to only charge interest on the smaller amount but that does n't allow the credit card issuer to maximize profits

how you use the metric is super important    because it subtracts cash it does not represent value   it represents the ongoing financing that will be necessary if both the equity plus debt is bought by one person who then pays himself a dividend with that free cash    so if you are private equity this measures your net investment at not the price you pay at t=0   if you are a retail investor who a wo n't be buying the debt b wo n't have any control over things like tax jurisdictions c wo n't be receiving any cash dividend etc etc the metric is pointless

bid and ask prices of stocks change not just daily but continuously   they are as the names suggest what price people are asking for to be willing to sell their stock and how much people are bidding to be willing to buy it at that moment your equation is accurate in theory but does n't actually apply   the bid and ask prices are indicators of the value of the stock but the only think you care about as a trader are what you actually pay and sell it for   so regardless of the bid ask the equation is since you can not buy an index directly index like indicator it does n't make sense to discuss how much people are bidding or asking for it   like joetaxpayer said you can buy and therefore bid ask for etfs and funds that attempt to track the value of the s&p 500

for those who do n't know credit card checks are blank checks that your credit card company sends you   when you fill them out and spend them you are taking a cash advance on your credit card account   you should be aware that taking a cash advance on your credit card normally has extra fees and finance charges above what you have with regular credit card transactions that having been said when you take one of these to your bank and try to deposit them it is entirely up to bank policy how long they will make you wait to use these funds   they want to be sure that it is a legitimate check and that it will be honored   if your teller does n't know the answer to that question you 'll need to find someone at the bank who does   if you do n't like the answer they give you you 'll need to find another bank i would think that if the credit card is from chase and you are trying to deposit a credit card check into a chase checking account they should be able to do that instantly   however bank policy does n't always make sense

you 'd need to test the assumptions here in effect you 're saying that in 15 years your account will have a balance 10x your income but normally you 'd expect your income to grow over the years e.g. promotions and so you 'd hope that your income in 15 years would be significantly larger than what it is now    but even in the case where your account eventually does grow to 10x your salary at that time it may still be worth continuing to contribute in effect adding a further 1 to your account is boosting the compounding return on your account by 1 after fees and risk free this additional 1 return in effect makes your retirement plan safer you either get a higher total return for the same investment mix or you can get the same total return for a slightly safer investment mix in effect you 're treating your salary as a safe annuity and each year putting 10 of the return from that into your more risky retirement account

you are faced with a dilemma if you use a 529 plan to fund your education the short timeline of a few years will limit your returns that are tax free most people who use a 529 plan either purchase years of tuition via lump sum when the child is young or they   put aside money on a regular basis that will grow tax deferred tax free some states do give a tax break when the contribution is made by a state taxpayer into a plan run by the state the long term plans generally use a risk profile that starts off heavily weighted in stock when the child is young and becomes more fixed income as the child reaches their high school years the idea is to protect the fund from big losses when there is no time to recover if you choose the plan with the least risk the issue is that the amount of gains that are being protected from federal tax is small if you pick a more aggressive plan the risk is that the losses could be larger than the state tax savings look at some of the other tax breaks for tuition to see if you qualify credits an education credit helps with the cost of higher education by    reducing the amount of tax owed on your tax return if the credit    reduces your tax to less than zero you may get a refund there are    two education credits available the american opportunity tax credit    and the lifetime learning credit who can claim an education credit there are additional rules for each credit but you must meet all    three of the following for either credit if you ’re eligible to claim the lifetime learning credit and are also    eligible to claim the american opportunity credit for the same student    in the same year you can choose to claim either credit but not both    you ca n't claim the if you were a nonresident alien for any part    of the tax year unless you elect to be treated as a resident alien for    federal tax purposes for more information about and foreign    students visit american opportunity tax credit information for    foreign students deductions tuition and fees deduction you may be able to deduct qualified education expenses paid during the    year for yourself your spouse or your dependent you can not claim    this deduction if your filing status is married filing separately or    if another person can claim an exemption for you as a dependent on his    or her tax return the qualified expenses must be for higher    education the tuition and fees deduction can reduce the amount of your income    subject to tax by up to $ 4,000 this deduction reported on form    tuition and fees deduction is taken as an adjustment to income this    means you can claim this deduction even if you do not itemize    deductions on schedule a form 1040 this deduction may be beneficial    to you if for example you can not take the lifetime learning credit    because your income is too high you may be able to take one of the education credits for your    education expenses instead of a tuition and fees deduction you can    choose the one that will give you the lower tax

this is automation a goal that businesses are going to head for no matter how much people about it   as long as we have an economy that demands profits as soon as it becomes viable to use a machine over a human it will     it 's not a new trend either   machines replace humans all the time   it 's been happening since the industrial revolution   this is just the latest iteration in a long running cycle   the correct response to automation replacing human labor is not to fight automation though it happens every time and always loses in the end but rather to embrace the new technology and ensure the displaced workers have other jobs or failing that the ability to retrain or train for higher paying jobs   this is an argument for a better more comprehensive welfare system more funding for public education maybe even something as horrific as a basic income system that ensures not only are our most vulnerable able to survive but those that want are given the opportunity to thrive instead of forcing them to work a low wage job for eternity

highlights from bill 's senate testimony   has a well known reputation for corruption unfortunately i discovered that it was far worse than many had thought   gt;when putin was first elected in 2000 he found that the had much of the president ’s power as well they stole power from him while stealing money from my investors   july 2003 putin arrested russia ’s biggest and richest man after ’s conviction the other went to putin and asked him what they needed to do to avoid sitting in the same cage as from what followed it appeared that putin ’s answer was fifty percent he was n’t saying 50 percent for the russian government or the presidential administration of russia but 50 percent for putin personally from that moment on putin became the biggest in russia and the richest man in the world   amp;nbsp 25 interior ministry officials into my moscow office and the office of the american law firm that represented me the officials seized all the corporate documents connected to the investment holding companies of the funds that i advised i did n’t know the purpose of these raids so i hired the smartest russian lawyer i knew a old named sergei magnitsky i asked sergei to investigate the purpose of the raids and try to stop whatever illegal plans these officials had   went out and investigated he came back with the most astounding conclusion of corporate identity theft the documents seized by the interior ministry were used to fraudulently re register our russian investment holding companies to a man named known criminal convicted of after more digging sergei discovered that the stolen companies were used by the to $ 230 million of taxes that our companies had paid to the russian government in the previous year   amp;nbsp gt;as i thought about it the murder of sergei magnitsky was done to cover up the theft of $ 230 million from the russian treasury i knew that the people who stole that money would n’t keep it in russia as easily as they stole the money it could be stolen from them these people keep their ill gotten gains in the west where property rights and rule of law exist this led to the idea of freezing their assets and banning their visas here in the west   2010 i traveled to washington and told sergei magnitsky ’s story to senators benjamin and john mccain they were both shocked and appalled and proposed a new piece of legislation called the sergei magnitsky rule of law accountability act   gt;despite the white house ’s desire to reset relations with russia at the time this case a bright light on the and impunity of the putin regime and persuaded congress that something needed to be done in november 2012 the magnitsky act passed the house of representatives by to 43 votes and later the senate 92 to 4 votes on december 14 2012 president obama signed the sergei magnitsky act into law   was furious looking for ways to against american interests he settled on the most and evil option of all banning the adoption of russian orphans by american families   amp;nbsp 2012 it ’s emerged that putin was a beneficiary of the stolen $ 230 million that sergei magnitsky exposed   estimate that he has accumulated $ 200 billion of ill gotten gains from these types of operations over his 17 years in power he keeps his money in the west and all of his money in the west is potentially exposed to asset freezes and confiscation therefore he has a significant and very personal interest in finding a way to get rid of the magnitsky sanctions   second reason why putin reacted so badly to the passage of the magnitsky act is that it destroys the promise of impunity he ’s given to all of his corrupt officials   are approximately ten thousand officials in russia working for putin who are given instructions to kill torture extort money from people and seize their property before the magnitsky act putin could guarantee them impunity and this system of illegal wealth accumulation worked smoothly however after the passage of the magnitsky act putin ’s guarantee disappeared the magnitsky act created real consequences outside of russia and this created a real problem for putin and his system of   amp;nbsp gt one of the most shocking attempts took place in the spring and summer of last year when a group of russians went on a lobbying campaign in washington to try to repeal the magnitsky act by changing the narrative of what had happened to sergei   was this group of russians acting on behalf of the russian state two men named and a woman named and a large group of american lobbyists all of whom are described below   amp;nbsp first step was to set up a fake ngo that would ostensibly promote russian although it quickly became clear that the ngo ’s sole purpose was to repeal the magnitsky act this ngo was called the human rights accountability global initiative foundation   a former soviet intelligence officer as an american citizen was hired to lead the magnitsky repeal effort   amp;nbsp also instructed u.s. law firm baker and their washington based partner marc to lobby members of congress to support an amendment taking sergei magnitsky ’s name off the global magnitsky act mr. was in contact with paul a congressional on the house foreign affairs committee at the time as part of the anti magnitsky lobbying campaign   through baker hired glenn simpson of the firm fusion gps to conduct a smear campaign against me and sergei magnitsky in advance of congressional hearings on the global magnitsky act   amp;nbsp gt;as part of ’s lobbying a former wall street journal reporter chris cooper of the group was hired to organize the washington based of a fake documentary about sergei magnitsky and myself this was one the best examples of putin ’s propaganda   amp;nbsp june 13 2016 they funded a major event at the to show their fake documentary inviting representatives of congress and the state department to attend   they were conducting these operations in washington d.c. at no time did they indicate that they were acting on behalf of russian government interests nor did they file disclosures under the foreign agent registration act   cherry on top   from trump 's interview with the new york times   gt;"the meal was going toward dessert trump said i went down just to say hello to and while i was there i said hello to putin really more than anything else it was not a long conversation but it was you know could be 15 minutes just talked about things actually it was very interesting we talked about adoption

you are correct that barring an equity capital raise your money does n't actually end up in the company however interest in their stock can help a company in other ways management board members hopefully own shares or options themselves thus knowing that green policies are favorable for the stock price as your fund might buy shares can be quite an incentive for them to go   companies with above average company share performance are also often viewed as financially healthy and so creditors tend to charge lower interest for companies with good share performance   lastly a high share price makes a company difficult to take over as all those shares have to be acquired and at the same time makes it easier for the company to perform takeovers themselves as they can finance such acquisitions by issuing more of their own shares there is also the implication that money flowing towards such green companies is money flowing out of away from polluting companies for these dirty companies the inverse of the previous points can hold true of course on the other hand there is quite an argument to be made that large enough green funds should actually buy substantial positions in companies with poor environmental records and steer the company towards greener policies but that might be a hard sell to investors

for an investment to appreciate in value one of two things needs to happen 1 demand for that particular item needs to increase 2 the supply of that item needs to decrease houses are good because everyone needs a place to live but there is a finite amount of land   no matter how much you invest in real estate ai n't   the trick there is to find an area that people are going to want to live in when you 're ready to sell   specific of wines and spirits are another good example because it 's literally impossible to create more of that vintage cars and most consumer goods usually do n't appreciate because they do n't last long enough   most cars are resold within three to five years after the initial purchase   this is also why jewelry is a good investment properly cared for it can last centuries without wearing out so look for something durable that has a limited supply

there are api libraries available to various banks in various programming languages for example in perl there are many libraries in the some of these use screen scraping libraries and talk to the gui underneath so they are vulnerable to any changes the bank makes to their interface but some of the better banks do seem to provide back end interfaces which can then be used directly in either case you should still be sure that the transactions are secure some bank sites have bad security a good place to start is to call your bank and ask if they offer any programming apis for accessing their back end

no as a director normally you ca n't as a director of a limited company all those payments should be accounted for as directors remuneration and have been subject to paye and even if you are self employed currently there is no legislation which prevents a director from receiving self employment income from a company in which he is a director however the default position of hmrc 's is that all the payments derived from the are subject to paye in other words it 's possible only invoice from an business or in a consultancy role that 's not directly related to the trade of business but it really depends on the circumstances and the contracts in place sources at forum david at and at   more sources if a person does other work that ’s not related to being a director they may have an employment contract and get employment rights source employment status as director at gov.uk in principle it is possible for an employee or office holder to tender for work with their employer outside their normal duties in circumstances where that individual will not be providing service as an employee or office holder but as a self employed contractor where there is any doubt about whether service is provided constitutes employment or self employment see the employment status manual source section 62 2003 at hmrc

yes that 's right in the end tax is charged on the total of your income in a tax year paye on employment income is just a way of making incremental payments throughout the year note that tax rates are marginal rates applying to bands of salary not the entire salary but as your employment salary would be already over the 40 threshold £ 45,000 for the entire extra from self employment would indeed be taxed at 40 note that you 'll also owe national insurance contributions in general if your employed income is over the higher rate tax threshold it should be 2 class 4 on the self employment income however due to various complications in the way the system works you might be initially charged more than that and and explicitly claim the excess back from hmrc it might also be less if your earnings are below or only slightly above the lower profits limit   you still get to keep 58 only you can decide whether that is worth your time or not

it depends   high net worth individuals is very subjective    lets say a person is worth 1.5 million   high but not super high   for one they should have an umbrella policy   until your net worth is above 300 k you really do n't need an umbrella policy   they should insure their home and cars but should probably have high deductibles   health insurance is a must as a bad illness can wipe them out   they should have long term care insurance when they reach age 60    now lets say a person is worth about 10 million   they might be able to self insure basic transportation and probably do n't need long term care insurance   however they may choose to carry the full coverage car insurance or other lines because it is a value    in conclusion insurance needs change based on a person 's net worth and income   it is very hard to make a blanket statement without details of the makeup of one 's net worth and how they earn their income having said all of that a high net worth hnw individual may never be able to drop certain coverage   lets say that a hnw owns a 50 k condo 1 k square foot condo   given that the outside structure is covered by the hoa the insurance on such a unit only covers the contents and liability   the contents could easily be floated by the hnw individual but not the liability   it is probably a requirement on their umbrella policy that they carry the maximum liability protection on their vehicles and properties   in the case above they would carry a policy for the purposes of liability protection this could also be true of their dependents   say for example their adult child receives some financial assistance from their parents like college being paid for   the hnw individuals should have their child cover the maximum liability on the auto policy according to this site   a person with a net worth of 1.5 million would be in the 90 95 percentile a person with 10 million in the this article does a decent job of describing what constitutes a hnw person or household   namely 1 million in investable assets which is of course a bit different then net worth

here 's what you do without on the negative side just for balance a bill when i last had comprehensive insurance it cost something like 3 4 of the value of the car per annum   obviously ymmv enormously but i think that 's somewhere near the middle of the range and i 'm not especially risky   so compared to the total depreciation and running costs of the car it 's actually fairly substantial   over the say 10 years i might keep that car it adds up to a fair slice of what it will take to buy a replacement financial crisis costs i do n't know about you but my insurance went up something like 30 in recent years despite the value insured and the risk going down said by the insurer to be due to market turmoil   so at least hundreds of dollars is just kind of loss and i 'd rather not pay it with the insurer if you have insurance and a loss you have to persuade them to pay out perhaps document the original conditions or the fault perhaps argue about whether their payment is fair   i 've done this for small non automotive claims and it added up to more hassle than the incident itself   obviously all insurers will claim they 're friendly to deal with but until you actually have a big claim you never know moral hazard i know i 'm solely responsible for not having my car crashed or stolen   somehow that just feels better free riders i 've seen people fudge their insurance claims so that things that should n't have been covered were claimed to be   you might have too   buy insurance and you 're paying for them choice insurers are typically going to make the decision for you about whether a claim is or not and in my experience are reluctant or refuse to just give you the cash amount of the claim see also moral hazard   do it yourself and you can choose whether to live with it make a smaller or larger repair or replace the whole vehicle with a second hand one or a brand new one or indeed perhaps do without a vehicle a distraction hopefully by the time you 've been working for a while a vehicle is not a really large fraction of your net worth   if you lose 10 of your net worth it 's not really nice but well you could easily have lost that off the value of your house or your retirement portfolio in recent years   what you actually need to insure is genuinely serious risks that would seriously change your life if they were lost such as your ability to work   for about the same cost as insuring a $ x car you can insure against $ x income every year for the rest of your life and i think it 's far more important if i have a write off accident but walk away i 'll be perfectly happy and obviously liability insurance is important because being hit for $ millions of liabilities could also have a serious impact    coverage for mechanical failures if your car needs a new transmission insurance is n't going to help yet it may cost more than the typical minor collision   save the money yourself and you can manage those costs out of the same bucket flexibility if you save up to replace your car but some other crisis occurs you can choose to put the money towards that   if you have car insurance but you have a family medical thing it 's no help i think the bottom line is insure against costs you could n't cope with by yourself   there are people who need a car but can just barely afford it but if you 're fortunate enough not to be in that case you do n't really need comprehensive insurance

i never said all public employees fly first class i worked in the public sector for 3 years and flew economy and most of colleagues did as well so i agree that most public employees fly coach    maybe i did n't explain what i did before starting a business as a computer programmer for 15 years i 've worked for 2 private companies and 1 publicly funded educational organization public or private i 've always flown economy except for a couple of times where i was bumped to first class by the airline    a lot of people fly coach when taking personal trips so it would be hypocritical of them to demand first class from their employer for business trips i guess it just pisses me off when people brag that they fly first class or business class or booked a hotel room with a view when their paycheck comes from tax dollars or union dues

life insurance is not required to be used to pay the debts of the estate life insurance proceeds are not part of your estate they go    directly to the beneficiary and are their property   your daughter    can do whatever she wants with the proceeds she can pay off your credit cards if she wants but she does n’t have    to even if your will said she should use the insurance money to pay    your debts if that ’s what you really want you should make your    estate not your daughter the beneficiary of your insurance policies    then the proceeds will become part of your estate so they ’d be    available to repay your debts source if the deceased owned life insurance and nominated a beneficiary    of the policy the proceeds of that policy would not pass into the    deceased 's estate but would go directly to the nominated beneficiary source the amount of the life insurance is included in the estate for the purpose of calculating estate tax but not for the purpose of debt repayment the estate for the purpose of estate tax is called the gross estate and includes many things that are not included in a probate estate   source

consider the mechanic which actually drives the price of a stock in simplest terms the price of a stock is the price at which the most recent trade occurred ie if the price of ibm is $ 100/share that means the last time someone bought ibm stock they paid $ 100 above and below the spot price are dozens hundreds thousands of buyers and sellers who have placed orders that no one is yet willing to match ie if ibm 's spot price is at $ 100 there could still be 10,000 people willing to sell for $ 101 called the ask price for the lowest price someone is currently willing to sell at and 15,000 willing to buy for $ 99 called the bid price for the highest price someone is currently willing to buy for   until someone is willing to buy for $ 101 then no one will be able to sell at $ 101 until someone is willing to sell for $ 99 no one will be able to buy for $ 99 typically orders are placed in the market at a particular limit meaning that those orders to buy at $ at $ 101 are already in the system and will be matched immediately as soon as someone is willing to meet the price on the other side now consider general market economics high demand drives up price and high supply drives down price if the details above for ibm were yesterday and today some news came out that ibm was laying off employees imagine that another 10,000 people who held shares wanted to sell now there would be 20,000 sellers and only 15,000 buyers if those new sellers were aggressive about wanting to sell they would have to drop their price to $ 99 to match the highest buyers in the market put together this means that as more sellers enter the market supply of shares increases driving down price conversely as more buyers enter the market demand for shares increases driving up share price as a result of the above you can say that all else being equal if price for a stock goes up there were more buyers that day and if price goes down there were more sellers that day on the face of it that is not necessarily true because you could have the same number of buyers and sellers one side could have simply decreased increased their acceptable price to match the other side

while you want it to grow faster than inflation there are things like i bonds that can carry some inflation protection with them for an idea that may make sense for part of this there are now some more details and i 'd think this seems alright initially though i would suggest considering having some kind of on going plan to handle periodically seeing how much more to invest here and what kind of taxes will this generate for you as taxable accounts can carry a mix of dividends interest and capital gains that you may have to pay even though you did n't see the gain yourself keep in mind that if you do go with a big name investment bank this could well add more fees as well as other stuff   lehman brothers was a big name investment bank once upon a time and they went broke   while you may want to be hands off i 'd still suggest having some kind of timeline for how often are your investments to be reviewed and things re allocated   each quarter semi annually or annual   there is n't so much a right or wrong answer here as much as i 'd point out that one should be aware of the trade offs in each case   if you take annual and wonder each week how it is doing then something a bit more frequent may make sense   on the other hand some people may well set it and forget it which can work as long as there is something to know about where to go if something does go broke   as these are managed investments the sipc check i 'd make may not hold though this would be the equivalent of fdic for deposits when dealing with securities the reit can be useful for diversification sure   you do realize that there may be some interesting taxes for you in the next few years given the nature of a reit investment right   the return of capital that a reit may pass through as a reit to maintain its tax status must distribute 90 of its net income each year that can be quite a off shoot of funds   where would those proceeds be invested   this is n't mentioned in your post and thus i 'm curious as if the reit passes out a dividend yield of say 5 then this is $ that could go somewhere

you 're getting great wisdom and options establishing your actionable path will require the details that only you know such as how much is actually in each paycheck and how much tax is withheld how much do you spend each month and yearly expenses too how much spending can you actually cut or replace how comfortable are you with considering or not considering unexpected emergency spending you mentioned you were cash poor but only you know what your current account balances are which will affect your actions and priorities btw interestingly your increase 401k contributions by 2 each year will need to end before hitting the $ 18 k contribution limit i took some time and added the details you posted into a cash flow program to see your scenario over the next few years there is n't a 401k loan activity in this program yet so i build the scenario from other simple activities you seem financially minded enough to continue modeling on your own i 'm posting the more difficult one for you borrow from 401k but you 'll have to input your actual balances paycheck and spending my spending assumptions must be low and i entered $ 70 k as take home so the model looks like you 've got lots of cash if you choose to play with it then consider modeling some other scenarios from the advice in the other posts here 's the borrow $ 6500 from 401k scenario model at be to me it 's all about trying the scenarios and see which one seems to work with all of the details the trick is knowing what scenarios to try and how to model them full disclosure i needed to do similar planning so i wrote be and i now share it with other people it 's in beta so i 'm testing it with scenarios like yours notice most of the extra activity occurs on

if you take the statement you quote as stated it is indeed absurd unless you have a really creative tax accountant or live in a country with very unusual tax laws any tax deduction you get for mortgage interest is going to be less than the interest you do n't come out ahead by getting a $ 25 deduction if you had a $ 100 expense to get that deduction where there can be some sense behind such a statement is if you consider the alternative to paying cash for a house or making extra payments against a mortgage if you had $ 100,000 in cash in a box under your bed and the choice is between a use that $ 100,000 to buy a house in cash or b borrow $ 100,000 at 6 interest and leave that cash in the box under the bed than clearly a is the better choice because it saves you the interest expense but if the choice is between a buy a house for $ 100,000 in cash and borrow $ 100,000 at 6 to buy a car or b borrow $ 100,000 at 6 interest to buy a house and use the $ 100,000 cash to buy the car b is the better choice the home mortgage loan is tax deductible the car loan is not as others have pointed out if instead of using some extra cash to pay down the principle on your mortgage you used that money to invest in the stock market it is likely that you would get better returns on the investment than what you would have saved in interest on the mortgage depending of course on how the market is doing and how well you pick stocks but the key issue there is n't the tax deduction it 's the comparison of the profits from the investment versus the opportunity cost of the money that could have been saved on the mortgage interest the tax deduction affects that comparison by effectively reducing the interest rate on the mortgage your real interest expense is the nominal interest minus the deduction but that 's not the key point just another number to plug in to the formula by the way given the complexity of u.s. tax law i would not rule out the possibility that there could be some scenario where you really would save money by having mortgage interest there are lots of deductions and credits that are phased out or eliminated as your income goes up perhaps you could find some set of tax laws that apply to you such that having an additional $ 1000 in interest expense lets you take a $ 300 deduction here and a $ 500 credit there etc and they add up to more than $ 1000 i do n't know if that could actually happen but the rules are complicated enough that maybe any tax accountants here who can come up with such a scenario

stock prices are set by bidding in principle a seller will say i want $ 80 if he ca n't find anyone willing to buy at that price he 'll either decide not to sell after all or he 'll lower his price likewise a buyer will say i 'll pay $ 70 if he ca n't find anyone willing to pay that price he 'll either decide not to buy or he 'll increase his price for most stocks there are many buyers and many sellers all the time so there 's a constant the typical small investor has very little control of the price you say i want to buy 10 shares of xyz corporation and my maximum price is $ 20 if the current trending price is below $ 20 your broker will buy it for you if not he wo n't you normally have some time limit on the order so if the price falls within your range within that time period your broker will buy that is your choice is basically to buy or not buy or sell or not sell at the current price you have little opportunity to really negotiate a better price if you have a significant percentage of a company 's total stock different story in real life most stocks are being traded constantly so buyers and sellers both have a pretty good idea of the current price if the last sale was ten minutes ago for $ 20 it 's unlikely anyone 's going to now bid $ 100 they 're going to bid $ or $ or some such if the last sale was for $ 20 and your broker really came to the floor and offered to buy for $ 100 i suppose someone would sell to him very quickly before he realized what an outrageous price this was i use td ameritrade and on their web site if i give a price limit on a buy that 's more than a small percentage above the last sale they reject it as an error i forget the exact number but they wo n't even accept a bid of $ 80 if the stock is going for $ 40 they might accept $ 41 or $ 42 something like that

organize your expenses in order of the rate of return and pay them in that order   by far the highest rate of return on your list is nowhere else are you going to see an immediate 100 return or 50 depending on the company 's matching policy on every dollar you allocate to this pot second would probably be money that you do not allocate here will usually incur a penalty   outside of large expenses like a home education or a reasonable car you never want to pay to use your own money and borrowed money is still yours remember that someday you have to pay all of it back   avoiding a negative rate of return interest can be just as beneficial as finding a high positive rate of return on an investment continue down the list determining what must be paid first and what the highest rates are in the immediate future and the long run   meanwhile live within your means and set aside a portion of your monthly income towards things like a rainy day fund up to a level which is not touched when reached   additional savings through work or your personal investments should not be neglected money saved early and compounded is worth many times what a dollar saved down the road will gain especially if you are young in your career

in a word no diversification is the first rule of investing   your plan has poor diversification because it ignores most of the economy large cap stocks   this means for the expected return your portfolio would get you would bear an unnecessarily large amount of risk   large cap and small cap stocks take turns outperforming each other   if you hold both you have a safer portfolio because one will perform well while the other performs poorly   you will also likely want some exposure to the bond market a simple and diversified portfolio would be a total market index fund and a total bond market fund   something like 60 in the equity and 40 in the bonds would be reasonable   you may also want international exposure and maybe exposure to real estate via a reit fund you have expressed some risk aversion in your post   the way to handle that is to take some of your money and keep it in your cash account and the rest into the diversified portfolio remember when people add more and more asset classes large cap international bonds etc they are not increasing the risk of their portfolio they are reducing it via diversification   the way to reduce it even more after you have diversified is to keep a larger proportion of it in a savings account or other guaranteed investment btw your p2p lender investment seems like a great idea to me but 60 of your money in it sounds like a lot

in general a lack of endorsement meaning nothing written by the receiver on the back of the check is equivalent to it being endorsed as deposit only to a bank that the depositor has an account with see uniform commercial code 4 that is the bank that receives a deposit without any endorsement promises to the banks that process the check along the line all the way back to your bank that they properly deposited the money into the account of the entity that the check was made out to with checks being processed with more and more automation it 's getting fairly common for there to be little writing needed on the check itself as the digital copy gets submitted to the banking system for clearing if you 're concerned about there being some sort of fraud that perhaps the entity that you 're sending money to is n't the ones that should be getting it or that they 're not actually getting the money or something like that that 's really an entirely different concern i would expect that if you were saying that you paid something and the payee said that you had n't that you would dispute the transaction with your bank they should be able to follow the electronic trail to where the money went but i suspect they only do so as part of an investigation and possibly only in an investigation that involved law enforcement of some type if you 're just curious about what bank account number your deposit went into then it just looks like you 're the one trying to commit some sort of fraud even if you 're just being curious and they do n't have much incentive to try to help you out there

if i was an upside down homeowner and i went to my bank to refinance the mortgage at a lower rate and they declined i 'd give them the middle finger by not paying the mortgage and declaring bankruptcy     a homeowner has no incentive to continue paying a mortgage for a home that is no longer the value of the mortgage and if the bank is unwilling to work with the upside down homeowner to get the home owner a lower interest rate that is the least the bank could do then make the home the bank 's problem and let them eat their cake    this home owner is not asking the bank to forgive part of the mortgage or write it off but asking for his mortgage to be refinanced at the lower rate that is pretty straight forward and simple we as taxpayers bailed the banks out in 2008 the least they could do is help upside down homeowners the banks reluctance to help upside down homeowners is why we have a stagnant housing market    the bank by not working with this home owner to refinance his mortgage at a lower interest rate is a bank that indicates they do n't care about having a paying customer

afaik they use entirely different lte frequencies in japan and the us hence the issues with the new ipad being lte in the states but not here     additionally there are still japanese manufacturers who are big brands in the japanese market but more or less unheard of overseas   so there 's likely to be relatively limited scope for economies of scale regarding handsets   sure with a limited number of handsets e.g. the iphone you may be able to place a larger order but when was the last time you heard of a network operator dictating terms to apple   that 's why only softbank had the iphone at launch because they were the only one willing to cede to apple 's high pricing demands     and that 's before you even get into language related issues   as far as lte equipment goes it depends on suppliers and whether the of ordering equipment for two very different territories thousands of miles apart with very different geography will bear a lot of fruit   as for people traveling between japan and the states its such a tiny proportion of customers it would barely make a dent   and most corporate customers historically favor anyway and given japanese business culture are unlikely to change any time soon   in a nutshell the synergies may not be as strong as it first seems

the simple answer is that you have to read the terms and conditions when you sign up for a checking account at the bank the process of fraud investigation varies from bank to bank   ultimately most banks will refund the money if you are not deemed negligent some banks offer quick reimbursement during fraud claims but many will not refund the money until the investigation is complete which can take several weeks checking accounts are terrible security problems if you 're looking for ways to avoid a hassle stop writing checks and using atm debit cards if you must send checks to pay bills use the bill pay system that is now common with most banks they use a service to send checks on your behalf and do n't even charge you for postage unless you ask for processing

my recommendation is simple   rent the fact that you have to ask the question is a clear sign that you have no business buying a home that 's not to say that it 's a bad question to ask though far more important then rather it 's wise for you to buy a home is the more important question of are you emotionally ready for the responsibility and of a home   at best you are tying your self to the same number of rooms same location and same set of circumstances for the next 5 7 years in that time it will be very unlikely that you will be able to sell the house for a profit get your minor equity back or even get a second loan for any reason   you mentioned getting married soon that means the possibility of more children divorce and who knows what else   you are in an emotionally and financially time in your life now is not the right time to buy anything large instead rent and focus on improving your credit rating in 5 years time you will have a much better credit rating get much better rates and fees and have a much better handle on where you want to be with your home family situation   buying a house is not something you do on a weekend for most people it 's the culmination of years of work searching researching and preparation   often times people that buy before they are ready will end up in foreclosure and generally have a crappy next 15 years as they try to work themselves out of the issue

you say it 's expensive   i 'm going to interpret this as the monthly payments are too high basically you need to get your old loan paid off presumably by selling the car you have now   this is the tough part   if you sold the car now how much would you get for it   you can use blue book to figure out what the car is roughly worth   that 's not a guarantee that it will actually sell for that much   look in your local to see what similar cars are selling for   keep in mind that you will usually get less for your old car if you trade it in versus sell it yourself now if you owe more than your car is worth you 're in a really tight spot   if you do n't get enough money when you sell it you are still stuck with the remainder of the loan   in that case it is usually best to just stick with the car you have and be more cautious about payments and loan length the next time you finance a car penalties   most car loans do n't have any kind of early repayment penalty   however you should check your loan paperwork just to make sure

consider that the bank of course makes money on the money in your escrow it is nothing but a free loan you give the bank and the official reasons why they want it are mostly bs they want your free loan nothing else as a consequence to let you out of it they want the money they now can not make on your money upfront in form of a fee that explains the amount it is right their expected loss by letting you out unfortunately knowing this does n't change your options either way you will have to pay that money either as a one time fee or as a continuing loss of interest as others mentioned you can not calculate with 29 years as chances are the mortgage will end earlier by refinancing or sale then you are back to square one with another mandatory escrow so paying the fee is probably not a good idea if you are an interesting borrower for other banks you might be able to refinance with no escrow you can always try to negotiate this and make it a part of the contract if they want your business they might agree to that

best strategy that has worked for me is to remember first of all that you hardly ever need anything right now try this if you see something you want to buy leave it for at least two weeks better yet a month if after that time you have hardly thought about it then you almost certainly do n't need it but if you 've thought quite a lot about owning it and how it will be beneficial then perhaps it 's worth picking up you will probably find that a small percentage of things you 'd like to buy make it through that screening period

i do n't think you 're missing anything many modern trading systems actually warn you when trying to enter a market order asking if you are sure that you would n't prefer to set a limit i fully agree with you that it is usually just better to define a limit even 20 higher than just doing a market trade let me give you some examples when you still might prefer to use a market order instead of a limit but even in those two examples a wide limit order might just be the safer thing to do   so what it really comes down to is speed a market order has no other to be defined is thus entered faster and saves you a few seconds that might be crucial

typically you can chose in the transfer if you want to transfer in target currency or in source currency if you chose source currency the receiving bank for you in india does the conversion and charges the fees if you chose target currency the sending bank does the conversion and charges the fees the advantage is that they offer to generate a defined amount in the target currency so you can pay a bill exactly either way one of the two banks is going to charge you it absolutely depends on the banks which fee is higher from personal experience between europe and the us either direction mostly the receiving bank is cheaper incoming fees are set lower than outgoing i ca n't say for india you need to check with your bank

i guess it depends on what you mean by too big imo the amount of data collected aggregated and controlled by google fb ms and apple is more than a little concerning   it 's not the size of the company or specifically how much money they have that causes me worry or even the fairly obvious monopolistic like stranglehold they have on their respective markets but rather the profound influence they have on the usa and indeed the world at large   google and facebook can paint trends create forces in the markets and politics with what equate to simple or minor changes to the way their softwares interact with the us the population at large

even ignoring the match which makes it like a non deductible ira the 401k plans that i know all have a range of choices of investment   can you find one that is part of the portfolio that you want   for example do you want to own some s&p500 index fund   that must be an option   if so do the 401k and make your other investments react to it reduce the proportion of s&p500 because of that the values in the 401k are pretax so only count in asset allocation   the tax deferral is huge over time   for starters you get to invest the 30 40 you would have paid as taxes now   yes you will pay that in taxes on withdrawal but any return you generate is yours to keep   the same happens for your returns

yes many hedge funds for example did not survive 2008 2009   but hedge funds were failing both before and after that period and other hedge funds thrived   those types of funds are particularly risky because they depend so much on leverage i.e. on money that is n't actually theirs more publically visible funds like those of the big name index fund companies tended not to close because they are not leveraged   you say that a great many companies failed during the recession but that 's not actually true   i ca n't think of more than a handful of publically traded companies that went bankrupt   so since the vast majority of publically traded companies stayed in business their stocks kept some most of their value and the funds that owned those stocks stayed afloat i personally did not see a single index fund that went out of business due to the recession

options pricing is based on the gap between strike and the current market and volatility that 's why the vix a commonly accepted volatility index is actually just a weighted blend of s&p 500 future options prices   a general rise in the price of options indicates people do n't know whether it will go up or down next and are therefore less willing to take that risk   but your question is why everything underwater in the puts chain went higher and that 's simple now that apple 's down the probability of falling a few more points is higher especially since apple has gone through some recent rough times and stocks in general are seen as risky these days

reaching the debt ceiling is an admission that the us ca n't pay its bills as they come due   credit rating agencies could cut the us 's debt rating making acquisition of new debt much more difficult    creditors could file for involuntary bankruptcy forcing the government to pay back the debt which to be clear it simply is incapable of doing in any kind of reasonable timeframe   the loss of confidence in the us 's ability to pay its debts   given how the us is such a financial and economic center of the world partially by design partially by happenstance it would probably be disastrous worldwide

you are misunderstanding what makes the price of a stock go up and down every time you sell a share of a stock there is someone else that buys the stock   so it is not accurate to say that stock prices go down when large amounts of the stock are sold and up when large amounts of the stock are bought   every day the amount of shares of a stock that are bought and sold are equal to each other because in order to sell a share of stock someone has to buy it let me try to explain what actually happens to the price of a stock when you want to sell it let 's say that a particular stock is listed on the ticker at $ 100 a share currently   all this means is that the last transaction that took place was for $ 100 someone sold their share to a buyer for $ 100 now let 's say that you have a share of the stock you 'd like to sell   you are hoping to get $ 100 for your share   there are 2 other people that also have a share that they want to sell   however there is only 1 person that wants to buy a share of stock and he only wants to pay $ 99 for a share   if none of you wants to sell lower than $ 100 then no shares get sold   but if one of you agrees to sell at $ 99 then the sale takes place   the ticker value of the stock is now $ 99 instead of $ 100 now let 's say that there are 3 new people that have decided they want to buy a share of the stock   they 'd like to buy at $ 99 but you and the other person left with a share want to sell at $ 100   either one of the sellers will come down to $ 99 or one of the buyers will go up to $ 100   this process will continue until everyone that wants to sell a share has sold and everyone who wants to buy a share has bought   in general though when there are more people that want to sell than buy the price goes down and when there are more people that want to buy than sell the price goes up to answer your question if your selling of the stock had caused the price to go down it means that you would have gotten less money for your stock than if it had not gone down   likewise if your buying the stock had caused it to go up it just means that it would have cost you more to buy the stock   it is just as likely that you would lose money doing this rather than gain money

pension in this instance seems to mean pension income as opposed to pension pot this money would be determined by whatever assets are being invested in it may be fixed it may be variable completely dependant on the underlying investments an annuity is a product in simple terms you over a lump sum of cash and receive an agreed annual income until you die the underlying investment required to reach that income level is not your concern it 's the provider 's worry so there is a mount of security to the retiree in having an annuity the downside of annuities is that the level of income may be too low for your liking for instance £ would mean £ 400 for every £ 10,000 given to the provider that 's 4 and would take 25 years to break even ignoring inflation opportunity cost of investing yourself therefore the gamble is whether you outlive the deal you could hand over £ 50,000 to a provider and drop dead a year later your £ 50k got you say £ 2k and then you popped your provider wins or you could like 40 years after retiring and then you end up costing the provider £ 80k you win best way to think of an annuity is a route to guaranteed agreed income to secure that guarantee there 's a price to pay and that is a lower income rate than you might like hope that was the kind of reply you were hoping for if not edit your op and ask again chris ps the explanation on the link you provided is pretty dire very confusing use of the term pension and even if that were better the explanation is still bad due to this is much better

i thought to on user 's comment above pc financial seems to fail to calculate explicitly and then display the cashback reward return of 1 for the benefit of consumers does it want to conceal or mislead or conceal customers   anyhow i show this using this info below i 'll just calculate using the rate for everywhere you shop since many deem travel a luxury 1 20,000 pc points = $ 20 in free groceries minimum redemption is 20,000 pc points   2 earn 10 pc points for every $ 1 spent everywhere you shop earn 20 pc points for every $ 1 spent on travel services at cashback reward rate = reward expenditure i find confusing the 20,000 pc points = $ 20 because this is not the cost or expenditure i regard this as the reward   the key step is to calculate the expenditure needed to achieve this reward which again is 20,000 pc points thus we must attain 1 from 2 and must solve for in this ratio problem = $   = = = > = $ 2000 so $ 2000 must be spent to reap $ 20 as the reward altogether cashback reward = $ = 0.01 = 1 i googled this card before and i infer from this article that pc changed its cashback ratios you get five pc points for every dollar you spend on your bank card at participating stores where president ’s choice products are sold this is a bit disappointing as i can do the math in my head and determine that the pc points rewards are only worth 0.5 of your purchase amount i had expected at least 1 to compete with the top reward credit cards also the webpage in the following the cent is supposed to be a dollar pc points are worth one tenth of a cent each so if you use the minimum allowable amount of pc points of 20,000 you will get $ 20.00 worth of groceries

costco requires an annual paid membership before you can enter and the the minimum price of any purchase is greater than at other stores because you are getting large bulk of that item   starbucks charges several dollars for a cup of coffee not an essential item   in both cases their clientele are the middle classes not the less well off members of society   consequently it makes business sense for them to pay staff such that are they are substantially similar to the customers   but walmart does serve the less well off   and their management is n't stupid if they believed a doubling of wages would result in greater sales and profitability they would do it in an heartbeat   but it wo n't   and i 'll bet walmart 's customers and employees are as similar to each other as costco 's customers and employees are to each other     walmart 's effects on prices is well   every cent they save customers is a cent those customers can put towards other things or prolong how long a particular amount of money will last   there are numerous claims about them lowering the effects wal mart   so changing nothing else increasing employee wages would decrease customer savings   we could make the cost of living for employees be less by reducing the costs of housing rather than every time house prices go up   and if you believe everyone should have healthcare then ensure everyone has it   if you believe it should be provided via employers along with a bizarre insurance industry a rather peculiar then just make that mandatory in the law   and finally for all the who believe it can be done better go ahead and do so   it is always easier to advocate how and what others should do if walmart are getting it so wrong then show everyone the right way

in principle the stock price should see no change in the days leading up to an earnings announcement and then at the moment of the announcement the stock price should move in the direction of the earnings surprise relative to the market 's belief of what earnings were going to be in practice stock prices tend to drift a little in the direction of the surprise shortly before the announcement and the associated price jump this could be because smart investors were able to replicate the computations to predict the announcement or because information gets illegally leaked ahead of the announcement   so i guess your bullet point b is a likely scenario note that hedging activity in the options market will not affect stock price one way or another   options transfer risk from one party to another but net to zero   intense hedging activity may be able to push up the price of options increasing the implied volatility but it should n't affect the price of a stock one way or the other for this reason bullet point a is not the case note that price behavior after the announcement is also interesting it seems to take some time to reach the correct price instead of jumping directly to it as economists would predict    this phenomenon is known as post earnings announcement drift
# 151423
i think part of the confusion is due to the age of the term and how money has changed over time relative to being backed by precious metals vs using central banks etc historically because historically the coin itself was precious metal if a change occurred between the face value of the coin and value of the precious metal itself the holder of the coin was less affected since they have the precious metal already in hand they could always trade it based on the metal value instead of the face value otoh if you buy a note worth an the current price of ounce of gold and the price of gold goes up and then the holder wants to redeem the note they end up with less than an ounce of gold in the more modern age   the main concern is the cost to borrow funds to put money into circulation or the gain when it goes out of circulation   the big difference between the two is that bills tend stay in circulation until they wear out have to be bought back and replaced   coins on the other hand last longer but have a tendency to drop out of circulation due to collectors especially with collectible series coins that the mint seems to love to issue lately   this means that bills issued tend to stay in circulation while only a percentage of coins stays in circulation   so the net effect on the money supply is different for the two and since modern is all about the cost to put money in circulation it is different in the case of coins where some percentage will not remain circulating

in general i 'd say yeah if you can pay cash pay cash if you pay cash then by definition you pay zero interest if you get a loan you 'll pay interest most people get a loan to buy a car because they do n't have the cash possible reasons not to pay cash when you could one technically you can pay cash but if you did you would have little or no reserve for emergencies like if the car costs say $ and you have $ in your bank account then technically you could afford to pay cash but you probably should n't because you do n't want to have just $ 10 left what if tomorrow something comes up two arguably you have a place to invest money that pays more than the interest on the loan like say you can get a car loan for whatever the going rate is today say 6 and you know a place to invest your money that is very safe and almost guaranteed to pay 10 it would make sense to borrow to buy the car invest the cash and then withdraw money from the investment to make the payments on the car you 'd end up 4 ahead there are a lot of catches to that strategy though the biggest is that the more the investment pays the more likely that it is risky if you thought the investment would pay 10 but it ends up paying only 4 then you will lose money by this strategy also there 's the psychological element many people say and fully intend to invest their money but then find other things they want to buy and so spend it instead if you pay cash you 're committed

keep in mind that credit takes time to build    your best short term solution is to save enough cash to put enough of a down payment that the lower loan to value ratio outweighs the lack of credit history   if there 's enough equity to ensure that the bank will get their money back if they have to foreclose you will have a better chance of securing financing in addition the stability and consistency of your employment may also be a factor that makes it difficult for you to get a loan without a substantial down payment finally do n't ignore the risk present in resting a property that you have a loan on   make sure you have a plan in place to pay your payments if the other half goes for several months or you risk losing the entire property my advice is to rent somewhere else for enough time that you can save up a lot of cash to purchase a duplex rather than getting in a rush and doing something unwise like apply for a bunch of credit cards you do n't need

on 1 one way to make it less painful is to split your raises between yourself and your 401k that is if you get a 2 raise increase your contribution to the 401 k by 1 and keep the other 1 keep doing this until you are maxed out you wo n't miss money you never had nearly as much as money you were used to living on on 2 yes go with the roth another consideration if you are ever going to max out your 401 k it is best to do it early even if you have to cut back later than to wait take advantage of the extra investment time while you are young

not 100 related but the 1 thing you need to avoid is credit card debt trust me on this one   i 'm 31 and finally got out of credit card debt about eight months ago for just about my entire 20s i racked up credit card debt and saved zero invested zero it pains me to realize that i basically wasted ten years of possible interest and instead bought a lot of dumb things and paid 25 interest on it so yes put money into your 401k and an ira   max them out

hard to give an answer without knowing more details interest rates remaining principle on loans especially how soon the new roof is needed   maintaining the value in your home unless you are planning to walk away from it or short sell or something is of paramount importance and the cost of a leak should it happen can be substantial if the roof is a few years out and you have loans with interest rates about oh i 'd say around more then i would pay off those loans and take the money you were paying there and start putting it into a fund to pay for the roof i am also a huge fan of doing whatever you can to max out your 401 k contributions   money put into a 401 k early has a lot more value than money put in later and since you do n't pay taxes on it the cost out of your pocket is much lower eg at a 20 tax rate it costs you only $ 80 out of pocket to put $ 100 into your 401 look at that you just made like 25 return on that $ 80 paying off loans is pretty much equivalent to making a risk free return on the money equal to the interest rate on the loan   but to really make that work what you need to do is in a virtual sense keep making the loan payment just now pay it to yourself putting that money into a savings account or towards your 401 k or whatever   if you just torn around and start spending that money then you are not really getting as much value to paying off the loan early

the main villain in robin hood is the sheriff of who is referred to as a tax collector   it was most certainly a government that robin hood was stealing from   robin hood never stole money from private citizens   he did n't steal from rich shop owners or farmers etc   he stole exclusively from the local government who kept raising taxes

you seem to think that you are mostly paying interest in the first year because of the length of the loan period this is skipping a step   you are mostly paying interest in the first year because your principle the amount you owe is highest in the first year   you do pay down some principle in that first year this reduces the principle in the second year which in turn reduces the interest owed your payments stay the same so the amount you pay to principle goes up in that second year this continues year after year and eventually you owe almost no interest but are making the same payments so almost all of your payment goes to principle it is a bit like compounded interest but it is compounded principle reduction reducing your principle increases the rate you reduce it as you did n't reduce your principle until the 16th year this has zero impact on the interest you owed in the first 15 years now for actual explicit numbers   you owe 100,000 $ at 3 interest   you are paying your mortgage annually keeps it simpler and pay 5000 $ per year the first year you put 3000 $ against interest and 2000 $ against principle by year 30 you put 145 $ against interest and $ against principle   because your principle was tiny your interest was tiny

my college gym would do something similar the school took out a massive loan to build a gym then charged students automatically $ 100 for the gym on their tuition then they charged $ 10 to use it for the semester most kids do n't look at what is included in tuition so they think they are getting a good deal by just paying $ 10 per semester when in reality its $ 110

whoa whoa whoa let 's not twist that data and make an assertion that it does n't support yes medical inflation has outpaced the cpi for ages but when you spending into medicare us single payer and private insurers medicare is able to better contain my hypothesis likely due to its ability to leverage its scale and keep costs low while private insurers are fragmented against strong provider networks    but wait you 're thinking should n't market forces keep insurance outlays low it 's econ 101 right theoretically they should but this ignores the industrial structure of healthcare providers and assumes perfect competition that does n't exist typically providers doctors groups hospitals etc are highly localized and able to exercise significant market power in a relative to several insurance plans who are competing to contract that provider in network for example when aetna and go up against hypothetically to negotiate payment rates has the ability to obtain high reimbursement rates because the three insurers have to have that provider in network to remain competitive ironically the less competition on the insurer side in that market the better reimbursement rates would be observed since the sole insurer would capture a large fraction of patients in the geographic area served and could use that volume to negotiate better rates   finally there 's the overhead issue medicare has lower overhead expenses than private insurers do again my guess greater economies of scale and lower advertising and marketing costs coupled with no profit motive even health themselves agree resources pdf that medicare has lower overhead costs and that includes some questionable addition of what the authors claim are hidden medicare expenses   i 'm inclined to believe that a single payer is probably more efficient and cheaper than a fragmented private insurance market that said i also find some sympathy to the argument that maintaining a robust private insurance market may spur innovation on payor innovation e.g. increased participation in wellness programs for or increasing the likelihood that patients be more sensitive to costs and benefits when seeking care after all countries like germany and switzerland are able to maintain a private insurance market while ensuring nearly universal coverage either way though arguing that health inflation alone makes single payer systems unsustainable is n't a strong argument since private insurers are currently doing worse on cost

no they can not refuse to provide you with the current balance or a balance history the other answers point you to resources that are available to help you put pressure on the dealership the bottom line is that you now know that you have the right to the details and to audit their recording of the transactions you should now use that information and demand a better response in writing if they have to give you a response in writing they ca n't deny the answer they gave in a court of law later on they understand this and they will take you more seriously if you send a letter make sure to keep copies of the letter and send it with certified delivery

itt people who did n't read the article   this has nothing to do with battery longevity it removes a software lock that intentionally reduces the amount of battery the car will use despite shipping with the same battery pack in the longer range model

it 's all about the question 's wording here they are saying interest is 1.25 per month not per year this is why in your earlier post i encouraged you to internalize what p y and c y mean in the solver it 's best to think of things in terms of per period of i hope this helps but more practice certainly will

also keep in mind that most reits have high dividend yields if you short you are responsible for payment of the dividend to the party you are borrowing the shares from this can add costs to your position over time short reits for a long time period is not necessarily an optimal strategy
