i had experience working for a company that manufactures stuff and giving products to the employees the condition was to stay employed for a year after the gift for the company to cover its cost i think they imputed the tax otherwise they 'd add the cost to the last paycheck which they did when i left but they were straight forward about it and i signed a paper acknowledging it however in your case you did n't get a product that you could return when leaving if you did n't want to pay but rather a service the winning trip was definitely supposed to be reported as income to you last year is it okay for them to treat me differently than the others for tax purposes of course not but it may be that some strings were attached to the winning of the incentive trip for example you 're required to stay employed for x time for the company to cover the expense see my example above maybe it was buried somewhere in small letters can they do this a year after the trip was won and redeemed as i said in this case this sounds shady since it is a service which you can not return you should have been taxed on it when receiving it would the irs want to know about this fuzzy business trip practice how would i report it   here 's how you can let them know besides now understanding the new level of slime from my former    employer is there anything else i should be worried about could they    do something like this every year just to be annoying no once they issued the last paycheck you 're done with them they can not issue you more paychecks after you 're no longer an employee in most us states you are supposed to receive the last paycheck on your last day of work or in very close proximity matter of weeks at most

since you are going to be experiencing a liquidity crisis that even owning physical gold would n't solve may i suggest bitcoins you will still be liquid and people anywhere will be able to trade it this is different from precious metals whereas even if you invested in gold you would waste considerable resources on storage security and actually making it divisible for trade you would be illiquid do note that the bitcoin currency is currently more volatile than a greek government bond

in steady state the refrigerator only has to pump out the heat that has leaked in from outside   the amount of heat leaked is related to the difference between interior and exterior temperatures and the overall insulation quality   thus a refrigerator full of cold food uses the same amount of energy as a refrigerator full of cold air    in practice people open the door take cold food out put warm food in and the unit may also make ice dispense cold water and itself   aside from tweaking those uses e.g. minimizing time with the door open a useful trick is to use empty milk cartons or similar containers to fill up unused space   this helps by reducing the amount of cold air that escapes when the door is opened and the air in the cartons has low thermal mass so it cools down rapidly   when you need the space you can remove the cartons and set them aside similarly water filled cartons may be used as a sort of thermal leveling out the temperature fluctuations within the refrigerator particularly if the electric utilities are erratic   however they increase the cost of when cooling the water in the first place and when you eventually dump out the water the expense of cooling it goes down the drain

there is more than one exchange where stock can be traded    for example there is the new york stock exchange and the london stock exchange   in fact if you look at all the exchanges there is essentially continuous trading 24/7 for many financial instruments eg us government bonds the closing price quoted in papers is usually the price at the close on the nyse   however options close after that and so there is after the close trading in many stocks with active options so the price at the close of options trading at cboe is often used the real price is always changing   but for the purpose of discussion using the closing price in nyse for nyse listed stocks is pretty standard and unlikely to be questioned   likewise using bloomberg 's price makes sense using some after hours or small market quote could lead to differences with commonly accepted numbers until tomorrow

first i would like to say do not pay credit card companies in an attempt to improve your credit rating in my opinion it 's not worth the cash and not fair for the consumer there are many great resources online that give advice on how to improve your credit score you can even simulate what would happen to your score if you did this credit karma will give you your transunion credit score for free and offers a simulation calculator if you only have one credit card i would start off by applying for another simply because   $ 700 is such a small limit and to pay a $ 30 annual fee seems outrageous try applying with the bank where you hold your savings or checking account they are more likely to approve your application since they have a working relationship with you all in all i would not go out of my way and spend money i would not have spent otherwise just to increase my credit score to me this practice is counter intuitive you are allowed a free credit report from each bureau once annually you can get this from this wo n't include your credit score but it will let you see what banks see when they run your credit report in addition you should check it over for any errors or possible identity theft if there are errors you need to file a claim with the credit agency immediately edit from with 3 agencies to choose from you can alternate during the year to pull a different report every 4 months a couple every 2 here are some resources you can read up on improve your fico credit score top 5 credit misconceptions   9 fast fixes for your credit scores

the only real competition i see in the us market is in the pre paid service providers   but they are just off the networks of the larger carriers   to have an actual functioning market they would have to be some legal framework that requires all carriers to share their networks at some reasonable fee rate and then put value added on top of that   that is pretty much how the pots worked   we recognized that as a nation it is plainly ridiculous to compete on who can hang the most wires   we lost that lesson and now we 're letting carriers compete almost purely on who can erect the most towers   at&amp;t and verizon are essentially the same company offering the same service   the entire basis of their competition is who can get the most right of way access to install the most towers   it 's crazy

the short answer to your question is yes   company performance affects stock price only through investors views but note that selling for higher and lower prices when the company is doing well or poorly is not an arbitrary choice   a stock is a claim on the future cash flows of the firm which ultimately come from its future profits   if the company is doing well investors will likely expect that there will large cash flows dividends in the future and be willing to pay more to hold it or require more to sell it    the price of a stock is equal what people think the future dividends are worth   if market participants started behaving irrationally like not reacting to changes in the expected future cash flows then arbitrageurs would make a ton of money trading against them until the situation was

some have suggested you can put the money in the 401k then take a loan to pay off the student loan debt   some things to consider before doing that check your 401k plan first   some plans allow you to continue paying on a loan if you leave the company some do not   if you have to change jobs before you pay back the 401k loan you may only have 90 days to completely pay the loan or the irs will treat this as an early withdrawal which means taxes and penalties   if you do n't have another job lined up this is going to make things much worse since you will have lost your income and may owe even more to the government depending on your state it may be up to 50 of the remaining amount   there are ways to work with some student debt loans to defer or adjust payments   there is no such option with a 401k plan this may change your taxes at the end of the year   most people can deduct student loan interest payments   you can not deduct interest paid to your 401k loan   you are paying the interest to yourself though    it may hurt your long term growth potential   currently loans on 401k loans are in the 4 range   if you are able to make more than 4 inside of your 401k you will be losing out on that growth since that money will only be earning the interest you pay back it may limit flexibility for a few years   when people fall on hard times their 401k is their last resort   some plans have a limit on the number of loans you can have at one time   you may need a loan or a withdrawal in the future   once you take the money out for a loan you ca n't access it again   see the first bullet about working with student loan vendors they typically have ways to work with you under hard circumstances   401k loans do n't amortization schedule   many 401k loans can only be amortized for a max of 5 years if you currently have 10 year loans can you afford to pay the same debt back in 1/2 the time at a lower rate   you will have to do the math when considering debt other than student loans such as credit cards if you fall on hard times you can always negotiate to reduce the amount you owe or the debt can be discharged with tax penalties of course   they ca n't make you take money out   once it is out it is fair game just to clarify the above is n't saying you should n't do it under any circumstances it is a few things you need to evaluate before making that choice   the 401k is supposed to be used to help secure your financial future when you ca n't work   the numbers may work out in the short term but do they still work out in the long term   most credit cards require minimum payments high enough to pay back in 7 10 years so does shortening that to 5 or less make up for the probably early years of compounding interest for your retirement   i think others have addressed some of this so i wo n't do the math i can tell you that i have a 401k loan and when things got iffy at my job for it was a very bad feeling to have that over my head because unlike other debts there is n't much you can do about it

i am not going to argue the merits of investing in real estate i am a fan i think it is a great idea when done right   i will assume you have done your due diligence and your numbers are correct so let 's go through your questions point by point what would be the type of taxes i should expect   none you are a real estate investor and the us government loves you everything is tax deductible and odds are your investment properties will actually manage to shelter some of your job income and you will pay less taxes on that too   obviously i am exaggerating slightly find a cpa certified public accountant that is familiar with real estate but here are a few examples i am not a tax professional but hopefully this gives you an idea of what sort of tax you can expect    how is insurance cost calculated   best advice i have call a few insurance firms and ask them   you will need landlord insurance make sure you are covered if a tenant gets hurt or burns down your property you can expect to pay more for landlord insurance than regular insurance is not a bad number to just plug in when running numbers its probably high   also your lease should require tenants to have renters insurance to help protect you have a liability conversation with a lawyer and think about llcs    how is the house price increase going to act as another source of income   appreciation can be another source of income but it is not really that useful in your scenario   it is not liquid you will not realize it until you sell the property and then you have to pay capital gains and depreciation recapture on it   there are methods to get access to the gains on the property without paying taxes   this is done by leveraging the property you get the equity but it is not counted as capital gains since you have to pay it back a mortgage or home equity lines of credit heloc are examples of this   i am not recommending these just making sure you are aware of your options please let me know if i am calculating anything wrong but my projection for one year is about $ per house assuming no maintenance is needed i would say you estimated profit is on the high side   not being involved in your market it will be a wild guess but i would expect you to realize cash flow per house per year of closer to $ 7,000   maybe even lower given your inexperience   some costs you need to remember to account for taxes insurance vacancy repairs capex property management utilities lawn care snow removal hoa fees all in all expect 50 or your rental income to be spent on the property   if you do well you can be surprised

insurance is bought for peace of mind and to divert disaster    diverting disaster is a good great thing   if your house burned down if someone hit your car or some other devastating event think medical happened that required a more allocation than you could afford the series of issues may snowball and cause you to lose a far greater amount of money than the initial incident   this could be in the form of losing work time losing a job having to buy transportation quickly paying a premium having to incur high rate debt and so on    for the middle income and lower classes medical house and medical insurance certainly falls into these categories   also why a lot of states have buyout options on auto insurance some will let you drive without insurance by proving bonding up to 250k.    now the other insurance as i have alluded to is for peace of mind mainly   this is your laptop insurance vacation insurance and so on   the premise of these insurances is that no matter what happens you can get back to even by paying just a little extra    however what other answers have failed to clarify is the idea of insurance   it is an agreement that you will pay a company money right now   and then if a certain set of events happen you follow their guidelines they are still in business they still have the same protocols and so on that you will get some benefit when something happens to you   we buy insurance because we think we can snap our fingers and life will be back to normal   for bigger things like medical home and auto there are more regulations but i could get 1000 comments on people getting screwed over by their insurance companies   for smaller things almost all insurance is outsourced to a 3rd party not affiliated legally with a business   therefore if the costs are too high they can simply go under and if the costs are low they continue helping the consumer that does n't need help    so we buy insurance divert catastrophe or because we have fallen for the insurance sales pitch   and an easy way to get around the sales pitch as the person selling you the insurance if you can have their name and info and they will be personally liable if the insurance company fails their end of the bargain

my general rule of thumb with start ups is do n't quit your day job until you can afford to quit your day job if you were a single man or your wife also could provide income for the family then you would have more flexibility but if you are the single income provider i suggest a more cautious route it may be frustrating to deal with the of work but if you really want to see that start up i would suggest getting started to work on it with what you can while working at your other job until you have enough money saved and enough work done that you can fully launch the start up full time it will be a lot of work so would a start up but it is less risky especially considering your family situation if you really hate what you are doing i would suggest looking for other opportunities in your field of work maybe there is something that you have overlooked and do n't hesitate to apply for jobs you are not sure if you are qualified as long as it does n't involve time away from your current job an application is fairly painless and the worst case is you keep doing what you are still doing

the other two answers seem basically correct but i wanted to add on thing   while you can exercise an american style option at any time it 's almost never smart to do so before expiration   in your example when the underlying stock reaches $ 110 you can theoretically make $ 2/share by exercising your option buying 100 shares $ and immediately selling those 100 shares back to the market at $   this is all before commission in more detail you 'll have these practical issues you are going to have to pay commissions which means you 'll need a bigger spread to make this worthwhile   you and those who have already answered have you finger on this part but i include it for completeness even at expiration if the difference between the last close price and the strike price is pretty close some in the money options will be allowed to expire unexercised when the holders ca n't cover the closing commission costs the market value of the option contract itself should also go up as the price of the underlying stock goes up   unless it 's very close to expiration the option contract should have some time value in its market price so if you want to close your position at this point earlier then expiration it will probably be better for you to sell the contract back to the market for more money and only one commission than to exercise and then close the stock position for less money and two commissions if you want to exercise and then flip the stock back as your exit strategy you need to be aware of the settlement times   you probably are not going to instantly have those 100 shares of stock credited to your account so you may not be able to sell them right away which could leave you subject to some risk of the price changing   alternatively you could sell the stock short to lock in the price but you 'll have to be sure that your brokerage account is set up to allow that and understand how to do this

you 're certainly still responsible to pay what you owe the company given that 1 for whatever reason the recipient never received the checks and 2 the money was credited back to you albeit in a less than timely manner however if you take the time to explain the situation to the business and show them proof that you sent the payments i would guess they would probably be willing to work with you on removing any late fees you have been assessed or possibly setting up a payment plan also if you have been charged any overdraft or minimum balance fees by your bank while they held your money for the payments that was eventually credited back to your account you might be able to get them to refund those if you explain what has happened this is really a perfect example though of why balancing your checking account is as important today as it ever was

there are several ways to minimize the international wire transfer fees transfer less frequently and larger amounts the fees are usually flat so transferring larger amounts lowers the fee percentage 3 is a lot in big banks receiving is usually if you transfer $ 1000 at a time its 1.5 if you transfer $ 10000 it 's much less accordingly if you have the time have them send you checks in us dollars instead of wire transferring it will be on hold for some time up to a couple of weeks maybe but will be totally free for you i know that many banks have either free send and/or receive i know that etrade provides this service for free my credit union provides if for free based on the relationship level i have a mortgage with them now so i do n't pay any fees at all including for wire transfer consider other options like western union those may cost more for the sender not necessarily though but will be free for the receiver you can get the money in cash or checks which you can just deposit on your regular bank account for smaller amounts it should be much cheaper than wire transfer for example sending $ 500 to india costs $ 10 while wire transfer is $ 30

i opened several free checking accounts at a local credit union   one is a deposit account where all of my new money goes   i get paid every two weeks   every other sunday we have our money day where we allocate the money from our deposit account into our other checking accounts   i have one designated as a bills account where all of my bills get paid automatically via bill pay or auto pay i created a spreadsheet that calculates how much to save each money day for all of my upcoming bills   this makes it so the amount i save for my bills is essentially equal   then i allocate the rest of my deposit money into my other checking accounts   i have a grocery household and main checking accounts but you could use any combination that you want when we 're at the store we check our balances how much we have left to spend on our mobile app   we ca n't overspend this way   the key is to make sure you 're using your pin when you use your debit card   this way it shows up in real time with your credit union and you 've got an accurate balance   this has worked really well to coordinate spending between me and my wife   it sounds like it 's a lot of work but it 's actually really automated   the best part is that i do n't have to do any accounting which means my budget does n't fail if i 'm not entering my transactions or categorizing them i 'm happy to share my spreadsheet if you 'd like

is n't this really the same as the adoption curve for any new personal technology though it starts off being the sole province of a handful of fairly well off nerds who do n't mind wasting their time on something that may end up being a technological dead end then becomes a high end rich person 's thing once it 's proven useful or enjoyable then as the market expands it gets cheap enough to benefit everyone   think of it from the point of view of the people or companies producing the enhancements production will get cheaper over time possibly going close to zero if the enhancements are stuff like and there 's usually way more money to be made in high volume sales than in boutique products if the costs of production are low   i think the history of technology over the past century says it 's pretty likely these kinds of enhancements will go down in price enough to be affordable by millions before the kinds of social problems you 're talking about have time to emerge rich people and enhancement hackers will always be at the far end of the curve but they wo n't be alone on the curve and anyway someone has to be trying out the new stuff before it 's ready for mass consumption

oracle specifically is paying a dividend with a current yield of about 1.4 annually and has appreciated nearly 50 over the last 5 years   granted the past does n't guarantee the future but the company has paid a pretty steady dividend since 2009   if you 're buying as part of an employee program you would presumably be holding the shares for a long time and the daily and even monthly movements are n't terribly relevant to a long term holding period additionally you may be able to buy the shares at a discount to the market price as part of your employee program   you probably also wo n't pay any transaction fee

cash flow is needed for expansion either to increase manufacturing capacity or to expand the workforce other times companies use it to purchase other companies microsoft and google have both used their cash or stocks to purchase companies examples by google include youtube google earth and now part of motorola to expand into phones if you are investing for the future you do n't want a lot of dividends they do bring tax issues that is not a big problem if you are investing in an ira or 401k. it is an issue if the non tax mutual fund distributes those dividends via the 1099 forcing you to address it on your taxes each year some investors do like dividends but they are looking for their investments to generate cash who would require it would it be an sec requirement even more government paperwork for companies

stop loss orders are the exact opposite of what you should be doing if you are implementing a long term buy and hold strategy the motivation of a buy and hold strategy is that in the long term the market rises even despite the occasional crash or recession setting a stop loss simply increases the probability that you will sell for a low price in a temporary market downturn unless you are likely to need near term liquidity in which case you 're not a long term investor that makes no sense

it might be best to step back and look at the core information first   you 're evaluating an llc vs a corporation both corporate entities   both have one or more members and both are seen similarly emphasis on similar here they 're not all the same to the irs   specifically llc 's can opt for a pass through tax system basically seen by the irs the same way an s corp is put another way you can be taxed as a corporate entity or it 's p l statements can flow through to your personal taxes   when you opt for a flow through the business files and you get a separate schedule to tie into your taxes   you should also look at filing a business expense schedule schedule c on your taxes to claim legitimate business expenses good reference point here while there are several differences see this and this and this between these entities the best determination on which structure is best for you is usually if you have full time employ while you 're running the business   s corps limit shares shareholders and some deductions but taxes are only paid by the shareholders   c corps have employees no restrictions on types or number of stock and no restrictions on the number of shareholders   however this means you would become an employee of your business you have to draw monies from somewhere and would be subject to paying taxes on your income both as an individual and as a business employment taxes such as social security medicare etc from the broad view of the irs in most cases an llc and a corp are the same type of entity tax wise   in fact most of the differences between llcs and corps occur in how profits losses are distributed between members llcs are arbitrary to a point and corps base this on shares back to your question imho you should opt for an llc   this allows you to work out a partnership with your co worker and allows you to disburse funds in a more flexible manner   from wikipedia a limited liability company with multiple members that to be taxed as partnership may specially allocate the members share of income gain loss deduction or credit via the company operating agreement on a basis other than the ownership percentage of each member so long as the rules contained in treasury regulation 26 cfr 1 are met s corporations may not specially allocate profits losses and other tax items under us tax law hope this helps please do let me know if you have further questions   as always this is not legal or tax advice just what i 've learned in setting several llcs and corporate structures up over the years edit as far as your formulas go the tax rate will be based upon your personal income for any pass through entity   this means that the same monies earned from and llc or an s corp with the same expenses and the same pass through options will be taxed the same more reading llc and the law google group

okay i went through a similar situation when my mother died in march of this year the estate still needs to go into probate especially if there was a will and when you do this your husband will be named as the executor then what he will need to do is produce both of their death certificates to the bank have the account closed and open an estate account with both of their names on it their debts anything like this should be paid from this account as well then what you can do is endorse the check as the executor and deposit it into this account after all debts are paid the money can be disbursed to the beneficiaries your husband basically as long as they did n't have any huge debts to pay he will see the money again it just may be a couple of months and you will have to pay some filing fees

gt it 's often the minimum wage employees that i see abused the worst they are easily replaceable by their employer and punishment for violating workers rights is a slap on the wrist     yeah this is a good point   i think the experience skews significantly as you go down the skill level prestige of the job   an interesting observation maybe would be that this mostly applies to people who are only just above minimum wage such as walmart employees   they get paid enough that it would be hard to find another retail job at the same pay level   but certainly not enough to be considered well off   true minimum wage earners who i 've known typically do n't give even the smallest shit about their employer   they switch employers in the blink of an eye and at the slightest   minimum wage jobs are as much a commodity for the employees as minimum wage employees are to the company    gt a lot of this was to get over a peak of work however now i have been granted some flexibility    well said   my situation is very similar   the company communicates their needs to me and so i 'm well aware of when peaks are likely to occur and of the consequences of missing deadlines etc   it rarely comes as a surprise

you need a good erp or at least ii implementation which means you need someone very familiar with or someone who becomes very familiar with your business to get it done right   those do n't come setup for some unique business as an off the shelf thing and while many are customizable you can easily end up in customization hell both dollar wise operation interruption wise and technical wiki   but this really begs for someone to ask why are you not maintaining amp updating your existing custom software   why attempt to ditch something that is hopefully working fairly well for the highly risky prospect of some entirely new untested system     is the business logic and the operation of the old system working well   while it might seem to be costly in terms of time amp money your best bet in my experience would be to get a really good programmer possibly with a cheap assistant temp helper to do some grunt work for him to document maintain and then slowly upgrade your current already in place software and/or rewrite it to use modern db 's web interfaces etc    because changing out your system is like replacing all the and in your body it will not be a pleasant experience and the patient may not survive the operation even if the implementation is a labeled a success the business is littered with the of erp victims   the big dogs have three huge upfront cost areas 1 the consultants in various teams stages 2 the underlying database software costs initial licenses 3 the ongoing licenses 4 the ongoing customization fixes if you ever want to upgrade alas most of the consultants who do customizations do n't do document it in a way that facilitates easy upgrades in part because that would significantly reduce their income

i believe the answer here is no sipc protection of customers with multiple accounts is determined by separate capacity each separate capacity is protected up to $ 500,000 for securities and cash including a $ 250,000 limit for cash only accounts held in the same capacity are combined for purposes of the sipc protection limits so even having 2 individual accounts you would only be covered for $ you can see more about the type of accounts that would give your more coverage here also note if you own a stock the record probably exist   therefore you would not lose your ownership or shares   the sipc is there to protect the times this does not happen

you also may want to consider how this interacts with the stepped up basis of estates   if you never sell the stock and it passes to your heirs with your estate under current tax law the basis will increase from the purchase price to the market price at the time of transfer    in a comment you proposed    thinking more deeply though i am a little skeptical that it 's a free lunch say i buy stock a a computer manufacturer at $ 100 which i intend to hold long term it ends up falling to $ 80 and the robo advisor sells it for tax loss harvesting buying stock b a similar computer manufacturer as a replacement so i benefit from realizing those losses however say both stocks then rise by 50 over 3 years at this point selling b gives me more capital gains tax than if i had held a through the losses since a 's rise from 80 back to 100 would have been free for me since i purchased at 100 and then later thought   although thinking even more sorry thinking out loud here i guess i still come out ahead on taxes since i was able to deduct the $ 20 loss on a against ordinary income and while i pay extra capital gains on b that 's a lower tax rate so the free lunch is $ of tax bracket capital gains rates that 's true   and in addition to that if you never sell b which continues to rise to $ 200 was last at $ 120 after a 50 increase from $ 80 the basis steps up to $ 200 on transfer to your heirs    of course your estate may have to pay a 40 tax on the $ 200 before transferring the shares to your heirs   so this is n't exactly a free lunch either   but you have to pay that 40 tax regardless of the form in which the money is held   cash real estate stocks whatever   whether you have a large or small capital gain on the stock is irrelevant to the estate tax    this type of planning may not matter to you personally but it is another aspect of what wealth management can impact

i think this has been clearly explained to you already   i agree with others that you are hating on tesla because you need to hate someone and it 's been all of five minutes since you last   but in case that 's not the case and you really just do n't understand let me try and explain it   the batteries are exactly the same yes   the difference between them is one is limited by software and the other is not   there are trade offs to each choice   limiting the battery to 20 of it 's means you can recharge to full every day and do little to no harm to your battery   you will of course have a limited range   with the unlocked you 75kwh battery you get more range   now tesla warns you not to charge beyond 90 of the battery capacity or you begin to damage the battery   however you get more range   let 's also be clear here   the battery packs limited to 60kwh have a reduced price of 8500 for the vehicle   if you want to upgrade you pay the 8500 difference but you are also woke for tax rebates and incentives which make the upgrade cheaper   the short the 60kwh version is cheaper you 'll get a longer life out of your battery and if you decide to unlock the full battery capacity there are tax incentives making it cheaper in the long run   finally your reference to this being a pay to win business model could n't be more wrong   from just what i 've said here you 're wrong   this gets more cars into people 's garage 's and driveways as well as simplifies production reducing production costs   it also provides more options to the consumer at a reasonable price   source

keep in mind that you need to have a cash reserve   blindly applying all stray cash to debt reduction is a bad idea   your lenders do not care about your balance   all they care about is your next payment   it is therefore imperative that you have a cash reserve that can carry these payments for several months   having zero cash reserves puts you at high risk for such simple things as the payroll clerk at work missing the monthly deposit rare but it happens i 've also been in situations where a major client had a cash flow issue and delayed payment and our company had to borrow to meet payroll that month   fortunately we were in good standing with the bank and had low debt but it could have been catastrophic for any employees living paycheque to paycheque

you can spend the money quite quickly the problem is that if there is something wrong with the check the bank will ask you for the money back if the check is from a trusted source a trusted friend a business with good reputation etc that 's fine if the money is from an source make sure that having to pay back the money does n't get you into trouble since most people are honest this is fine for a small amount but if it 's more than you can afford to pay back do n't spend it   a simple scam is that people send you checks by mistake the check is for the wrong amount say $ instead of $ 190 and they ask you to send the difference back so you put $ into your account send them $ 720 and six weeks later your bank asks for their $ back if someone pays you too much on a check and asks you to pay them the difference you know it is a scam

this effect has much empirical evidence as googling dividend price effect evidence will show as the financial economic schools of thought run the so do the theories   one school goes as far to call it a market inefficiency since the earning power thus the value of an equity that 's affected is no different or at least not riskier by the percentage of market capitalization paid most papers offer that by the efficient market hypothesis and arbitrage theory the value of an equity is known by the market at any point in time given by its price so if an equity pays a dividend the adjusted price would be efficient since the holder receives no excess of the price instantly before payment as after including the dividend since that dividend information was already discounted so would otherwise produce an arbitrage

at an income of $ 95 k you are on the edge of qualify for $ 500,000 mortgage once you have a down payment    yes the fastest way to qualify for a $ 500,000 condo is to save for a down payment   i am suggesting that might not be the best long term financial plan   you are only going to qualify for a 30 year term   you still have a student loan where interest is not tax deductible    you have put you yourself in a long term debt position and if you lose your job a potential cash flow problem with a risk of losing the condo    since you are living at home i would go after that student debt   looks like you could pay it off in like a year   i do n't know prices in you area but maybe go in at less than $ 500,000 for your first home

of course the situation for each student will vary widely so you 'll have to dig deep on your own to know what is the best choice for your situation now that the disclaimer is out of the way the best choice would be to use the unsubsidized stafford loan to finance graduate school if you need to resort to loans the major benefits to the unsubsidized stafford are the following you 'll be forced to consider other loan types due to the unsubsidized stafford loan 's established limits on how much you can borrow per year and in aggregate the borrowing limits are also adjustable down by your institution the plus loan is a fallback loan program designed to be your last resort the program was created as a way for parents to borrow money for their college attending children when all other forms of financing have been exhausted as a result you have the following major disadvantages to using the plus loan you do have the bonus of being able to borrow up to 100 of your educational costs without any limits per year or in aggregate the major benefit of keeping your loans in the direct loan program is predictability many private student loans are variable interest rate loans which can result in higher payments during the course of the loan private loans are also not eligible for government loan forgiveness programs such as for working in a non profit for 10 years

for 3x it 's about 114 and for 4x 144 which naturally is twice 72   these are close back of napkin results with smart phone apps offering scientific calculators you should get comfortable just taking the root of a number for a more precise answer   update in response to brick 's comment the rule of 72 says that to double your money it answers both questions how much time do i need given a rate and how much return do i need given a time   logic tells me that if 72 is the number to double 144 is the but i 'm a math guy and my logic might not be logical to op so   let 's take the 20th root of 4    this is the key to use 4 hit key 20 equals the result is or and this is the precise rate you 'd need to quadruple your money in 20 years now 20 = which rounds to 144 rule of 144 to quadruple your money   this now answers op 's question how to derive a rule of x for a return other than doubling   one more example i want 10x my money of course i need the initial guess to enter one calculation people like 8 in general it 's a bit below the 10 long term s&p return and a good round number the rule of 72 says 9 years to double so 18 years is 4x and 36 years is for my initial calculation i 'll use 40 years the root of 10 i get again the precise rate that gives 10 fold over 40 years and multiplying this by 40 i get a rule of 237 which i 'm tempted to round to 240   at 6 yrs   1.06 ^ = 9.99 at 6 yrs   1.06 ^ = you can see that you lose some accuracy for the sake of a number that 's easier to remember and manipulate 72 to double is pretty darn accurate so i 'll stick with rule of 237 to get 10x my money    to close the purpose of these rules is to create the tool that lets you perform some otherwise tough calculations away from any electronic device of course i know how to use logs and in real life i 'm paid to explain them to students who are typically glad when that chapter is over i 've shown above how the rule of x can be formulated with a power root key which for most people is simpler ironically log calculations as offered force a continuous compounding which may not be desired at all it would give a result of 230 for my 10x return example and the following using the first equation he offered at 6 yrs   1.06 ^ = which is further away from the desired 10x than my 237 or rounded 240

so there is no truly correct way to calculate return   professionals will often calculate many different rates of return depending on what they wish to understand about their portfolio   however the two most common ways of calculating multi period return though are time weighted return and money weighted return i 'll leave the details to this good article but the big picture is time weighted returns help you understand how the stock performed during the period in question independent of how you invested it it   whereas money weighted return helps you understand how you performed investing in the stock in question   from your question it appears both methods would be useful in combination to help you evaluate your portfolio both methods should be fairly easy to calculate yourself in a spread sheet but if you are interested there are plenty of examples of both in google docs on the web

all for us yes you will have a realized long term capital gain which is taxable long term gains including those distributed by a mutual fund or other and also qualified dividends both not relevant here are taxed at lower rates than ordinary income but are still almost not quite like ordinary income not always 15 specifically if your ordinary taxable income after deductions and exemptions equivalent to line 43 minus ltcg ends in the 25 to 33 brackets your ltcg income is taxed at 15 unless the total of reaches the top of those brackets then any remainder at 20 these brackets depend on your filing status and are adjusted yearly for inflation for 2016 they are single 37,650 to married joint or to head of household to special married separate 37,650 to which i 'd guess covers at least the middle three quintiles of the earning population   otoh if your ordinary income ends below the 25 bracket your ltcg income that fits in the lower is taxed at 0 not at all and only the portion that would be in the ordinary up brackets is taxed at 15 if your ordinary taxable income this year was below those brackets or you expect next year it will be possibly due to status exemption deduction changes as well as income change then if all else is equal you are better off realizing the stock gain in the where some or more of it fits in the 0 bracket if you 're over about $ 400k a similar calculation applies but you can afford more reliable advice than potential dogs on the internet update near dupe found see also how are long term capital gains taxed if the gain pushes income into a new tax bracket   also a warning on estimated payments in general you are required to pay most of your income tax liability during the year not wait until april 15 if you underpay by more than 10 or $ 1000 whichever is larger you usually owe a penalty computed on form 2210 whose name is frequently and for most people whose income is mostly from a job this is handled by payroll withholding which normally comes out close enough to your liability if you have other income like investments as here or self employment or pension retirement disability etc you are supposed to either make estimated payments each quarter the irs quarters are shifted slightly from everyone else 's or increase your withholding or a combination for a large income lump in december that was n't planned in advance it wo n't be practical to adjust withholding however if this is the only year increased there is a safe harbor if your withholding this year 2016 is enough to pay last year 's tax 2015 which for most people it is unless you got a pay cut this year or a filed status change like or having a child you get until next april 15 or next business day in 2017 it is actually april 18 to pay the additional amount of this year 's tax 2016 without underpayment penalty however if you split the gain so that both 2016 and 2017 have income and thus taxes higher than normal for you you will need to make estimated payment(s and/or increase withholding for 2017 ps congratulations on your gain and on the patience to hold anything for 10 years

if a country had a genuine completely flat income tax system then it would n't matter who paid the tax since it does n't depend on the employee 's other income since not many countries run this it does n't really make sense for the employee to take the burden of the tax as opposed to merely doing the administration and paying the probable amount of tax at payroll leaving the employee to use their personal tax calculation to correct the payment if necessary your prospective employer is probably saying that your tax calculation in singapore is so simple they can do it for you they may or may not need to know a lot of information about you in order to do this calculation depending what the singapore tax authorities say if you 're not a singapore national they may or may not be relying on bilateral tax agreements with your country to assert that you wo n't have to pay any further tax on the income in your own country it 's possible they 're merely asserting that you wo n't owe anything else in singapore and in fact you will have taxes to report even if it 's just reporting to your home tax authority that you 've already paid the tax still for a foreign worker a guarantee you wo n't have to deal with the local tax authority is a good thing to have even if that 's all it is since there does n't appear to be any specific allowance for tax free money in the singapore tax system it looks like what you have here is just the employer agreeing to do something that will normally result in the correct tax being paid in your behalf this is n't uncommon but it 's also not exactly what you asked for and in particular if you have two jobs in singapore then they ca n't both be doing this since tax is not flat the example calculation includes varying tax rates for the first x amount of income that i assume without checking are per person not per employment joe 's answer has the link in practice in the uk for example there are plenty of uk nationals working in the uk who do n't need to do a full tax return and whose tax is collected entirely at source between paye and deductions on bank interest and in this sense the employer is required by law to take the responsibility for doing the admin and making the tax payments to hmrc note that a uk employer does n't need to know your circumstances in detail to make the correct payroll deductions all they need is a so called tax code which is calculated by hmrc and communicated to the employer and which basically how much they can pay you at zero rate before the various tax rate tiers kick in that 's all the employer needs to know here for the typical employee they do n't need to know precisely what credits and liabilities resulted in the figure however these employers still do n't offer a net salary that is they do n't take on the tax burden because different employees will have different tax codes which the employer would in effect be cancelling out by offering to pay two people the same net salary regardless of their individual circumstances the indications seem to be that the same applies in singapore this offer is really a net salary subject to certain assumptions the main one being that you have no other tax liabilities in singapore if you 're a singapore millionaire taking that job for fun you might find that the employer doesn't can't take on your non standard tax liability on this marginal income

if you have an s corp with several shareholders you probably also have a tax adviser who suggested using s corp to begin with   you 're probably best off asking that adviser about this issue if you decided to use s corp for multiple shareholders without a professional guiding you you should probably start looking for such a professional or you may get yourself into trouble that said and reminding you that 1 free advice on the internet is worth exactly what you paid for it and 2 i 'm not a tax professional or tax adviser you should talk to a ea cpa licensed in your state here 's this generally s corps are disregarded entities for tax purposes and their income flows to their shareholders individual tax returns through k-1 forms distributed by the s corp yearly the shareholders do n't have to actually withdraw the profits but if not withdrawing they 're added to their cost bases in the shares i 'm guessing your corp does n't distribute the net income but keeps it on the corporate account only distributing enough to cover the shareholders taxes on their respective income portion in this case the amount not distributed is added to their basis the amount distributed has already been taxed through k-1 if the corporation distributes more than the shareholder 's portion of net income then there can be several different choices depending on the circumstances the extra distribution will be treated as salary to the shareholder and a deduction to the corporation i.e. increasing the net income for the rest of the shareholders the extra distribution will be treated as return of investment reducing that shareholder 's basis in the shares but not affecting the other shareholders if the basis is 0 then it is treated as income to the shareholder and taxed at ordinary rates the extra distribution will be treated as buy back reducing that shareholder 's ownership stake in the company and reallocating the bought back portion among the rest of the shareholders in this case it is treated as a sale of stock and the gain is calculated as with any other stock sale including short term vs. long term taxation there 's also sec that can come in handy here the extra distribution will be treated as dividend this is very rare for s corp but can happen if it was a c corp before in that case it will be taxed as dividends note that options 2 3 and 4 subject the shareholder to the while option 1 subjects the shareholder to fica self employment tax and subjects the company to payroll taxes there might be other options your licensed tax adviser will go with you through all the facts and circumstances and will suggest the best way to proceed

first of all i am sorry for your loss at this time worrying about money is probably the least of your concerns it might be tempting to try to pay off all your debts at once and while that would be satisfying it would be a poor investment of your inheritance when you have debt you have to think about how much that debt is costing you to keep open since you have on your student loan it does not make sense to pay any more than the minimum payments you may want to look into getting a personal loan to pay off your other personal debts the interest rates for a loan will probably be much less than what you are paying currently this will allow you to put a payment plan together that is affordable you can also use your inheritance as collateral for the loan getting a loan will most likely give you a better credit rating as well you may also be tempted to get a brand new sports car but that would also not be a good idea at all you should shop for a vehicle based on your current income and not your savings i believe you can get the same rates for an auto loan for a car up to 3 years old as a brand new car it would be worth your while to shop for a quality used car from a reputable dealer if it is a certified used car you can usually carry the rest of the new car warranty the biggest return on investment you have now is your employer sponsored 401(k account find out how long it takes for you to become fully vested being vested means that you can leave your job and keep all of your employer contributions if possible max out or at least contribute as much as you can afford to that fund to get employee matching you should also stick with your job until you become fully vested the money you have in retirement accounts does you no good when you are young there is a significant penalty for early withdrawal and that age is currently 59 1/2 doing the math it would be around when you would be able to have access to that money you should hold onto a certain amount of your money and keep it in a higher interest rate savings account or a money market account you say that your living situation will change in the next year as well take full advantage of living as cheaply as you can do n't make any unnecessary purchases try to brown bag it to lunch instead of eating out etc save as much as you can and put it into a savings account you can use that money to put a down payment on a house or for the security and first month 's rent try not to spend any money from your savings and try to support yourself as best as you can from your income make a budget for yourself and figure out how much you can spend every month do n't factor in your savings into it your savings should be treated as an emergency fund since you have just completed school and this is your first big job out of college your income will most likely improve with time it might make sense to job hop a few times to find the right position you are much more likely to get a higher salary by changing jobs and employers than you are staying in the same one for your entire career this generally is true even if you are promoted at the by the same employer if you do leave your current job you would lose what your employer contributed if you are not vested even if that happened you would still keep the portion that you contributed

i do n't think there 's much you can do losses from the sale of personal use automobiles used for pleasure commuting etc are not deductible as capital losses   see irs tax topic end of the first paragraph   the expenses you incurred in owning and operating the car insurance fuel maintenance service plans etc are not deductible either if you used it partly for business then some of your expenses might be deductible see irs tax topic 510   this includes depreciation decline in value but only according to a standard schedule you do n't generally just get to deduct the difference between your buying and selling price   also you 'd need to have records to verify your business use   but anyway these deductions would apply or not regardless of whether you sell the car you do n't get your sales tax refunded when you resell the vehicle   that 's why it 's a sales tax not a value added tax   note however that if you do sell it the sales tax on this new transaction will be the buyer 's responsibility not yours you do have the option on your federal income tax return to deduct the state sales tax you paid when you bought the car in fact you can deduct all the sales taxes you paid in that year   if you have already filed your taxes for that year you can go back and amend them   however this takes the place of your state income tax deduction for the year you ca n't deduct both   see tax topic   so this is only useful if your sales taxes for that year exceeded the state income tax you paid in that year   also note that state taxes are not deductible on your state income tax return   again this deduction applies whether you sell the car or not

mortgage rates generally consist of two factors the risk premium is relatively constant for a particular individual house combination so most of the changes in your mortgage rate will be associated with changes in the price of money in the world economy at large interest rates in the overall economy are usually tied to an interest rate called the federal funds rate the federal reserve the federal funds rate by buying and/or selling bonds until the rate is something they like so you can usually expect your interest rate to rise or fall depending on the policies of the federal reserve you can predict this in a couple of ways the way they have described their plans recently indicates that will keep interest rates low for an extended period of time probably through 2014 or so and they hope to keep inflation around 2 unless inflation is significantly more than 2 between now and then they are extremely unlikely to change that plan as such you should probably not expect mortgage interest rates in general to change more than small amounts until worry more about your credit score

as andy t says it is very common for landlords to have a residential mortgage typically capital + interest on their own home and a buy to let mortgage typically interest only on each rental property that they own however before going down this route you will need to do some homework buying and letting a property is covered by a fair amount of legislation and tax rules and in the last couple of years the amount of regulation has increased as has the amount of tax you 're likely to pay letting a property can be profitable but you need to do the maths first and make sure you do everything by the book using a reputable letting agent at least for your first tenant should help avoid common pitfalls there are a number of good websites on this subject note that the rules in england wales scotland and northern ireland are all different so make sure that you get the right information

this is probably the best most concise and yet detailed answer to this oft posed question i 've seen on this sub have an upvote only thing i 'd add is that hfs comparatively more active approach creates a moat vs. mutual funds which are seen as more long term passive investments this means they can charge fees and have higher expense ratios though obviously anyone in finance who has been conscious in the last five years knows that this is changing

you could do that once maybe if the lender negotiates rather than going to court and taking you for everything you have plus having you wages garnished for the next several decades and in the process you would destroy your credit rating making it impossible to borrow again any time soon doing this deliberately is fraud but worse than that it 's stupid you are likely to lose far more than you could gain

this scheme does n't work because the combination of corporation tax even the lower tax plus the personal income tax does n't give you a tax advantage not on any realistic income i 've ever worked it out on anyway   prior to the 2014 tax year on lower incomes you could scrape a bit of an advantage but the 2013 budget changed the calculation for the tax credit on non eligible dividends so there should n't be an advantage anymore moreover if you were to do it this way by paying corporation tax instead of cpp you are n't eligible for cpp if you sit with a calculator for long enough you may figure out a way of saving $ 200 or something small but it 's a lot of paperwork for little if any benefit and you would n't get cpp i understand the money multiplier effect described above but the tax system is designed in a way that it makes more sense to take it as salary and put it in a tax deferred saving account i.e. an rrsp so there 's no limit on the multiplier effect like i said sit with a calculator if you 're earning a really large amount and are still under the small business limit it may make more sense to use a but that is the case regardless of using it as a tax shelter because if you 're earning a lot you 're probably running a business of some size the main benefit i think is that if you use a you can carry forward your losses but you have to be aware of the definition of an allowable business investment loss

sounds like a poorly written piece at best the way you make money with a mortgage if you 're careful and/or lucky and/or patient is to use that loan to make leveraged investments if the return on the investments is higher than the interest on the loan you win of course if the investments do n't do well you can lose money on this deal but at current interest rates it is n't that hard to make a profit on this arrangement especially if you can get the tax deductability helping you

the name of the gilt states the redemption date but not the original issue date a gilt with 8.75 yield and close to its redemption date may have been issued at a time when interest rates were indeed close to 8.75 for example in the early 1990s the uk inflation rate was about 8 one reason for preferring high or low coupon gilts is the trade off between capital gains and income and the different taxation rules for each if you buy a gilt and hold it to its maturity date you know in advance the exact price that it will be redeemed for i.e. £ 100 you may prefer to take a high level of income now knowing you will make a capital loss in future which might offset some other predictable capital gain for tax purposes or you may prefer not to take income that you do n't need right now and instead get a guaranteed capital gain in future for example when you plan to retire from work also you can use the change in the market value of gilts as a gamble or a hedge against your expectation of interest rate changes in future with the government guaranteed fallback position that if your predictions are wrong you know exactly what return you will get if you hold the gilts to maturity the same idea applies to other bond investments but without the government guarantee of course

somebody will have to file all the required paperwork and fees with the local government state government and even the federal government this paperwork is used by these governments to record who owns the property and how it is owned   prior to the settlement date they also will need to verify how the property is described and owned so that you are sure that you are being sold the exact property you expect and that it is delivered to you free and clear of all other debts if this is done wrong you might discover years later that you paid money for something that you do n't really own in some jurisdictions this has to be done via a law office in others there is no requirement for a lawyer because a mortgage company bank or credit union is giving you money for the loan they may require you to use a settlement attorney they do n't want to discover in 5 years that a simple mistake will cost them hundreds of thousands to fix the mortgage company is required to give you a more detailed estimate of all the closing costs before you are committed to the loan the quoted paragraph is not good enough even if you can avoid the use of a lawyer these functions still need to be done by somebody and that will still cost money

just pick a good bond and invest all your money there since they 're fairly low risk no that is basically throwing away your money and why would you do that and who told you they are low risk that is a very wrong premise what factors should i consider in picking a bond and how would they weigh against each other quite a number of them to say assuming these are n't government uk etc how safe is the institution issuing the bond their income business they are in their past performance business wise and the bonds issued by them if any check for the bond ratings issued by the rating agencies read the prospectus and check for any specific conditions i.e. bonds are callable bonds can be retired under certain conditions what happens if they default and what order will you be debt take priority where are interest rates heading which will decide the price you are paying for the bond and also the yield you will derive from the bond how do you intend to invest the income coupon you will derive from the bonds what is your time horizon to invest in bonds and similarly the bond 's life i have invested in stocks previously but realized that it is n't for me bonds are much more difficult than equities stick to government bonds if you can but they do n't generate much income considering the low interest rates environment now that qe is over you might expect interest rates to rise but you can only wait or go for bonds from stable companies i.e. ge walmart and no i am not saying you buy their bonds in any imaginable way

there is no fundamental good reason i think that 's just how it 's done which is what all the other answers seem to be saying w/o coming out and admitting it just guessing but i 'll bet most of the reason is historical before up to the moment quotes were readily available that was a bit tedious to calculate update the fund 's value so enacted laws let it be done just once per day   quotes the security act of 1940 which certainly has been updated but also still might contain the results of like this there are genuinely different issues between funds and stocks though one share of a fund is fundamentally different from one share of stock there is a finite supply of company x stock and people are trading that piece of ownership around and barter to find an mutually agreeable price   but when you buy into a mutual fund the mutual fund suddenly has more shares it takes your money and uses it to buy shares of the underlying stocks in a ratio equal to its current holdings   as a consequence the mutual fund 's price is n't determined by two people bartering and agreeing on a price like stock there is exactly one sane way to price a mutual fund and that 's the weighted total of its underlying stock   if you wanted to sell your ownership of mutual fund z to a friend at there would n't be any bartering you 'd just calculate the value based on the stated value of the underlying stock at that exact moment so there 's no inherent reason you ca n't instantaneously price a mutual fund   but people do n't really buy sell funds to each other they go to the fund manager and essentially make a deposit or withdraw   the fund manager is only required by law to do it once a day and perhaps even forbidden from doing it more often so that 's all they do disclaimer i know very little about markets and finance but i recognize answers that are just because

thanks for replying i think we are talking at cross purposes though in your original example you were talking terms of a promise to pay at a future time in that example the asset might be destroyed but the promise to pay would still be binding under typical laws of obligations and so a court could enforce the to pay unless perhaps the promise was itself eg by being contingent on the asset the apples being harvested ie not being destroyed so my question was really whether such a contingent promise really amounts to creating new money as is suggested by the original example i do n't see a promise of this nature can be akin to creating money it is a new bargain entered into by two or more parties

a share of stock is a small fraction of the ownership of the company if you expect the company to eventually be of interest to someone who wants to engineer a merger or takeover it 's worth whatever someone is willing to pay to help make that happen or keep it from happening which means it will almost always track the company 's value to some degree because the company itself will buy back shares when it can if they get too cheap to protect itself from takeover it may also start paying dividends at a later date you may also value being able to vote on the company 's actions including whether it should offer a dividend or reinvest that money in the company basically you would want to own that share or not for the same reasons you would want to own a piece of that business because that 's exactly what it is

there are in fact two balances kept for your account by most banks that have to comply with common convenience banking laws   the first is your actual balance it is simply the sum total of all deposits and withdrawals that have cleared the account that is both your bank and the bank from which the deposit came or to which the payment will go have exchanged necessary proof of authorization from the payor and have confirmed with each other that the money has actually been debited from the account of the payor transferred between the banks and credited to the account of the payee   the second balance is the available balance this is the actual balance plus any amount that the bank is floating you while a deposit clears minus any amount that the bank has received notice of that you may have just authorized but for which either full proof of authorization or the definite amount or both have not been confirmed this is what 's happening here your bank received notice that you intended to pay the train company $ x. they put an authorization hold on that $ x deducting it from your available balance but not your actual balance the bank then for whatever reason declined to process the actual transaction insufficient funds suspicion of theft fraud but kept the hold in place in case the transaction was re attempted holds for debit purchases usually expire between 1 and 5 days after being placed if the hold is not subsequently settled by the merchant providing definite proof of amount and authorization before that time the expiration time mainly depends on the policy of the bank holding your account holds can remain in place as long as thirty days for certain accounts or types of payment again depending on bank policy in certain circumstances the bank can remove a hold on request but it is the bank and not the merchant that you must contact to remove a hold or even inquire about one

excellent question for a six year old actually a good question for a 20 year old   one explanation is a bit more complicated your son thinks that after the christmas season the company is worth more for example they might have turned $ 10 million of goods into $ 20 million of cash which increases their assets by $ 10 million and is surely a good thing however that 's not the whole picture before the christmas season we have a company with $ 10 million of goods and the christmas season just ahead while afterwards we have a company with $ 20 million cash and nine months of slow sales ahead   let 's say your son gets $ 10 pocket money every sunday at 11 am five minutes to 11 he has one dollar in his pocket five minutes past 11 he has 11 dollars in his pocket is he richer now not really because every minute he gets a bit closer to his pocket money and five past eleven he is again almost a week away from the next pocket money on the other hand on monday he loses his wallet with $ 10 inside he is now $ 10 poorer or his neighbour unexpectedly offers him to wash his car for $ 10 and he does it he is now $ 10 richer   so if the company got robbed in august with all stock gone no insurance but time to buy new stock for the season they lose $ 10 million the company is worth $ 10 million less and the share price drops if they get robbed just before christmas sales start they do n't make the $ 20 million sales so they are $ 10 million poorer but they are $ 20 million behind where they should be the company is worth $ 20 millions less and the share price drops twice as much on the other hand if there is a totally unexpected craze for a new toy going on from april to june and then it drops down and they make $ 10 million unexpectedly they are worth $ 10 million more expected $ 10 million profit = no increase in share price unexpected $ 10 million profit increase in share price   now the second totally different explanation the share price is not based on the value of the company but on what people are willing to pay say it 's november and i own 100 shares worth $ 10 if everyone knew they are worth $ 20 in january i would hold on to my shares and not sell them for $ 10 it would be very hard to convince me to sell them for $ 19   if you could predict that the shares will be worth $ 20 in january then they would be worth $ 20 now the will not go up or down if something good or bad happens that everyone expects it only goes up or down if something happens unexpectedly

i think that better is up to a discussion but the difference is that while in trust you can control the money after your death in some way giving it directly to children means you have no such control i.e. in trust you can stipulate that the children will be able to spend the money under certain terms or in certain ways for example for college only after getting married no more than 10 of the value a year etc giving their names as the beneficiaries means that they get the money and can do with it whatever they please btw minor has nothing to do with it they do n't have to be minors or your children at all

yeah pretty much that 's really par for the course among underemployed twenty somethings in new york to be fair i 've also lived in cost inflated areas my whole life so i 'm used to it and know how to work around it even so with that 18k i 'm able to support a decent single habit    the only thing i may have a little is that i do a some freelance photography on the side and i use money from that to buy myself a new pair of   red wing boots and some nice raw jeans every year or so which i guess would make my income more like an even $ 20,000 sure i wish i made more so i could have some savings and a little security and i 'm certainly not saying i want to live like this when i 'm 35 but i do alright    point is people forget that this city is full of poor people and it would n't exist if they could n't survive doing menial jobs for minimum wage my neighborhood is full of rican single parents flipping burgers for less than i make an hour pulling down maybe thirty grand a year to a lot of people i know a $ 60,000 year would be a fortune there 's a huge difference between doing alright and this privileged idea of getting by most people raised in the upper middle class cling to

there are a few ways you can go about paying this off quickly and safely you could start paying $ monthly ie double what you 're paying now you 'll pay less interest in the long run because they can only charge you for the amount outstanding remember 6.8 of $ 12k is more than 6.8 of $ 6k however your plan sounds more sensible say you get to $ 6k paid off and $ 6k saved you 're able to pay off what 's left and that 's almost $ 200 a month you 'll have extra although what i like about this is if you become ill lose your job or whatever then you 're still able make the $ payments plus you 'll have money saved for day to day expenses food water gas electricity etc long enough to see yourself through ps they may charge you a settlement fee because if you pay early then they miss out on money but check your contract with them first hope this helps

you kind of have to take what the market is offering   the easiest way would be for you to have a system by which you could purchase the entire business and then dispose of the and other liabilities as part of the sale   then you could pick and choose which of the clients you want to add to your portfolio of clients and those you would release back to the market   the valuation of the transaction is the trick   taking the new client and managing it profitably is presumably something you feel you are well suited to do already

in general there should be a liquidity premium which means that less liquid stocks should be cheaper that 's because to buy such a stock you should demand a higher rate of return to compensate for the liquidity risk the possibility that you wo n't be able to sell easily lower initial price = higher eventual rate of return that 's what 's meant when investopedia says the security would be cheaper on average is liquidity good it depends here 's what illiquidity is imagine you own a rare piece of art say there are 10 people in the world who collect this type of art and would appreciate what you own that 's an illiquid asset because when you want to sell maybe those 10 people are n't buying maybe they do n't want your particular piece or they all happen to be short on funds or maybe worse only one of them is buying so they have all the negotiating leverage you 'll have to lower your price if you 're really in a hurry to sell maybe if you lower your price enough you can get one of the 10 buyers interested even if none were initially an illiquid asset is bad for sellers illiquid means there are n't enough buyers for you to get a bidding war going at the time of your choosing you 'll potentially have to wait around for buyers to turn up or for a stock maybe you 'd have to sell a little bit at a time as buyers want the shares illiquid can be bad for buyers too if the buyer is for some reason in a hurry maybe nobody is selling at any given time but usually buyers do n't have to be in a hurry an exception may be if you short sell something illiquid brokers often wo n't let you do this btw in that case you could be a forced buyer and this could be very bad on an illiquid security if there are only one or two sellers out there they now have the negotiating leverage and they can ask whatever price they want illiquidity is very bad when mixed with margin or short sales because of the potential for forced trades at inopportune times there are plenty of obscure penny stocks where there might be only one or two trades per day or fewer the spread is going to be high on these because the bids at a given time will just be lowball offers from buyers who are n't really all that interested unless you want to give your stock away in which case they 'll take it and the asks are going to be from sellers who want to get a decent price but maybe there are n't really any buyers willing to pay so the ask is just sitting there with no takers the bids and asks may be limit orders that have been sitting open for 3 weeks and forgotten about contrast with a liquid asset for example a popular model used car in good condition would be a lot more liquid than a rare piece of art though not nearly as liquid as most stocks you can probably find several people that want to buy it living nearby and you 're not going to have to drop the price to get a buyer to show up you might even get those buyers in a bidding war from illiquid penny stocks there 's a continuum all the way up to the most heavily traded stocks such as those in the s&p500 with these at a given moment there will be thousands of buyers and sellers so the spread is going to close down to nearly zero if you think about it just statistically if there are thousands of bids and thousands of asks then the closest bid ask pair is going to be close together that 's a narrow spread while if there are 3 bids and 2 asks on some illiquid penny stock they might be dollars away from each other and the number of shares desired might not match up you can see how liquidity is good in some situations and not in others an illiquid asset gives you more opportunity to get a good deal because there are n't a lot of other buyers and sellers around and there 's some opportunity to negotiate within the wide spread for some assets maybe you can literally negotiate by talking to the other party though obviously not when trading stocks on an exchange but an illiquid asset also means you might get a bad deal especially if you need to sell quickly and the only buyers around are making lowball offers so the time to buy illiquid assets is when you can take your time on both buying and selling and will have no reason for a forced trade on a particular timeline this usually means no debt is involved since creditors including your margin broker can force you to trade it also means you do n't need to spend the money anytime soon since if you suddenly needed the money you 'd have a forced trade on your hands if you have the time then you put a price out there that 's very good for you and you wait for someone to show up and give you that price this is how you get a good deal one more note another use of the term liquid is to refer to assets with low or zero volatility such as money market funds an asset with a lot of volatility around its intrinsic or true value is effectively illiquid even if there 's high trade volume in that any given point in time might not be a good time to sell because the price is n't at the right level anyway the general definition of a liquid investment is one that you 'd be comfortable cashing out of at a moment 's notice in this sense most stocks are not all that liquid despite high trading volume in different contexts people may use liquid in this sense or to mean a low bid ask spread

the risk of any investment is measured by its incremental effect on the volatility of your overall personal wealth including your other investments   the usual example is that adding a volatile stock to your portfolio may actually reduce the risk of your portfolio if it is negatively correlated with the other stuff in your portfolio common measures of risk such as beta assume that you have whole market diversified portfolio in the case of an investment that may or may not be hedged against currency movements we ca n't say whether the hedge adds or removes risk for you without knowing what else is in your portfolio   if you are an eu citizen with nominally savings or otherwise stand to lose buying power if the euro depreciates relative to the dollar than the hedged etf is less risky than the unhedged version   on the other hand if your background risk is such that you benefit from that depreciation then the reverse is true hedging means reducing the risk already present in your portfolio   in this case it does not refer to reducing the individual volatility of the etf   it may or may not do that but individual asset volatility and risk are two very different things

a fascinating view on this the math of a 10 deposit and projected 10 return lead to an inevitable point when the account is worth 10x your income nice and the deposit 10 of income only represents 1 of the account balance   the use of an ira is neither here nor there as your proposed deposit is still just 1 of your retirement account total pay off debt for one with this level of savings it should be assumed you are n't carrying any high interest debt   it really depends on your age and retirement budget our number was our final income so at 10x we were still saving for you if you project hitting your number soon enough i 'd still deposit to the match but maybe no more it might be time to just enjoy the extra money for others their goal may be much higher and those extra years deposits are still needed i 'd play with a spreadsheet and see the impact of reduced retirement account deposits note the question asks about funding the 401(k vs paying down debt i 'd always advise to deposit to the match but beyond that one should focus on their high interest debt especially by their 50 's

an accounting general ledger is based on tracking your actual assets liabilities expenses and income and gnucash is first and foremost a general ledger program while it has some simple budgeting capabilities they 're primarily based around reporting how close your actual expenses were to a planned budget not around forecasting eventual cash flow or saving a portion of assets for particular purposes i think the closest concept to what you 're trying to do is that you want to take your real checking account and segment it into portions you could use something like this as an account hierarchy the total in the checking account parent represents your actual amount of money that you might reconcile with your bank but you have it allocated in your accounting in various ways you may have deposits usually go into the available funds subaccount but when you want to save some money you transfer from that into a savings subaccount you could include that transfer as an additional split when you buy something such as transferring $ 50 from assets checking account available funds sending $ 45 to expenses groceries and $ 5 to assets checking account long term savings this can make it a little more annoying to reconcile your accounts you need to use the include subaccounts checkbox and i 'm not sure how well it 'd work if you ever imported transaction files from your bank another option may be to track your budgeting which answers how much am i allowed to spend on x right now separately from your accounting which only answers how much have i spent on x in the past and how much do i own right now using a different application or spreadsheet using gnucash to track budget envelopes is kind of twisting it in a way it 's not really designed for though it may work well enough for what you 're looking for

i would look at it as more of a balance in general assuming you have the ability to contribute pre or post tax money and you expect your retirement tax rate to be about the same pre tax money gives you flexibility of withdrawal during retirement say one year you have unusually high expenses you can pull money from your taxed accounts until you hit the top of your target tax bracket and then pull the rest out of already taxed accounts note that if you have the same tax rate today as when you retire the traditional account will net you slightly more money but not a huge amount

i am not familiar with this broker but i believe this is what is going on when entering combination orders in this case the purchase of stocks and the writing of a call it does not make sense to set a limit price on the two legs of the order separately in that case it may be possible that one order gets executed but the other not for example instead you can specify the total amount you are willing to pay net debit or receive net credit per item for this particular choice of a buy and write strategy a net credit does not make sense as joetaxpayer has explained hence if you would choose this option the order would never get executed for some combinations of options it does make sense however it is perhaps also good to see where the max gain numbers come from in the first case the gain would be maximal if the stock rises to the strike of the call or higher in that case you would be payed out $ 100 = $ 250 but you have paid $ 100 for the combination hence this leaves a profit of $ 109 disregarding transaction fees in the other case you would have been paid $ for the position hence in that case the total profit would be $ = $ but as said such an order would not be executed by the way note that in your screenshot the bid is at 0 so writing a call would not earn you anything at all

basically what @littleadv said but let me amplify what i think is the most important point as he she says one thing you 're paying them for is their expertise if the title on record at the county office had a legal flaw in it would you recognize it in a way your question is like asking why should i go to a doctor when i could just make my own medicine out of i grow in my garden and treat myself maybe you could but the doctor and the pharmacist have years of training on how to do this right you probably do n't is it possible for you to learn everything you need to do it right sure but do you want to spend the time to study all that for something that you will do buy a house maybe once every ten years will you remember it all next time or have to learn it all over but really most important is title companies offer insurance in case the title turns out to be flawed that to me is the big reason why i would use a title company even if i was paying cash and there was no bank involved to insist on it if there 's some legal flaw in the title and it turns out that someone else has a claim to my house and i lose in court i would be out about $ 100,000 your house might be costing you much more that 's a huge risk to take paying the couple of hundred dollars for insurance against that risk seems well worth it to me and by the way i do n't think the due diligence is easy it 's not just a matter of making sure a title is really on file at the court house and has the proper stamp on it it 's all about does someone else have a legal claim to this property like maybe three owners ago someone forged a signature on a deed so the sale is fraudulent and now the person who was defrauded or his heirs discover the issue and claim the property or maybe the previous owner failed to pay a contractor who did repairs on the house and now he goes to court and gets a lien on the property it 's unlikely that you have the expertise to recognize a forged document you almost surely have no way to recognize a forged signature of someone you never met on an otherwise valid looking document and you 'd have to do a lot of research to find every contractor who ever worked on the house and insure none of them have a claim etc

this is a very important question and you will find arguments from both sides in part because it is still ben economics ph.d. from stanford answers is high frequency trading good for the economy on quite well   this is an important but question there are few    published academic studies on it though several groups are working on    the subject you may be interested in the following papers these document some of the phenomena that arise in high frequency    trading from a theoretical and an empirical perspective however a    full equilibrium analysis of the unique features of high frequency    trading is still missing and until it is done all our answers will    be kind of   tentative nevertheless there are some obvious things one can say currently    high frequency traders are competing to locate physically closer and    closer to exchanges because milliseconds matter thus large amounts    of money are being spent to beat other market makers by tiny fractions    of a second once many firms make these investments the market looks    like it did before in terms of competition and prices but is a tiny    bit faster this investment is unlikely to be socially efficient that    is the users of   the market do n't actually benefit from the fact that    their trades are executed half a millisecond faster certainly not    enough to cover all the investment that went into making that happen some people who study the issue believe that high frequency trading    hft actually exacerbates market volatility some plots to this    effect are found in the second paper linked above there is certainly    no widely accepted theory that says faster trading technology    necessarily increases efficiency and it is easy to think of    algorithms that can make money at least in the short run but hurt    most other investors as well as the informational value of the    market one caution is that some of the complaining about hft comes from those    who lose when hft gets better old style market makers they    certainly have an incentive to make hft out to be very bad so some    complaints about the predatory nature of hft should be taken with a    grain of salt there is no strong economic consensus about the value    of this activity for what it 's worth my personal impression is that    this is more bad than good i 'll post an update here as more    definitive research comes out you can also find a debate on high frequency trading from the economist which gives both sides of the argument in conclusion regardless of how you feel about hft it seems like it 's here to stay and wo n't be leaving in the foreseeable future so the debate will rage on additional resource you may finding interesting europe begins push to ban hft high frequency trading discussion on cnbc should high frequency trading hft be banned

i think that memoryless in this context of a given stock 's performance is not a term of art imo it 's an anecdotal concept or cliche used to make a point about holding a stock sometimes people get stuck they buy a stock or fund at 50 it goes down to 30 then hold onto it so they can get back to even by holding the loser stock for emotional reasons the person potentially misses out on gains elsewhere

in fact buybacks were often considered a vehicle for insider trading especially prior to 1982   for instance prior to the reagan era executives avoided buybacks due to fears that    they would be prosecuted for market manipulation but under sec rule    adopted in 1982 companies receive a safe harbor from market    manipulation liability on stock buybacks if they adhere to four    limitations not engaging in buybacks at the beginning or end of the    trading day using a single broker for the trades purchasing shares    at the prevailing market price and limiting the volume of buybacks to    25 percent of the average daily trading volume over the previous four    weeks

over time gold has mainly a hedge against inflation based on its scarcity value that is unless finds some killer app for it that would also make it a good investment the usual ones electronic medicine dental do n't really do the trick it should be noted that gold performs its inflation hedge function over a long period of time say $ 50-$100 years   over shorter periods of time it will spike for other reasons the latest classic example was in 1979 80 and the main reason in my opinion was the iranian hostage crisis inflation was secondary this was a political risk situation but one that was not an attack on 52 u.s. no less was an attack on the u.s. dollar but gold got so pricey that it lost its inflation hedge function for some two decades until about 2000 inflation has not been a notable factor in 2011 but political risk has been witness egypt libya and potentially syria and other countries put another way gold is less of an investment that a hedge and not just against inflation

perhaps there is no single formula that accounts for all the time intervals but there is a method to get formulas for each compound interest period you deposit money monthly but there is interest applied weekly let 's assume the month has 4 weeks   so you added x in the end of the first month when the new month starts you have x money in your account after one week you have x + money after the second week you have x + + and so on always taking the previous ammount of money and multiplying it by the interest b you have this gives you for the end of the second month   this looks complicated but it 's easy for computers call it that is it is a function that gives you the ammount of money you would obtain by the end of the second month do you see that the future money inputs are given with relation to the previous ones then we can do the following for notice the x is the end of the formula it 's the deposit of money in the end of the month i 'm assuming it 'll pass through the compound interest only in the first week of the next month   and then write   there is something in mathematics called recurrence relation in which we can use these two formulas to produce a simplified one for arbitrary b and n. doing it by hand would be a bit complicated but fortunately cases are able to do it easily i used mathematica commands and it gave me the following formula   all the work you actually have to do is to figure out what will be and then write the f(n for in terms of notice that i used the command in my code mathematica comes with algorithms for formulas so if it did n't find something simpler you probably wo n't find it by yourself if the code looks ugly it 's because of mathematica formatting in the software it looks like this   notice that i wrote the entire formula for but as it 's also a recurrence relation it can be written as   that is this should give you much simpler formulas to apply in this method

as others have pointed out it 's all about a fixed small cost versus the potential of a large cost if you have insurance you know you will pay a fixed amount per month there is a 100 probability that you will have to pay this premium if you do n't have insurance there is a large chance that you will have no cost in any given month and a small chance that you will have a large cost like my home owners insurance costs me about $ 50 per month if i did n't have insurance and my house burned down i would be out something like $ 100,000 what 's the chance that my house will burn down this month very small but i 'd rather pay $ 50 and not have to worry about it on the other hand i just bought a filing cabinet for $ 160 and the store offered me an extended warranty for something like $ 20 a year what 's the probability that some accident will happen that damages my filing cabinet pretty small even if it did i think i could handle shelling out $ 160 i can imagine my stomach in knots and lying awake at nights worrying about the possibility of losing $ 100,000 or finding myself homeless i ca n't imagine lying awake at nights worrying about losing $ 160 or being force to stuff my files under the bed i 'll take my chances when i was young and had even less money than i have now i bought cars that cost me a thousand dollars or even poor as i was i knew that if the car was totaled i could dig up the cash to buy another it was n't worth paying the insurance premium these days i 'm driving a car that cost me $ 6,000 i have collision and comprehensive insurance but i think it 's debatable i bought the car with cash to begin with and if i had to i could scrape up the cash to replace it especially considering that my last payment for my daughter 's college tuition is due next month and then that expense is gone

the sears ceo eddie lampert is an ayn rand fanatic   this is what happens when you take ayn rand newshour amp making sense column this is what happens when you take ayn rand seriously   in 2008 sears ceo eddie lampert decided to restructure the company according to rand 's principles   lampert broke the company into more than 30 individual units each with its own management and each measured separately for profit and loss the idea was to promote competition among the units which lampert assumed would lead to higher profits instead this is what happened as described by a reporter for bloomberg business   an advocate of free market economics and fan of the ayn rand he created the model because he expected the invisible hand of the market to drive better results if the company 's leaders were told to act selfishly he argued they would run their divisions in a rational manner boosting overall performance   instead the divisions turned against each other and sears and kmart the overarching brands suffered interviews with more than 40 former executives many of whom sat at the highest levels of the company paint a picture of a business that 's by infighting as its divisions battle over fewer resources   a close up of the debacle was described by stuart in a salon article from 2013   it got crazy executives started undermining other units because they knew their bonuses were tied to individual unit performance they began to focus solely on the economic performance of their unit at the expense of the overall sears brand one unit kenmore started selling the products of other companies and placed them more prominently than sears own products units competed for ad space in sears units were no longer incentivized to make sacrifices like offering discounts to get shoppers into the store   sears became a miserable place to work rife with infighting and screaming matches employees focused solely on making money in their own unit ceased to have any loyalty to the company or stake in its survival   we all know the end of the story sears share prices fell and the company appears to be headed toward bankruptcy the moral of the story in 's words   what lampert failed to see is that humans actually have a natural inclination to work for the mutual benefit of an organization they like to cooperate and collaborate and they often work more productively when they have shared goals take all of that away and you create a company that will destroy itself

while derivative pricing models are better modeling reality as academia invests more into the subject none sufficiently do if for example one assumes that stock returns are for the purposes of pricing options like black scholes does the only true dependent variable becomes log standard deviation otherwise known as volatility producing the infamous volatility smile which disappears in the cases of models with more factors accounting for other mathematical moments such as mean skew and etc   still these more advanced models are flawed and suffer the same extreme time mispricing as black scholes   in other words one can model anything however one wants but the worse the model the stranger the results since volatility for a given expiration should be constant across all strikes and is with better models in the case of pricing dividends these can be adjusted for the many complexities of taxation but the model becomes ever more complex and extremely expensive for each eventuality   furthermore with more complexity in any model the likelihood of discovering a closed form in the short run is less for equities in a low interest rate not high dividend yield not low volatility low dividend tax environment the standard swap pricing models will not provide results much different from one where a single low tax rate on dividends is assumed if one is pricing a swap on equity outside of the bounds above the dividend tax rate could have more of an effect but for computational efficiency applying a single assumed dividend tax rate would be optimal with instead of d in a formula where d is the dividend paid and x is the tax rate in short a closed form model is only as good as its assumptions so if anomalies appear between the actual prices of swaps in the market and a swap model then that model is less correct than the one with smaller anomalies of the same type   in other words if pricing equity swaps without a dividend tax rate factored more closely matches the actual prices than pricing with dividend taxes factored then it could be assumed that pricing without a dividend tax factored is superior   this all depends upon the data and there does n't seem to be much in academia to assist with a conclusion if equity swaps do truly provide a tax advantage and both parties to a swap transaction are aware of this fact then it seems unlikely swap sellers would n't demand some of the tax advantage back in the form of a higher price   a model is no defense since volatility curves persist despite what black scholes says they should be

many web sites and articles warn against buying former rental cars because people renting these cars often them many of those are also written by unqualified individuals for publication on blog farms and encourage all sorts of financial practices that 's not even considering the interests of who is paying to advertise on said i 'm sure their interests align with making sure you always pay top dollar for a new car because those used ones are so mistreated never trust financial advice published on the internet or in the media for that matter edit one caveat on further never never buy used vehicles from government auctions asset old police cars etc anybody irresponsible enough to go to jail or abandon their car long enough to lose their assets likely is n't a responsible owner of such and cops and crooks alike do absolutely beat the out of police cars   when it comes to government owned vehicles police cars municipal governments are notoriously stingy and will squeeze every last minute of use out of them before putting them on the market if you 're buying a government vehicle assume it 's being sold because it has problems but from a financial point of view i notice that rental agencies sell cars within the first two years during the time when they depreciate the most bingo i figure many large rental companies will have mathematicians who calculate the best time to sell does the fact that they sell the car mean during this time suggest that they know the car 's cost of further maintenance or other costs will be higher or is there another reason they sell at this time which has a calculated advantage to them but which is less than idea statistically for me the purchaser it does n't take a phd to realize it 's bad for business if your model revolves around renting out 1970s that run the risk of breaking down and leaving customers stranded in inopportune or dangerous places in particular has a terrible reputation for this and it shows in the condition of their of the 90s all of them uber wo n't let you drive for them if your car is older than 7 10 years for the same reasons yes as a car ages the chance of having to make repairs increases rental agencies are in the business of renting vehicles not running service centers and garages it 's more aligned with their core business model to just dispose of cars once they 've squeezed the most reliable years out of them and amortize the vehicles depreciation across the tax deductions and fleet pricing they enjoy when buying new ones   this gets them out of the service game and lets them focus on their core procurement and rental there 's no calculated time to lemon that they 're trying to skirt here they 're just trying to avoid having to make any repairs whatsoever

the ownership of the house depends on what the original deed transferring title at the time of purchase says and how this ownership is listed in government records where the title transfer deed is registered hopefully the   two records are consistent   in legal systems that from british common law including the us the two most common forms of ownership are tenancy in common meaning that unless otherwise specified in the title deed each of the owners has an equal share in the entire property and can sell or his her share without requiring the approval   of the others and joint tenancy with right of survivorship meaning   that all owners have equal share and if one owner   dies the survivors form a new spouses generally own property   especially the home in a special kind of called tenancy by the entirety on the other hand the rule is that unless explicitly specified otherwise tenancy in common with equal shares is how the owners hold the property other countries may have different default assumptions and/or have multiple other forms of ownership see e.g. here for the intricate rules applicable in india mortgages are a different issue most mortgages state that the are jointly and liable for the mortgage   payments meaning that the mortgage holder does not care who makes the payment but only that the mortgage payment is made in full if one owner refuses to pay his share the others can not send in their shares of the mortgage payment due and tell the bank to sue the co owner for his share of the payment everybody is liable and can be sued for the unpaid amount and if the bank forecloses everybody 's share in the property is seized not just the share owned by the person   it is of course possible to for different co owners to have separate mortgages for their individual shares but the legalities including questions such as whose lien is primary and whose secondary are complicated with regard to who paid what over the years of ownership it does not matter as far as the ownership is concerned if it is a tenancy in common with equal shares the fact that the various owners paid the bills mortgage payments property taxes repairs and maintenance in unequal amounts does not   change the ownership of the property unless a new deed is recorded with the new percentages   now the co owners may decide among themselves as a matter of fairness that any money realized from a sale of the property should be divided up in accordance with the proportion that each contributed during the ownership but that is a different issue if i were a buyer of property titled as tenancy in common i or the bank who is lending me money to make the purchase would issue separate checks to each co seller in proportion to the percentages listed on the deed of ownership and let them worry about whether they should transfer money among themselves to make it equitable careful here gift taxes might   well be due if large sums of money change hands

ok reading between the lines here it looks like the services offered by your company are of an adult possibly illegal nature and that this individual has actually paid you in full for the services rendered up to this point the wrinkle here is that you say that you 've been offered large cash gifts in return for future favours but that your client has n't provided a real paypal account to do so when you pressed him on it he sent a fake email and invented a financial adviser to you off then has n't contacted you   since it 's pretty clear that he has n't got any intention of making these payments to you what you 're now proposing to do is to use his known banking details to collect money to cover those verbal promises in pretty much every part of the world that 's a crime without a written agreement to use that payment method for those promises he could easily call the police and have you arrested for theft of funds the further wrinkle is that his actions claiming to have made payment via paypal forged email headers etc strongly suggest that this individual is involved in cyber crime and may well have used a fake bank account to pay for your initial services   the bottom line here is that you need real legal advice from an actual lawyer

building tanks and helicopters is the use of the countries economic resources for goods that provide no net benefit to the economy beyond their construction price   if for example the government wanted to stimulate the economy by spending $ 1 trillion on something sure the country 's gdp would by definition increase by $ 1 trillion and there 'd probably be some multiplier effect by those workers now having additional money to spend on other goods   there 's also going to be some negative effects on other sectors of the economy because the prices for labor and raw materials will go up because of the increased demand from the government   if the government is buying $ 100 billion in steel and aluminum you can bet that the spot prices of steel and aluminum is going to jump up squeezing any private industries that need to buy those resources   now the question is what do you spend that $ 1 trillion on to get the biggest bang for your buck   military hardware accomplishes the goal of having something disposable to buy with $ 1 trillion but little additional benefit to the private economy   if you instead spent $ 1 trillion on building infrastructure bridges roads dams pipelines flood control scientific research or education you 've now generated goods that have their own intrinsic value to society beyond their cost whether it be less traffic new scientific discoveries or a more educated workforce

assuming that no one else has hit the ask and the asks are still there yes you will fill $ as long as you did n't exhaust that ask actually there is no current price at which the stock is exchanging hands in reality it is the last price traded the somebody who negotiated prices between buyers sellers is the exchange through their handling of bids asks   the real negotiation comes between bids asks and if they meet or cross a trade occurs it 's not that both bid ask should be $ it 's that they were to answer the title the reasons why the bid and ask even their midpoint move away from the last price are largely unknown but at least for the market makers if their sell inventory is going away people are buying heavily and they 're running out of inventory they will start to hike up their asks a lot and their bids a little because market makers try to stay market neutral having no opinion on whether an asset will rise or fall so with stocks that means having a balanced inventory of longs shorts   they want to sometimes have to depending on the exchange accommodate the buying pressure but they do n't want to lose money so they simply raise the ask and then raise the bid as people hit their asks since their average cost basis has risen in fact yahoo finance is great about showing this there 's rarely 1 bid and 1 ask   take a look at bac 's limit book you can see that there are many bids and many asks   if one ask is exhausted the next in line is now the highest   the market maker who just sold at x will certainly step over the highest bid to bid at to get an 11 return on investment

from your description it seems that you should have $ 75k of basis i.e. after tax amount in your traditional ira as others have mentioned in comments you might have had to report this in the year it was rolled over i will assume that you will have figured this out having after tax amounts in a traditional ira is tricky as you usually ca n't choose to take out only the after tax portion withdrawals as well as conversions to roth ira must be pro rata which means that the amount of pre tax and post tax money in the withdrawal or conversion follows the same proportion as in the ira overall so say 7.5 of your traditional ira is after tax and the other is pre tax that means any withdrawal will consist of pre tax and post tax in those proportions so e.g. if you withdraw or convert $ 1000 $ 75 will be post tax and $ will be pre tax so any withdrawal or conversion will consist overwhelmingly of pre tax amounts which will be taxed and you may not want that at this time there is one way to separate the pre tax and post tax amounts in a traditional ira but it involves having an active 401(k which i doubt you have at this point as you 're retired some 401(k plans allow people to rollover funds from traditional ira into it if they allow this then you can use it to siphon only pre tax money from the traditional ira as irs does not allow rollover of post tax money into a 401(k this way you can rollover the entire pre tax amount of the traditional ira into the traditional 401(k leaving behind only after tax money in the traditional ira which you can immediately convert to roth ira with no tax

a couple options that i know of interactive brokers offers a paper trading mode to its account holders that allows you to start with a pretend stack of money and place simulated trades to test trading ideas they also provide an api that allows you to interface with their platform for retrieving quotes placing orders and the such as you noted however it 's not free you must hold a funded brokerage account in order to qualify for access to their platform in order to maintain an account there are minimums for required equity and monthly activity measured in dollars that you spend on commissions so you wo n't get access to their platform without having a decent amount of skin in the game ib 's native api is java based is an unofficial wrapper that makes the interface available in python i 've not used ib at all myself but i 've heard good things about their api and its accessibility via edit ib now supports python via their published api so using is no longer needed unless you wish to use python the officially supported api is based on python 3 td ameritrade also offers an api that is usable by its brokerage clients they do not offer any such paper trading mode so you would need to execute transactions based on quotes at the corresponding trade times and then keep track of your simulated account history yourself the api supports quote retrieval price history and trade execution among other functions tda might be more attractive than ib if you 're looking for a low cost link into market data as i believe their minimum equity levels are lower to get access you 'll need to sign up for an api developer account which i believe requires an nda i do n't believe there is an official python implementation of the api but if you 're a capable python writer you should n't have trouble up to the published interfaces some caveats as when doing any strategy backtesting you 'll want to be sure to be pessimistic when doing so so your optimism does n't make your trades look more successful than they would be in the real world at a minimum you 'll want to ensure that your simulations transact at the posted bid ask prices not necessarily the last trade 's price as well as any commissions and fees associated with the trade a more robust scheme would also take into account the depth of the order book also known as level 2 quotes which can cause additional slippage in the prices at which you buy sell your security an even more robust scheme would take into account the potential latency of trade execution looking at all prices over some time period that covers the maximum expected latency and simulating the trade at the worst possible price

the formula uses the finance rate to discount negative cash flows but since the only negative cash flow in the example in in the current period there 's nothing to discount   it 's meant to solve problems with irr like when there are both positive and negative cash flows which can result in multiple answers for irr   the example they give is n't a good one for because it 's a simple spend now earn later scenario which irr is perfectly fine for if you add a negative cashflow somewhere after the first one you 'll see the answer change with difference financing rates

in most countries you are deemed to dispose of all your assets at the fair value at that time at the moment you are considered no longer a resident ie on the day your friend leaves brazil brazil will likely consider him to have sold his btc for $ 1m.   the brazilian government will then likely want him to calculate how much it cost him to mine buy it so that they can tax him on the gain no argument about how btc is n't fiat money matters here tax laws will typically apply to all investments in a way similar to stocks etc   the us will likely be very suspicious of such a large amount of money without some level of including that he paid taxes on any relevant gains in other countries by showing the us that he paid appropriate expatriate taxes in brazil if they exist i am speaking generally and have no knowledge of brazilian taxes he is helping to prove that he does not need to pay any taxes on that money in the us typically the btc then is valued for us tax purposes as the $ 1 m it was worth when he entered the us becoming a resident there this may require tax planning prior to entering the us see additional answer here any attempt to bring the btc into the us without paying appropriate brazilian us taxes as applicable i 'm not 100 on either check with a tax lawyer knowledgeable on both us brazilian tax law because the amount of money is material will likely be considered fraud how to commit fraud is not entertained as valid subject matter on this site

you do not realize gains or losses until you actually sell the stock   after you sell the initial stocks bonds you have realized the gain   when you buy the new different stocks you have n't realized anything until you then sell those there is one exception to this called the wash sale rule   from investopedia.com with the wash sale rule the irs disallows a loss deduction from the    sale of a security if a substantially identical security was purchased within 30 days before or after the sale   the    wash sale period is actually 61 days consisting of the 30 days before    and the 30 days after the date of the sale for example if you bought    100 shares of ibm on december 1 and then sold 100 shares of ibm on    december 15 at a loss the loss deduction would not be allowed    similarly selling ibm on december 15 and then buying it back on    january 10 of the following year does not permit a deduction the    wash sale rule is designed to prevent investors from making trades for    the sole purpose of avoiding taxes

the long and short of it is the mortgage company has a significant interest in the resale value of the home in the event of a default   imagine a scenario where you say to yourselves that you 're not going to repair the deck just yet meh we 'll do that next summer and something happens that causes a default on the mortgage the resale value of the home may be harmed by the deck even though you 're willing to live with it   that being the case the mortgage company has every right to insist that you carry out the repairs in order to maintain the property in salable condition so the essence of it is you do n't have much choice but to do the repairs keep in mind too that the insurance company paid for the roof and the deck to be repaired   if they were to learn that you now have no intention of using the money to repair the property you could end up in legal hot water with them   after all you did accept the check for repairs that you 're now not carrying out

this is a great question for understanding how futures work first let 's start with your assumptions the most interesting thing here is that neither of these things really matters for the price of the futures   this may seem odd as a futures contract sounds like you are betting on the future price of the index but remember that the current price already includes the expectations of future earnings as well there is actually a fairly simple formula for the price of a futures contract note the link is for forward contracts which are very similar but slightly more simple to understand   note that if you are given the current price of the underlying the futures price depends essentially only on the interest rate and the dividends paid during the length of the futures contract   in this case the dividend rate for the s&p500 is higher than the prevailing interest rate so the futures price is lower than the current price   it is slightly more complicated than this as you can see from the formula but that is essentially how it works note this is why people use futures contracts to mimic other exposures   as the price of the future moves pretty much in with the underlying and sometimes using futures to hedge exposures can be cheaper than buying etfs or using swaps edit example of the effect of dividends on futures prices for simplicity let 's imagine we are looking at a futures position on a stock that has only one dividend d in the near term and that this dividend happens to be scheduled for the day before the futures delivery date   to make it even more simple lets say the price of the stock is fairly constant around a price p and interest rates are near zero   after the dividend we would expect the price of the stock to be p ~ p d as if you buy the stock after the dividend you would n't get that dividend but you still expect to get the rest of the value from additional future cash flows of the company however if we buy the futures contract we will eventually own the stock but only after the dividend happens   since we do n't get that dividend cash that the owners of the stock will get we certainly would n't want to pay as much as we would pay for the stock p   we should instead pay about p the expected value of owning the stock after that date    so in the end we expect the stock price in the future p to be the futures price   today p and that should make us feel a lot more comfortable about what we our buying   neither owning the stock or future is really necessarily favorable in the end you are just buying slightly different future expected cash flows and should expect to pay slightly different prices

there are many situations where injecting a certain amount of cash at the right time may reap rewards far in excess of the value of the cash injected for example if someone who needs a car to get to work gets in a wreck and that person does not have ready money to make it may have no choice but to secure very expensive financing   receipt of $ 1000 in ready money to repair the car may thus save the person from having to take out a loan that would cost $ 1200 or more to repay while the insurance business has sufficient overhead that it is unlikely that insurance would generally have a positive net expectation even considering such factors it is at least theoretically possible that insurance could have a positive expected value for both the insurer and the insured and in some cases it may have positive expected values for both parties in practice as well

you should never invest in a stock just for the dividend dividends are not guaranteed i have seen some companies that are paying close to 10 dividends but are losing money and have to borrow funds just to maintain the dividends how long can these companies continue paying dividends at this rate or at all would you keep investing in a stock paying 10 dividends per year where the share price is falling 20 per year i know i would n't some high dividend paying stocks also tend to grow a lot slower than lower or non dividend paying stocks you should look at the total return both dividend yield and capital return combined to make a better decision you should also never stay in a stock which is falling drastically just because it pays a dividend i would never stay in a stock that falls 20 30 50 or more just because i am getting a 5 dividend regarding taxation some countries may have special taxation rules when it comes to dividends just like they may have special taxation rules for longer term capital gains compared to shorter term capital gains again no one should use taxation as the main purpose to make an investment decision you should factor taxation into your decision but it should never be the determining factor of your decisions no one has ever become poor in making a gain and paying some tax but many people have lost a great portion of their capital by not selling a stock when it has lost 50 or more of its value

there is no ideal number of stocks you should own there are several factors you should consider though first how actively do you want to manage your portfolio if you want to be very active then the number of stocks you own should be based on the amount of time you have to research the company by reading sec filings and listening to conference calls so you are not surprised when the company reports every quarter if you do n't want to be very active then you are better off buying solid companies that have a good reputation and good history of performance   second you should decide how much risk you are willing to take if you have $ 10,000 that you can afford to lose then you can put your money into more risky stocks or into fewer stocks which could potentially have a higher return if you want your $ 10,000 grow or lose with the market better off again going with the good rep and history stocks or a variety of stocks   third this goes along with your risk to some extent but you should consider if you are looking for short term or long term gains if you are looking to put your money in the market for the short term you will probably be looking at fewer stocks with more money in each if you are looking for long term you will be around 5 stocks that you swap as they reach goals you set out for each stock   in my opinion and i am not a financial expert i like to stay at around 5 companies mostly for the fact that it is about the ideal number of companies to keep track of

in cases like this you should be aware that tax treaties may exist and that countries are generally willing to enter into them their purpose is to help prevent double taxation tax treaties often times give you a better tax rate than even being a resident of the countries in question for instance the italy to us tax rate is lower than simply doing business in many united states   this should guide your google search here is something i found for germany spain it appears that the dividend tax rate under that treaty is 5 to my understanding the income tax rates are often multiples higher i read that spain 's income tax rate is 18   so what i would do is see if there is the possibility of deferring taxes in the lower tax and then doing a large one time dividend when but germany is n't really known for its low taxes being a federal republic the taxes are levied by both the states and the federal government look to see if your business structure can avoid being taxed as the entity level ie your business earnings are always distributed to the owners which are not germany citizens or residents as dividends so this way you avoid germany 's 15 federal corporate tax and you avoid spain 's 18 income tax and instead get spanish dividends at 5 tax anyway contact a tax attorney to help interpret the use of the regulations but this is the frame of mind you should be thinking in because it looks like spain is willing to do a tax credit if you pay taxes in germany several options here to lower your tax footprint

the standard low risk gain very short term parking spot these days tends to be a money market account   however you have only mentioned stock for good balance your portfolio should consider the bond market too consider adding a bond index fund to diversify the basic mix taking up much of that 40 this will also help stabilize your risk since bonds tend to move opposite stocks just because everyone else is also using them as the main alternative though there are theoretical arguments why this should be so eventually you may want to add a small amount of reit fund to be mix but that 's back on the higher risk side by the way trying to guess when the next correction will occur is usually not a winning strategy guesses tend to go wrong as often as they go right even for pros rather than attempting to time the market pick a strategic mix of investments and rebalance periodically to maintain those ratios there has been debate here about dollar cost averaging see other answers but that idea may argue for investing and rebalancing in more small chunks rather than a few large ones i generally actively rebalance once a year or so and between those times let the balance suggest which fund(s new money should go into minimal effort and it has worked quite well enough

the perceived risk depends on the entire situation but often it is considered more risk especially if you want to occupy yourself things you need to consider it can be very difficult to show a property with tenants occupying it there are many reasons for this and most homes show sell better empty i have found many tenants make it difficult on the seller leaving their areas a mess being and especially in markets that are flooded with options a lot of buyers just wo n't bother with the difficulty of scheduling a showing in occupied properties i 've tried to purchase many properties where the renter insists on being there during a showing but wo n't open the door and there 's no recourse for the landlord because his lease or laws in the area do n't allow you to enter without permission also it can be difficult to look past a lot of clutter and other people 's decorating and preferences to be kind is the property currently under lease and what is the period of that lease it could be that the lease is month to month or it could be years remaining on the lease period it is likely a legal requirement in most areas that you honor the existing lease i would never buy a property that has multiple years remaining while some amateur landlords will allow 2 or even 5 year leases this is a very bad idea for many reasons what are laws like in your area for evicting tenants you should know this regardless of whether or not you intend to occupy or keep it a rental it can be a very difficult process evicting tenants and this process is vastly different from country to country and state to state here in the usa look into the security deposit assuming there is one how much is the deposit will it cover damage that may not exist yet do n't think that just because you plan on evicting them soon it is n't important people can trash a place on the way out and an expensive lawsuit could be your only recourse it is far easier to take a deposit than sue i would absolutely demand that the deposit transfer to you upon sale view the current renters with a fresh eye especially if you are considering leave it a rental look into all of the typical requirements their monthly income their credit history their criminal record their payment history their references are they likely to be good or terrible renters if you 're interested in the property consider an offer which requires the current landlord to evict within the time frame of the buy sell agreement this is n't an uncommon requirement i think the first thing to do is go look at the property and see if you can determine for yourself why it has n't sold yet properties all have different reasons for not selling in a reasonable time to the local market having renters alone in most markets should n't be that big of a factor i would suspect bad smells nasty renters or an unfavorable lease agreement exists

college courses focus mainly on theory in the real world you 'll need to learn the tools to gather and analyze the data   for the most part what is taught in college is pretty worthless i remember my database class in business school was about database theory is was a complete waste of time and money did n't learn a single useful thing   learning these hands on things will put you ahead of 95 of your peers   sql is the coding language used in data bases   r is used for statistical analysis    is a reporting tool that can link to data bases then report the data   tableau another reporting tool the is more visual than   none of the things are difficult to learn so do n't be intimidated    tldr i learned more by spending $ 100 on then in college

budgeting is the key   saying that you need to eat out less and cook more is good but ultimately difficult for some people because it is very difficult to measure how much eating out is too much instead help him set up a monthly budget luckily he 's already got some built in motivation he 's got a saving goal trip with a deadline when you set up the budget start here figuring out how much per month he needs to save to meet his goal   after you 've put the saving goal and the fixed monthly bills into the budget address what he has left put a small amount of money into a fast food category and a larger amount into a grocery category if he spends everything in his fast food budget and still has the desire to go out he 'll need to raid his grocery budget and if that is depleted he 'll need to raid his vacation budget by doing this it will be made very clear to him that he must choose between going out and taking the trip   in my opinion using budgeting software makes the whole budgeting process easier see this answer and this answer for more detailed recommendations on using software for budgeting

the fsa in contrast to the hsa is not an account that you put money in   fsa stands for flexible spending arrangement not account   technically it is a defined benefit plan   here is the difference with an account such as an hsa you put money into the account and you get that same money out   you ca n't take money out unless you first put money in the fsa does n't work that way   instead you pick an annual amount that your fsa will cover and work out a monthly fee to pay for it   for example you might decide on a $ 1800 fsa which will cost you $ 150 per month   however the $ 150 you pay each month does not go into an account for you instead it goes to your employer who is managing the plan let 's say that in january at the beginning of the plan year you have a large medical expense of $ 1000   you 've only had $ 150 taken out of your paycheck so far this year but you are covered for $ 1800 so you get reimbursed the full $ 1000   this is referred to as uniform coverage meaning that you get the full $ 1800 of coverage on day 1 of the year now let 's say that you leave your job in march   you 've only paid $ 450 and you 've received $ 1000 in benefit   you do not owe your employer the rest of the money your employer eats this cost   this is the trade off that the fsa offers over other types of accounts depending on an employee 's circumstances an employer might make money use it or lose it or might lose money uniform coverage on an individual employee the idea behind the use it or lose it provision of the fsa is to help the employer pay for the uniform coverage provision the details behind the fsa and other types of health plans are outlined in irs publication 969 i 'm sure that a secondary reason behind the use it or lose it provision is that it encourages an employee to keep his fsa plan small so he can use it all up and not have to lose too much of it at the end of the year   and a smaller fsa contribution means more tax money for the government to address your point that it should n't be this way i 'm personally not a fan of the fsa because of the use it or lose it provision   but participation is voluntary for both employers and employees   you proposed an alternative set of rules for the fsa but you are basically describing an hsa in which you can not spend more than you have and you get to keep whatever is left over   the recent rules changes that allow plans to feature a grace period or a small carryover balance were an attempt to make the fsa a little more attractive useful but if you want the ability to keep your money and not have to spend it at all use an hsa instead

most 0 interest loans have quite high interest rates that are deferred if you are late on a payment you are hit with all the deferred interest they 're banking on a percentage of customers missing a payment   also this is popular in furniture car sales because it 's a way to get people to buy who otherwise would n't they made money on the item sale so the loan does n't have to earn them money even though some will traditional banks lenders do make money from interest and rely on that they would have to rely on fees if interest were not permitted

definitely not with gift cards and to a lesser degree not even with debit cards   for most transactions they work the same but you 'll run into problems when dealing with situations where a hold is placed that 's higher than the transaction amount this is the norm with gas purchases at the time you run the card you do n't know how much gas you 're going to pump so they put through an authorization for some fixed amount say $ 75 or $ 100   if you do not have this much available it will fail and you ca n't use the card to purchase the gas   unless you 're living paycheck to paycheck the debit card should work in this case but the gift card very well might not i 've also seen this happen on a larger scale with a car rental   a co worker only had a debit card and the substantial hold the rental car place wanted to put on the card was unacceptable

i think it 's important to be clear what is being studied here it 's the effect of a more dramatic increase in the min wage than we 've seen before   there are many studies which show no negative effect at all on employment in situations where gradual increases in the min wage happen just like there are several well known studies that compare similar cities with different minimum wages that show no negative affect on employment in the city with the higher wage   but in none of those situations was the wage ever increased quite like it was in seattle so that 's the new thing to study here   so again the study is clearly not trying to say that raising the minimum wage has a negative effect on employment rather it 's looking at just this particular significant increase   for me this really is an indictment on the unwillingness of congress to gradually raise the minimum wage over time using some sort of sensible inflationary benchmark    had they been gradually inflating the wage over time to coincide with normal inflation we could see a $ 12 min wage already that had no effect on employment   so is the solution a sudden correction to get to the wage up to a liveable standard in one perhaps slightly painful to employment swoop or is it to go more gradually meaning that you 'll still remain decades behind inflation growth

yeah it was a mix between the issuing agencies and the credit agencies if the credit agencies did nt rate them as aaa then the financial institutions would just go to the other agency so there was a conflict of interest in rating them higher there was mismanagement on both sides of the fence and when the cdos started to default it created a forced selling environment where people had to sell their cdos stocks at a steep discount to get enough liquidity to pay their own mortgages

there is one basic principle to apply here   to compare money paid at different times all the amounts must be compounded or discounted to the same point in time in this case the moment of the initial   $ 225,000 loan is convenient at that moment you get $ 225,000 you then make 30 payments on the 40 mortgage   the amount of these payments has to be calculated   they 're paying off a $ 90,000 mortgage with 30 monthly payments at a monthly rate of 0.5 finally you make 30 payments of an amount x starting one month after the 40 mortgage ends so far we 've just listed the amount and time of all the payments back and forth a time line type diagram is a huge help here finally use compound interest and annuity formulas to bring all the payments to the starting point using an interest rate of 1 a month equate money in with money out and solve for x

there are many reasons for buying stock for dividends   you are right in the sense that in theory a stock 's price will go down in value by the amount of the dividend as the amount of dividend was adding to the value of the company but now has been paid out to shareholder so now the company is worth less by the value of the dividend however in real life this may or may not happen sometimes the price will drop by less than the value of the dividend sometimes the price will drop by more than the dividend and other times the price will go up even though the stock has gone ex dividend we can say that if the price has dropped by exactly the amount of the dividend then there has been no change in the stockholders value if the price has dropped by more than the value of the dividend then there has been a drop to the stockholder 's value and if the price has gone up or dropped by less than the value of the dividend then there has been a increase to the stockholder 's value benefits of buying stocks with good dividends what you should n't do however is buy stocks solely due to the dividend be aware that if a company starts reducing its dividends it could be an early warning sign that the company may be heading into financial troubles that is why holding a stock that is dropping in price purely for its dividend can be a very dangerous practice

some of the information on the form would have been useful to complete the income tax paperwork the next spring it would have had numbers for taxes and interest that were addressed at the settlement it is possible it is mixed in with the next years tax information if i needed a form from 15 years ago i would n't ask the real estate agent i would ask the settlement company they might have a copy of the paperwork they might have to retrieve it from an archive so it could take time and they could charge a fee the local government probably does n't have a copy of the but they do have paperwork documenting the sale price when the transaction took place i know that the jurisdictions in my area have on line the tax appraisal information going back a number of years they also list all the purchases because of the change in ownership and many also list any name changes   you probably do n't want a screen capture of the transactions page but the tax office might have what you need this is the same information that the title search company was retrieving for their report question is there going to be capital gains for a single person there is no gains unless the increase in price is $ 250,000 for a couple it is $ 500,000 i am ignoring any time requirements because you mentioned the purchase was 15 years ago i am also assuming that it was never a rental property because that would require a lot more paperwork

i 'd contact paypal to request clarification   in the meantime most banks will credit outgoing transfers immediately but process later and only debit incoming after it passes through a processing team so while the money will go out right away it may take a few days for your bank to actually process the withdrawal and the subsequent reversal from paypal in reality paypal does n't usually recieve the money immediately either but they extend you credit to speed up things either way it does n't hurt to contact paypal to make sure they have reverted the amount to your bank and if they confirm such you can also reach out to your bank and ask where the money is stuck usually delays like this will happen in the interface between two unrelated financial institutions

what you are looking here is the cost of capital because that is what you are effectively giving up in order to invest in those loans in a discounted cash flow it would be the i in the denominator for instance instead of purchasing those loans you could have lent your money at the risk free rate not 100 true but typical assumption and therefore you are taking a slight risk in those loans for a higher return   there are several ways to compute that number the one most often used would be the rate if the bank were to lend that money in this way it would be the fed funds rate plus some additional risk premium

most basic tip   do n't go to the grocery store hungry what we do to minimize food waste on sunday when my wife and i go grocery shopping we figure out what meals we are going to have for dinner that week and we only buy what we need for those meals we also try to decide in advance what we are going out for dinner for example we know we have to take the in laws out for dinner on wednesday so we do n't buy a dinner for that night as part of our weekly planning we figure out the lunches we will take to work based on our dinners   for example if we plan to make a big pot of pasta for dinner one night we know we 'll have leftovers for lunch so we wo n't buy a lunch for the following day basically we try to match our food purchasing to our food consumption during the week we generally try to cook the dinner that uses the most perishable items first   if we buy seafood that will be monday night 's dinner   the frozen pizza can wait until the end of the week my wife an i both have to deal with the occasional unexpected late night at work which can mess up our cooking plans   as a result it is not uncommon for us to be too tired to cook so we skip a dinner   it is less wasteful to do that with something frozen preserved also we try to consider cooking time vs our work schedule   we do n't pick a complex dinner for a night that we know in advance will be a long work day

if you find a credit card with 0 interest let us know   i guess i 'll just be the one to tell you that this belongs in /r personalfinance   no a new credit card balance wo n't affect your existing mortgage however opening that mortgage so recently definitely dinged your credit substantially and it almost definitely has n't recovered yet so your credit score is n't as good as you think it is from the home purchase   if you can magically finance $ 4k for 0 apr then obviously you should do that since you 're house poor but be absolutely sure you 're right about the terms of financing i normally make purchases like that on a rewards credit card airline miles then pay it off immediately but that 's just me   using the word answers that question immediately

in my experience there 's usually only one or two theatres within a small city maybe a few more in larger cities but those are also larger areas so there really is n't much competition sure there are other places to get popcorn but not movie theatre popcorn it wo n't be with 4000 calories worth of tasty butter and salt even if you make it at home that can be difficult to accomplish and then you have to invest the time to make it besides when i go to the movies i do n't go just to see a movie if i just want to see a movie i can watch it at home the junk food they sell is part of the experience even then people do their own food into theatres all the time but it 's hard to in a bag of popcorn and again ordinary popcorn just is n't the same so i think the answer boils down to it 's expensive because people are willing to pay for it and they 're willing to pay for it because it 's not really available elsewhere at any better price and it 's part of what they come for

of course your situation is very at a personal level and i sympathize i just do n't get your point about being driven further into debt it would seem that with a lower credit score you are prevented from taking on more debt that can absolutely be especially to someone who runs a business that relies on short term credit as for why they do this they do it to reduce their risk they do n't want to lend more money they are afraid that you will lose your job and default of course it is not as personal as i am writing it not for you they do n't target you personally they target your credit profile and not for them it is a matter of how the market views the debt and how much they can trade on such debt not what they want to do personally as for the tarp bailouts not releasing enough credit this is reality goverment always thinks it can influence the situation more than it actually can in order to unfreeze credit there needs to be a growing economy that makes the risk look acceptable no amount of goverment will really change that more than marginally by the way legislation like this forcing credit card companies to not raise their rates can lead to credit restrictions by forcing the rates down the risk has to be somewhere so it will be by lowering credit lines or by other means like any price control if you restrict the price it causes shortages intrest rates are the price of credit

this question is largely opinion based but i wanted to balance out the people jumping on you there are lots of factors that go into salary pay such as what you contribute to the company and you go above or beyond what s expected of you i would say seniority is one factor or at least there is a case to be made that it is important if someone has worked 5 years for me that is five years that i have not had to search interview and train a replacement i am not a business owner but i do employ people and when someone quits its an extremely stressful process not having to go through that again in my opinion is worth a small bump in pay i ca nt comment on if its fair or not that is opinion what is fact is that whenever a broad group of people are given a pay raise for arbitrary reasons and other employees are nt its creates it hurts morale employees leave and in severe cases the business becomes crippled so i m not sure if its fair but is it a bad idea generally see here and i highly recommend going here for anyone who thinks dramatically raising pay because its the right thing to do is a good idea

okay yes that would seem to make sense so something like a local vol model    in the context of term structure modelling you can also incorporate a volatility surface into the pricing of european and even exotic options e.g. through a sabr or an sabr for exotics which i suppose means by your criteria there are actually varying degree of arbitrage free when it comes to picking a model by that i mean there are varying degrees of what your model takes as given if it takes the market price of risk as given it 's an equilibrium model if it takes the observed term structure as given it 's an arbitrage free model if it takes the volatility structure as given it 's something else   and wrote a paper called a new of the dynamic term structure models in the journal of investment management that basically coincides with what we 're saying   so yes it sounds right to me

based on your comment that you were not owed the money yes you do have to return it   the paperwork you agreed to when you setup the direct deposit gives them the ability to reverse the transaction i do not know the maximum time they have to pull it back but they could do it without warning if you spend the money and they pull it back you will not be warned and you might overdraw the account they might not notice for days or weeks depending on how they do their audits it is unusual for a large company to do this because their time card systems are designed to prevent this problem   if they are on us government contacts this would be bad for them if they then billed the government for work that was not done or they billed the wrong customer they can face fines if the government finds out you probably have some time before you have to tell them but i would wait no more than a business day or two before contacting them you might find out that they do owe you the money

completely agree with this especially with the level 2 comment some sections in the schweser level 2 books are quite scarce and will need additional research    i just passed level 2 this june and i have pretty much never used the cfai materials they are very long and time consuming whereas the schweser resources were much shorter yet still comprehensive enough of course you are in this to improve yourself and learn as much as you can about the world of finance so if you are not under time pressure perhaps it may be better for your long term understanding to learn the content from the cfai resources    one thing i would stress is to do the mock exams and topic tests on the cfa website as this is probably the most important component of your studies use these resources to find your weaknesses and fill in the gaps from there    you should skim read those blue boxes which contain worked examples but personally i found the end of chapter questions to be too easy and a waste of time tbh   hope that helps a bit all the best for your studies    tl;dr   schweser materials are more concise and a better option regardless of what you use do official cfa amp topic tests

i 'd think the first question here is did they overpay you and if so what were the circumstances at one extreme if you lied on your and said you worked 50 hours when really you only worked 40 and they paid you for 50 hours and now they 've figured out that you did n't really work those overtime hours then yes they overpaid you and you owe them the money or if you reported your time accurately but they made an honest mistake like you worked 30 hours but for whatever reason they paid you for 40 then they really did overpay you and you owe them the money or if a check was just mis printed because their computer system screwed up or something sorry you do n't get to keep the money yes we all have fantasies about the bank accidentally adding a million dollars to our balance and somehow we get to keep the money but sorry it does n't work that way in real life if there 's been a mistake once they figure out the mistake you have to give the money back if it 's something more complicated it might be debatable   if you 're not sure what the details are find out the details and investigate do you have any evidence that what they are saying is not true how much money is involved if we 're talking $ 20 it 's not worth going to court over you 'd have to pay a lawyer way more than the $ 20 a court might order the company to pay your court costs if you won but they might not and if you lost you could have to pay their court costs which could be way more than any possible gain there are times when it 's better to just eat the loss and get on with your life of course the same could be said from the other side if the amount of money is small and the case is debatable and you refuse to hand over the cash they may just give up figuring it 's not worth the trouble i do n't know that i 'd want to gamble on that though if there is serious money involved at least several thousand dollars then it could make sense to talk to a lawyer if you think you have a case

first keep in mind that there are generally 2 ways to buy a corporation 's shares you can buy a share directly from the corporation this does not happen often it usually happens at the initial public offering the first time the company becomes public where anyone with access to the stock exchange can become a part owner plus maybe a few more times during the corporations existence in this case the corporation is offering new ownership in exchange for a price set the corporation or a broker hired by the corporation   the price used for a public offering is the highest amount that the company believes it can get this is a very complicated field and involves many different methods of evaluating what the company should be worth if the company sets the price too low then they have missed out on possible value which would be earned by the previous private shareholders they would have gotten the same share of a corporation which would now have more cash to spend because of increased money paid by new shareholders if the company sets the price too high then the share subscription might only be partially filled so there might not be enough cash to do what the company wanted you can buy a share from another shareholder this is more common when you see the company 's share price on the stock exchange it is this type of transaction buying out other current shareholders the price here is simply set based on what current owners are willing to sell at the bid price listed by an exchange is the current highest bid that a purchaser is offering for a single share the ask price is the current lowest offer that a seller is offering to sell a single share they currently own when the bid price = the ask price a share transaction happens and the most recent stock price changes

the expense ratio reduces the return of the etf your scenario of paying is that of a load   most all etfs can be bought without paying a load sales charge as a percent of amount invested and some etfs can be bought without paying a brokerage fee fixed or variable charge for a buy transaction just like buying any other stock   through the brokerage because the brokerage has waived it   your broker   might charge fees for both buying and selling shares in an etf but in any case this is quite separate from the expense ratio
