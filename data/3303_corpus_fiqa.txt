tl;dr i think you can find a much better deal doing a refi will cost you some amount of money   however a 2.5 fee top of closing costs seems really high   you can get a quote from quicken loans pretty quick and compare their fee   also i would check with a local bank preferably one you already do business with   the 2.5 is probably their commission for originating the loan   if you are in the southeast i have had great luck with regions bank   they are large enough but also small enough   please know that i have no affiliation with either company btw the rate also seems high   doing a quick search of bank rate it seems you can get 3.25 with zero fee as of this writing   the worse deal they show is with a .75 fee much better than you were quoted if you can afford it i would also encourage you to think outside the box   a client of mine was able to obtain a home equity loan not line of credit to replace their mortgage   they went for a 7 year pay off with the loan in first position at a rate about .75 below the then current 15 year rate   the key was there was zero closing costs   it saved them quite a bit of money also look at a 10 year fixed   it might not be much more than you are paying now

tl;dr i agree with pete b. 's assertion that you should continue shopping that 's not the whole story though there are other factors that can raise your rate and affect your closing costs the published rate is typically the best rate you can get here are some other factors that can raise your rate you should have received a loan estimate which will itemize the fees you will pay on that document you will see if you are paying a price to buy down the rate and all the other fees how are you calculating the 2.5 note that some fees are fixed an appraisal on a $ 40 k home may cost the same as an appraisal for a $ 400 k home if you add up the total closing costs and view it as a percentage of the loan the smaller loan may have a higher percentage than the larger loan even though the total cost of the smaller loan is less

2.5 whoa you are being robbed there   straight up stripped down and bent over a table robbed never agree to fees   if they do n't want to do the work to give you a loan there are other lenders who do rarely agree to points   if you know and i do n't mean think i mean know if you know that you are going to hold that loan much longer than it would take to repay those points then maybe   for example if they are charging one point to lower your rate 0.25 you want to be totally sure you will stay in the house at least four years and probably more like six or eight years before moving or refinancing it 's more or less ok to pay for the appraisal   if something goes wrong with the loan application the appraisal will be valid for a few more months you can try again i once had 14 cash for a down payment   the loan officer said if i could come up with 15 the rate would be reduced by 0.25   to get the money i took a reverse point which paid me 1 but raised my the rate by 0.25 the loan officer who was n't too bright asked why did you do that   the two things cancel each other out i did it i explained because you paid me 1 of the value of my house to sign my name twice

elliott was arguing from the position of an original creditor   they still had the same rights and obligations as if they bought the bond directly from the government   so buying the bonds at a huge discount did not mean that they gave up rights under the law   would your opinion differ if it was the original bondholders in the lawsuit and not these vulture funds   think of it this way elliott paid less because the original bondholders rights were judged by the market to be unlikely to result in being paid in full   but paying less did not extinguish any of the original bondholders rights    and anytime a bond holder is forced to accept modified terms that they did not agree to the borrower is unilaterally changing the terms   there is an argument that this is necessary for businesses and individuals but sovereigns that can raise revenue as a matter of policy have no excuse

i do n't think the two are particularly linked   while brick is right in that the price of oil is denominated in dollars i do n't think that 's responsible for most of the movement here oil has been weak for intrinsic reasons related to oil supply demand imbalance largely   oil also was way over priced back when it was > $ 100 a barrel a lot of that was due to worries about instability in the middle east the dollar has been strong for other separate intrinsic reasons   the american economy has had a stronger rebound than europe or asia while we were hit hard in the 2008 recession we rebounded pretty quickly from a whole economy point of view we still have a lot of weaknesses in terms of long term unemployment but that does n't seem to be hurting our productivity much    pick another time period and you wo n't necessarily see the same matching path and i would even say that those paths do n't match particularly well   marketwatch covered this for example other sites show similar things   there is a weak correlation but only in the short term or for specific reasons

gt;the point is the worker deserve a share of those profits it is their work that has made them in addition to the work of the ceo   uh no the main purpose of a corporation is to increase shareholders wealth neither the workers nor the ceo deserve anything from the profits their pay has already been deducted as an expense profit is the residual income that is left to distribute to shareholders you know the guys who are risking everything i.e. they are last to receive anything if left when a company goes bankrupt as a dividend or to reinvest in the company    if salaries are low that is a whole different problem increase them and have more adequate profit levels next but let 's not get confused as to who deserves what   personally i find both cat 's remuneration 's policy and the union 's demands disgusting so do n't take this the wrong way ceo is clearly overpaid already but they did not just decide to give him a raise or something pay for performance measures are probably already in his contract maybe next time when that contract is the remuneration board will propose more normal terms the union on the other hand with its unreasonable demands about seniority and god knows what else is likely to lead to many cut backs at the new terms and unlikely but possible closure of the plant leading to even more unemployment

someone is paid a certain sum each month and wants to spend only a certain amount each month can he spend more and then take it out of next month 's payment using the example 100 month 1 60 first month save 40 second month 100 salary spend 70 save 30 overall savings 70 third month 100 salary spend 50 save 50 overall savings 120 so in short term or once a while doing this is fine however if and this depends on individuals it goes beyond control i.e. you keep spending say 90 every month you would have to save for quite a few months to get back to normal a better way would be to reverse this using the example 100 month 1 60 first month save 40 second month 100 salary spend 50 save 50 overall savings 90 third month 100 salary spend 70 save 30 overall savings 120 i.e. save more first and then spend rather than spending now and saying you will save in future generally this is the trap quite a few fall into specially when saving for retirement they keep putting it to future and very soon realize that they ca n't get back to the goal

credit cards are meant to be used so generally it does n't hurt your credit score to use them   to top it off you even get an interest grace period so you do n't have to rush home and pay balances as soon as they 're charged    in general you accrue charges during your statement period we 'll call it september 1 through september 30   the statement due date is something like 20 days after the close of the statement period so we 'll call it october 20   as long as you pay your entire statement balance by the due date you will never pay interest   you charge your laptop on september 3 it shows up on your statement as $ 1,300 you pay $ 1,300 on october 18 you pay no interest however if you pay $ 1,000 on october 18 leaving a $ 300 balance to be carried in to the next statement period a carried balance you will pay interest   generally interest is calculated based on your average daily balance during the statement period which is now be the october 1 to october 31 period   you 'll notice that you did n't pay anything until the october 18 that means the entire $ 1,300 will be included in your average daily balance up to the 18th of the month   add to that anything else you charge on the card now will be included in your average daily balance for interest charge calculation purposes the moral of the story is use your card and pay your entire statement balance before the due date    now how much will this impact your credit score   it 's tough to say   utilization is not a bad thing until it 's a big number   i 've read that 70 utilization and over is really the point at which lenders will raise an and under 30 is considered excellent if you have one card and $ 1,300 is a significant portion of your available limit then yes you should probably pay it down quickly   spend six or so months using the card and paying it then call your bank and ask for a credit line increase

congratulations on deciding to save money and choosing to invest it one thing to know about mutual funds including index funds is that they typically require a minimum investment of a few thousand dollars $ 3000 being a typical amount unless the investment is in an ira in which case $ 1000 might be a minimum in some cases automated monthly investments of $ 50 or $ 100 might need to be set up if you are beginning with a small balance there is nothing wrong with your approach you now should go and look at the various requirements for specific index funds the fidelity and vanguard families are good choices and both offer very low cost index funds to choose from but different funds can have different requirements regarding minimum investments etc you also have a choice of which index you want to follow the s&p 500 index midcap indexes small cap indexes total stock market indexes etc but your choice might be limited   until you have more money to invest because of minimum investment rules etc    most important after you have made your choice i urge you to not look every day or even every month to see how your investment is doing you will save yourself a lot of anxiety and will save yourself from making wrong decisions   far too many investors ignore the buy low sell high and pull money out of what should be long term investments at the first of a downturn and end up buying high and selling low finally the time is approaching when most stock funds will be declaring dividends and capital gains distributions if you invest now you may end up with a paper profit on which you will have to pay taxes in   non tax advantaged accounts on your 2012 tax return this is called buying a dividend and so you might want to spend some time investigating now but actually make the investment in late december after your chosen fund has made its distributions the date for this will be on the fund 's web site or in early 2013

to understand the twist you need to understand what the yield curve is   you must also understand that the price of debt is inverse to the interest rate so when the price of bonds or notes or bills rises that means the current price goes up and the yield to maturity has gone down   currently early 2012 the short term rate is low close to zero the tools the fed uses setting short term rates for one is exhausted as their current target is basically zero for this debt but my mortgage is based on 10yr rates not 1 yr or 30 day money the next step in the fed 's effort is to try to pull longer term rates down by buying back 10 year notes in this quantity the fed impacts the yield at that point on the curve buying remember supply demand pushes the price up and for debt a higher price equates to lower yield to raise the money to do this they will sell short term debt these two transactions effectively try to twist the curve to pull long term rates lower and push the economy

the only fair thing to do is to let each of you pay their own loans that way your brother will probably get out of debt faster and starts saving or investing assuming equal down payments while you 'll be stuck with your loan for a while longer if you want to minimize the interests you have to pay you could simply borrow money from your brother that way he 'll contribute towards your loans and you will know exactly how much you owe him your brother may lend you money interest free or you could agree on an interest rate which is lower than what you pay on your loans which will somewhat compensate your brother and still be beneficial to you it still wo n't be fair though because your brother might be able to invest his extra money with better interest rate and lending money to you would prevent that

if this is something you plan to continue doing it would make sense to create it as it 's own business entity and then to get non profit status eg    otherwise i 'm pretty sure you have to think of it as you receiving the money as a sole proprietor and file a couple more tax forms at the end of the year i think it 's a schedule c.   so essentially if you bring in $ 10,000 then you spend that $ 10,000 as legit business expenses for your venture your schedule c would show no profit and would n't pay taxes on it but you do have to file that form operating this way could have legal implications should something happen and you get sued having the proper business entity setup could help in that situation

the simple answer is technically bonds do n't have earnings hence no p e. what i think the op is really asking how do i compare stock and bond etfs some mature stocks exhibit very similar characteristics to bonds so at the margin if you are considering investing between 2 such investments that provide stable income in the form of dividends you might want to use the dividend price ratio d p of the stock and compare it to the dividend yield of the bond if you go down to the basics both the bond and the stock can be considered   the present value of all future expected cashflows the cash that accrues to the owner of the stock is future dividends and for the bond is the coupon payments if a company were to pay out 100 of its earnings then the dividend yield d p would be conveniently e p. for a company with p e of 20 that paid out it 's entire earnings one would expect d p = 1/20 = 5 this serves as a decent yard stick in the short term ~ 1 year to compare mature stock etfs with stable prospects vs bond funds since the former will have very little expected price growth think utilities hence they both compete on the cashflows they throw off to the investor this comparison stops being useful for stock etfs with higher growth prospects since expected future cashflows are much more volatile this comparison is also not valid in the long term since bond etfs are highly sensitive to the yield curve interest rate risk and they can move substantially from where they are now

i have credit card debt of about $ 5000   that 's the answer right there you told us the has no match the next highest priority would be credit card debt that 's costing you interest you did n't mention the rate on the card i 'm assuming it 's 8 or more   as far as your balance sheet the bottom line is concerned pay off a 10 debt is the same as earning 10 on your money if anyone promises you a higher return with a different investment i 'd run the other way we hope the market i.e. the us stock market as measured by a broad index say the s&p 500 will return 8 10%/yr over the long term but this is n't guaranteed paying off that credit card will save you the interest every year and free up the payments to invest elsewhere   in response to 's comment crazy no human nature and emotion is what it is i honestly do n't know how to address some of it years ago i was in a similar situation with a reader who had a $ 5000 emergency account yet had $ 5000 in credit card debt i had a tough time getting my head around why it was n't obvious this made no sense in your case i might suggest you pay the card down to below $ 1000 and have the credit line reduced paying high interest on $ 5 k makes no sense at any point in one 's life at least a can dig his way out and learn a lesson a pre retiree should n't be throwing this money away

as anecdotal experience we have a credit account in my name as offered by bank 's marketing before i could qualify by common rules for i have an account there for years so they knew my history and reliability dynamics i guess and my wife is subscribed as a secondary user to the same credit account with a separate card so we share the same limits e.g. max month usage overdraft and benefits bank 's discounts and bonuses when usage passes certain thresholds and it 's easier to gain these points together than alone so in the end maintenance of the card costs zero or close to that on most months while the card is in a program to get discounts from hundreds of shops and even offers a free or discounted airport lounge access in some places but the bonus program is just that benefits come and go as global economics changes e.g. we had free car assistance available for a couple of years but it is gone since last tariff update generally it is beneficial for us to do all transactions including rent etc via these two credit cards to the same account and then recharge its overdraft as salaries come in we have an up to 50 days period till 20th of next calendar month with no penalties on having taken the loans but if we ever did that then tens of yearly percents would kick in using the card(s for daily ops there is a play on building up the credit history as well while we do n't really need the loans to get from month to month it helps build an image in the face of credit organizations which can help secure e.g. favorable mortgage rates and other contract conditions which are out of pocket money range i 'd say it is not only a we against the system sort of game though as it sort of trains our own financial discipline every month we have a chance to go over our spendings to see what we did and so we more regularly think about it in the end so the bank probably benefits from dealing with more educated less random customers when it comes to the bigger loans regarding internet we tend to trust more to a debit card which we populate with pocket money sufficient for upcoming or already placed blocked transactions after all a malicious shop can not sip off thousands of credit money but only as much as you 've pre allocated there on debit

not exactly there are a few ways to manage your taxes with investments 1 for most investments you get taxed on any gain in value in the investment or dividends paid by that investment most investments with some exceptions for mutual funds you do n't take the tax hit until you sell the investment and realize the gain for bonds cds and other cash type investments you have to pay taxes in the year they pay out the interest or dividend 2 you can put money up to a certain limit in a traditional ira and can subtract that amount from your income for tax calculation for the year you invest it however you are going to pay taxes on it when you take the money out at retirement it really just delays the taxes 3 if you put the money in a roth ira you do n't get a tax break now but you do n't have to pay any taxes on the money or the gains when you take it out at retirement 4 the gains from some mutual funds can be tax exempt but that just saves you from paying tax on the increase in value   5 do n't fall for scams that try to use insurance policies as investments to avoid taxes the fees are which usually makes them a ripoff

tl;dr my understanding of the rules is that if you are required to register for gst earning more than $ 75k per annum you would be required to pay gst on these items to clarify firstly taxable income and goods and services tax are two different things any income you receive needs to be considered for income tax purposes whether or not it ends up being taxable income would be too much to go into here but generally you would take your expenses and any deductions away from your income to arrive at what would generally be the taxable amount an accountant will help you do this income tax is paid by anyone who earns income over the tax free threshold by contrast goods and services tax is a tax paid by business of which you are running one of course this is passed on to the consumer but it 's the business that the payment to the tax office however gst is n't required to be charged and paid in all cases the key in your situation is first determining whether you need to register for gst or whether indeed you already have if you earn less than $ 75,000 per year no need to register if you do earn more than that through your business or you have registered anyway then the next question is whether your items are gst free the ato says that some education courses and course materials are gst free whether this applies to you or not i 'm obviously not going to be able to comment on so i would advise getting an accountant 's advice on this or at the very least call the ato or browse their legal database thirdly are your sales connected with australia the ato says that a sale of something other than goods or property is connected with australia if the thing is done in australia or the seller makes the sale through a business they carry on in australia both of these appear to be true in your case so in summary if you are required to register for gst you would be required to pay gst on these items i am not a financial advisor or a tax accountant and this is not financial advice

i 'll be happy to edit when you provide answers to the question i posed in the comments   given the choice and i assume there is no other i 'd take a loan from the 401(k vs a withdrawal   you withdraw $ i 'll assume 25 bracket as you 're planning at least a $ 200 k house hopefully your taxable income is above $ 38 k the 25 line for singles the tax and penalty is 35 total federal you net $ and you have $ 40 k less in the retirement account in 40 years at 10 average growth that 's $ 1.8 m you wo n't have in your 401(k and as littleadv stated no deposits for 6 months meaning no matching there 's a few more thousand you 'll lose   you borrow $ 20k. your 401(k will see a return on the $ 20k that 's better than the short bond account 4 5 vs less than 1 you are short $ 6 k but in return have paid no tax no penalty etc i respect those who are strongly anti loan but even they would agree this is the far lesser of 2 evils    the above is pretty generic there are better choices but your cpa friend 's advice is nearly as bad as it gets by the way the tax you 'll save once you have the mortgage has nothing to do with that 10 penalty say you bought the house with cash as many would be happy to do you 'd pay the penalty for the 401(k withdrawal but have no mortgage deduction if you had the 20 you still have a loan and the deduction but no penalty for taking his bad advice   my advice is to take that refund and use it to pay the loan faster

prior to having children we did exactly what you describe   we would visit my mother in law about four to six times a year a each way trip for a weekend   we 'd simply rent a car drive down drive back return it out $ 150 or so for the weekend a total of under $ 1000 a year far cheaper than owning you should factor in whether you will save money though on things you might not immediately consider   will you spend less on groceries in particular if you can drive to costco or sam 's club or even just to a regular grocery store   i doubt you 'll save the cost of the car $ as you say but it 's possible it will factor into the mix i definitely would discourage purchasing a new car if you 're considering the financial side primarily   i suspect you can get a used car maybe the $ 10k car you would've sold and spend more like $ 1000 a year on it or less   i do n't know if i 'd go to the $ 5000 level as those in comments suggested as if you 're doing long trips you want something with higher than average reliability but even a car like a 5 year old mid level sedan easily costing you less than $ 10k would be fine and likely sell in 5 years for $ 5k itself while hopefully not having too much maintenance especially if you choose something with lower mileage shop around   but even with those assumptions 20 days a year of rental which you can probably get less than $ 50 rates on particularly if you look at some of the car sharing options and enterprise both allow you to do longer term rentals for reasonable prices seems like a fine deal compared to the hassle of owning

as the comments above have been trying to get across the prospective employer is offering to pay you for the bonus unvested compensation that you would be losing by jumping ship right now to go work for them   they are not offering to buy any securities that you already hold regardless of whether they 're profitable or unprofitable example 1 you participate in your current company 's 401(k and your company matches your contributions at 50   however the matching funds are not yours immediately they vest in increments until you have been at the company for 5 years   let 's say you 've been there for 3 years and have contributed $ 50 k to the plan   your company has matched you at $ 25 k but only 60 of that $ 15 k has vested   if you leave right now for the new employer you 're leaving $ 10 k behind   so the new employer might offer to buy out i.e. pay you that $ 10 k to help encourage you to switch now   you might then counter their offer by pointing out that if you stay where you are that $ 10 k is coming to you tax deferred whereas their $ 10 k signing bonus would be taxed   so you ask for $ 15 k instead example 2 you work for a wall street investment bank   each december you receive a performance bonus   since you began working there your three yearly bonuses have been in order $ 500 k $ 750 k and $ 1m.   it 's june so you 've worked halfway towards your next bonus   you have a lot of incentive to not leave your current employer   a competing employer may offer to buy you out of your anticipated bonus by giving you a $ 1.25 m signing bonus since you 'd almost certainly not be eligible for a performance bonus during your first year there   you might negotiate with them and say i 'm on track for $ 2 m this year and then they would figure out if you 're really worth that much to them so you can see this all has to do with the prospective employer trying to compensate you for any income you 're already counting on receiving from your current employer   by jumping ship now you would be foregoing that guaranteed expected income so the competitor wants to remove that anchor that might be holding you back from making the move stocks options that you already own are irrelevant to the prospective employer   since you would n't be giving those up by changing jobs there 's no reason for them to factor into the equation

i personally found the for dummies books on property investment very helpful and a great primer i found them unbiased and very informative laying out the basic principles depending on your knowledge it can provide you with enough of a foundation to have an informed conversation with banks real estates etc   watch the markets for a while at least 6 months to know what prices vendors will be expecting and rents tenants will be expecting most property magazines will also contain a suburb summary in the back   when you get closer to purchase make sure to ask your bank for the rp data reports on the properties you are looking at the banks will typically provide these for free i also set out some points for myself which i made clear for myself at the beginning this might provide a good starting point and really narrow down your research options as generic research on property investment can be overwhelming i ended up with a 3 in western sydney that has so far happily paid for itself building a good relationship with real estate agents and attending lots of open homes auctions and talking to other investors can only help   i was once told if you attend free property investment seminars you will always learn at least one new thing be it statistics methodologies finance options etc with that in mind always keep a level head leave your wallet at home and do n't sign up to anything   at the end of the day keep a cool head do n't stop reading and rush nothing

drips come to mind as something that may be worth examining if you take the microsoft example consider what would happen if you bought additional shares each year by re investing the dividends and the stock also went up over the years a combination of capital appreciation in the share price plus the additional shares purchased over time can produce a good income stream over time the key is to consider how long are you contributing how much are you contributing and what end result are you expecting as some companies can have larger dividends if you look at reits for example

what do you mean not coming back it seems to be coming back to 1990 prices but not fast enough i 'd love to see it come back to 1970 prices   i do n't understand it when people say that housing is not improving when prices go lower when gas is cheaper as far as my budget is concerned it 's improving when food is cheaper it 's also improving of course this is assuming it 's really cheaper and not some artifact of unhealthy war or simply costing fewer us dollars due to fiscal manipulation housing improves when prices go down because it improves my chances of being able to afford one   if lower prices are caused by demographics student debt and no jobs i say it ca n't come soon enough i want it

as someone who has a very similar debt amount and environment new grad nice new paying job want a car etc i 'd like to share something with you life has unexpected costs luckily i did n't buy that new car the first few months out of college like i had planned to i 'm glad that i did n't because as a fledgling adult despite having lived on my own while in college while working part to full time there are some things you just do n't realize until it either happens or it happens to someone else here are some of those things i could go on but i wo n't $ 95 k is good money and i would definitely recommend spending it a bit to enjoy yourself but i would honestly tell you that taking your monthly expenses adding a few hundred on top of that and then multiplying   that sum by 3 would be a smart savings amount before picking up a car loan maybe that 's an excessive savings but i 've seen way too many people burn out over their cost of living and their failure to adjust appropriately when shit hits the fan so instead of having to deal with the stab at your pride when having to lower the cost quality of living that you 'll probably grow accustomed to at a $ 95 k salary just prepare for the worst   oh and did i mention a new job is not a secure job consider yourself to likely be the first asset dropped from the company if even the tiniest thing goes wrong i know way too many people who were fresh hires at intel boeing and a few other big tech companies that pay around what you make and despite being bad asses in college they were dropped like a bad habit when their employers hit rough patches to those even more experienced than me please feel free to add to the list i 'd personally love to know them myself

from my recollection of warren buffett 's book warren buffett and the art of arbitrage the following factors determine the difference between the market price of a stock and the future expected price of an acquisition or merger time assuming the deal will close the market price should approach the offer price as the closing date approaches the fact that there is a 14 spread partially reflects the time value of money probability things could happen between now and closing date which could derail the deal the higher the spread the more likely the market thinks the deal will not occur for example lo shareholders could reject the offer saying it is too low or anti trust regulators could say the deal is anti competitive part of this 14 spread indicates the probability of the deal completing

i 'm not sure if you are including the use of credit cards in the intent of your   however i will give you some good reasons i use them even when i can pay cash 1 i get an interest free loan for almost 30 days as long as i do n't carry balances 2 i get a statement detailing where i am spending my money that is helpful for budgeting i 'd never keep track to this level of detail if i were using cash 3 many cards offer reward programs that can be used for cash back 4 it helps maintain my credit rating for those times i need to buy something and pay it off over time car house etc 5 not so much an issue for me personally but for people that live paycheck to paycheck it might help to time your cash outflows to match up with your inflows for a business i think it is mostly a cash flow issue that is in a lot of b2b type businesses customers can pay very slowly managing their own cash flows so your revenue can sometimes lag quite a bit behind the expenses that were associated with them e.g payroll a business line of credit can smooth out the cash flow especially for companies that do n't have a lot of cash reserves

buying or selling a futures contract means that you are entering into a contractual agreement to buy or sell the contracted commodity or financial instrument in the contracted amount the contract size at the price you have bought or sold the contract on the contract expire date maturity date   it is important to understand that futures contracts are tradeable instruments meaning that you are free to sell or buy back your contract at any time before the expiry date for example if you buy 1 lot 1 contract of a gold future on the comex exchange for the contract month of december 2016 then you entering into a contract to buy 100 ounces the contract size of gold at the price at which you buy the contract not the spot price on the day of expiry when the contract comes to maturity   the december 2016 gold futures contract has an expiry date of 28 december   you are free to trade this contract at any time before its expiry by selling it back to another market participant   if you sell the contract at a price higher than you have purchased it then you will realise a profit of 100 times the difference between the price you bought the contract and the price you sold the contract where 100 is the contract size of the gold contract   similarly if you sell the contract at a price lower than the price you have purchased it then you will realise a loss commissions paid will also effect your net profit or loss if you hold your contract until the expiry date and exercise your contract by taking or making delivery then you are obliged to buy or sell 100 ounces of gold at the price at which you bought or sold the contract not the current spot price so long as your contract is open i.e. prior to the expiry date and so long as you own the contract you are required to make a good faith deposit to show that you intend to honour your contractual obligations   this deposit is usually called initial margin   typically the initial margin amount will be about 2 of the total contract value for the gold contract   so if you buy or sell one contract for 100 ounces of gold at say $ an ounce then the total contract value will be $ and your deposit requirement would be about $ 2,500   the initial margin is returned to you when you sell or buy back your futures contract or when you exercise your contract on expiry in addition to initial margin you will be required to maintain a second type of margin called variation margin   the variation margin is the running profit or loss you are showing on your open contract for the sake of simplicity lets look only at the case where you have purchased a futures contract   if the futures price is higher than your contract buy price then you are showing a profit on your current position and this profit the variation margin will be used to offset your initial margin requirement conversely if the futures price has dropped below your contracted buy price then you will be showing a loss on your open position and this loss the variation margin will be added to your initial margin and you will be called to put up more money in order to show good faith that you intend to honour your obligations   note that neither the initial margin nor the variation margin are accounting items   in other words these are not postings that are debited or credited to the ledger in your trading account   so in some sense you do n't have to pay anything upfront but you do need to put up a refundable deposit to show good faith

i would not claim to be a personal expert in rental property i do have friends and family and acquaintances who run rental units for additional income and/or make a full time living at the rental business   as joetaxpayer points out rentals are a cash eating business you need to have enough liquid funds to endure uncertainty with maintenance and vacancy costs often a leveraged rental will show high roi or cagr but that must be balanced by your overall risk and liquidity position i have been told that a good rule of thumb is to buy in cash with a target roi of 10 of course ymmv and might not be realistic for your market it may require you to do some serious bargain hunting which seems reasonable based on the stagnant market you described some examples the main point here is assessing the risk associated with financing real estate the roi or cagr of a financed property looks great but consider the net income a few expensive maintenance events or vacancies will quickly get you to a negative cash flow multiply this by a few rentals and your risk exposure is multiplied too   note that i did not factor in appreciation based on op information cash purchase with some very rough estimates based on op example net income = rent tax = $ per year finance purchase rough estimate with 20 down net income = rent tax = $ 7500 per year

you 're partially correct at least in my understanding of this yes the tax credit can be carried forward to future years but since it is non refundable it will reduce your tax liability solely depending on your tax situation this may result in a bigger refund or it may not in an example if you 've had $ 3 k withheld from your paycheck toward your income tax and this is also an accurate reflection if your tax liability then taking the would reduce your tax liability enabling you to be eligible for a refund due to having already pre paid more tax than you 're liable for

seems like the straightforward answer is to call the provider and ask   they should be able to tell you if you owe them or not   unfortunately with small providers there is always a chance they wo n't get even that right i would confirm exactly why they think you do n't owe them anything if in fact you do n't medical providers can go after you for years later depending on your state so do n't assume just because it 's been months that they wo n't eventually   smaller providers are n't terribly organized but they do usually eventually go after most of those who owe them

does that justify the purpose that is for individual banks to decide no bank would pay for daily expenditure if you are saying primary salary you are spending on so your declaration is right you are looking at funding your via loan and you are earning enough for living and paying of the loan i noticed that a lot of lenders do not lend to applicants whose purpose is to finance the tuition for post secondary education this could be because the lenders have seen larger percentage defaults when people opt for such loans it could be due to mix of factors like the the drag this would cause to an individual who may not benefit enough in terms of higher salary to repay the loan or moves out of country getting a better job if it is education loan have you looked at getting scholarships or student loans

yes but only if they 're looking for investors you would need to contact them directly unless you 're looking to invest a significant sum they may not be interested in speaking with you think at least 6 figures maybe 7 depending on their size and needs this is otherwise known as being a venture capitalist some companies do n't want additional investors because the capital is n't yet needed and they do n't want to give up shares in the profit control alternatively you could try and figure out which investment groups already have a stake in the company you 're interested in if those companies are publicly traded you could buy stocks for their company with the expectation that their stock price will increase if the company you know of does well in the long run

you should hire a lawyer the fact that they told you your personal information shows that they actually had it and are not which is a good thing the fact that they mislead you means that their intentions are not pure which is not surprising coming from a collection agency of course when dealing with collections or any matter of significance for that matter do n't rely on their recording of the call because they can always conveniently lose it make sure to write down every single detail discussed including the date and time of the call and the id name of the person on the other side if possible make your own recording notifying them of it of course it 's too late to record the calls now but do try to as much information as possible to provide to your lawyer to deal with it in the end of the day they will either provide you with the recording and then you might be surprised to hear that what they said was not in fact what you thought they said and it was just your wishful thinking it is very possible to be indeed the case or claim we lost it and then it will be a problem to either of you to prove who said what but they 'll have the better hand having better lawyers in convincing the court that you 're the one trying to avoid paying your debts that is why proper representation at all stages is important as to the bankruptcy it wo n't help for student loans student loans is one of the very few types of debts you ca n't really run away from you have to solve this the sooner the better get a professional advice for the future and for the other readers you should have gotten the professional advice before defaulting on these loans and certainly after the first call

one thing that has not been pointed out as a disadvantage of using credit cards   people tend to spend more   you can see this study and this one plus about 500 others   on average people tend to spend about 17 more with credit cards then with cash   this amount any perks one gets by having a credit card    the safest way to use one is to only use them for purchases where you can not make a decision to spend more   one example would be for utility bills that do n't charge a fee or at the gas pump using them at amazon might have you upgrade your purchase or add some extra items   using them at restaurants might encourage you to order an extra drink or two   using them at the coffee shop might have you super size your coffee or add a    of course this extra spending could lead you into a debt cycle exacerbating the financial hit many struggle with   please tread carefully if you decide to use them

as pointed out in a comment it would be more natural to get a regular mortgage on the second house which is essentially using the second house as collateral for its own loan   if you are to use the first house either mortgage it or get a home equity line of credit on it and use that money to buy the second house the relative merits of the options may depend in part on where you live whether or not you live in the homes and the relative cost of the two properties   for example in the us first and second homes get preferred tax treatment in addition to rates that are typically better than commercial loans including mortgages for investment properties   if you 're going to get a better rate and pay less taxes on one option and not on the others that 's definitely something to weigh

the reason to put more money down or accept a shorter maximum term is because the bank the deal or fails to sour it in some fashion   for example typically if there is less than 20 down you have to pay an premium called private mortgage insurance which makes it bad deal but i see banks offering the same rate for a mortgage as for a 30-year one and i think fools and their money   take the 30-year and if you feel like it pay more every month   although why you would feel like it i do n't know since it 's very difficult to get that money back if you need it

there is one other factor that i have n't seen mentioned here   it 's easy to assume that if you buy a stock then someone else another stock owner must have sold it to you   this is not true however because there are people called market makers whose basic job is to always be available to buy shares from those who wish to sell and sell shares to those who wish to buy   they could be selling you shares they just bought from someone else but they also could simply be issuing shares from the company itself that have never been bought before this is a super oversimplified explanation but hopefully it illustrates my point

i ca n't speak to your broader question about stocks in general but in several years tracking aapl closely i can tell you that there 's little apparent pattern to when their earnings call will be or when it will be announced what little i do know   aapl 's calls tend to occur on a tuesday more than any other day of the week   it 's announced roughly a month in advance but has been announced w/ less notice   it has a definite range of dates in which it occurs typically somewhere in the 3rd week of the new quarter plus or minus a few days more broadly for 1 given the underlying nature of what an option is then yes the day an earnings call date is announced could certainly influence the iv price of options but only for options that expire inside the grey area ~2 weeks long window in which the call could potentially occur   options expiring outside that grey area should experience little to no price change in reaction to the announcement of the date unless the date was itself surprising e.g. an earlier date would increase the premium on earlier dated options a later date would increase the premium for later dated options as for 2 the exact date will probably always be a mystery but the main factors are   the historical pattern of earnings call dates and announcements of those dates which you can look up for any given company   when the company 's quarter ends   potentially some influence in how long it takes the company to close out their books for the quarter some types of businesses would be faster than others   any special considerations for this particular quarter that affect reporting ability and finally    a surprise of an earnings call occurring later than usual is rarely going to be a good sign for the underlying security and the expectation of catastrophe while the underlying may also cause a disproportionate rise in ivs prices due to fear

q will i have to submit the accounts for the swiss business even though i m not on the payroll and the business makes hardly any profit each year i can of course get our accounts each year but they will be in swiss german you will have to submit on your income from the business   the term partnership refers to a specific business entity type in the u.s.   i 'm not sure if you 're using it the same way   in a partnership in the u.s. you pay income tax on your share of the partnership 's income whether or not you actually receive income in your personal account   there 's not enough information here to know if that applies in your case in the u.s. the partnership itself does not pay income tax it is a disregarded entity for tax purposes with the tax liability passed through to the partners as individuals q will i need to have this translated is there any format procedure to this will it have to be translated by my swiss accountants and if so which parts of the documentation need to be translated as regards language you will file a tax return on a u.s. form presumably in english   you will not have to submit your account information on any other form so the fact that your documentation is in german does not matter   the only exception that comes to mind is that you could potentially get audited just like anyone else filing taxes in the u.s. in which case you might need to produce your documentation   that situation is rare enough that i would n't worry about it though   i 'm not sure if they 'd take it in german or force you to get a translation i was told that if i sell the business and property after i a that i will be liable to 15 tax of the profit i 'd made i also understand that any tax paid on selling in switzerland will be deducted from the 15 q is this correct the long term capital gains rate is 15 for most people at very high incomes it is 20   it sounds like you would qualify for long term held for greater than 1 year capital gains in this case although the details might matter there is a foreign tax credit but i 'm not completely sure if it would apply in this case if forced to guess i would say that it does   if you search for foreign tax credit and irs you should get to the information that you need pretty quickly i will effectively have all the paperwork for this as we 'll need to do the same in switzerland but again it will be in swiss german q would this be a problem if its presented in swiss german even in this case you will not need to submit any of your paperwork to the irs unless you get audited   see earlier comments

there is a term for this if you google house hacking you will get lots of articles and advice   some of it will pertain to multifamily properties but a good amount should be owner occupied and renting bedrooms i would play with a mortgage calculator like what s my payment   include principle interest taxes and insurance see how much it will cost   at 110k your monthly fixed payments will depend on a number of factors down payment interest real estate tax rate and insurance cost but $ would be a decent guess in my area   going off that with two roommates willing to pay $ 500 a month you would have no living expenses except any maintenance or utilities   with your income i would expect you could make the payment alone if needed and it may be needed so it seems fairly low risk from my perspective you need somewhere to live you are used to roommates and you can pay the entire cost yourself in a worst case some more things to consider insurance will be more expensive you want to ensure you as the landlord you are covered if anything happens   if a tenant burns down your house or trips and falls and decides to sue you insurance will protect you    capital expenses capex replacing things as they wear out on a home the roof siding flooring and all water heater etc have a lifespan and will need to be replaced   on rental properties a portion of rent should be set aside to replace these things in the future   if a roof lasts costs $ 8,000 and your roof is old you should be setting aside $ 70 a month so in the   future when this know expense comes up it is not a hardship taxes yes there is a special way to report income from an arrangement like this   you will fill out a schedule e form in addition to your regular tax documents you will also be able to write off a percent of housing expenses and depreciation on the home   i have been told it is not a simple tax situation and to consult a cpa that specializes in real estate

you might want to bring this fancy new irs rule to your employer 's attention   if your employer sets it up an after tax 401(k plan allows employees to contribute after tax money above the $ 18k year limit into a special 401(k that allows deferral of tax on all earnings until withdrawal in retirement now if you think about it that 's not all that special on its own   since you 've already paid tax on the contribution you could imitate the above plan all by yourself by simply investing in things that generate no income until the day you sell them and then just waiting to sell them until retirement   so basically you 're locking up money until retirement and getting zero benefit but here 's the cool part   the new irs rule says you can roll over these contributions into a roth 401(k or roth ira with no extra taxes or penalties   and a roth plan is much better because you do n't have to pay tax ever on the earnings   so you can contribute to this after tax plan and then immediately roll over into a roth plan and start earning tax free forever now the article i linked above gets some important things slightly wrong   it seems to suggest that your company is not allowed to create a brand new 401(k bucket for these special after tax contributions   and that means that you would have to mingle pre tax and post tax dollars in your existing traditional 401(k which would just completely destroy the usefulness of the rollover to roth   that would make this whole thing worthless however i know from personal experience that this is not true   your company can most definitely set up a separate after tax plan to receive all of these new contributions   then there 's no mingling of pre tax and post tax dollars and you can do the rollover to roth with the click of a button no taxes or penalties owed now this new plan still sits under the overall umbrella of your company 's total retirement plan offerings   so the total amount of money that you can put into a traditional 401(k a roth 401(k and this new after tax 401(k both your personal contributions and your company 's match if any is still limited to $ 53k per year and still must satisfy all the non discrimination rules for hces etc so it 's not trivial to set up and your company will almost certainly not be able to go all the way to $ 53k but they could get a lot closer than they currently do

i think it 's wise to account for those inevitable but unpredictable expenses like car house repairs and abnormal medical bills when deciding on your emergency fund amount   so if you average $ 100/month for car repairs and you have a 6-month emergency fund then part of that fund is $ 600 for car repairs if your total annual out of pocket for health insurance is $ then emergency fund gets $ 2,500 and so on this way you add cushion to your emergency fund to handle those unpredictable but inevitable expenses without setting up a bunch of separate accounts it does n't have to be inflexible either i know my furnace and air conditioner are way past their expected life so i 'm keeping a larger than normal emergency fund ultimately it 's personal preference to me cash is all the same no matter what account it 's in but other people do best by keeping some logical physical separation of funds intended for different purposes

being long the s&p index etf you can expect to make money the index itself will never crash because the individual stocks in it are simply removed when they begin performing badly this is not to say that the s&p index wo n't lose 80 of its value in an instant or over a few trading sessions if circuit breakers are considered but even in the 2008 correction the s&p still traded far above book value with this in mind you have to realize that despite common sentiment the indexes are hardly representative of the market they are just a derivative and as you might be aware derivatives can enable financial tricks far removed from reality regarding index funds if a small group of people decide that 401k 's are performing badly then they will simply rebalance the components of the indexes with companies that are doing well the headline will be s&p makes another record high today so although panic selling can disrupt the order book especially during periods of illiquidity with the current structure the stock market being based off of three composite indexes can never crash because there will always exist a company that is not exposed to broad market fluctuations and will be performing better by fundamentals and share price similarly you collect dividends from the index etfs you can also sell covered calls on your holdings the cboe has a chart through the 2008 crisis showing your theoretical profit and loss if you sold calls 2 standard deviations out of the money at every monthly interval if you are going to be holding an index etf for a long time then you should n't be concerned about its share price at all since the returns would be pretty abysmal either way but it should suffice for hedging inflation

agree with it is rare larger cap examples include nokia and holdings   if cash exceeds market cap that means total debt is greater than ev the value of the operating assets if the debt is partially repaid matures the equity is ok but if management is crap and the cash is spent at an below the interest rate on the debt now you have a situation where the net debt exceeds the value of the operating assets the credit quality suffers debt trades down you need to in order to avoid bankruptcy   the above assumes debt is greater than cash situations where cash exceeds market cap and debt is less than cash i.e. a negative ev are exceedingly rare in larger companies and are either a a wonderfully attractive mispricing or b market views management as so awful that the cash will get burnt up by the business and the value of that cash will be destroyed

the main reason for paying your mortgage off quickly is to reduce risk should a crisis happen   if you do n't have a house payment you have much higher cash flow every month and your day to day living expenses are much lower so if an illness or job loss happens you 'll be in a much better position to handle it you should have a good emergency fund in place before throwing extra money at the mortgage so that you can cover the bigger surprises that come along there is the argument that paying off your mortgage ties up cash that could be used for other things but you need to be honest with yourself would you really invest that money at a high enough rate of return to make up your mortgage interest rate after taxes   or would you spend it on other things   if you do invest it how certain are you of that rate of return   paying off the mortgage saves you your mortgage interest rate guaranteed finally there is the more intangible aspect of what it feels like to be completely debt free with no payments whatsoever   that feeling can be a game changer for people and it can free you up to do things that you could never do when you 're saddled with a mortgage payment every month

ask yourself the same question for furniture making would you feel more comfortable sitting in a chair that you made yourself versus one that you bought from a furniture store   how about one that you bought from ikea and assembled for an experienced competent furniture maker you might be able to make an equivalent chair for less money and be highly confident   for a diy builder you might be less confident but be willing to take more of a risk with the possibility of making a good chair for less money and gain experience on what not to do next time    the same applies to investing if you are highly confident in your own abilities diy investing may work better for you   for the general population however relying on experts to do the hard work and paying a little more for their services is probably a better option and gives you more confidence as for the second quote i 'm note sure there 's a causality there   if anything i think it 's the other way around people who have more money saved for retirement are more likely to use investment advisors

you ’ve really got three or four questions going here and it ’s clear that a gap in understanding one component of how bonds work pricing is having a ripple effect across the other facets of your question the reality is that everybody ’s answers so far touch on various pieces of your general question but maybe i can help by integrating so let ’s start by nailing down what your actual questions are   1 why do mortgage rates tend to increase when the published treasury bond rate increases i ’m going to come back to this because it requires a lot of building blocks 2 what ’s the math behind a bond yield increasing price falling   this gets complicated fast especially when you start talking about selling the bond in the middle of its time period many people that trade in bonds use financial calculators excel or pre calculated tables to simplify or even just approximate the value of a bond but here ’s a simple example that shows the math   let ’s say we ’ve got a bond that is issued by dell for $ 10,000 the company will pay it back in 5 years and it is offering an 8 rate interest payments will only be paid annually remember that the amount dell has promised to pay in interest is fixed for the life of the bond and is called the rate we can think about the way the payouts will be paid in the following table    as i ’m sure you know the value of a bond its yield comes from two sources the interest payments and the return of the principal but if you as an investor paid $ 14,000 for this bond you would usually be wrong you need to those amounts to take into account the time value of this is why when you are dealing in bonds it is important to know the coupon what is dell paying each period but it is also important to know your own personal discount rates this will vary from person to person and institution to institution but it is what actually sets the price you would buy this bond for   there are three general cases for the discount rate or the market rate first where the market rate = = the coupon rate this is known as par in bond parlance second where the market rate < the coupon rate this is known as premium in bond parlance third where the market rate > coupon rate this is known as a bond   but before we get into those in too much depth how does discounting work the idea behind discounting is that you need to account for the idea that a dollar today is not worth the same as a dollar tomorrow it ’s usually worth tomorrow you discount a lump sum like the return of the principal differently than you do a series of equal cash flows like the stream of $ 800 interest payments the formula for discounting a lump sum is   present value = future value of periods the formula for discounting a stream of equal payments is   present payment i = interest rate and n = number of periods cite investopedia so let ’s look at how this would look in pricing the pretend dell bond as a par bond first we discount the return of the $ 10,000 principal as 10,000 1 that equals $   next we discount the 5 equal payments of $ 800 as 800 i just plugged and but you can do that yourself that equals $ you may get slightly different numbers with rounding   so you add the two together and it says that you would be willing to pay $ + $ = $ 10,000 surprise when the bond is a par bond you ’re basically being compensated for the time value of money with the interest payments you purchase the bond at the face which is the principal that will be returned at the end   if you worked through the math for a 6 discount rate on an 8 coupon bond you would see that it ’s premium because you would pay more than the principal that is returned to obtain the bond vs 10,000 similarly if you work through the math for a 10 discount rate on an 8 coupon bond it ’s a bond because you will pay less than the principal that is returned for the bond vs 10,000   it ’s easy to see how an investor could hold our imaginary dell bond for one year collect the first interest payment and then sell the bond on to another investor the mechanics of the calculations are the same except that one less interest payment is available and the principal will be returned one year sooner so in both formulae   still with me now that we ’re on the same page about how a bond is priced we can talk about yield to maturity which is at the heart of your main question   bond yields like the ones you can access on cnbc or or wherever you may be looking are actually taking the reverse approach to this in these cases the prices are in that the sellers have listed the bonds for sale and specified the price since the coupon values are fixed already by whatever organization issued the bond the rate of return can be imputed from those values   to do that you just do a bit of algebra and swap present value and future value in our two equations   let ’s say that dell has gone private had an awesome year and figured out how to make robot unicorns that do wonderful things for all mankind you decide that now would be a great time to sell your bond after holding it for one year and collecting that $ 800 interest payment you think you ’d like to sell it for $ 10,500 since the principal return is fixed + 10,000 the number of periods is fixed 4 and the interest payments are fixed $ 800 but you ’ve changed the price something else has to adjust and that is the discount rate it ’s kind of tricky to actually use those equations to solve for this by hand you end up with two equations one unknown and set them equal so the easiest way to solve for this rate is actually in excel using the function = pmt pv fv nper = 4 pmt = 800 and hint to make sure that you catch the minus sign in front of the present value buyer pays now for the positive return of 10,000 in the future   that shows as the effective discount rate or rate of return for the investor that is the same thing as the yield to maturity it specifies the return that a bond investor would see if he or she purchased the bond today and held it to maturity   3 what factors in terms of supply and demand drive changes in the bond market i hope it ’s clear now how the tradeoff works between yields going up when prices go down and vice versa it happens because the coupon rate the number of periods and the return of principal for a bond are fixed so when someone sells a bond in the middle of its term the only things that can change are the price and corresponding yield discount rate   other commenters including you have touched on some of the reasons why the prices go up and down generally speaking it ’s because of the basics of supply and demand higher level of bonds for sale to be purchased by same level of demand will mean prices go down but it ’s not just because interest rates are going up and it has a lot more to do with the expectations for 1 risk 2 return and 3 future inflation sometimes it is action by the fed as joe taxpayer has pointed out if they sell a lot of bonds then the basics of higher supply for a set level of demand imply that the prices should go down prices going down on a bond imply that yields will go up i really hope that ’s clear by now this is a common monetary lever that the government uses to remove from the system in that they receive payments from an investor up front when the investor buys the bond from the fed and then the fed gradually return that cash back into the system over time   sometimes it is due to uncertainty about the future if investors at large believe that inflation is coming then bonds become a less attractive investment as the dollars received for future payments will be less valuable this could lead to a sell off in the bond markets because investors want to cash out their bonds and transfer that capital to something that will preserve their value under inflation here again an increase in supply of bonds for sale will lead to decreased prices and higher yields   at the end of the day it is really hard to predict exactly which direction bond markets will be moving and more importantly why if you figure it out move to new york or chicago or london and work as a trader in the bond markets you ’ll make a killing and if you ’d like i will be glad to drive your cars for you   4 how does the availability of money supply for banks drive changes in other lending rates   when any investment organization forms it builds its portfolio to try to deliver a set return at the lowest risk possible as a corollary to that it tries to deliver the maximum return possible for a given level of risk   when we ’re talking about a bank dumbcoder ’s answer is dead on banks have various options to choose from and a 10-year t bond is broadly seen as one of the least risky investments thus it is a benchmark for other investments   5 so now why do mortgage rates tend to increase when the published treasury bond yield rate increases the traditional residential 30-year mortgage is very similar to a bond investment there is a long term investment horizon with fixed cash payments over the term of the note but the principal is returned incrementally during the life of the loan   so since mortgages are more than the 10-year treasury bond they will carry a certain premium that is tied to how much more risky an individual is as a borrower than the us government   and here it is no one actually directly changes the interest rate on 10-year treasuries not even the fed the fed sets a price constraint that it will sell bonds at during its periodic auctions buyers bid for those and the resulting prices imply the yield rate if the yield rate for current 10-year bonds increases then banks take it as a sign that everyone in the investment community sees some sign of increased risk in the future this might be from inflation this might be from uncertain economic performance but whatever it is they operate with some rule of thumb that their 30-year mortgage rate for excellent credit borrowers will be the 10-year plus 1.5 or something and they publish their rates

these are two different ways of processing payments they go through different systems many times and are treated differently by the banks credit card issuers and the stores merchants pay different fees on transactions paid by debit cards and by credit cards debit transactions require pin and are deducted from your bank account directly in order to achieve that the transaction has to reach the bank in real time otherwise it will be declined this means that the merchant has to have a line of communications open to the relevant processor that in turn has to be able to connect to the bank and get the authorization all that while on line the bank verifies the pin authorizes the transaction and deducts the amount from your account while you 're still at the counter many times these transactions can not be reversed and the fraud protections and warranties are different from credit transactions credit transactions do n't have to go to your card issuer at all the merchant can accept credit payment without calling anyone and without getting prior authorizations even if the merchant sends the transaction for authorization with its processor if the processor can not reach the issuing bank they can still approve the transaction under certain conditions this is however never true with debit cards even if used as credit they 're not deducted from your bank account but accumulated on your credit card account they 're posted there when the actual transaction reaches the card issuer which may be many days and even many months after the transaction took place credit transactions can be reversed in some cases very easily and enjoy from a higher level of fraud protection in some countries and most if not all of the eu fraudulent credit transactions are never the consumer 's problem always the bank 's not so with debit transactions banks may be encouraging you to use debit for several reasons merchants will probably prefer credit because consumers will probably be better off with credit because

i would add to this that while everyone is right on trading there are certain special situations you could look into that could turn a profit in a relatively short time frame one month say    a recent example is realty finance i bought in at $ prior to a spinoff sold half the spinoff company at $ within a month and the other half the reit has since paid a 50 cent dividend and gone up to mid $ as well within a total of just over 2 months this admittedly sounds like bragging which is n't i just want to give an example of a short term position resulting in a gain and i do n't know any off the top of my head except the one i did recently    this is n't trading but it is a short term position that would have turned a profit with $ 1800 i still would n't recommend it considering commissions eats a sizable portion but if you want to take short term positions you do n't need as much as you would to be a day trader    i would read seth klarman 's margin of safety the sections on spinoffs and bankruptcy they provide some useful information on some short term positions however also be aware that you should be willing to hold any short term position as a long term position if it does not immediately work out by way of example i believed would go up post spinoff but the spinoff company stay the same instead stayed the same and the spinoff went up but was undervalued so i held it for another month    just my advice as far as learning use play money but if you never are going to have enough money to really trade with hopefully my info on short term positions is helpful

the short answer is that banking is complicated but the bank really does n't need your money because it can get it from the fed almost free it can only use 90 of the money you give the bank it can only make money on that 90 from very low risk and thus low return investments and as it has to show a profit to its shareholders it will take whatever cut it needs to off the top of the returns all of these things combine to make savings account interest roughly .05 in the us right now the longer answer all fdic insured banks which the us requires all depositor banks to be are subject to regulation by the federal reserve the very first rule that all banks must comply with is that depositor money can not be invested in things the fed terms risky this limits banks from investing your money in things that have high returns like stocks commodities and hedges because along with the high possible returns come high risk banks typically can only invest your savings in t debt and in certain fed approved aaa bonds which have very low risk and so very little return the investment of bank assets into risky market funds was a major contributor to the financial crisis with the repeal of the glass steagall act banks had been allowed to integrate their fdic insured depositor business with their investment banking business not fdic insured while still not allowed to bet on risky investments with deposits banks were using their own money retained profits corporate equity bond money to bet heavily in the markets and were investing depositor funds in faulty aaa rated investment objects like cdos when the housing market crashed banks had to pull out of the investment market and cash in hedges like credit default swaps to cover the depositor losses which sent a wave through the rest of the market banks really ca n't even loan your money out to people who walk in like you 'd think they would and which they traditionally used to do that 's how the savings and loan crisis happened when speculators took out huge loans to invest lost the cash declared bankruptcy and left the s&ls and ultimately the fdic on the hook for depositors money   so the upshot of all this is that the bank simply wo n't give you more on your money than it is allowed to make on it   in addition there are several tools that the fed has to regulate economic activity and three big ones play a part first is the federal funds rate this is the interest rate that the fed charges on loans made to other banks which is a primary source of day to day liquidity for these banks money paid as interest to the fed is effectively removed from the economy and is a way to reduce the money supply right now the ffr is .25 that 's one quarter of one percent which is effectively zero borrow a billion dollars $ from the fed for one month and you 'll pay them a $ banks lend to other banks at a rate based on the ffr called the interbank rate usually adding some fraction of a percent so the lending bank makes money on the loan this means that the banks can get money from the fed and from other banks very cheaply which means they do n't have to offer high interest rates on savings to entice individual depositors to save their money with the bank second is quantitative easing which just means the fed buys government bonds and pays for them with new money this happens all the time remember those interest charges on bank loans to keep the money supply stable the fed must buy t debt at least in the amount of the interest being charged otherwise the money leaves the economy and is not available to circulate the fed usually buys a little more than it collects in order to gradually increase the money supply which allows the economy to grow while controlling inflation having too much money and so making money worth less than what it can buy   what 's new is that the fed is increasing the money supply by a very large amount by buying bonds far in excess of the low rates it 's charging and at fixed prices determined by the yield the fed wants to induce in the markets in the first place with the fed buying so many there are fewer for institutions and other investors to buy this increases the demand driving down yields as investors besides the fed are willing to pay a similar price and remember that t debt is one of the main things banks are allowed to invest your deposits in inflation is n't a concern right now despite the large amount of new money being injected because the current economy is so lackluster right now that the new cash is just being sat upon by corporations and being used by consumers to pay down debt instead of what the fed and government want us to do hire update equipment buy houses and american cars etc in addition the spot market price for a t bond or any investment security is generally what the last guy paid by buying treasury debt gradually at a fixed price the fed can smooth out in the spot price that speculators may try to induce by making low buy offers on t debt to increase yields lastly the fed can tell banks that they must keep a certain amount of their deposits in reserve basically by keeping them in a combination of cash in the vault and in accounts with the fed itself this has a dual purpose higher reserve rates allow a bank to weather a run more people than usual wanting their money and thus reduces risk of failure an increased reserves amount also reduces the amount of money circulating in the economy because obviously if the banks have to keep a percentage of assets in cash they ca n't invest that cash banks are currently required to keep 10 of deposited assets the sum of all checking and savings accounts but not cds in cash this compounds the other problems with banks investing not only are they not getting a great return on your savings they can only use 90 of your savings to get it

the answer to your question is governed by the structure of the company and your ownership or lack thereof in the business   australian business can be structured the same way u.s. ones are as a sole proprietorship partnership llc or company   if you are only on the board and have no equity you can not be affected   you must have some amount of equity in the business to have any chance of being affected if the business is a sole proprietorship then the single individual running the business is personally responsible for all debt and the inability to pay obligations would result in personal bankruptcy which would in all likelihood affect your credit score it would in the u.s. if it is a partnership then anyone holding stock in the company is likewise personally responsible for a portion of the debt and can be subject to bankruptcy and credit score implications if the business is structured as a limited liability company or a corporation a stakeholder 's personal finances are separate from the business 's and their credit score can not be affected

the only downside is for the agents not you agents especially selling agents prefer the concession over the price reduction for their own interests   they get a commission on a higher purchase price   that and the recorded sales price for the house is a tad higher which incrementally increases the comps for the next sales when we moved the agent conditioned me to get ready to offer a concession should we decide to sell our previous home   we decided to rent that property and have someone else manage it but with regard to your questions the concessions are applied against your closing costs   when we bought our last house they specified caps on the closing costs so money will be typically be withheld or not contractually the concessions are n't a taxable gain   your basis in the property will be higher than if you get a price reduction but the lower basis hopefully means a higher capital gain when you sell

i generally agree with the other answers   regarding the bit about your loan from your parents your arrangement with your parents is certainly material to you getting another   loan   the mortgage application will probably require you to disclose all outstanding debt   obviously if you choose to omit it and your parents do n't tell it probably wo n't come up   but that would be unethical definitely and illegal probably    whether this will interfere with you getting a loan is another question but since it 's your only debt it will probably be ok

you seem to be on the right track   i feel though that it 's worth addressing your maintenance budget   even if both cars described in your question are from the same model year one has been in service 2x more one car has been on the road in weather twice as much as the other   i 'm not sure what 's being represented in the $ 6k of maintenance but a whole host of systems can require maintenance or replacement at 200k+ miles   a c compressor all sorts of rubber parts seals hoses belts computer systems stereo window regulators the list goes on   i do n't know at what point the battery on a hybrid needs to be replaced or what that replacement entails but likely the battery or the hybrid recharge system will require something after 200k miles of service   i would learn more about what actual maintenance a high mileage prius can experience to answer your question though at this level of used i do n't think the dealership adds anything to the equation   when you 're buying certified pre owned the dealership manufacturer relationship and warranty can be meaningful   when you 're buying a 100k+ miles car from a random small used car lot it might as well be a stranger on craigslist

i place 90 of the blame on carly and then the board that bitch was primed by her contract to gut and the company   when a board links a ceos remuneration to annual profit it makes unscrupulous individuals do things which have clear and obvious negative long term impacts but which will hike the annual profit for this year and another year or so but then turn badly negative   because carly is a little bitch and wanted to extract as much money as was humanly possible from her position at hp she on the most disastrous set of actions possible   the direct result is what we see now   ceo compensation should never be linked to profitability for an individual year but to their performance throughout their tenure and then beyond   it 's my belief a ceo should take a base salary of no more than 50 times the mean worker 's salary is not the average because that simply encourages the board to enrich the management team rather than the workers   if the company is profitable for a single year ceos should receive a large bonus say no more than 20 times the mean salary at the company   and 3 years after the ceo leaves he 'd be entitled to another round of payments base on long term performance of the company this means ceos have a duty and a very large responsibility to ensure that their replacement is actually a better ceo than they are   when board members leave there 's no incentive to them personally to ensure their replacement is even capable let alone excellent   the other issue i have with ceos is their stock options or stock grants i believe all companies should have strict rules about stock ownership by the board they must own a certain number of shares and those shares must be purchased before they join the board and demonstrably not by any mechanism which the company pays for   directors and officers with no personal investment interest in the performance of the company are a concern

it depends what rate mortgage you can get for any extra loans   if you remortgage you are likely to get a rate of 3.5 4 depending who you go with with deposit accounts in the uk around 1 yes you can get more by tying it up for longer but not a huge amount more clearly you 're better off not having a mortgage rather than money in the bank does your 8k income allow for tax if it does you are getting 6 return on the money tied up in the flat if you are getting 6 after tax on the invested money that 's way better than you would get on any left over cash paid into an investment borrowing money on a mortgage would cost you less than 6 so you are better off borrowing rather than selling the flat if you are getting 6 before tax depending on your tax rate it probably makes very little difference you 'd need to work out how much an extra 80k mortgage would cost you how much the 50k on deposit would earn you and how much you make after tax there is a different route set up a mortgage on the rental flat you can claim the interest payment off the flat 's income reduce your tax bill so the effective mortgage rate on the flat would be less than what you could get with a mortgage on the new house use the money from the flat 's mortgage to finance the difference in house price in fact from a tax view you may be better off having a mortgage free house and maxing out the mortgage on the flat so you can write off as much as possible against your tax bill all of the above assume that the flat is rented all the time the odd dry spell on the flat could influence the sums a lot all of the above assume that   your cash flow works whichever route you choose as no one on stack exchange has all of the numbers for your specific circumstances it may be worth talking to a tax accountant they could advise you properly knowing the numbers which makes the best sense for you in terms of overall cost cash flow risk and so on

your rate of return for paying off this loan is 9 and that 's guaranteed for reference the best rate of return on a 10-year fdic insured certificate of deposit today is 3 there 's definitely something out there with better returns than paying off your loans but there 's definitely not going to be anything with better risk adjusted returns than paying off your loans investors dream of guaranteed 9 rates of return if you had something that could provide a guaranteed 9 rate of return wannabe investors would be lining up at your door and tripping over each other to outbid each other until it actually closer to a 3 rate of return :p depending on whether your loans are tax deductible and what your inflation expectations are you could adjust those rates to make the comparison more accurate but at 3 vs 9 the picture 's pretty clear

here are the reasons i did not lease my current car when you lease you 're tied in at a monthly payment for 48 months or more the only way to get out of that payment is to transfer the lease or buy out the lease if you buy finance you can always sell the car or trade it in to get out of the payments or you can pay down more of the vehicle to lower the payments most leases calculate the cost of leasing based on the residual value of the vehicle often these values are far lower than the actual worth of the vehicle if you owned it for those months and sold it yourself so when you do the math the lease costs you more with today 's low financing rates

it is true that all else being equal you will pay a lower amount of total interest by paying down your highest interest rate debts first   however all else is not always equal   i 'm going to try to come up with some reasons why it might be better in some circumstances to pay your debts in a different order   and i 'll try to use as much math as possible   let 's say that your goal is to eliminate all of your debt as fast as possible   the faster you do this the lower the total interest that you will pay   now let 's consider the different methods that you could take to get there you could pay the highest interest first you could pay the lowest interest first or you could pay something in the middle first   no matter which path you choose the quicker you pay everything off the lower total interest you will pay   in addition to that the quicker you pay everything off the difference in total interest paid between the most optimal method and the least optimal method will be less   to put this in mathematical notation = 0 given that anything we can do to speed up the time it takes to get to debt free is to our advantage when paying large amounts of debt as fast as possible sacrifice is needed   and this means that psychology comes into play   i do n't know about you but for me the system makes everything easier   after all is what gets us to write answers here on se one way to do this is to eliminate individual debts as quickly as possible   for example let 's say that i 've got 10 debts   5 of them are for $ 1k each   3 of them are for $ 5k each 1 is a $ 20k car loan and 1 is a $ 100k mortgage   each one has a monthly payment let 's say that i 've got $ 3k sitting in the bank that i want to use to my debt reduction   i could pay all $ 3k toward one of my larger loans or i could immediately pay off 3 of my 10 loans   ignore interest for the moment and let 's say that we are going to pay off the smallest loans first   when i eliminate these three loans three of my monthly payments are also gone   now let 's say that with the money i was paying toward these eliminated debts and some other money i was able to scrape together $ 500 a month that i want to use toward debt reduction   in four months i 've eliminated the last two $ 1k debts and i 'm down to 5 debts instead of 10   achievement unlocked instead of this strategy i could have paid toward my largest interest rate   let 's say that was one of the $ 5k loans   i paid the $ 3k toward the bank to it and because i still had all the monthly payments after that i was only able to scrape together $ 400 a month extra toward debt reduction   in four months i still have 10 debts now let 's say that after these four months i have a bad month and some unexpected expenses come up   if i 've eliminated 5 of my debts my monthly payments are less and i 'll have an easier month then i would have had if i still had 10 monthly payments to deal with each time i eliminate a debt the amount extra i have each month to tackle the remaining debts gets bigger   and if your goal is eliminating debt quickly these early wins can really help motivate you on   it really feels like you are getting somewhere when your monthly bills go down   it also helps you with the debt free mindset   you start to see a future where you are n't sending payments to the banks each month   this method of paying your smaller debts first has been popularized in recent years by dave ramsey and he calls it the debt snowball method there might be other reasons why you would pick one debt over another to pay first   for example let 's say that one of your loans is with a bank that has terrible customer service   they do n't send you bills on time they process your payment late their website stinks they are a constant source of stress and you are getting sick of them   that would be a great reason to pay that debt first and never set foot in that bank again in conclusion if you have a constant amount of extra cash each month that you are going to use to reduce your debt and this will never change then yes you will save money over the long run by paying the highest interest debt first   however if you are trying to eliminate your debt as fast as possible and you are sacrificing in your budget sending every extra penny you can scrape together toward debt reduction the snowball method of knocking out the small debts first can help motivate you to continue to sacrifice toward your goal and can also ease the cash flow situation in difficult months when you find yourself with less extra to send in

when you leave an employer 401(k loans are immediately due or within 30 days or 60 days so maybe they are waiting to see if you will pay off your loan if you wanted to transfer the loan as well you need to talk to your new 401(k plan administrator to find out if this even possible if they say no and you do n't pay off the loan it will count as a premature distribution from your old 401(k plan and possibly be subject to excise tax in addition to income tax

forecasts of stock market direction are not reliable so you should n't be putting much weight on them   long term you can expect to do better in stocks but obtaining this better expected return has the danger of buying in to the market at a particularly bad moment leading to a substantially lower return   so mitigate that risk while moving in a big piece of cash by dollar cost averaging   an example would be to divide your cash hoard conceptually into say six pieces and invest each piece in the index fund two months apart   after a year you will have invested the whole sum at about the average of the index for the year

ah i see what you mean then   but if you die at 57 being hit by a bus those self invested funds wo n't help the general social welfare of the union instead 1/3 would go to some estate tax and the rest are left to the designated of your choosing    this system helps the general populace a bit more directly   that is the theory anyways   edit what i mean to say is you still perceive that money as your own like some compulsory retirement savings plan i see it more as tax revenue math little to no guarantee i will personally benefit from it directly any more than the general benefit it provides to this great union

real estate is not an investment but pure speculation rental income may make it look like an investment but if you ask some experienced investor you would be told to stay away from real estate unless it is for your own use if you believe otherwise then please read on another strong reason not to buy real estate right now is the low interest rates you should be selling real estate when the interest rates are so low not buying it you buy real estate when the interest rate cycle peaks like you would see in russia in months to come with 17 central bank rate right now and if it goes up a little more that is when it is time to start looking for a property in russia this thread sums it up nicely

because a paying down a liability and thus gaining asset equity is not technically an expense gnucash will not include it in any expense reports however you can abuse the system a bit to do what you want   the mortgage payment should be divided into principle interest and escrow tax insurance accounts for example a mortgage payment will then be a split transaction that puts money into these accounts from your bank account for completeness the escrow account will periodically be used to pay actual expenses which just moves the expense from escrow into insurance or tax this is nice so that expenses for a month are n't inflated due to a tax payment being made now this is all fairly typical and results in all but the principle part of the mortgage payment being included in expense reports the trick then is to duplicate the principle portion in a way that it makes its way into your expenses one way to do this is to create a principle expense account and also a fictional equity account that provides the funds to pay it every time you record a mortgage payment add a transfer from this equity account into the principle payments expense account this will mess things up at some level since you 're inventing an expense that does not truly exist but if you 're using gnucash more to monitor monthly cash flow it causes the income expense report to finally make sense example transaction split

your question is best asked of a tax expert not random people on the internet such an expert will help you ask the right questions   for example you did not point out the country or state in which you live   that matters    first point is that you will not pay tax on 60 k its expensive to transact real estate so your net proceeds will be closer to   also you can probably the deduct the costs of improvements you implied that you really like this rental property   if that is the case why would you sell ever   this home could be a central part of your financial independence plan   so keep it until you die   iirc when it passes to your heirs a new cost basis is formed thereby not passing the tax burden onto them assuming the property is located in the us

hobby expenses are not tax deductible   business expenses are but only if it 's a bona fide business   first they look at profitability if you reported a net profit i.e. paid taxes in your first 3 years they will believe you rant on youtube for a living    remember by the time they get around to auditing you you 'll likely be well into or through your third year    there is an exception for farms   other than that if you lose money year after year you better be able to show that you look walk and like a business and one with a reasonable business reason for delayed profitability   for instance netflix 's old business model of mailing dvds had very high fixed infrastructure expense that took years to turn profitable but was a very sensible model   they 're fine with that   pets.com into oblivion but they tried they 're fine with that too   you ca n't mix all your activities if you 're an electrician specializing in iot and smart homes can you deduct a trip to the trade show you bet   conference arguable   ses   no way   now if you had a second business of a product site which profited by ads and affiliate links then ses would be fine to deduct from that business   but if this second business loses money every year it 's a hobby and not deductible at all   that person would want separate accounting books for the electrician and businesses   that 's a basic duck test of a business vs. a hobby you need to be able to show how each business gets income and pays expense separate from every other business and your personal life   it 's a best practice to give each business a separate checking account and checkbook you do n't need to risk tax penalties on a business that may never   you can amend your taxes up to 3 years after the proper filing date   i save my expense for each tax year and if a business becomes justifiable i go back and amend past years tax forms taking those deductions   irs gives me a refund check with interest

not all call options that have value at expiration exercise by purchasing the security or attempting to with funds in your account    on etns they often always settle in cash   as an example of an option i 'm currently looking at it settles in cash please confirm by reading the documentation on this set of options at but it is an example of this   there 's nothing it can settle into as you ca n't purchase the index only options on it   you may quickly look wikipedia at the difference between american style options and european style options for more understanding here interestingly i just spoke to my broker about this subject for a trade execution   before i go into that let me also quickly refer to joe 's answer   what you buy you can sell   that 's one of the jobs of a market maker to provide liquidity in a market   so when you buy a stock you can sell it   when you buy an option you can sell it   that 's at any time before expiration although how close you do it before the closing bell on expiration friday saturday is your discretion   when a market maker lists an option price they list a bid and an ask   if you are willing to sell at the bid price they need to purchase it generally speaking   that 's why they put a spread between the bid and ask price but that 's another topic not related to your question just note the point of them buying at the bid price and selling at the ask price that 's what they 're saying they 'll do now one major difference with options vs. stocks is that options are contracts so therefore we can note just as easily that you can sell the option on something particularly if you own either the underlying or an option deeper in the money   if you own the underlying instrument stock and you sell a call option on it this is a strategy typically referred to as a covered call considered a risk reduction strategy   you forfeit potential gains on the upside for money you receive in selling the option the point of this discussion is is simply what one buys one can sell   what one sells one can buy that 's how a market is supposed to work   and also not to think that making money in options is buying first then selling   it may be selling and either buying back or ideally that option expiring worthless now a final example   let 's say you buy a deep in the money call on a stock trading at $ 150 and you own the $ 100 calls   at expiration these have a value of $ 50   but let 's say you do n't have any money in your account to take ownership of the underlying security you have to come up with the additional $ 100 per share you are missing   in that case need to call   your broker and see how they handle it and it will depend on the type of account you have e.g. margin or not ira etc   generally speaking though the margin department makes these decisions and they look through folks that have options on things that have value and are expiring and whether they have the funds in their account to absorb the security they are going to need to own   exchange wise options that have value at expiration are exercised   but what if the person who has the option does n't have the funds to own the whole stock well ideally on monday they 'll buy all the shares with the options you have at the current price and immediately liquidate the amount you ca n't afford to own but they do n't have to   i 'm mentioning this detail so that it helps you see what 's going or needs to go on with exchanges and brokerages and individuals so you have a broader picture

in double entry bookkeeping no transaction is ever negative you only deal in positive numbers we simulate negative numbers by calling numbers debits and credits where one is the negative of the other only a balance can be negative in this case income is a credit account that means that things that increase your balance are credits and things that reduce your balance are debits so a gift from grandma is a credit it 's a positive number and you write it in the credit column you pretty much never subtract from income except to correct a mistake assets like a checking account are debit accounts increases are debits and decreases are credits you routinely have both debits and credits on a checking account i.e. you put money in and you take money out every transaction affects at least two accounts one with a debit and one with a credit so in this case the gift from grandma credits income and debits checking buying food credits checking and debits expenses

founder makes available 100 equity but uses a reasonable amount of the proceeds to pay him herself a salary or wage and from that salary invests in the same initial offering to acquire shares for him herself    i see several problems    what is a reasonable salary    also this leaves the door open to the following scam   founders say that they are going to follow this plan   however instead of buying shares they simply quit after being paid the salary   they use knowledge gained from this business to start a competitor   investors are left holding an empty company    tax consequences   the founder would pay income tax on the salary   by contrast if the founder instead sells shares that would be capital gains tax which is lower in many countries e.g. the united states    why would i want to invest in a business where the founders do n't believe in it enough to take a significant equity stake    consider the amazon.com example   jeff bezos makes a minimal salary around $ 80,000 a year less than many of his employees   but he has a substantial ownership position   if the company does n't make money he wo n't   would investors really value the stocks with a p e of in 2016 if they did n't trust him to make the right long term decisions    it 's also worth noting that most initial public offerings ipos are not made when the founder is the only employee   a single employee company instead looks for private investors often called angel investors   companies generally do n't go public until they are established in some way often making money   negotiating with angel investors is different from negotiating with the public   they can personally review the books and once invested tend to have input on how the money is spent    in other words this is mostly solving the wrong problem if you talk about ipos   this might make more sense with a venture as that replaces a few angel investors with many individuals   but most ventures tend to approach things from the opposite direction   instead of looking for investors they look for customers   if they offer a useful product they will get customers   if not they never get the money    beyond all this if a founder is only going to get a fair salary some of the time then why put in any sweat equity   this works fine if the company looks valuable after a year   what if it does n't   the founder is out a year of sweat equity and has nothing in return   that happens now too but the possibility of the big return offsets it   you 're taking out the big return    i do n't think that this is good for either founders or investors   the founder trades a potentially good or even great return for a mediocre return   the investors trade a situation where both they and the founder benefit from a successful company to one where they benefit a lot more than the founder   that 's not good for either side

its not just citi and bofa even barclays hsbc and other large banks are trading below book value in markets they are listed are there particular assets that are causing these two banks to be valued lower relative to their book values than the other banks there no particular assets given the current economic situation most banks are not making good returns i.e. expected returns of markets are around 10 12 and the returns getting generated are around 4 6 the overall slow down in various segments as well as regulations in most countries mean that banks have to at the business model in short term and generate more revenue the market believes that banks may loose money faster and hence the negative outlook and the trading below the book value note book value is derived in ideal conditions i.e. when the company is healthy if any company were to sell the assets in distress the actual funds raised would be quite a bit less than book value its also to be noted that typically banks would not close out and hence book value to an extent is just an indicator or is it a residual based on their being the biggest losers of 2008 that are still around today the 2008 has gone past this is more recent if you look most of these banks were doing quite well till last year and had recovered substantially after 2008

if you are the beneficiary of an annuity you might receive a single sum distribution when the annuity owner dies the amount of this death benefit might be the current cash value of the annuity or some other amount based upon contract riders that the owner purchased the tax on death benefits depends on a number of factors death benefits are taxed as normal income unlike other investments the named beneficiary of a non qualified annuity does not get a step up in tax basis to the date of death however that does n't mean the beneficiary will have to pay taxes on the full amount because the purchaser of the annuity made the investment with after tax dollars only the amount attributable to investment income is taxed but it will be taxed as ordinary income and not enjoy any special capital gains treatment when there is a death benefit that exceeds the value of the account that additional amount is also taxed as ordinary income   taxes on annuities depend on several circumstances for more information on distribution of inherited annuities and taxes go to annuities they go into details that could help you even more   one thing that annuities hq points out is if you take the lump sum payout you may be pushed into a higher tax bracket   along with doing research i would also contact a financial advisor

your employment status is not 100 clear from the question   normally consultants are sole proprietors or llc 's and are paid with 1099 's   they take care of their own taxes often with schedule c and they sometimes can but generally do not use employer company 401(k   if this is your situation you can contact any provider you want and set up your own solo 401(k which will have great investment options and no fees   i do this through fidelity if you are paid with a w2 you are not a consultant   you are an employee and must use your employer 's 401(k figure out what you are if you are a consultant open a solo 401(k at the provider of your choice   make sure beforehand that they allow incoming rollovers   roll all of your previous 401(k)s and ira 's into it when you have moved your 401(k to a better provider you wo n't be paying any extra fees but you will not recoup any fees your original provider charged i 'm not sure why you mention a roth ira   if you try to roll your 401(k into a roth instead of a traditional ira or 401(k be aware that you will be taxed on everything you roll edit a little info about ira 's in response to your comment tax advantaged retirement accounts come in two flavors one is managed by your company and the money is taken out of your paycheck   this is usually a 401(k or 403(b   you can contribute up to $ 18 k per year and your company can also contribute to it   the other flavor is an ira   you can contribute $ 5,500 per year to this for you and $ 5,500 for your spouse   these are outside of your company and you make the deposits yourself   you choose your own provider so competition has driven prices way down   you can have both a 401(k and an ira and contribute the max to both though at high incomes you lose the ability to deduct ira contributions these accounts are tax advantaged because you only pay taxes once   with a regular brokerage account you pay income tax in the year in which you earn money then you pay tax every year on dividends and any capital gains that have been realized by selling   there are two types of tax advantaged accounts traditional ira or traditional 401(k   you do not pay income tax on this money in the year you earn it nor do you pay capital gains tax   instead you pay tax only in the year in which you take the money out in retirement roth ira or roth 401(k   you do pay income tax on money on this money in the year in which you earn it   but then you do n't pay tax on any gains or withdrawals ever again when you leave your job and sometimes at other times you can move your money out of a 401(k into your ira where you can do a better job managing it   you can also move money from your ira into a 401(k if your 401(k provider will allow you to whether traditional or roth is better depends on your tax rate now and your tax rate at retirement   however if you choose to move money from a traditional account into a roth account you must pay tax on it in that year as if it was income because traditional and roth accounts are taxed at different times   for that reason if you are just trying to move money out of your 401(k to save on fees the logical place to put it is in a traditional ira moving money from a traditional to a roth may make sense for example if your tax rate is temporarily low this year but that would be a separate decision from the one you are looking at you can always roll your traditional ira into a roth later if that does become the case   otherwise there 's no reason to think your traditional 401(k should be rolled into a roth ira according to what you have described

you did n't have a situation of excess contribution if you have proof that someone in fidelity actually told you what you said you might try to recover some of your losses through a lawsuit however their first and main defense would be that they 're not in the business of providing tax advice and it is your problem that you asked random person a tax question and then acted on an incorrect answer by the way that only goes to say that anything you might read here you should as well take with a grain of salt the only one who can give you a tax advice is a licensed tax professional i explained it in details in my blog post but in short it is either an ea enrolled agent with the irs credentials or a cpa certified public accountant or attorney licensed in your state back to your question excess contribution to a ira is when you contribute in excess to the limits imposed for traditional ira in 2012 the limit was $ 5000 you contributed $ 4000 this means that you were not in excess there 's nothing they can correct the 1099-r you got seems to be correct and in order what you did have was a case of non deductible contribution non deductible contribution to your ira should have been reported to the irs on form 8606 non deductible contribution creates basis in your ira withdrawals from your ira are prorated to the relation of your basis to your total value and the taxable amount is determined based on that rate it is also calculated using form 8606 so in short you should have filed a form 8606 with your 2012 tax return declaring non deductible ira and creating $ 4000 basis and then form 8606 with your 2013 tax return calculating which portion of the $ 4000 you withdrew is non taxable if your total ira in all accounts was that $ 4000 then nothing would be taxable talk to a tax adviser you might need to amend your 2012 return or send the 2012 form separately if possible and then do some math on your 2013 return if 60 days have n't passed you might want to consider depositing the $ 4000 in a roth ira and perform what is called conversion

apartment complexes have had a long history of not accepting cash for payment of rent this eliminates the problem of robbery and strongly reduces the risks of embezzlement    this note is legal tender for all debts public and private   article 1 section 10 of the us constitution states    no state shall make any thing but gold and silver coin a tender in payment of debts previous editions of banknotes stated that the notes were redeemable in gold or in lawful money the mint act of set gold and silver as legal currency and that one did not have to accept base metal coins for more than $ 10 which is why coin rolls only go up to $ 10 the coinage act of dropped silver and made gold the legal standard for currency in 1933 the redeemable in gold was changed by federal statute and the legend you mention was added prior to 1933 someone could demand that you pay them in gold and not with a bank note legislation in 1933 ended that this clause in the constitution leads some political groups to wish to return to a gold standard i recommend reading the book greenback as it describes how our currency got the way it did and why that clause appears on currency

common financial advice is just that it is common and general in nature and not specific for your financial needs your goals and your risk tolerance regarding the possibility of a us market not going anywhere over a long period of time well it is not a possibility it has happened see chart below   it took 13 years for the s&p 500 to break through a level first reached in march 2000 tested in october 2007 just before the gfc and finally broken through in march 2013 if you had bought in early 2000 you would still be behind when you take inflation into account if you took the strategy of dollar cost averaging and bought the same dollar value say $ 10,000 of the index every six months beginning of each january and each july starting from the start of 2000 and bought your last portion in january 2013 you would have a return of about 35 over 13.5 years or an average of 2.6 per year now lets look at the same chart below but this time add some trend lines   if we instead bought whenever the price crossed above the downtrend line and sold whenever the price crossed below the uptrend line with the first purchase at the start of january 2000 we would have a return of 93 over the 13.5 years or an average of per year another more aggressive option but manageable if you incorporate a risk management strategy is to buy long when the price crosses the downtrend line and sell your existing long position and sell short when the price drops below the uptrend line that is profiting both up trending and down trending markets again we start our buying at the start of january 2000 by shorting the index when the market is in a down trend you could increase the above returns of 93 by another 54 for a total return of 147 over 13.5 years or an average of per year to conclude using a simple long term strategy to time the markets may result in considerably higher returns than dollar cost averaging over the medium to long term and i know which strategy would help me sleep better at night

first consider the basic case of what you are asking you expect to have a future obligation to pay interest and you are concerned that the rate when you pay it will be higher than the rate today in the simplest case you could theoretically hedge that risk by buying an asset which pays the market interest rate as the interest rate rises increasing your costs your return on this asset would also increase this would minimize your exposure to interest rate fluctuations there are of course two problems with this simplified solution   1 the reason you expect to pay interest is because you need want to take on debt to purchase your house to fully offset this risk by putting all your money in an asset which bears the market interest rate would effectively be the same as just buying your house in cash 2 the timing of the future outflow is a bit unique you will be locking in a rate in 5 years which will determine the payments for the 5 years after that so unless you own this interest paying asset for that whole future duration you wo n't immediately benefit you also wo n't need want to buy that asset today because the rates from today to 2022 are largely irrelevant to you you want something that directly goes against the prevailing mortgage interest rate in 2022 precisely so in your specific case you could in theory consider the following solution you could short a coupon bond likely one with a 10 year maturity date from today as interest rates rise the value of the coupon bond for it 's remaining life of 5 years which has an implied interest rate set today will drop because you will have shorted an asset dropping in value you will have a gain you could then close your short position when you buy your house in 5 years in theory your gain at that moment in time would equal the present value of the rate differential between today 's low mortgage rates and tomorrow 's high interest rates there are different ways mechanically to achieve what i mention above such as buying forward derivative contracts based on interest rates etc but all methods will have a few important caveats 1 these will not be perfect hedges against your mortgage rates unless the product directly relates to mortgage rates general interest rates will only be a proxy for mortgage rates 2 there is additional risk in taking this type of position taking a short position trading on a margin requires you to make ongoing payments to the broker in the event that your position loses money theoretically those losses would be offset by inherent gains in the future if mortgage rates stay low go lower but that offset is n't in your plan for 5 years 3 5 years may be too long of a timeline for you to accurately time the maturity of your hedge position if you end up moving in 7 years then changes in rates between 2022 might mean you lose on both your hedge position and your mortgage rates 4 taking on a position like this will tie up your capital either because you are directly buying an asset you believe will offset growing interest rates or because you are taking on a margin account for a short position preventing you from using a margin account for other investments to the extent you max out your margin limit i doubt any of these solutions will be desirable to an individual looking to mitigate interest rate risk because of the additional risks it creates but it may help you see this idea in another light

@littleadv has said most of what i 'd say if they had not gotten here first i 'd add this much it 's important to understand what debt collectors can and can not do because a lot of them will use intimidation and any other technique you can think of to get away with as much as you will let them i 'd start with this pdf file from the ftc and then start googling for info on your state 's regulations also it would be a very very good idea to review the documents you signed or get a copy when you took out the loan to see what sort of additional penalties etc you may have already agreed to in the event you default   the fee 's the collector is adding in could be of their own creation making them highly negotiable or it might be something you already agreed to in you little recourse but to pay them do keep in mind that in many cases debt collectors are at the very least to charge you simple interest of around 10   on a debt of your size paid off over several years that might amount to more than the $ 4 k they are adding   otoh you can pretty much expect them to try both tacking on fees and then trying to add interest if the fees are not paid    another source of assistance may be the department of education ombudsman if you need help with a defaulted student loan contact the department of education 's ombudsman at or visit its website at but first you must take steps to resolve your loan problem on your own there is a checklist of required steps on the website or the ombudsman will not assist you

this answer assumes that your purpose for using the espp is to generate a relatively safe 15 return on that portion of your income frequently before there were roth 401 k options the advice was   this advice was especially good for the younger workers because they wanted to have a roth account but did n't want to miss the 401 k match as roth 401 k accounts were introduced that advice changed somewhat because it was possible to get the benefit of the roth and still get the   maximum match for your situation what i would propose is contribute to the 401 k enough to get the maximum match   contribute as much as you want or are allowed into the espp take the proceeds and contribute to an ira or roth ira if you reach the ira max you have to decide if you will scale back the espp to contribute more to the 401k.

millennials are sure as hell not less then other generations    you 're talking about post millennials gen z millennials are the children of the boomers and as a result share a lot of the similar characteristics the problem with the millennials is that they learned a lot of boomer traits of their parents but have not been afforded the same economic opportunities as their parents where   gen y and the boomers are surprisingly some of the most liberal of   generations however both are incredibly whilst being socially progressive   gen z the post millennials grew up post 2001 post gfc as a result of this chaotic and traumatic world which they grew up in they tend to prize stability more then the boomers and gen y do gen z are more interested in work being a means to a hopefully stable end whereas gen y boomers see work as being an essential part of their identity as an individual gen z will take many things for granted having grew up with a black president and in a country with a growing awareness of social rights e.g legalization of same sex marriage and as a result will not be as socially progressive as their preceding generations

credit unions operate for the benefit of their depositors who are the actual owners of the institution whereas conventional banks operate for the benefit of their shareholders who of course are not necessarily depositors so credit unions will typically give a benefit or service for free if it is free or extremely cheap to them whereas conventional banks will charge for it if they think it will not lose them depositors

see my answer here what is the dividend tax rate for uk stock the only tax from us stocks you 'd need to worry about would be dividend withholding tax of 30   if you contact your isa provider they should be able to provide you with a w8-ben form so that you can have this rate reduced to 15   just because there 's a tax treaty does not mean you will automatically be charged 15 you must provide a w8-ben form and renew it when it expires that last 15 is unfortunately unavoidable   if you were paying any uk taxes you could claim that 15 as a discount against your uk dividend tax liability but as your us stock would be wrapped in an isa there 's no uk tax to pay which means no tax to reclaim from the tax treaty other than though you will pay absolutely no tax on us stocks held in an isa to either the us or uk government

and what exactly do i profit from the short i understand it is the difference in the value of the stock so if my initial investment was $ 4000 200 $ 20 and i bought it at $ 3800 200 $ 19 i profit from the difference which is $ 200 do i also receive back the extra $ 2000 i gave the bank to perform the trade either this is extremely poorly worded or you misunderstand the mechanics of a short position   when you open a short position your are expecting that the stock will decline from here   in a short position you are borrowing shares you do n't own and selling them   if the price goes down you get to buy the same shares back for less money and return them to the person you borrowed from   your profit is the delta between the original sell price and the new lower buy price less commissions and fees interest   opening and closing a short position is two trades a sell then a buy   just like a long trade there is no maximum holding period if you place your order to sell short 200 shares at $ 19 your initial investment is $    in order to open your $ short position your broker may require your account to have at least $ according to the 1.5 ratio in your question   it 's not advisable to open a short position this close to the ratio requirement   most brokers require a buffer in your account in case the stock goes up because in a short trade if the stock goes up you 're losing money   if the stock goes up such that you 've exhausted your buffer you 'll receive what 's known as a margin call where your broker either requires you to wire in more money or sell part or all of your position at a loss to avoid further losses   and remember you may be charged interest on the value of the shares you 're borrowing when you hold a position long your maximum loss is the money you put in a position can only fall to zero though you may owe interest or other fees if you 're trading on margin   when you hold a position short your maximum loss is unlimited there 's no limit to how high the value of something can go   there are less risky ways to make short trades by using put options but you should ensure that you have a firm grasp on what 's happening before you use real money the timing of the trades and execution of the trades is no different than when you take a plain vanilla long position   you place your order either market or limit or whatever and it executes when your trade criteria occurs

my answer will suck but it comes from someone who has been married you ca n't control another person or convince them to do something   what you can do is identify what they value and show how saving money increases their opportunities in what they value but understand that the person could see what you 're saying as invalid too   if you 're single and reading this this is why you verify that the person has similar values to you think of it like someone who wants good gas mileage you show them a car that gets and immediately they say well but that 's not a cool car   so their value is n't the miles per gallon and you may find the same is true with your spouse   india is paying more interest than the us and europe in their savings accounts i believe the benchmark interest rate is 7.5 so assuming your spouse values more money showing him how to use money in savings to passively earn money might be a technique that works   but it may mean nothing to him because it 's 1 not his actual value or 2 is n't enough to matter in his mind in other words this is all sales and whatever you do and this is regardless of gender do n't manipulate as in the long run that tends to build resentment   if there is a specific problem that you know he sees as a major issue and saving money can help i 'd recommend showing how savings would help with that problem   people generally like solutions to problems just remember what you think he sees as a problem may not be what he sees as a problem   this is why i chuckle when i see single people give married people advice you ca n't just convince the person enough because you are not that person we have to speak their language and we should be careful to avoid creating resentment the part that sucks or does n't depending on who you ask is that if we ca n't convince others to do it we should do it ourselves   either 1 earn money independently yourself when applicable realizing that you are about to have a child and may be limited or 2 save the money that you and your spouse have agreed that you 're allotted if this applies to your situation a few spouses divide income even when one is an earner

first of all i am sorry for your loss at this time worrying about money is probably the least of your concerns it might be tempting to try to pay off all your debts at once and while that would be satisfying it would be a poor investment of your inheritance when you have debt you have to think about how much that debt is costing you to keep open since you have on your student loan it does not make sense to pay any more than the minimum payments you may want to look into getting a personal loan to pay off your other personal debts the interest rates for a loan will probably be much less than what you are paying currently this will allow you to put a payment plan together that is affordable you can also use your inheritance as collateral for the loan getting a loan will most likely give you a better credit rating as well you may also be tempted to get a brand new sports car but that would also not be a good idea at all you should shop for a vehicle based on your current income and not your savings i believe you can get the same rates for an auto loan for a car up to 3 years old as a brand new car it would be worth your while to shop for a quality used car from a reputable dealer if it is a certified used car you can usually carry the rest of the new car warranty the biggest return on investment you have now is your employer sponsored 401(k account find out how long it takes for you to become fully vested being vested means that you can leave your job and keep all of your employer contributions if possible max out or at least contribute as much as you can afford to that fund to get employee matching you should also stick with your job until you become fully vested the money you have in retirement accounts does you no good when you are young there is a significant penalty for early withdrawal and that age is currently 59 1/2 doing the math it would be around when you would be able to have access to that money you should hold onto a certain amount of your money and keep it in a higher interest rate savings account or a money market account you say that your living situation will change in the next year as well take full advantage of living as cheaply as you can do n't make any unnecessary purchases try to brown bag it to lunch instead of eating out etc save as much as you can and put it into a savings account you can use that money to put a down payment on a house or for the security and first month 's rent try not to spend any money from your savings and try to support yourself as best as you can from your income make a budget for yourself and figure out how much you can spend every month do n't factor in your savings into it your savings should be treated as an emergency fund since you have just completed school and this is your first big job out of college your income will most likely improve with time it might make sense to job hop a few times to find the right position you are much more likely to get a higher salary by changing jobs and employers than you are staying in the same one for your entire career this generally is true even if you are promoted at the by the same employer if you do leave your current job you would lose what your employer contributed if you are not vested even if that happened you would still keep the portion that you contributed

if you only have to pay 23k federal taxes on 100k that means you are in the long term capital gains tax rate which is the lower of the tax rates available first you get your federal income tax marginal tax rate and then find the matching long term capital gains tax rate for example if your marginal federal income tax rate is 28 your capital gains tax rate would be 15 or rather if the amount of the gain would put you in the 28 rate then your long term capital gains tax rate is 15 you can reduce that by having more losses if you have anything else invested anywhere that is taking a loss then you can sell that this year and it will offset the other gains you have realized the only note is that your losses have to be long term capital losses too tax loss harvesting takes this to an extreme where you sell something at a loss to lock in the tax loss but you did n't really want to get rid of that investment so then you buy a nearly identical investment ie if you owned shares of tech sector etf and it was at a loss you would sell that and then immediately buy tech sector etf the competing product that does the exact same thing then there is charity this still requires spending money and you not having it any longer if you feel that a cause can use the money more directly than the us government you can donate an appreciated asset to the charity not report a gain and also take a charitable deduction

yes they need expansionary monetary policy to help them with their internal devaluation    however this involves leaving the euro so there are additional costs to the normal costs of inflation they are experiencing some of these costs right now as capital is fleeing the country and it will get worse if when they really leave it 's also worth keeping in mind that greece does n't have very good institutions it 's why they are in this mess in the first place so it 's hard to say that they 'll be able to leave the euro and devalue without also trying out policies that will lead to hyperinflation   internal devaluation is possible without expansionary monetary policy but it takes some time and the capital flight in anticipation of taxes neo drachmas means that meanwhile there is also little investment in the economy in the meantime

usually the to why sell it is to maintain the specific distribution balance or to track the index that this fund was designed to offer a buy and hold fund could only buy when users are actively putting money into it that limits their ability to follow those approaches   and i think there would be problems withdrawls fair in terms of what shares are sold and how the costs for selling them are distributed that do n't arise for a single buy and hold investor if you 're willing to accept the limitations of the former and can overcome the latter it 's an interesting idea   but note that one of the places index funds save money is that since the composition of indexes changes they are already operating mostly in buy and hold mode it 's unclear how much your variant would save worth exploring in greater depth though i think

we are talking at cross purposes but not for the reason you think    the debt might or might not be legally or practically recoverable the apple farmer and everything he owns might have been destroyed in the fire but the value created and destroyed was real and so was the money    you 're focusing on the debt owed to the shoemaker which is fine but your mistake is thinking that the debt is in some way meaningfully different from money which it 's not    most people who try to explain this difference would go off on a about how the overwhelming majority of money on deposit in banks and otherwise in circulation has never been printed or something which is okay but it 's not a very convincing argument because you 'll come back with something like but i can still withdraw all my money i can still cash all my checks etc   so instead i 'm going to try and break this down bear with me   the apple grower got a deer worth 12 loddars let 's set the interest part aside for the moment i got a pair shoes also worth loddars   forget about the shoe maker and the debt for a moment and focus on me i sold a deer and i used the proceeds to buy a pair of shoes    did i defraud anyone no i engaged in a fair transaction with willing partners on both sides    did i get paid for the deer obviously i did because i used the payment to buy shoes    what did i get paid with if not money    i can hear you saying yeah but the shoe guy    forget about the shoe guy when buy something on amazon marketplace and charge it on a credit card and then get paid via direct deposit and then have the money taken from your account to pay off the credit card company electronically is all of that real money of course it is    now what happens if you die before paying the the credit card bill does that mean that the money amazon paid to the seller does n't exist   does that mean that money paid by the cc company to amazon does n't exist how about the money in your bank account does that exist what if your employer once defrauded someone how about then    none of that money has ever been printed nobody got permission from ben bernanke to authorize these transactions but the money that changed hands was absolutely real even though it was nothing more than a series of promises    before you argue with me think this through all these account transfers ultimately boil down to promises by the end bank to produce cash when and if the account holder walks up to a teller and demands it the bank does n't have nearly enough cash to pay every account holder but they do have enough hopefully to keep their promises since they know they wo n't all be called in at once    nobody ever actually delivered a package of paper currency to cover these transactions everyone is just trading promises and passing those promises along to others it sounds crazy to say it that way but it is absolutely true    tally up your net worth or if that 's too ugly imagine up someone 's net worth who has a net worth chances are that you have never in your life seen that amount of paper cash certainly not in your physical possession so who has it it 's not like your local bank branch has a box marked with $ 400,000 in bills and coins sitting there    what you have is a series of promises    when your employer gets by credit card the customer promises to pay the credit card company who promises to pay your employer 's bank your employer then pays you with a direct deposit whereby his bank promises to pay your bank you then swipe an atm card and your bank promises to pay the grocery store 's bank who in turn sends a check to their supplier which is a promise that the grocery store 's bank will pay the supplier 's bank who in turn does the same with the farmer who does the same with his mortgage company who does the same to their investors who do the same to whoever they spend money with    occasionally one of them takes a cash withdrawal to tip the or stick in a birthday card or buy hot dogs at the ballpark or something but overwhelmingly we are all just spending and re spending promises and the remarkable thing is that overwhelmingly we keep them without anyone involved ever hiring a truck to deliver a of cash to the first person because there is no first person   all of that stuff is absolutely real money*.    i used the example of a wildfire but maybe it will be more useful to think of something that just changes in value for no obvious reason think of some article of clothing that has gone out of everyone was buying that stuff up until the day they stopped somewhere someone was stuck with the last warehouse full of hot pink parachute pants or whatever a month before when they were ordered from china or wherever they were worth $ 50 each now you ca n't give them away that value is gone it 's just vanished the money that bought the pants was real the pants are real but they are no longer worth anything    the person holding that warehouse full of pants now has to pay to either store of dispose of them they might start bouncing checks and breaking promises there was no fraud but there also might not be any way to recover the money owed $ 10 mm worth of parachute pants is now negative $ 1 mm worth of trash that has to be disposed of and mortgage obligations on the warehouse    i hope some of that makes sense it is really hard to explain this stuff via analogy and hypothetical and the kinds of terms that lawyers think in if you will forgive me for saying so

if something in any transaction in life financial or otherwise make you feel comfortable and the choice is between saving money with one thing versus another do n’t sell your personal needs short pay more elsewhere that treats you the way you expect to be treated in the long run the $ $ $ you save in a cheaper transaction might cost you more in the headaches and annoyance you have to swallow in dealing with this bargain in the future your question is this do his sales tactics indicate other underlying problems how can i deal effectively with those tactics and you state this as well to make a long story short the dealer 's aggressive sales tactics have made me somewhat uncomfortable and finally ask how can i deal effectively with those tactics okay first and foremost if you feel discomfort in anything in life not just a financial situation just walk away you might have to say no when doing this but it ’s not always the case you will have to counter aggression with aggression and specifically in the case of a purchase like this you need to also ask yourself is this discount being offered me worth the headache i am getting at the end of the day money is meaningless and has it ’s main worth as an economic motivator someone has a need and someone else has something that can solve that need what would it take for the side of need to connect to the side of solution to that need this is the basic concept surrounding all economics so that said i have personally avoided buying things for less money and paid slightly more elsewhere for a service experience that made me feel comfortable at the end of the day if you feel happy in the transaction it helps in the long run more than let ’s say the $ 20 to $ 40 you save by buying from someone else also on the side of customer service this person ’s sales techniques sound like something out of a very old fashioned sales playbook nowadays it ’s all about relationships and service the immediate sale is not as important for competent and reputable businesses because they know a better customer service experience will bring people back so it does n’t matter how long this guy has been in business it could be that he ’s been in business a long time just because he has been in business a long time that said and in the case of musical instruments maybe this guy is really good at care and upkeep of instruments but has crappy sales techniques keep that in mind as well and just push back on their sales methods for things like musical instruments people might be jerks on the sales side but in the maintenance and repair side they are great will you need to go to them if when your instrument needs repair or you do n’t care at the end of the day go with your gut and if your gut says no then just go somewhere else and spend your money on an item you like from a place that treats you the way you need

its a classic sign of fraud the fraud is on you you cashed the check not given to you and not endorsed by the person its given to so even if the check is legit you 're still in trouble there are many variations of this scheme but the common thing is that the innocent third party is given a check to cash and gives its own check or cash in return the check ends up being forged stolen or otherwise invalid but the cash check the third party gave is long gone usually its cash because its you should wait at least a couple of weeks to make sure the check does n't bounce you might want to contact the check owner to verify its legit and suggest to return the money if it is not you might also want to consult with an attorney bear in mind that it might be reported to the authorities as a money laundering scheme which it very well might be and you 'll have some explaining to do in this case even if the check is legit

this is a good question and my answer below being the first rationale that crossed my mind is far from fleshed out it 's just a reply based on many books on the historical cycles of markets and it 's something i 've discussed at work i work in finance    historically we can observe that periods of financial booms high valuations of public equities tend to lead to lower returns it 's a fairly simplistic notion but if you 're paying more now for something when it 's potentially close to a high water mark then you 're returns in the short term are likely to be somewhat returns from the underlying companies have a hard time keeping up with high valuations such that investors are n't likely to see a return in the short run

the spot curve or yield curve demonstrates the different yields at which bonds of differing maturities are being purchased when the yield curve is upward sloping longer maturity bonds are being purchased at higher yields when it 's downward sloping longer maturity bonds are purchased at lower yields keep in mind that yield is inversely related to price so that a high yield bond will be at a lower price and vice versa the spot curve can also be used to determine the forward curve this is based on the concept that an investor given two options with identical cash flows will be indifferent in what to purchase i.e. their prices should be equal    to learn more about this stay here in /r finance to learn anything about your actual question try /r personalfinance

at this point the cost of borrowing money is very low   for the sake of argument say it is 1 per year for a large institution i can either go out and find a client to invest 100,000 $ and split profit and loss with them or i could borrow 50,000 $ pay in interest and get the same return and loss while moving the market half as much which would let me double my position in both cases the company is responsible for covering all fixed costs like paying for traders trades office space branding management regulatory compliance etc for your system to work the cost to gather clients and interact with them has to be significantly less than 1 of the capital they provide you per year at the 50 level that might actually be worth it for the company in question   except at the 50 level you 'd have really horrible returns even when the market went up   so suppose a more reasonable level is the client keeps 75 of the returns which compares to existing companies which offer larger investors an 80 cut on profits but no coverage on losses now the cost to gather and interact with clients has to be lower than 2500 $ per million dollars provided to beat out a simple loan arrangement   a single sales employee with 100 overhead office all marketing support benefits earning has to bring in 32 million dollar years worth of investment every year to break even cash is cheap   investment houses sell cash management and charge for it   they do n't sell shared investment risk at least not to retail investors because it would take a lot of cash for it to be worth their bother more explicitly for this to be viable they 'd basically have to constantly arrange large hedges against the market going down to cover any losses   that is the kind of thing that some margin loans may require   that would all by itself lower their profits significantly and they would be exposed to counter party risk on top of that it is much harder to come up with a pile of cash when the markets go down significantly   if you are large enough to be worthwhile finding a safe counterparty may be nearly impossible

in the case of wells fargo i believe that free trading is linked to your overall banking relationship with the firm so if you have a checking account with a balance of $ x or   a total relationship with the bank relationship is usually defined as loan balances + deposit balances over a certain amount they give you a like free stock trades the theory behind this approach is that banks want to be a one stop shop for you the idea is that they can market the banks products to you over a period of years lowering customer acquisition cost and offer you a level of convenience that allows them to charge a premium for services for example many people will pay a rate or fee premium on a mortgage or car loan so that they can do all of their business in one place in other cases free trading is linked to marketing campaigns by funds charles schwab started this with the no transaction fee mutual fund store many years ago transaction fees are actually paid for by the mutual funds who pay for placement in the program free etf trade programs are similar

as long as you can be trusted with a credit card i find that if you have a setup that uses three accounts 1 your credit card 2 2 a high interest internet account most of these accounts do n’t have fees 3 a savings account   the method that works for me is 1st i calculate my fixed monthly bills i.e rent and utilities and then transfer it into my high interest account   for the month whenever i make a purchase i transfer the money into the high interest account this way i can keep a running balance of what money i have left to spend in the month then when the credit card bill comes i transfer the money out of the high interest account across to pay off the credit card this way you generate interest on the money which you would have spent throughout the month and still maintain $ 0 of interest from the credit card over a year you can generate at least enough money in interest to go out for dinner on one of free flights

keep in mind that the exchanges do not hold buy or sell the stock people or funds do   all the exchange does is facilitate the sale of stock from one entity to another so the shares outstanding and market cap for a company are set regardless of how many exchanges the stock is listed on   the company typically indicates the number of shares outstanding in its financial statements   i do not know if the exchange itself keeps track of shares outstanding it may just report whatever the company publishes so theoretically if you wanted to buy all of the stock of a company you could do it all in one exchange provided that all the existing holders of the stock were willing to sell you their shares   there are many issues with that though which i do n't think are to your question

is it worth it you state the average yield on a stock as 2 3 but seem to have come up with this by looking at the yield of an s&p500 index   not every stock in that index is paying a dividend and many of them that are paying have such a low yield that a dividend investor would not even consider them   unless you plan to buy the index itself you are distorting the possible income by averaging in all these you are also assuming your income is directly proportional to the amount of yield you could buy right now   but that 's a false measure because you are talking about building up your investment by contributing $ month   no matter what asset you choose to invest in it 's going to take some time to build up to producing $ 20k year income at that rate   investments today will have time in market to grow in multiple ways given you have some time immediate yield is not what you should be measuring dividends or other investments on in my opinion   income investors usually focus on yield on cost a measure of income to be received this year based on the purchase price of the asset producing that income   if you do go with dividend investing and your investments grow the dividends themselves on a regular basis it 's not unheard of for to be north of 6 in 10 years   the same can be true of rental property given that rents can rise achieving that with dividends has alot to do with picking the right companies but you 've said you are not opposed to working hard to invest correctly so i assume researching and teaching yourself how to lower the risk of picking the wrong companies is n't something you 'd be opposed to i know more about dividend growth investing than i do property investing so i can only provide an example of a dividend growth entry strategy many dividend growth investors have goals of not entering a new position unless the current yield is over 3 and only then when the company has a long consistent track record of growing eps and dividends at a good rate a low debt cashflow ratio to reduce risk of dividend cuts and a good moat to preserve competitiveness of the company relative to its peers   amongst many other possible measures   they then buy only on dips or where the price causes a higher yield and lower than normal p e at the same time that they have faith that they 've valued the company correctly for a 3 + year or longer hold time there are those who self report that they 've managed to build up a $ dividend payment portfolio in less than 10 years   check out dividend growth investor 's blog for an example   there 's a whole world of dividend growth investing strategies and writings out there and the commenters on his blog will lead to links for many of them i want to point out that income is not just for those who are old   some people planned and have achieved the ability to retire young purely because they 've built up an income portfolio that covers their expenses    assuming you want that the question is whether stock assets that pay dividends is the type of investment process that with you or if something else fits you better   i believe the op says they 'd prefer long hold times with few activities once the investment decisions are made and is n't by significant work to identify his investments   both real estate and stocks fit the latter but the of dividend growth stocks and hands off property investing which i assume means paying for a property manager are a better fit for the former   in my opinion the biggest additional factor differentiating these two is liquidity concerns   post tax stock accounts are going to be much easier to turn into emergency cash than a real estate portfolio   whether that 's an important factor depends on personal situation though

yeah me too as i said actually what i 'd really prefer is single payer but failing that getting health insurance separated from employment would be a big step forward if people really knew how much they are paying for health insurance things would change   i 've never worked for an employer that did n't renegotiate health insurance every year often changing insurance providers every year to the extent that hr departments are competent in finding the best value the current environment is pretty dynamic and competitive are individuals going to be as competent and well informed as hr departments i do n't know but i do know that simply making a market free does n't guarantee lower prices if consumers are ill informed and bad at making decisions   as for wages currently companies are not required to carry health insurance and many have dropped it already without increasing wages so i do n't see an upward pressure on wages from greater employee mobility   but it 's true that if there were a single large pool for insurance to be based off of large businesses would no longer get the pool advantage of health insurance over small businesses hence my preference for single payer or single group multi payer

technically yes in most cases you 'll probably get all the amt you pay for exercising in the money incentive stock options isos credited back to you practically however inflation could significantly reduce the value of the money when you get it back remember you can only recover the differential between regular income tax and the tentative minimum tax each year depending on your situation that could be a few thousand dollars or less in which case $ 50k of amt credit would take a while to use up however as you point out if you end up selling your shares you 'll likely use up all your amt credit that year so yes you 'd probably get your $ 50k of amt back but a lot of people do n't have that much to tie up in taxes for an extended period of time

i think you 've got basics but you may have the order emphasis a bit wrong i 've changed the order of the things you 've learned in to what i think is the most important to understand owning a stock is like owning a tiny chunk of the business owning stock is owning a tiny chunk of the business it 's not just like it the tiny chunks are called shares because that is literally what they are a share of the business sometimes shares are also called stocks the words stock and share are mostly interchangeable but a single stock normally means your holding of many shares in a business so if you have 100 shares in 1 company that 's a stock in that company if you then buy 100 shares in another company you now own 2 stocks an investor seeks to buy stocks at a low price and sell when the price is high not necessarily an investor will buy shares in a company that they believe will make them a profit in general a company will make a profit and distribute some or all of it to shareholders in the form of dividends they will also keep back a portion of the profit to invest in growing the company if the company does grow it will grow in value and your shares will get more valuable price of a stock is affected by supply demand volume and possibly company profits the price of a share that you see on a stock ticker is the price that people on the market have exchanged the share for recently not the price you or i can buy a share for although usually if people on the market are buying and selling at that price someone will buy or sell from you at a similar sort of price in theory the price will be the companies total value if you were to own the whole thing it 's market capitalisation divided by the total number of shares that exist in that company the problem is that it 's very difficult to work out the total value of a company you can start by counting the different things that it owns including things like intellectual property and the knowledge and experience of people who work there subtract all the money it owes in loans etc and then make an allowance for how much profit you expect the company to make in the future the problem is that these numbers are all going to be estimates and different peoples estimates will disagree some people do n't bother to estimate at all the market makers will just follow supply and demand they will hold a few shares in each of many companies that they are interested in they will advertise a lower price that they are willing to buy at and a higher price that they will sell at all the time when they hold a lot of a share they will price it lower so that people buy it from them when they start to run out they will price it higher you will never need to spend more than the market makers price to buy a share or get less than the market makers price when you come to sell it unless you want to buy or sell more shares than they are willing to this is why stock price depends on supply and demand the other category of people who do n't care about the companies they are trading are the high speed traders they just look at information like the past price the volume total amount of shares being exchanged on the market and many other statistics both from the market and elsewhere and look for patterns you can not compete with these people they do things like physically locate their servers nearer to the stock exchanges buildings to get a few milliseconds time advantage over their competitors to buy shares quicker than them

note that we do not comment on specific stocks here and have no place doing so if your question is only about that specific stock then it is off topic i have not tried to answer that part below the key to valuation is predicting the net present value of all of a company 's cash flows i.e. of their future profits and losses through a number of methods to long to explain here investment banks and hedge funds work out what they expect the company 's cash flows to be and trade so that these future profits losses etc are priced into the stock price since future cash flows profits or whatever you want to call them are priced in the price of a stock should n't move at all on an earnings statement this begs the question why do some stock prices move violently when they announce earnings the models that the institutional investors use are not perfect and can not take into account everything an unexpected craze for a product or a supply chain agreement breaking down on not being as good as it seems will not be factored into this pricing and so the price will move based on the degree to which expectation is missed or exceeded since penny socks are speculative their value is based far more on the long term expected cash flows and less on the short run cash flows this goes a long way to explaining why some of the highest market capitalisation penny stocks are those making consistent losses this means that they can be far less susceptible to price movements after an earnings announcement even if it is well out of the consensus range higher potential future value comes with the higher risks of penny stocks which discounts current value in the end if people 's expectation of the company 's performance reflects reality then the profitability is priced in and there will be no price movement if the actuality is outside of the expected range then there will be a price movement

what littleadv said is correct   his worth is based on the presumed worth of the total company value which is much greater than all investment dollars combined because of valuation in other words his worth is based on the potential return for his share of ownership at a rate based on the latest valuation of the company he is worth $ 17.5 billion today but the total funding for facebook is only $ 2.4 billion i do n't understand this in private companies valuations typically come from either speculation analysts or from investments   investment valuations are the better gauge because actual money traded hands for a percentage ownership however just as with public companies on the stock market there are at least two caveats just because someone else sold their shares at a given rate does n't mean that rate in both cases it 's possible the value may be much lower or much higher   some high value purchases surprise for how high they are such as microsoft 's acquisition of skype for $ 8.5 billion the formula for one owner 's worth based on a given acquisition is valuation = acquisition amount acquisition percent worth = owner 's percent × valuation according to wikipedia zuckerberg owns 24   in january goldman 's invested $ 500 million at a $ 50 billion valuation that is the latest investment and puts zuckerberg 's worth at $ 12 billion however some speculation places a facebook ipo at a much higher valuation such as as $ 100 billion   i do n't know what your reference is for $ 17 billion but it puts their valuation at $ billion between the january goldman valuation and current ipo speculation for instance originally invested $ 10,000 which at his estimated 5 ownership would now be worth $ 3 5 billion

gt   lol ok buddy you googled some hysterical left wing editorials and i 'm suppose to buy it as trump being anti science they did that same shit with bush and reagan and they 'll do it to the next republican president    i am a scientist and every scientist i know recognizes it   republicans dems and even the few trump supporters   it 's not left wing editorials it 's not just msm   it 's literally every science oriented magazine   i gave links to science which is the magazine for general scientists   gt;&gt    inversely proportional   gt   wow pedantic boy if nothing is evidence of having won an argument it 's when dudes start over definitions inversely proportional works just fine here   not pedantic accurate   as scientists tend to be when there is an underlying equation relationship   there 's a world of difference between y = x + k and y = c + k for positive c.   if you ca n't distinguish these then i 'm glad you 're not a scientist   if you can recognize that these are considerably different then i would suggest you have a problem admitting that you screwed up   gt;&gt   won on income is just poor   gt   nah it was fine you got it    no   i do n't think anyone is asserting causality and won on income asserts causality   for example the same exit polls show race was significant   would you call it good to say won due to racism   also you 'll note that i also did n't assert causality with regard to the amount of education statistic   i do have some in this regard but i do n't have the appropriate data to test it   aside   and before you jump to conclusions my number one hypothesis does n't have to do with intelligence it has to do with critical thinking skills as well as not viewing problems as simple black and white propositions   gt   now you are just trying to hurt my feelings it 's almost as if ad hominem attack is the last recourse of a defeated liberal i believe it 's acceptable to take whatever grammatical liberties necessarily when writing mocking   i 'm glad to see you can use good grammar when you try   but seriously i could n't make heads or tails of your last paragraph and was more than to note that each of your previous paragraphs in that post included sentence fragments missing articles and such   if you 're trying to communicate be clear about it   if you do n't i just wo n't take it seriously

the assumption that companies listed otc are not serious is far from the truth many companies on the otc are just starting off there because they do n't meet the requirements to be listed on the nasdaq or nyse major stock exchanges like the nasdaq and the nyse only want the best companies to trade on their exchanges the nasdaq for example has three sets of listing requirements a company must meet at least one of the three requirement sets as well as the main rules for all companies these include now do n't assume that the otc does n't have rules either as this is far from the truth as well while there are no minimum level of revenue profits or assets required to get listed on the otc there are requirements for audited financial statements and ongoing filing and reporting to the sec and nasd additionally there are several different levels of the otc including the the and the otc pink each with their own set of requirements for more information about what it takes to be listed on otc look here a company deciding to trade on the otc is making the decision to take their company public and they are investing to make it happen currently the fees to get listed on the otc range from $ 30,000 to $ 150,000 depending on the firm you decide to go with and the services they offer as part as their package now i know i would n't consider $ 30 k or more to not be serious money when i looked into the process of getting a company listed on the tsx the requirements seemed a lot more relaxed than those of the major u.s. markets as well consisting of an application records submission and then a decision made by a tsx committee about whether you get listed more information about the tsx here i think the way that the otc markets have gotten such a bad reputation is from these get rich on penny stock companies that you see pumping up otc company stocks and getting massive amounts of people to buy without doing their due diligence and investigating the company and reading its prospectus then when they loose a bunch of money on an ill informed investment decision they blame it on the company being an otc stock   whether you decide to trade the otc market or not i would n't make a decision based on how many exchanges the company is listed on but rather based on the research you do into the company

on a company level roce over wacc would be more meaningful in my view but the end result should be be pretty much the same this concept is closely related to value creation value can only be created when a company 's roce is exceeding its cost of funding wacc this is also tightly related with the npv concept value is only created when the npv on a project is   and to directly answer op study in detail wacc weighted average cost of capital focus on the modigliani miller theorem with taxes and financial distress costs good luck

the trick to using a credit card responsibly is accounting with your old system you were paying for everything out of your savings account   everytime you had an expense it was immediately withdrawn from your savings account and you saw how much money you had left now with a credit card there is n't any money being withdrawn from your savings account until a month later when you have a huge credit card bill the trick is to treat every credit card transaction as if it was a debit card transaction and subtract the money from your available funds on paper immediately   then you 'll know how much money you actually have to spend not by looking at your bank statement but by looking at your available funds number and when the credit card bill comes you 'll have money sitting there waiting to go to the credit card company this requires more work than you had with your old system and if it sounds like too much work you might be better off with a debit card or cash   but if you want to continue to use the credit card you 'll find that the right software will make the accounting process easier   i like ynab but there are other software products that work as well   just make sure that your system accounts for each credit card transaction as it is spent deducting the amount from your budget now so that there is money set aside for the credit card bill   software that simply your spending after the fact is not as useful

nearly all long lived active funds underperform the market over the long run the best they can hope for in almost all cases is to approximate the market return considering that the market return is this fund should be expected to do less well in terms of predicting future performance if its average return is greater than the average market return its future average return can be expected to fall

this may be a lame answer but the best ira contribution strategy is the one that will actually stick to a single lump sum contribution every year may be a difficult thing for you to maintain   when it 's time to make your contribution you may say eh $ 5000 is a lot of money and my checking account balance is kinda low i 'll wait before i contribute   you keep putting it off and then you miss the opportunity for the year if you setup small regular automatic withdrawals your ira contribution will run on auto pilot   depending on your cash flow this may not be favorable though

i 'm aware that this is not how modern economics works i considered pursuing a graduate degree in the subject but chose not to because i disagree with the foundations of the approach     my ideas are n't based in explicit observation of reality as i prioritize reason above observation the difference between the two approaches is similar to the difference between pure mathematics and applied mathematics where the my perspective is pure math and the the modern economist is applied math if you would include the and of pure mathematics as fantasy then my ideas are indeed based in fantasy but you 'd then have to explain why such an approach is wrong given how often the seemingly useless work of pure math ends up proving highly valuable in the long run e.g. number theory and computer science
