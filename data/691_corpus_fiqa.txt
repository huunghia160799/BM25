using the transfer category is the best place to put these categories as that accurately reflects what the transaction is if you have your credit card and bank account linked in mint the debit and credit to both accounts will net to $ 0 in the category   i would not recommend using hide from budget and trends as sometimes multiple erroneous transactions pop up and having a category that should but in error does not net to $ 0 will raise your attention to possibly duplicate transactions you can ask mint to always categorize certain transactions in certain ways on any of your payments if you click edit details and then select the transfer category you can ask mint to always make that classification

i am a believer in that theory my opinion is that over the long term we can expect 25 of income to reflect the payment on one 's mortgage and if you drew a line over time reflecting the mortgage this represents plus the downpayment you 'd be very close to a median home price the bubble that occurred was real but not as dramatic as schiller 's chart implies $ 1000 will support a $ k 30yr mortgage but $ k at 4 this is with no hype and exact same supply demand pressures   the market cap of all us companies adds to about $ the total wealth in the us about $ of course us stocks are n't just held by us citizens it 's a big world   let me suggest two things the world is poor in comparison to much of the us a $ 100,000 net worth puts you in the top 8 in the world the implication of this is that as the poorer 90 work their way up from poverty money will seek investments and there 's room for growth   even if you looked at a closed system the us only the limit absent bubbles would be one that would have to put a cap on productivity in today 's dollars we produce more than we did years ago and less than we will in the future we invent new things faster than the old ones are so any that our $ 18 t market can grow to say $ 30 t does not need to discuss p es or bubbles but rather the creation of new products and businesses that will increase the total market   to summarize   population growth not really discussed productivity and long term reduced poverty will all keep that boundary to be a growing number   that said this question may be economic and not pf in which case my analysis is bound for the off topic barrel fascinating question

what is your time horizon over long horizons you absolutely want to minimise the expense ratio a seemingly 2 fee p.a can cost you a third of your savings over 35 years over short horizons the cost of trading in and trading out might matter more a mutual fund might be front loaded i.e. charge a fixed initial percentage when you first purchase it etfs traded daily on an exchange just like a stock do n't have that what you 'll pay there is the broker commission and the bid ask spread and possibly any premium discount the etf has vis a vis the underlying asset value   another thing to keep in mind is tracking error how closely does the fond mirror the underlying index it attempts to track more often than not it works against you however not sure there is a systematic difference between etfs and funds there size and age of a fund can matter indeed i 've had new and smallish etfs that did n't take off close down so i had to sell and re allocate the money two more minor aspects synthetic etfs and lending to short sellers 1 some etfs are synthetic that is they do n't buy all the underlying shares replicating the index actually owning the shares instead they put the money in the bank and enter a swap with a counter party typically an investment bank that promises to pay them the equivalent return of holding that share portfolio in this case you have implicit credit exposure to that counter party if the index performs well and they do n't pay up well tough luck the etf was relying on that swap never really held the shares comprising the index and wo n't necessarily cough up the difference 2 in a similar vein some non synthetic etfs hold the shares but then lend them out to short sellers earning extra money this will increase the profit of the etf provider and potentially decrease your expense ratio if they pass some of the profit on or charge lower fees so that 's a good thing in case of an operational screw up or if the short seller ca n't fulfil their obligations to return the shares there is a risk of a loss   these two considerations are not really a factor in normal times except in improving etf expense ratios but during the 2009 meltdown they were floated as things to consider mutual funds and etfs re invest or pay out dividends for a given mutual fund you might be able to choose while etfs typically are of one type or the other not sure how tax treatment differs there though sorry not something i have to deal with in my jurisdiction   as a rule of thumb though as alex says for a popular index etfs will be cheaper over the long term very low cost mutual funds such as vanguard might be competitive though

the decision whether this test is or is not met seems to be highly dependent on the specific situation of the employer and the employee   i think that you wo n't find a lot of general references meeting your needs there is such a thing as a private ruling letter where individuals provide specific information about their situation and request the irs to rule in advance on how the situation falls with respect to the tax law   i do n't know a lot about that process or what you need to do to qualify to get a private ruling   i do know that versions of at least some of the rulings are published   you might look for such rulings that are close to your situation i did a quick search and found two that are somewhat related as regards your situation my non expert understanding is that you will not pass in this case unless either a the employer specifies that you must live on the west coast or you 'll be fired b the employer would refuse to provide space for you if you moved to boston or another company location or c you can show that you could not possibly do your job out of boston   for c that might mean for example you need to make visits to client locations in sf on short notice to meet business requirements   if you are only physically needed in sf occasionally and with reasonable notice i do n't think you could make it under c although if the employer does n't want to pay travel costs then you might still make it under a in this case

what you 're looking for are either fx forwards or fx futures    these products are traded differently but they are basically the same thing agreements to deliver currency at a defined exchange rate at a future time    almost every large venue or bank will transact forwards when the counterparty you or your broker has sufficient trust and credit for the settlement risk but the typical duration is less than a year though some will do a single digit multi year forward on a custom basis   then again all forwards are considered custom contracts   you 'll also need to know that forwards are done on currency pairs so you 'll need to pick the currency to pair your nok against   most likely you 'll want eur nok simply for the larger liquidity of that pair over other possible pairs a quote on a forward will usually just be known by the standard currency pair ticker with a settlement date different from spot   e.g. eur nok 12 m for the 12 month settlement futures on the other hand are exchange traded and more standardized   the vast majority through the cme chicago mercantile exchange   your broker will need access to one of these exchanges and you simply need to qualify for futures trading process depends on your broker   futures generally have highest liquidity for the next expiration quarterly expiration on well known standard dates but i believe they 're defined for more years out than forwards    at one fx desk i 've knowledge of they had 6 years worth of quarterly expirations in their system at any one time   futures are generally known by a ticker composed of a globex or cme code for the currency with another code representing the expiration   for example is nok for norwegian h for march and 6 for the nearest future date 's year that ends in 6 i.e. 2016    note that you 'll be legally liable to deliver the contracted size of if you hold through expiration   so the common trade is to hold the future and net out just before expiration when the price more accurately reflects the current spot market

2.5 whoa you are being robbed there   straight up stripped down and bent over a table robbed never agree to fees   if they do n't want to do the work to give you a loan there are other lenders who do rarely agree to points   if you know and i do n't mean think i mean know if you know that you are going to hold that loan much longer than it would take to repay those points then maybe   for example if they are charging one point to lower your rate 0.25 you want to be totally sure you will stay in the house at least four years and probably more like six or eight years before moving or refinancing it 's more or less ok to pay for the appraisal   if something goes wrong with the loan application the appraisal will be valid for a few more months you can try again i once had 14 cash for a down payment   the loan officer said if i could come up with 15 the rate would be reduced by 0.25   to get the money i took a reverse point which paid me 1 but raised my the rate by 0.25 the loan officer who was n't too bright asked why did you do that   the two things cancel each other out i did it i explained because you paid me 1 of the value of my house to sign my name twice

there is really much simpler explanation for the interest rate differences in different countries it is the interest rate arbitrage it is a very well explored economic concept so you can look it up on the internet in case you want to know more 1 interest rates for the same currency in different countries basically as one smart person here pointed out there is only one price of money in free market economy it happens because investors can move their money anywhere in the world to capitalize on the local interest rates advantage for instance if i can take a loan in the usa at 3 4 annual interest and receive 5 6 annual income on my dollar deposit in russia i would take a loan in the us and open a deposit in russia to enjoy a risk free interest rate differential income of 2 5 6 3 4 ~ 2 so would any reasonable person however in real world very few banks in russia or anywhere would pay you an an interest rate higher than it can borrow money at it 'd probably lose money if it 'd do so anyways the difference between the risk free rate and interest rate on the dollar deposit can be attributed to the risk premium of this particular bank the higher expected return the greater risk premium if there is a positive difference in the interest rates on the dollar deposits in different countries it will almost entirely accounted for the risk premium it is generally much riskier to keep money in say russian bank than american that 's why investors want greater return on their dollar deposits in russian banks than in american of course if you 'd want to park your usd in russian bank you 'd also have to consider transaction costs so as you may have already guessed there is no free lunch 2 interest rates in different currencies for different countries if we are talking about the interest rates in different sovereign currencies it is a somewhat similar concept only there is more risk if you keep money in local currency risk premium is much higher probably the biggest component of this risk is inflation that is only attributed to the prices in local currency for that reason current interest rates on deposits in russian rubles are at 10 12 but only 1 3 in the us dollars an economic concept that discusses this phenomenon in great detail is interest rate parity   hope this was helpful p.s. it does n't look quite realistic that you can get an 8 annual income for usd deposit in russia with the interest rates in the u.s. being at 1 2 at present moment a 30-year mortgage annual interest rate in the us is at ~2 3 and an annual interest rates for dollar deposits in one of the safest russian banks = very little risk premium is at 1 3 so arbitrage is impossible

i do n't like buying individual bonds for my own portfolio   i actually used to buy long term government strip bonds or provincial bonds but i stopped   here are some reasons why my broker allows me to purchase bonds via their web application   however to sell a bond i had to call in to the fixed income trading desk   that was inconvenient   but your broker may be different bonds do n't typically trade on a formal exchange   so there 's no cheap easy way as far as i know to get an independent quote for a bond 's value i had to trust what my broker said my bond was worth when assessing my portfolio performance    i asked my broker once how they arrive at the market value shown i.e. whether it was last bid ask or actual trade and i was told they use a third party bond quotation valuation information provider for the data and that quotes are an estimate of what the bond would be worth based on similar bonds   i quickly learned that was n't the value i could actually get when selling it when you 're dealing with your broker to buy and sell bonds you 're likely dealing with theirs or a related investment bank which makes a market for specific issues of bonds   while i was n't being charged an explicit commission to buy or sell bonds it was evident the broker makes money off the spread   that is the difference between what they would be willing to sell a bond for and what they would be willing to buy that same bond for   they will buy your bond back from you cheaper than what they could turn around and sell it to somebody else for   that 's why they do n't charge an explicit commission it 's built in and hidden anyway when i finally discovered my broker would seldom actually offer me the market value quoted for my bonds typically it would be bought back for a few percent less than it were theoretically worth i gave up   i do n't think bonds simply are liquid enough nor the costs transparent enough for retail investors   or maybe it 's just me however i do think bonds remain an important part of a diversified portfolio   bonds ought to be represented in a diversified portfolio using low cost bond index mutual funds or exchange traded funds   since these funds buy sell bonds in large quantities they get a better deal on the spreads   so while you do pay an explicit management fee for a fund you are probably saving since you 're not getting shafted on the spreads

i 'm not convinced that cost of living is related to ensuring greater appreciation of assets over time especially over a 30 year window the importance of regional differences in cost of living to anyone 's decision making should be weighted by the percentage of their income spent on indexed items   that is for people who spend 35 or even 50 of their salary on indexed items regional variances in cost of living are far more important than for people who spend 10 of their salaries on these items   essentially as income goes up the significance of cost of living goes down see for a pretty picture of the relevance of cost of living across income groups for food gas which are often not included in indexes due to volatility   so if you are wondering whether cost of living is overstated perhaps it 's because you are in an income group that does n't need to worry about it as much   whether it 's overstated or not will depend on how much one makes and spends

typically this is n't a random having a small volume just means it 's not showing on the chart but it is a price point same thing would've happened if it would've been a very large order that shows on the chart consider also that this could have been the first one of many transactions that go far below your stop point would you not have wanted it to be executed then at this time as it did would you expect the system to look into future and decide that this is a one time dip and not sell versus it is a crash and sell either way the system can not look in the future so it has no way to know if a crash is coming or if it was a short dip therefore the are executed as given sell if any transfer happens below the limit to avoid that or at least reduce the chance for it you can either leave more distance and risk a higher loss when it crashes or trade higher volumes so the short small dip wo n't execute your order also very liquid stocks will not show such small transaction dips

you are neglecting a few very important things around real estate transactions in belgium so in the end a 300 k building may cost you more than 340 k let 's take some unexpected costs into account and use 350 k for remainder of calculation even worse if it 's newly built which i doubt the first percentage is 21 vat instead of 10 all these costs can be checked on the useful site now aside from that most banks will and actually have to demand you pay part of all this yourself so you ca n't do 5 60 k or 5 70 k now mostly banks will only finance up to about 90 of the value of the building so 90 of 300 k which is 270 k 5 54 k the other 80 k 5 16 k you have to pay yourselves but it could be the bank goes as low as 80 another part to complicate the loan is how much you can pay a month since the mortgage crisis they 're very strict on this there are lots of banks that will not allow you to make monthly payments of more than 33 of your monthly income when you are going to live there this is a nuisance even when buying one house you want to buy 2 odds seem low they 'll accept high monthly payments because you either need an additional loan or need to pay rent so do n't count on a 5y deal now this is all based on a single loan it will probably be a bit different with multiple loans however it is unlikely any bank will accept this even if all loans are with the same bank you need to consider the basics of a real estate loan a bank trusts you can pay it off and if not they can seize the real estate hoping to regain their initial investment it 's very hard to seize a complete asset if only one out of 5 loan takers you could   maybe do this with another less restrictive higher risk type of loan but rates will be a lot higher think 5 6 instead of 1.5 and do n't underestimate the running costs for that price and 5 rooms in that city you 're likely looking at an older building expect lots of cost for maintenance and keeping the building according to code also expect costs for repairs you rent to students you 'll also have to pay quite a bit of money on insurances and of course on real estate taxes which are average in also factor in that currently there is not a housing shortage for students so you might not always have a guaranteed occupation also take into account responsibility if a fire breaks out or the house collapses or a gas leak occurs you might be sued it does n't matter if you 're at fault it 's costly and a big nuisance simply because you did n't think of any of this do n't do this it 's better to invest in real estate funds but if you still think you can do better then all the landlords is riddled with do n't do it as a personal investment create a put some investment in here like 10 20 k each approach a bank with a serious business plan to get the rest of the money as a loan towards a single entity your and get things going when the money comes in you can either give yourselves a salary or pay out profits on the shares you may be confused about how rich you can become because we as a nation tend to overestimate the profitability of real estate it 's really not that much better than other investments otherwise everybody would only invest in real estate funds there are a few things that skew our vision however

the answer is simple you can generally claim a deduction for an expense if that expense was used to derive an income most business expenses are used to derive profits and income most individual expenses are not of course social policy sometimes gets in the way and allows for deductions where they usually would n't be allowed regarding the interest on a mortgage being deductible whilst the principal is n't that is because it is the interest which is the annual expense by the way deductions for mortgage interest in the usa for a house you live in is only allowed due to social policy as there is no income rent being produced here unlike with an investment property

etfs offer the flexibility of stocks while retaining many of the benefits of mutual funds since an etf is an actual fund it has the diversification of its potentially many underlying securities you can find etfs with stocks at various market caps and style categories you can have bond or mixed etfs you can even get etfs with equal or fundamental weighting in short all the variety benefits of mutual funds etfs are typically much less expensive than mutual funds both in terms of management fees expense ratio and taxable gains most of them are not actively managed instead they follow an index and therefore have a low turnover a mutual fund may actively trade and if not balanced with a loss will generate capital gains that you pay taxes on an etf will produce gains only when shifting to keep inline with the index or you yourself sell as a reminder while expense ratio always matters capital gains and dividends do n't matter if the etf or mutual fund is in a tax advantaged account etfs have no load fees instead because you trade it like a stock you will pay a commission commissions are straight up front and perfectly clear much easier to understand than the various ways funds might charge you there are no account minimums to entry with etfs but you will need to buy complete shares only a few places allow partial shares it is generally harder to dollar cost average into an etf with regular automated investments also like trading stocks you can do those fancy things like selling short buying on margin options etc and you can pay attention to the price fluctuations throughout the day if you really want to things to make you pause if you buy no load mutual funds through the parent company you 'll get them at no commission many brokerages have no transaction fee ntf agreements with companies so that you can buy many funds for free still look out for that expense ratio though which is probably paying for that ntf advantage as sort of a middle ground index funds can have very low expense ratios track the same index as an etf can be tax efficient or tax managed free to purchase easy to dollar cost average and easier to automate understand further reading

well it would appear that you had a wash sale that canceled out a loss position   without seeing the entire report i could n't tell you exactly what was happening or how you triggered 1091   but just from the images it appears as though your purchase of stock was layered into multiple tranches perhaps you acquired more of the stock in the period than you sold possibly because of a prior holding    if in the period around the sale of stock 30 days before and 30 days after you also acquire the same stock including by contract or option then it out your loss   if you held your stock for a while then in a period bought more and sold some then any loss would be washed out by the acquisition   of course it is also a wash sale if your purchase of the stock follows your sale rather than it   your disallowed loss goes into the basis of your stock holding so will be meaningful when you do have a true economic sale of that stock from irs pub 550 a wash sale occurs when you sell or trade stock or securities at a loss and within 30 days before or after the sale you buy substantially identical stock or securities acquire substantially identical stock or securities in a fully taxable trade acquire a contract or option to buy substantially identical stock or securities or acquire substantially identical stock for your individual retirement account ira or roth ira if you sell stock and your spouse or a corporation you control buys substantially identical stock you also have a wash sale looking at your account images we can see a number of positions sold at a loss sale proceeds less than basis but each one is adjusted to a zero loss   i suspect the fuller picture of your account history and portfolio will show a more complicated and longer history with this particular stock   that is likely the source of the wash sale disallowed loss you might be able to confirm that all the added numbers are appearing in your current basis in this stock or were reflected upon your final exit from the stock

when they make the most money off of charging interest on late payments this is incorrect do you have any data to back this in the past decade there was a tendency by financial institutions to make money from late payments and there were certain rewards incentives for people who paid late however the bubble cracked soon enough and there were huge losses in the card industry today most of the revenue for card companies is from margins on customers who pay on time and growth avenues are promoting to pay every transaction by card why do they actively seek people who pay their bills on time as evidence by requiring good credit scores to get approved for a card instead of they opposite as indicated above remember if one customer defaults it wipes out margins made by tons of customers in spite of giving credit to people with good credit score the average credit card debit an us individual holds is still quite high

the answer for me has to do with compounding that drop in price post ex div is not compounded but if you reinvest your dividends back into the stock then you buy on those post ex div dips in price and your money is compounded because those shares you just bought will themselves yeald dividends next quarter   also with my broker i reinvest the dividend incurring no commission my broker has a feature to reinvest dividends automatically and he charges no commission on those buys edit i forgot to mention that you do not the loss from a drop in price until you sell the security if you do not sell post ex div then you have no loss as long as the dividend remains the same or increases then the theoretical roi on that security goes up the drop in price is actually to your benefit because you are able to acquire more shares with the money you just received in the dividend   so the price coming down post ex div is a good thing if you buy and hold

one such strategy i have heard for those who have this opportunity is to purchase the maximum allowed when the window to sell opens sell all of your shares and repurchase the most you can with the amount you gained or keep an equivalent to avoid another transaction fee this allows you to buy at a discount and spread out the risk by investing elsewhere   this way you are really only exposing yourself to lose money which you would n't have had access to without the stock discount

it will depend on how much you expect to earn this way and whether you expect the company to become profitable soon has the company just not made a profit yet or has it actually made a significant loss that your invoices would just be offsetting if you 're earning over £ 10,000 per year then invoicing through the company is preferable above that level you 'd be taking money from the company as dividends after paying 20 corporation tax with no other tax to pay on your personal tax return as a sole trader you 'd be paying 20 income tax and 9 ni note however that the company can only pay dividends from profits which is a problem if there are significant losses to offset below £ 10,000 there 's little difference through the company you can take a salary of £ per year without paying any income tax or ni with the new £ 2000 discount on employers ni you could then take salary up to £ 10,000 and just pay 12 employee 's ni as a sole trader you pay 9 class 4 ni over £ and a fixed £ 143 per year for class 2 ni paying 9 rather than 12 saves you £ 60 but then you add the £ 143 in practice the company would work out more expensive at this level because you 'll probably want to pay an accountant to deal with the payroll for you having the company repay your £ 2000 from the invoices does n't really save any tax if the company will become profitable in the future you do n't pay any tax now since the money you receive is n't income and the company does n't pay any tax if the extra £ 2000 of revenue does n't put it back in profit however if the company is profitable next year then it will have an extra £ 2000 of profit that would otherwise have been offset against this year 's loss and you do end up paying 20 corporation tax on the £ 2000 you could still have the company repay the loan in order to delay the tax liability but it 's not really tax free money loaning additional money to the company has no tax benefit you just give the company £ 1000 and get your original £ 1000 back later you pay no tax and neither does the company but it was your money in the first place

yes it does matter you are right that lower demand for a stock will drive its price down lower stock prices can hurt the company take a look at 's answer to this question a declining share price will make it hard to secure credit attract further investors build partnerships etc also employees are often holding options or in a stock purchase plan so a declining share price can severely dampen morale in an extreme case if share prices plummet too far the company can be pressured to reverse split the shares and eventually take the company private this recently happened to playboy if you do not want to support a company for whatever reason then it is wise to avoid their stock

it 's pretty easy for foreign scammers to get a us phone number or email    a domestic bank account is a little harder   very likely the direct contact   is a us citizen or a legal immigrant   the nigerian may be completely made up to throw you off the scent   and that person can be found or deported and there 's even a small chance of reversing the bank transfers it 's also hard for foreign scammers to sound american on the phone again suggesting a domestic scam or one with domestic agents   if you or your son is willing to do a serious amount of skill building and legwork you can uncover evidence by filing a lawsuit   once you have done so you can use the legal processes of discovery to force banks etc to give you information they would never give willingly   there are countless details   lawyers get paid to get the details right    suing actual people can backfire they can   but since you do not know their real name you would probably be filing a john doe lawsuit   john doe is a placeholder the idea being that you will later through discovery uncover the defendants real names   for a novice exploring the legal system for the first time there 's a big advantage john doe never or he never gets in your way or wastes your time heck he never even shows up in court and when you collect evidence via discovery you can take that to law enforcement or immigration    it goes without well there 's no need to go into that   just realize you did goof and make sure you learn the lessons

is investing in a roth retirement account only better if you will be in a higher     tax bracket in retirement if you are pushing up against the contribution limits a roth account may allow you to save more money in tax advantaged accounts in your example you are putting $ 100 pre tax in a traditional account vs $ 85 post tax in a roth account but if there are limits and the limits are the same for traditional or roth accounts as they currently are for us 401(k accounts you can effectively put more into a roth account where the limit applies to the post tax amount than a traditional account where the limit applies to the pre tax amount if so is there any case in which a traditional retirement account is better than a roth account it is smart to have some money in a traditional account because the first amount of money you earn or withdraw each year up to the standard deduction is taxed at 0 which is probably less than your current rate and the next bit of money is taxed at only 10 which may also be less than your current marginal rate of course things may change by the time you retire but it is probably safe to assume that we will still have some kind of progressive income tax structure

as said by others buying shares of a company will not support it directly but let 's think about two example companies company a which has 90 stocks owned by supporters and company b which has only 1 of stocks owned by supporters both companies release bad news for example profits have decreased in company b most investors might want to sell their stock quickly and the price will plummet in company a the supporters continue believing in the company and will not want to sell it the price will drop less usually but it can drop even more if the sellers of company a are very desperate to get rid of the stock so why is it important for the company to have a high stock price in the short term it 's not important one example is that the company can release more stocks and receive more financing by doing that other reasons are listed here

matt levine 's first point here is very interesting as a lens for understanding why so many large hedge funds seem to have difficulty beating the market while the ones that do tend to be either smaller operations or more independent groups within the giants   if you look at the best firms in the world like or you see a trend where they typically stop taking in outside capital and effectively convert to family offices at least for the most profitable strategies levine 's point here is particularly applicable to it has famously incredible returns via medallion but not so much the other funds unsurprisingly the medallion fund is entirely employee and owner capital   as extremely profitable strategies scale up to their capacity constraints fund managers naturally decide to pool greater amounts of their own capital into the firm therefore skin in the game is not only effective as an intuitive heuristic for skill this manager believes in the fund enough to put most of their personal net worth into it but it 's also practically effective for showing how likely the firm is to perform based on how much you 're able to participate   as the percentage of skin in the game increases the likelihood of outside investors being able to participate decreases because the fund managers know they no longer need to share risk and do n't want to waste allocations on the way to capacity constraints if a firm is soliciting capital it 's highly suspect and managers who go on to become the next jim simons or seth klarman will mostly be on the market for relatively short periods of time

you have a good thing going one of the luxuries of being invested in an index fund for the long term is that you do n't have to sweat the inevitable short term dips in the market instead look at the opportunity that presents itself on market dips now your monthly investment is getting in at a lower price buy low sell high do n't lose money these are common for long term investment mentality 5 8 years is plenty of time i 'd call it medium term as you get closer to your goals ~2 3 years out you should start slowly moving money out of your index fund and start dollar cost averaging out into cash or short term bonds but that 's another question keep putting money in wait and sell high if it 's not high wait another year or two to buy the house a lot of people do the opposite for their entire lives buying high panic selling on the dips then buying again when it goes up that 's bad i recommend a search on dollar cost averaging which is exactly what you are doing right now with your monthly investments

well if you worked in the united states you have social security and medicare and medicaid in most cases as well   so you have a small amount of income to spend every month to cover your most basic living expenses as well as your basic medical expenses   at least that 's the idea in reality it probably is n't anywhere near enough money for most to live comfortably   also there is a real fear that the us will have to inflate itself out of its debt to some extent in the future   this theory implies that the money retired individuals have saved or are receiving down the road could buy significantly less in the future than they expect if you have the ability to put money away into an ira or 401 k early in your life it will be greatly beneficial to do so   however that is another issue i wo n't begin to discuss fully here edit since your question was restated after i typed my initial response the final answer is   you will receive some assistance from social security medicare and medicaid   you will most likely need to either continue working draw on savings such as an ira or 401k or will need assistance from others   if none of those are options you would most likely end up living in poverty or worse

the short answer is that it depends on the taxation laws in your country the long answer is that there are usually tax avoidance mechanisms that you can use which may make it more economically feasible for you to go one way or the other consider the following the long term average growth rate of the stock market in australia is around 7   the average interest on a mortgage is 4.75   assuming you have money left over from a 20 deposit you have a few options   you could 1 put that money into an index fund for the long term understanding that the market may not move for a decade or even move downwards 2 dump that money straight into the mortgage 3 put that money in an offset account option 1 will get you over the course of 30 40 years around 7 return   if and when that profit is realised it will be taxed at a minimum of half your marginal tax rate probably around 20 netting you around 5.25 option 2 will effectively earn you 4.75 pa tax free option 3 will effectively earn you 4.75 pa tax free with the added bonus that the money is ready for you to draw upon on short notice of the three options until you have a good 3 + months of living expenses covered i 'd go with the offset account every single time once you have a few months worth of living expenses covered i would the adopt a policy of spreading your risk   in australia that would mean extra contributions to my super 401k in the us and possibly purchasing an investment property as well once i had the capital to positively gear it of course you should find out more about the tax laws in your country and do your own maths

if you owned a bank how would you invest the bank 's money   typically banks are involved in loaning out money to businesses people and government at a higher interest rate then what they are paying to depositors   this is the spread and how they make money if the bank determines that the yields on government bonds is more attractive then loaning the money out to businesses and people then the bank will purchase government bonds   it can also decide the other way   in this manner the mortgage and bond markets are always competing for capital and tend to offer very similar yields certain banks have the unique privilege of being able to borrow money from the fed at the federal funds rate and use this money to purchase government debt or loan it out to other banks or purchase other debt products in this manner you see a high correlation between the fed funds rate mortgage rates and treasury yields     other political factors include legislation that encourages mortgage lending see community reinvestment act where banks may not have made the loans without said legislation in short keep your eye on the fed and ask yourself does the fed want rates to rise and can the us government afford rising rates   the answer to these two questions is no   however the fed may be pressured to stop the presses if inflation becomes unwieldy and the fed actually starts to care about food and energy prices   so far this has n't been the case

i think you underestimate the power politics and play in teacher ratings and the impact of local school systems   until unless the us moves to a national system then the notion of good and bad teachers is entirely up to the officials who oversee the teacher and thus more a matter of politics than any sort of absolute rating   indeed i 'd suggest a rating is not only but impossible

you ca n't get a heloc to the best of my knowledge without actually owning the house if you get an 80 mortgage of the purchase price not the appraised value btw you still need 20 as a down payment once you own the home you can apply for a heloc presuming you have enough equity eg the purchase price is $ 40k less than the appraised value we have n't looked at the norm at least where i live of 5 down for a traditional mortgage and 3.5 for an fha which your question touches on if you can do 5 down on a $ 1,000,000 mortgage you need $ 50,000 on the day of closing if the home is worth ie appraises for $ you 're getting 20 of the house for free presuming the bank(s will go for it you could likely then open a heloc for as much as $ 250,000 again depending on individual lender rules tl;dr if you do n't have the money ready on the day of signing via if it is a loan gift or because you have been saving you can not afford the house to clarify from comments with the op i am in no way speaking to the buyer 's ability to afford the monthly payments this is only about affording the initial costs associated with the home buying process down payment closing whatever else the bank(s require etc

well if one share cost $ 100 and the company needs to raise $ 10000 then the company will issue 100 shares for that price   right however say there 's 100 shares out there now then each share holder owns 1/100th of the company now the company will remain the same but it 's shared between 200 shareholders after the issuing of new shares   that means each share holder now owns of the company   and hence only gets of their earnings etc

an employee costs the company in four ways salary taxes benefits and capital salary the obvious one what they pay you taxes there are several taxes that an employer has to pay for the privilege of hiring someone including social security taxes which goes to your retirement unemployment insurance tax your unemployment benefits if they lay you off and workers compensation tax pays if you are injured on the job there may be other taxes that i 'm not thinking of but in any case those are the main ones benefits in the u.s. employers often pay for medical insurance sometimes for dental life and disability there 's usually some sort of retirement plan they expect to give you some number of vacation days holidays and sick days where they pay you even though you 're not working companies sometimes offer other benefits like discounts on buying company products membership in health clubs etc capital often the company has to provide you with some sort of equipment like a computer furniture like a chair and desk etc as far as the company is concerned all of the above are part of the cost of having you as an employee if they would pay a domestic employee $ 60,000 in salary and $ 20,000 in taxes then assuming the same benefits and capital investment if a foreign employee would cost them $ 0 in taxes they should logically be willing to pay $ 80,000 any big company will have accountants who figure out the total cost of a new employee in excruciating detail and they will likely be totally rational about this a smaller company might think well taxes do n't really count this is irrational but people are not always rational i do n't know what benefits they are offering you if any and what equipment they will provide you with if any   i also do n't know what taxes if any a u.s. company has to pay when hiring a remote employee in a foreign country if anybody on here knows the answer to that please chime in balanced against that the company likely sees disadvantages to hiring a foreign remote employee too communication will be more difficult which may result in inefficiency my previous employer used some contractors in india and while there were certainly advantages the language and time zone issues caused difficulties there are almost certainly some international bureaucratic inconveniences they will have to deal with etc so while you should certainly calculate what it would cost them to have a domestic employee doing the same job that 's not necessarily the end of the story and ultimately it all comes down to negotiations even if the company knows that by the time they add in taxes and benefits and whatever a domestic employee will cost them $ 100,000 a year if they are absolutely convinced that they should be able to hire an austrian for $ 60,000 a year that might be the best offer you will get you can point out the cost savings and maybe they will concede the point and maybe not

thanks it has taken me some time to understand how all this works and there are still many gray areas i want to understand further   the fed interest rate is the rate charged by banks to loan to each other to balance overnight reserves but only using the reserves they hold at the fed that adds no new money to the system but increases the money multiplier a little since perhaps more loans can be made    basically one bank with excess reserves can loan to another bank that needs reserves the fed injects no money here only sets the rate for banks to do this with each other   when the fed buys securities that effectively adds that many more dollars into circulation which then gets hit by the money multiplier adding a lot of new liquidity   i think historically the latter tracks increases in the money supply much better than the former i think the st. louis fed has records online for all this dating back to the 1940 's or so

sounds like a terrible situation the only thing i can think of if you have the cash for it is to pay down enough of the mortgage and refinance to the point where the rent covers the mortgage plus expenses on the one hand this feels like literally burning money in the fireplace as you will likely never see back the difference between the likely value when you sell and what you are putting in now on the other hand every time you make an interest payment you are burning the smaller amount of money with no hope of seeing it back ever if you do n't have the cash or you find that just throwing away money then i would get out as fast as i can every month you hold you are paying a huge amount of interest if you sold at $ 300,000 you would have only a $ 30,000 debt to manage the total amount it would take to pay that off at anything resembling normal interest rates would probably be less than you have already sunk into this thing of course if you are willing to bet that the market will come back and make you profitable on what you will have to put in from now on then you might want to hold on personally i would not make that bet all around a terrible situation i wish you lots of luck in resolving it

there are a lot of good answers but i will share my experience   first a savings account needs to be for savings if your in the us you have regulation d to deal with and that will bite you on the rear if you go over those limits specially easy to do if your purchasing from a savings account   next having an income account and a spending account can be a very good tool to build a nest egg so for example you get $ 1500 into your income account and then move $ 1000 to your spending account then budget based on that $ 1000 this is an amazing thing to do so long as you have the discipline to never transfer that extra $ 500 and pretend your broke when you run out of the $ 1000   that being said there is no reason that you ca n't do that in one account it 's all preference my wife and i use ynab an envelope budgeting system to do just that we do n't need the separate accounts we are no more likely to not spend in one account then we are to not spend in two accounts it 's all just self discipline and what you need to do   this does lead to the situation we call ynab broke it 's when we have to start choosing between   going hungry or getting that new dvd even though our bank account has $ 5,000 in it   it 's even harder when you choose go hungry and have to follow through with it even though you have enough to buy a used car in your bank account   but rather it 's ynab broke or your spending account is empty and your income account it full the result is the same it 's up to you to have the self discipline not to spend rather that 's in one account or two makes little difference

there are a lot of open questions about if this is your only accessible money or if you have other emergency funds and if you have any retirements savings and when do you plan to retire but leaving this all aside you currently pay 2.65 on the mortgage and you make less on savings maybe 1 or 1.5 so putting the savings into the mortgage makes you the difference which is a good deal however you need to reflect this with your risk and your long term goals and look at potential even better deals for example you could put the savings into higher risk higher gain investments let ’s assume index funds and make 6 10 per year in average that obviously is a lot more why would you not want to do that investing like this is a long term plan if this is your only savings emergency fund or if you need the money within the next five years you should not do it it could catch you in a bad market situation and then it might be a severe loss if you are sure you do n’t need it for at least five if not ten years invest it and keep the mortgage you will easily beat its interest rate if you are risk averse and ca n’t sleep with your savings doing while you watch that is also not a plan for you there are many things to consider and your personal situation is relevant for the decision consider all options and be sure to always have a emergency fund remaining it is also not black and white there are options in between of your two propositions pay some in and keep some for emergencies

well it all kind of depends    the realtor is your pro and you should communicate further with him   is this a neighborhood on the decline   is there a good reason to make such a low offer   are you totally off base when you think 85 k is fair and if so why   is he just working his tail off for you a great thing one thing that is a key to this negotiation is financing   what does your financing status look like   a reasonable cash offer with no contingencies and a quick close might be less than   a person with strong financing can get a better discount then a person that is questionable it could be that the realtor is testing the waters to find the bottom price   the home selling season is closed typically the summer and the home has been on the market for a bit   offering 70 k might mean a counter at 82 k so you can work on an offer between 80 and 82    to me it sounds like this guy is working for you   you should thank him   it is pretty hard to find a realtor that is willing to negotiate his pay down in order to save you money    also he can answer the closing cost question better than us as he is more familiar with your particular market

some index funds offer lower expense ratios to those who invest large amounts of money for example vanguard offers admiral shares of many of its mutual funds including several index funds to individuals who invest more than $ 50 k or $ 100 k and these shares have lower expense ratios than the investor shares in the fund there are institutional shares designed for investments by pension plans 401k plans of large companies etc which have even lower expenses than admiral shares individuals working for large companies sometimes get access to institutional shares through their 401k plans   thus there is something to gained by investing in just one index fund for a particular index that offers lower expense ratios for large investments instead of diversifying into several index funds all tracking the same index of course this advantage might be offset by failure to track the index closely but this tracking should be monitored not on a daily basis but over much longer periods of time to test whether your favorite fund is trailing the index by far more than its competitors with larger expense ratios remember that the net asset value nav published by each mutual fund after the markets close already take into account the expense ratio

to answer your question as clarified in a comment all i wanted to know what will happen if i enter my debit card number in the sixteen digit account number they offer on the application for balance transfer that 's all almost certainly subject to the particular terms and conditions of the offer no money will move the only question is exactly when and how they will say no if you do it online and their system is clever enough to look up the the first six digits of the card number you enter their system might learn straight away that you   have entered a debit card number eg a card starting is a bank of ireland debit card otherwise you 'll have to wait until the request goes to their back office system which will eventually lead to the card issuer 's system being contacted at which point it will become clear that it 's a debit card and your transfer request will be refused at that point that said some credit card companies do offer a money transfer aka super balance transfer which is an offer to transfer money directly into a bank account putting the resulting debt on the credit card i 've never seen these offered without having to call a service centre and talk to a person though presumably so that they can check that the details they have for you about income etc are still correct

first i want to point out that your question contains an assumption does anyone make significant money trading low volume stocks   i 'm not sure this is the case i 've never heard of a hedge fund trading in the pink sheets for example second if your assumption is valid here are a few ideas how it might work accumulate slowly exit slowly   this wo n't work for short term swings but if you feel like a low volume stock will be a longer term winner you can accumulate a sizable portion in small enough chunks not to swing the price and then slowly unwind your position when the price has increased sufficiently create additional buyers sellers   your frustration may be one of the reasons low volume stock is so full of scammers pumping and dumping read any investing message board to see examples of this   if you can scare holders of the stock into selling you can buy significant portions without driving the stock price up   similarly if you can convince people to buy the stock you can unload without destroying the price   this is of course morally and legally dubious so i would not recommend this practice

as the offshore planning world turns the limited liability company llc is starting to appear with greater frequency as an alternative to the conventional offshore asset protection trust   it is desirable because unlike the offshore trust which requires an independent trustee the llc permits the client to remain in full control as the manager of the entity   while the typical offshore trust provides the highest form of asset protection the asset protection afforded by the llc is significant and with retained control provides a powerful combination   recently st. vincent and the as well as have sought to improve their legislation by offering superior llc statutes   each is progressive and will be desirable for planners and clients alike

a trailing stop will sell x shares at some percentage below the current market price   putting in this order with a 10 trailing stop when the stock price is $ 50 will sell the stock when it hits $ 45   it 's a market order at that point see below a stop order will sell the stock when it reaches a certain price   the stop order becomes a market order when the magic price is hit   this means that you may not sell it at or below your price when the order is executed   but the stock will sell faster because the trader must execute a stop limit order is the same as a stop order except the stock wo n't be sold if it ca n't be gotten for the price   as a result the sell may not be executed more information here

since your youtube income is considered self employment income and because you probably already made more than $ 400 in net income after deducting expenses from the $ 4000 you 've received so far you will have to pay self employment tax and file a return   this is according to the irs 's publication 17 2016 your federal income tax so assumes the same rules for 2016 will remain in effect for 2017 you are self employed if you carry on a trade or business as a sole proprietor are an independent contractor are a member of a partnership or are in business for yourself in any other way self employment can include work in addition to your regular full time business activities such as certain part time work you do at home or in addition to your regular job you must file a return if your gross income is at least as much as the filing requirement amount for your filing status and age shown in table 1 1 also you must file form 1040 and schedule se form 1040 self employment tax if your net earnings from self employment excluding church employee income were $ 400 or more or you had church employee income of $ or more see table 1 3 use schedule se form 1040 to figure your self employment tax self employment tax is comparable to the social security and medicare tax withheld from an employee 's wages for more information about this tax see pub 334 tax guide for small business i 'd also note that your predicted income is getting close to the level where you would need to pay estimated taxes which for self employed people work like the withholding taxes employers remove their employees paychecks and pay to the government if you end up owing more than $ 1000 when you file your return you could be assessed penalties for not paying the estimated taxes there is a grace period if you had to pay no taxes in the previous year 2016 in this case that could let you escape those penalties

yes if you can split your income up over multiple years it will be to your advantage over earning it all in one year   the reasons are as you mentioned you get to apply multiple deductions credits exemptions to the same income rather than just 1 standard deduction you get to deduct 2 standard deductions you can double the max saved in an ira you benefit more from any non refundable credits etc this is partly due to the fact that when you are filing your taxes in year 1 you ca n't include anything from year 2 since it has n't happened yet it does n't make sense for the government to take into account actions that may or may not happen when calculating your tax bill there are factors where other year profit loss can affect your tax liability however as far as i know these are limited to businesses look into loss carry forwarded back if you want to know more regarding the 30 simple rate i think you are confusing something that is simple to say with something that is simple to implement   are we going to go change the rules on people who expected their mortgage deduction to continue there are few ways i can think of that are more sure to cause home prices to plummet than to eliminate the mortgage interest deduction what about removing student loan interest under a 30 simple rate what tools would the government use to encourage trade in specific areas will state income tax deduction also be removed this is going to punish those in a state with a high income tax more than those in states without income tax those are all just common deductions that affect a lot of people you could easily say no to all of them and just piss off a bunch of people but what about selling stock though i paid $ 100 for the stock and i sold it for $ 120 do i need to pay $ 36 tax on that because it is a simple 30 tax rate or are we allowing the cost of goods sold deduction it 's called something else i believe when talking about stocks but it 's the same idea what about if i travel for work to tutor individuals can i deduct my mileage expenses do i need to pay 30 income tax on my earnings and principal from a roth ira a lot of people have contributed to a roth with the understanding that withdrawals will be tax free changing those rules are punishing people for using vehicles intentionally created by the government are we going to go around and dismantle all non profits that entirely on tax deductible donations do i need to pay taxes on the employer 's cost of my health insurance what about 401k 's and ira 's being true to a simple 30 tax will eliminate all benefits from every job as you would need to pay taxes on the value of the benefits i should mention that this is n't exactly too crazy there was a relatively recent irs publication about businesses needing to withhold taxes from their employees for the cost of company supplied food but i do n't know if it was ultimately accepted at the end of the day the concept of simplifying the tax law is n't without merit but realize that the complexities of tax law are there due to the complexities of life the vast majority of tax laws were written for a reason other than to benefit special interests and for that reason they can not easily be ignored

wikipedia has a good summary historically branch banking in the united states especially interstate branch banking was viewed by regulatory authorities and this was codified with the enactment of the act of 1927 which specifically prohibited interstate banking over the next few decades some banks attempted to circumvent 's provisions by establishing bank holding companies that operated so called independent banks in multiple states to address this the bank holding company act of 1956 prohibited bank holding companies headquartered in one state from having branches in any other state most interstate banking prohibitions were repealed by the interstate banking and branching efficiency act of 1994 research has also found that anticompetitive state provisions restricted out of state growth when those provisions were more restrictive than the provisions set by the interstate banking and branching efficiency act or by neighboring states some states have also had restrictive bank branch laws for example illinois outlawed branches other than the main office until 1967 and did not allow an unlimited number until 1993

there is a lot misinformation in this thread that i 'd like to clear up in fact you 're more than welcomed to pm me if you wish to see any backup to the statements i 'm about to make    first i 'd like to say that as an uber lyft driver the experience has been nothing short of i normally work in the l.a. and areas of so cal and the amount of interesting super successful and wonderful people i meet on a daily basis is off the charts it 's as if i 'm some sort of talk show host on wheels    initially i applied for lyft as the social and community angle of its service intrigued the hell out of me i 'm an outgoing guy and i 'm also an artist of some type who receives a royalty check only once a month instead of doing and begging for money i thought doing lyft would be a great idea instead so far my customers have been nothing short of an inspiration anyway after passing a background check a driving test with my mentor a driving record check alongside submitting all my documentation license registration insurance and a quick vehicle inspection my car is rather new and in great condition i was hired quickly    that same day i decided to get to work quickly see how the whole system works as soon as i got to the destination i wanted to get to i got my first call on my phone within 5 minutes i use my gps and rush to pick my customer up while obeying all traffic laws of course after a couple of minutes of chit chat i come to find out my first lyft customer ever is an uber recruiter she likes my car and my approach so she hands me a uber black bag with an iphone a car charger and a mount i asked her if this means i have to work exclusively for uber she says nope   my eyes then light up like some medieval lights in the sky chicken little for the ancient aliens approved phenomena when i realize i 'll have access to both customer bases just one week removed from not being able to pay my phone bill    after submitting a background check a driving record check and pretty much all the stuff lyft asked for i was driving for both uber and lyft a week after i was hired for lyft    the good news for you the consumer is that both companies are being cut throat because they want your money there 's never been a better time to hitch a ride on the cheap both companies have thrown millions of dollars over the past couple of months through social media   driver bonuses and other venues so you 're able to get a free ride or a deep discount off a long ride   if you have n't tried both services now 's the time do n't want to risk getting a dui just for driving down a couple of blocks to your favorite bar this weekend you 'll probably be able to get a free ride there if you gently for specials and pay between $ 7 13 for the trip back better than getting your car losing your license and paying $ 10,000 + in penalties and court fees eh you have no idea how many poor i take to and from work who ca n't drive because they just got a and who are now $ 25 35 per ride just to get to where they got ta go      insurance   as for insurance both companies have given me supplemental insurance i have full coverage on my car for when i 'm off the clock which was required at time of hiring btw so here 's how the insurance for lyft and uber works    for    when app is turned on on the way to pick up client contingent liability    1 up to $ 50k person bodily injury   1 up to $ 100k accident bodily injury   1 up to $ 25k accident property damage    when you pick up in the car and you 're on your way to the destination    excessive liability amp um   1 up to $   contingent collision amp comprehensive    1 up to $   $ 2500 deductible    for    when app is turned on on the way to pick up client contingent liability   1 up to $ 50k person bodily injury 1 up to $ 100k accident bodily injury 1 up to $ 25k accident property damage    when you pick up in the car and you 're on your way to the destination   excessive liability amp um   up to $   contingent collision amp comprehensive   up to $ $ 1000 deductible   other than the deductible as you can see both plans are pretty much the same which in my opinion should be more than enough    services amp expectations   both apps are easy to use and within 5 10 minutes sometimes much sooner there 've been many times where i get a call and the customer is on the sidewalk a few feet from where i was parked waiting for my next call both passengers and drivers adhere to a rating system as of today if either driver or passenger fail to maintain a rating of 4.6 and above they risk being booted from using the app so it 's important that drivers know what the hell they are doing like being courteous respectful professional clean and know how to use a gps while driving accurately and safely and/or knowing their routes and passengers should also be polite respectful very important since drivers are n't also do n't be so drunk that you either pass out or throw up in the back and make sure that if your bring your friends along for the ride that they adhere to the code of conduct expected of passengers i 've run into numerous instances where an otherwise perfect passenger gets dinged for their drunk and/or rude friends     also as a driver for your insurance to work do n't ever end a drive early because you made a wrong turn or were late for a pick up you 're risking an insurance hiccup in the event of an incident and passengers should also make sure that their driver has their app online throughout the entire trip as well as making sure the driver 's pic of him her and his her car match the profile you see on the app    as for safety i 've yet to hear from a passenger they felt they were ever in immediate danger did they get a creepy vibe from one of their drivers sure not everyone is a social butterfly and there has been an of ex cab drivers going over to uber which is good cause the service is getting pro drivers with experience but could prove detrimental since they 're gon na have a hard time competing with lyft on the charisma side of things    however i 've already numerous accounts from young women in hollywood who are now refusing to call for a yellow cab or taxis on hollywood blvd and sunset and the surrounding areas due to unwelcome sexual advances by drivers looking to take advantage of their sometimes solitary and drive home it 's and great to hear whenever you drop one of these young women off at their places and they thank you for being both professional courteous welcoming and above all else trustworthy all while paying a fraction of the cost of what a cab would normally run at that time of night    my personal experience in summary   i 'm literally having the time of my life my other job requires me to interact with humanity pick its brain and then express those experiences to everyone else in an positive and inspirational manner what better way to do it while earning some decent money than driving around for uber and lyft    these services are without a doubt revolutionary and are being used and employed by both young and old men and women struggling students and strategically utilized by incredibly wealthy and successful hollywood types and investment bankers it 's cheap reliable and very fun too it 's also bringing back the long lost art of human interaction and conversation back into our daily lives    so far so good and it breaks my heart whenever i hear misinformation and astroturfing about these services throughout the internet and i 'm supremely as to how certain municipalities are colluding with taxi cab lobbies to prevent uber and lyft and other ride share services from competing fairly at a time where cities are desperate to ease reduce dui 's and make sure their citizens are happy and are left with

if you do n't pull the money out of an ira or 401(k until you hit retirement age there are no tax consequences at all no matter how you invest or ignore it it wo n't affect your return same for a roth ira unless you move money out of the account before age 59 ½ it 's essentially invisible to the irs because some of a roth has already had taxes paid the rules are more complicated if you do pull out the money whereas the others are just a straight tax penalty with few exceptions

do not borrow to invest in real estate   the interest payments will eat up most of your profit the property management fees might eat up the rest and you will have significant risk with tenant issues property value etc   many people have made it work many also lose everything real estate can be a great investment but you ca n't even afford a house of your own yet let alone investment property   keep saving up until you have 20 down to buy a house of your own ideally that you can put on a 15 fixed mortgage and pay it off as quickly as you can   then you can start saving for your first rental property if that process is n't fast enough for you you have two options   increase your income or reduce your expenses   there 's no shortcut to wealth building without taking significant risks at most i would scale back the 401(k to the 5 match you get but you should scale that back up once you have enough for a down payment

why not ask a fee only financial adviser contact a local adviser and ask how much they will charge to work through the process   the options are n't as complex as they seem the general idea is to first figure out what you can afford each month this is a generally straight forward calculation   then figure out the costs that are specific to your area e.g property taxes   figure out how much of a down payment costs you can gather   then start with your local bank or credit union the number of options for mortgages will not be as complex if you already know how much you can afford and how much cash you can bring to the transaction a simple table can be easily created based on what you can afford each month how much cash you have and the rates currently available the bank will have a way to estimate the costs of each option as part of the required disclosures another source of good info can be a highly regarded local real estate agent focus on one that will represent you as a purchaser they want you to be able to buy a house while they do have a bias they want a commission most of it is eliminated if you know how much you can afford before you meet with them they will know all the government programs that can make the monthly costs or closing costs cheaper

you 're confusing between individual 401k they 're called and are intended for self employed and individual retirement account ira you ca n't open a without being self employed you can open an ira and roll over money from your old 401k to it you can not get a loan from ira you can ask the 401k plan manager to reissue the checks to the new trust should n't be a problem make sure the checks are issued to the trust not to you to avoid withholding and tax complications this is what is called a direct rollover you might be able to roll the money over to the 401k of your new employer it is not always allowed and you should check you can probably then take a loan from that 401k however it diminishes the value of your retirement savings and you should only do it if you have no other choice being evicted from your home your children are starving ca n't pay for your etc this kind of disasters otherwise i 'd suggest rolling over to ira investing in funds with significantly lower fees vanguard target retirements funds for example or index funds etf 's and your spending and budgeting habits so that you wo n't need loans from your 401k re companies etrade is nice consider also scottrade tdameritrade vanguard fidelity sharebuilder and may be others these are all discount brokers with relatively low fees but each has its own set of no fee funds

j approaching the answer from the w4 perspective for calculation purposes may be more trouble that it 's worth i 'd strongly suggest you use tax software whether it 's the 2016 sw or a current year one on line to get an estimate of your total tax bill for the year you can then look at your current run rate of tax paid in to see if you are on track if you have a large shortfall you can easily adjust your withholdings if you are on track to get a large refund make the adjustment so next year will track better note a withholding allowance is equal to a personal exemption some think that 4 means 4 people in the house but it actually means do n't tax 4 x $ 4050 as i have $ in combined people or tax deductions

manufacturers sometimes give incentives to car dealers to ensure that the prior year models are sold out before the year is up   however dealers are usually pretty smart on only ordering the cars they know they can sell before this happens   also manufacturers are usually pretty good about only producing enough vehicles to cover demand    honestly you are n't likely to see these incentives materialize unless the manufacturer really screwed up    if that happens then three things occur   first is that manufacturers give a hidden incentive to the dealers   dealers wo n't publicize this even internally   if the cars are still not moving after a month then the dealers will tell the salespeople that those cars have a specific bonus on them   if those cars still do n't sell then the bonus inflates quite a bit and dealers begin advertising that car at a deep discount on the radio   it 's pretty much guaranteed to sell at that point barring those circumstances the deal you get on a brand new car late in the model year is likely to be the same you could have gotten early in the model year    honestly if you want the best deal possible look at the date of the inspection sticker on the car   if it is close to the 3 month mark then the dealer will bend over backwards to sell the car as the finance costs are racking up on it   they 'll often sell that one at heavy discounts

in response to one of the comments you might be interested in owning the new home as a rental property for a year   you could flip this thinking and make the current home into a rental property for a period of time 1 year seems to be the consensus consult an accountant familiar with real estate this will potentially allow for a 1031 exchange into another property although i   believe that property ca n't then be a primary residence all potentially not worth the complication for the tax savings but figured i 'd throw it out there also the 1031 exchange defers taxes until some point in the future in which you finally sell the for cash

unless you are buying millions of dollars worth of a stock at a time your transaction is a drop in the bucket unlikely to have any effect on the stock price as ian says it 's more likely that you are just remembering the times when the price dropped after you bought if you keep careful track i suspect you will find that the price goes up more often than it goes down or at least that the stocks you buy go up as often as the average stock on the market goes up if you actually kept records and found that 's not true the most likely explanation is bad luck or that someone has placed a voodoo curse on you i suppose one could imagine other scenarios like if you regularly buy stock based on recommendations by well known market pundits you could expect to see a temporary increase in price as thousands or millions of people who hear this recommendation rush to buy and then a few days or weeks later people move on to the next recommendation the market down and the price reverts to a more normal level in that case if you 're on the tail end of the buying rush you could end up paying a premium i 'm just speculating here i have n't done a study to find if this actually happens but it sounds plausible to me

so here are some of the risks of renting a property plus the normal risk of losing your job health etc but those are going to be bad whether you had the rental or not so those are n't really a factor can you beat the average gain of the s&p 500 over 10 years   probably but there 's significant risk that something bad will happen that could cause the whole thing to come crashing down how many months can you go without the rental income before you ca n't pay all three mortgages is that a risk you 're willing to take for $ 5,000 per year or less    if the second home was paid for with cash and you could pay the first mortgage with your income then you 'd be in a much better situation to have a rental property   the fact that the property is significantly leveraged means that any unfortunate event could put you in a serious financial bind and makes me say that you should sell the rental get your first mortgage paid down as soon as possible and start saving cash to buy rental property if that 's what you want to invest in i think we could go at least 24 months with no rental income well that means that you have about $ 36k in an emergency fund which makes me a little more comfortable with a rental but that 's still a lot of debt spread across two houses    another way to think about it   if you just had your main house with a $ 600k mortgage and no heloc would you take out a $ heloc and buy the second house with a $ 200k mortgage

you mention only two debts mortgage and student loan but you mention $ 19 k in savings which suggests that you are a saver and likely do not have other debts you did not mention your net income and expenses income statement but since you have substantial savings you likely live within your means income > expenses   since you mention $ 38 k in retirement we might conclude you are regularly saving for retirement are you saving 10 toward retirement you did not mention any medical condition or other debts that might require a large savings so i would suggest having 6 months savings $ 2.5 k x 6 = $ 15 k but should your net expenses be less you might reduce this $ 2 k x 6 = $ 12 k you do not mention any investment you might want to make but since you did not mention any candidate investments we can assume you have no specific investments you find particularly attractive   you did not mention anything you were saving to purchase that you might want to purchase you have combined $ 19 k + $ 50 k = $ 69 k savings and $ 15 k would be a comfortable emergency savings leaving $ 54 k you could use to reduce mortgage or student loan debt the mortgage debt interest is higher so paying that debt off would be like earning 4.5 guaranteed return on your money tax free   at your income your marginal tax rate is low enough that the mortgage interest deduction if you do itemize would not reduce this return much 15 if you itemize the student loan debt interest would be like earning 2.8 guaranteed return on your money tax free clearly the higher return on your investment in paying off debt would be reducing your mortgage balance over 50 higher return on investment compared to the student loan debt you did not mention any circumstance that might cause the student loan rate to increase the mortgage rate to increase nor did you mention any difficulty making both the mortgage and student loan payments the amounts of either payment nor the number of years remaining to pay on either should you need or desire to reduce your payments you could choose to payoff the student loan to eliminate one payment and thus decrease your expenses   or you could choose to pay down the mortgage and refinance or the mortgage to obtain a smaller payment   another strategy assuming you have had your house for 5 7 years might be to pay the mortgage down enough to refinance into a 15 year loan and assuming you have a good credit score obtain a lower 3 rate but i am going to suggest you consider a blended approach   combine the dave ramsey debt snowball approach with the reduce the interest rate approach   take the $ 54 k $ 57 k available after reserving 6 months emergency fund and split between both   you pay your mortgage down by $ 27 k and your student loan debt down by $   your blended return on investment is 2.8 + = and you have the following balance sheet assets debts the next steps would be to there are two great reasons for paying off the student loan debt one is the dave ramsey debt snowball approach which is that this is the smaller debt and thus represents a psychological win and the other is that student loan debt has special treatment even in bankruptcy

i 've never invested in penny stocks my 1 investing rule buy what you know and use   people get burned because they hear about the next big thing go invest to just end up losing everything because they have no clue in what they 're investing in from what i 've found until you have minimum of $ 5k to invest put everything in a single investment the reason for this as others have mentioned is that commissions eat up just about all your profits   my opinion do n't put it in a bond returns are garbage right now however they are safe because this is $ 1000 we 're talking about and not your life savings put it in a equity like a stock to try and maximize your return i aim for 15 returns on stocks and can generally achieve 10 15 consistently the problem is when you get greedy and keep thinking it will go above once you 're at 10 15 sell it sell it right away if it drops down -15 you have to be willing to accept that risk the nice thing is that you can wait it out i try to put a 3 month time frame on things i buy to make money   once you start getting a more sizable chunk of money to play around with you should start to diversify in canada at least once you have a trading account with a decent size investment the commissions get reduced to like $ 10 a trade with your consistent 10 returns and additional savings you 'll start to build up your portfolio keep at it and best of luck

i agree that retail looks for orderly markets but orderly markets have really never existed really study market history and you 'll see that markets are more orderly today than they ever have been the stuff that used to take place was just insane and happened before computers let alone hft   let me state that while it may seem like i 'm defending hft my algos are actually much longer term and would n't be hurt by any of your proposals i think many of the hft guys are no better than those three card monte sharks who used to fill times square but they 're just playing the game they 're not good but they 're also not bad they 're just another segment of players in orderly markets up and down they really do add liquidity when things go awry as they tend to do in the markets the hfts step aside but do n't fool yourself market makers have always done the exact same thing and also remember that many markets do n't even have market makers traders provide all liquidity   here 's the thing retail investors to the markets when everything is going up and up they believe they can do no wrong and that prices will go up forever then the market gets a bit tougher retail investors and most pros by the way start to lose and then retail investors cry foul markets were never intended to be a nice safe playground for the masses they were designed for those who dedicate their lives to understanding them i do n't pretend that i can litigate a legal case operate on someone 's brain or build a bridge experts have studied those areas for decades and are quite good at those things but retail investors have always thought of wall street as some sort of safe las vegas in reality it 's survival of the   i 'll say to you what i say to every one of my friend 's who wants me to show them a few things about trading if you are n't going to really commit thousands of hours to understanding the markets then stay out invest money that you do n't need for some time in a few good mutual funds keep your debt to a minimum do n't chase quick profits if you do n't understand the game

regardless of how it exactly impacts the credit score the question is does it help improve your credit situation if the score does go up but it goes up slowly that was a lot of effort to retard credit score growth   learning to use a credit card wisely will help you become more financially mature start to use the card for a class of purchases groceries gas restaurants pick one that wo n't overwhelm your finances if you lose track of the exact amount you have been charging you can also use it to pay some utilities or other monthly expenses automatically as you use the card more often and you do n't overuse it the credit card company will generally raise your credit limit this will then help you because that will drop your utilization ratio just repeat the process by adding another class of charges to you credit card usage this expanded use of credit will in the long run help your score the online systems allow you to see every day what your balance is thus minimizing surprises

i wrote a little program one time to try to do this   i think i wrote it in python or something the idea was to have a list of projected expenses where each one would have things like the amount the date of the next transaction the frequency of the transaction and so on   the program would then simulate time determining when the next transaction would be updating balances and so on   you can actually do a very similar thing with a spreadsheet where you basically have a list of expenses that you manually paste in for each month in advance   simply keep a running balance of each row and make sure you do n't forget any transactions that should be happening this works great for fixed expenses or expenses that you know how much they are going to be for the next month   if you do n't know you can estimate for instance you can make an educated guess at how much your electric bill will be the next month if you have n't gotten the bill yet and you can estimate how much you will spend on fuel based on reviewing previous months and some idea of whether your usage will differ in the next month   for variable expenses i would always err on the side of a larger amount than i expected to spend   it is n't going to be possible to budget to the exact penny unless you lead a very simple life but the extra you allocate is important to cushion unexpected and unavoidable once you have this done for expenses against your bank account you can see what your low water mark is for the month or whatever time period you project out to   if this is above your minimum then you can see how much you can safely allocate to e.g. paying off debt   throwing a credit card into the mix can make things a bit more predictable in the current month especially for unpredictable amounts but it is a bit more complicated as now you have a second account that you have to track that has to get deducted from your first account when it becomes due in the following month   i am assuming a typical card where you have something like a 25 day grace period to pay without interest along with up to 30 days after the expense before the grace period starts depending on the relationship between your cut off date and when the actual expense occurs

first of all i recommend reading this short e book that is aimed at young investors the book is written for american investors but they same rules apply with different terms e.g. the equivalent tax free savings are called isas in the uk if you do n't anticipate needing the money any time soon then your best bet is likely a stocks and share isa in an aggressive portfolio of assets you are probably better off with an even more aggressive asset allocation than the one in the book e.g. 0 15 bond funds 85 100 equity funds in the long term this will generate the most income for an up to date table of brokers i recommend if you are planning to use the money as a deposit on a mortgage then your best bet might be a help to buy isa you 'll have to shop around for the best deals if you would rather have something more liquid that you can draw into to cover expenses while at school you can either go for a more conservative isa 100 bond funds or even a cash isa or try to find a savings account with a comparable interest rate

i agree   my biggest disagreement with the article is the stigma against the rebates offered by exchanges     these are offered for providing liquidity to the markets and are an added incentive to both market makers and institutional and now retail clients to post orders and provide liquidity for other participants to interact with   we have some market making strategies that make very little in gross p&amp;l i.e. capturing the spread but net p&amp;l is much higher due to the rebates we get for maintaining quotes and providing liquidity throughout the day especially in illiquid small cap names where spreads would be wide if they relied purely on retail institutional flow   i 'm surprised the author did n't talk about inverted exchanges bats y edge a where participants receive rebates for taking liquidity instead of providing it   those models essentially reward people who need immediate execution does he see a problem with those or should they be exempt

edit after reading one of the comments on the original question i realized that there is a much more intuitive way to think about this if you look at it as a standard pv calculation and hold each of the cashflows constant really what 's happening is that because of inflation the discount rate is n't the full value of the interest rate really the discount rate is only the portion of the interest rate above the inflation rate hence in the standard perpetuity pv equation pv = a r r becomes the interest rate less the inflation rate which gives you pv = a i g that seems like a much better way to get to the answer than all the machinations i was originally trying original answer i think i finally figured this out the general term for this type of system in which the payments increase over time is a gradient series annuity in this specific example since the payment is increasing by a percentage each period not a constant rate this would be considered a geometric gradient series according to this link the formula for the present value of a geometric gradient series of payments is where p is the present value of this series of cashflows    is the initial payment for period 1 i.e. the amount you want to withdraw adjusted for inflation    g is the gradient or growth rate of the periodic payment in this case this is the inflation rate    i is the interest rate    n is the number of payments this is almost exactly what i was looking for in my original question the only problem is this is for a fixed amount of time i.e. n periods in order to figure out the formula for a perpetuity we need to find the limit of the right side of this equation as the number of periods n approaches infinity luckily in this equation n is already well isolated to a single term 1 + + and since we know that the interest rate i has to be greater than the inflation rate g the limit of that factor is 0 so after replacing that term with 0 our equation simplifies to the following note i do n't do this stuff for a living and honestly do n't have a fantastic finance iq it 's been a while since i 've done any calculus or even this much algebra so i may have made an error in the math

i realize this is a dated question but for anyone interested in this subject please be aware of the availability of irc and capital gain treatment for the sale of patents   when the holder of a patent transfers all substantial rights to an unrelated person it can qualify for long term capital gain treatment   that can be a meaningful tax savings relative to ordinary income treatment there are a number of specific provisions and requirements to access   the holder must be the creator or someone unrelated and not the creator 's employer who purchased the patent from the creator   the holder must transfer all substantial rights to the patent not a licensing or sell an undivided portion of all substantial rights partial sale again not a license   the benefit of is that long term treatment will apply even for patents with holding periods under 1 year   other rules and permutations of course also apply   those who fail may still qualify their assets as capital under or   a patent held by its creator will often qualify as a capital asset it may not make any sense to sell your business as a whole particularly if all a purchaser wants is a patent or group of patents   of course if the patent was held by its creator in a single member llc or other disregarded entity sold to a buyer then the tax treatment is still treated as the sale of a long term capital asset

as mentioned in the other answer you ca n't invest all of your money in one slightly risky place and to receive a significant return on your investment you must take on a reasonable amount of risk and must manage that risk by diversifying your portfolio of investments unfortunately answers to this question will be somewhat opinion and experience based i have two suggestions however both involve risk which you will likely experience in any situation peer to peer lending in my own situation i 've placed a large sum of money into peer to peer lending sites such as lendingclub lendingclub specifically advertises that 98 of its user base that invests in 100 notes or more of relatively equal size receive positive returns and i 'm sure you 'll see similar statements in other similarly established vendors in this area historical averages in this industry can be between 5 7 you may be able to perform above or below this average   the returns on peer to peer lending investments are paid out fairly frequently as each loan you invest in on the site pays back into your account every time the recipient of the loan makes a payment   if you invest in small amounts fractions of several hundred loans you 're receiving several small payments throughout the month on various dates you can withdraw any money you have received back that has n't been invested or money you have in the account that has n't been invested at any time for personal spending however this involves various risks which have to be considered such as someone you 've loaned money to on the site defaulting rental property property itself i 'm also considering purchasing a very cheap home and renting it out to tenants for passive income this is something i would consider a possibility for you on this front you have the savings to do the same it would be possible for you to afford the 20 downpayment on a very low cost home say $ 100,000 or less up to $ 200,000 depending on your area but you 'd need to be able to pay for the monthly mortgage payment until you had a tenant and would need to be able to afford any on going maintenance however ideally you 'd factor that into the amount you charged tenants you could very likely get a mortgage for a place and have a tenant that pays you rent that exceeds the amount you pay for the mortgage and any maintenance costs earning you a profit and therefore passive income however rental properties involve risks in that you might have trouble finding tenants or keeping tenants or keeping the property in good shape and it 's possible the property value could decrease   one could also generalize that property is a somewhat safe investment in that property values tend to increase over time and while you may not significantly over run inflation 's increase you may be able to get more value out of the property by renting it out in the mean time additional note on credit you mention you have a credit card payment that you 're making to build credit i 'd like to place here for your reference that you do not need to carry a balance to build credit having active accounts and ensuring you do n't miss payments builds your history to be more specific your history is based off of many different aspects such as   i 'm sure i missed a couple of things on this front you should be able to find this information with some research wanted to make sure you were n't carrying a balance simply due to the common myth that you must do so to build credit summary the items mentioned above are suggestions but whatever you choose to invest in you should carefully spread out diversify your portfolio across a variety of different areas   it would not be advisable to stick to just one investment method say either of the two above and not also invest in stocks bonds or other types of investments as well   you can certainly decide what percentage of your portfolio you want to invest in different areas for instance x% of assets in stocks bonds y% in real estate etc but it does make the most sense to not have all of your eggs in one basket

i used to work for ally auto formerly known as and i 'd advise not to pay off the account unless you need to free up some debt in your credit report since until the account is paid off it will show that you owe your financial institution the original loan amount the reason why i am saying not to pay off the account is because good bad payments are sent to the credit bureau 30 days after the due date of the payment and if you want to increase your credit score then its best to pay it on a monthly basis the negative side to this is you will pay more interest by doing this   if ever you decide to leave $ 1.00 in loan i am pretty much sure that the financial institution will absorb the remaining balance and consider the account paid off   what exactly is your goal here do you plan to increase your credit score do you need to free up some debt

a credit card is basically a revolving loan in which you 're allowed to borrow up to a certain amount the limit and any time you borrow you pay interest   if you were to borrow $ 100 to pay for something via a credit card you 'd have a $ 100 balance on the card if you then pay $ 70 cash to the card there would be $ 30 remaining   that $ 30 balance could accrue interest the timing of that interest charge could vary the 20 you 've quoted is almost certainly apr of which the a stands for annual so that 20 would be an annual rate   it makes the most sense mind you to keep a minimal balance on a credit card as the interest rate is higher than most other loans

a company is basically divided into shit the company owns assets and shit the company owes to people liabilities so what about ownership ownership is called equity and on a simplistic level equity = asset liabilities but a better view of that should be asset = liabilities + equity which means a company 's assets   is separated into things owned by debtors e.g. banks and things owned by and you so when you are offered one percent you are basically owning one percent of the company    not the best explanation but should be a simplified one    here 's where the options come in when you are offered options that means you have the option of redeeming the shares at a lower price than market however these options are not usually immediately redeemable there 's usually a minimum amount of time you have to work at a company to be able to use these options this period is called the vesting period

most companies that have employee discounts have policies to prevent exactly this sometimes they will say that you can only use the company discount for products that you intend to use yourself they 'll specifically ban buying things for friends of course enforcing such a rule can be difficult but a car is a big enough purchase that if they have such a rule they 're likely to pay attention other times they try to discourage letting friends use your discount by having rules that make it awkward like i used to work for a furniture company that said you had to pick up the furniture personally at the office where you worked so if you wanted to buy a for your brother who lived in another state you 'd have to pay to ship it and probably wipe out most of the savings from the employee discount my daughter 's employer says you have to show your employee id when you make the purchase and then they deduct it from your next paycheck so you 'd have to get your friend to pay you back maybe loan them your id if they want to pick it out which would get awkward etc assuming the company does n't care if you buy with an employee discount and re sell or their rules are lax enough that you can get away with it i 'm not aware of any law that would stop you in general there are n't any laws against you re selling things you 've bought people have garage sales and sell used cars and the like all the time there are specific exceptions like you ca n't re sell prescription drugs

all other things being equal if you have two stocks both with a p e    of 2 and one has an eps of 5 whereas the other has an eps of 10 is    the latter a better purchase what this really boils down to is the number of shares a company has outstanding   given the same earnings p e a company with fewer shares will have a higher eps than a company with more shares   knowing that i do n't think the number of shares has much if anything to do with the quality of a company    it 's similar to the arguments i hear often from people new to investing where they think that a company with a share price of $ 100/share must be better than a company with a share price of $ 30/share simply because the share price is higher

for the first four months of the year when you were an employee the health insurance premiums were paid for with pre tax money   when you receive your w-2 at the end of the year the amount in box 1 of the w-2 will be reduced by the amount you paid for health insurance   you ca n't deduct it on your tax return because it has already been deducted for you now that you are a 1099 independent contractor you are self employed and eligible for the self employed health insurance deduction   however as you noted the cobra premiums are likely not eligible for this deduction because the policy is in your old employer 's name   see this question for details but keep in mind that there are conflicting answers on that question

this sounds a lot like an equity indexed annuity   they date from about 1996 there is a bit of skepticism about them as they are tricky to understand for the typical investor   for instance an equity indexed annuity pays a portion of the gain in an index like s&p 500 when the stock market rises and guarantees you wo n't lose if it falls   in an arbitrage sense it is roughly equivalent to buying a mixture of bonds and index call options there are a lot of complicated tweaks on these such as annual ratchet annual reset interest caps etc there is quite a bit of debate about whether they are too good to be true so i 'd read a few articles with pros and cons before buying one these are also commonly called fixed indexed annuities

from what i understand i never had an resp but would consider one for a future child with the right type of withdrawal you can use the resp money for anything education related basically know that the resp is considered to have three within it 1 your contributions 2 contributions from the government through the canada education savings grant cesg and 3 the return on the investment or accumulated earnings the government contributes an extra 20 on top of your contributions annually by way of the cesg up to a $ 500 max tuition as you noted official tuition fees reported on a fee slip is where one large chunk of the resp will go this will be pulled out of your original contributions and is known as a post secondary education withdrawal different resp administrators bank discount brokerage etc determine what sort of proof of would be required but it ought to be similar between them and different educational institutions this withdrawal is not taxable by either you or the student since the contributions were made with after tax dollars educational assistance payments are for other expenses that the student would incur by being at university in the first 13 weeks of studies you can request up to $ 5000 in withdrawals full time studies $ 2500 for par time after which there is no limit each payment is made up of the cesg and accumulated earnings portions of the resp whose proportions are determined based on the amount this is considered taxable income for the student or beneficiary in the year the withdrawal is made it gets a bit fuzzy here from my understanding the student would ostensibly be able to purchase anything that they could rationalize as education related and i 'm not sure what sort of proof different banks would need maybe just the confirmation of is enough this is the part of my post that should directly answer your question which using this terminology boils down to what sorts of expenses can i use the withdrawals for to this from what i 've read out there i would say that you could probably purchase anything from the student 's point of view they are enrolled in a qualifying education institution and if they do n't spend the money on education related purchases money required for those purchases will have to come from somewhere else anyway   other withdrawals any other type of withdrawal is like walking through a you can withdraw the original contributions without paying tax on them but you would need to pay back the corresponding cesg back to the government other types of withdrawals would be taxable and may incur a 20 penalty i do n't have any more details on that as i mentioned this is from what i 've read and looked into for future resp purposes a new concept that has popped up is resp vs tfsa the tfsa provides the same tax shelter after tax dollar contributions no tax on the gains but also allows for no tax on the withdrawals to add to that the tfsa withdrawals are tax free as well the main benefit that the resp offers that the tfsa does n't is the cesg my current opinion and i could be wrong is that you should contribute $ 2500 annually to the resp in order to get the $ 500 max cesg and anything else that you 'd like to contribute should go in a tfsa but i digress hopefully my long winded response makes some sense enjoy

funds especially index funds are a safe way for beginning investors to get a diversified investment across a lot of the stock market they are not the perfect investment but they are better than the majority of mutual funds and you do not spend a lot of money in fees compared to the alternative buying individual stocks based on what a friend tells you or buying a hot mutual fund it 's a great choice for a lot of people if you are willing to do some study you can do better quite a bit better with common stocks as an individual investor you have some structural advantages you can take significant to you positions in small cap companies while this is not practical for large institutional investors or mutual fund managers   however you can also lose a lot of money quickly in individual stocks it pays to go slow and to your homework however and make sure that you are investing not speculating i like as a good place to start and subscribe to a couple of their newsletters i will note that investing is not for the faint of heart to do well you may need to do the opposite of what everybody else is doing buying when the market is down and selling when the market is high a few people mentioned the efficient market hypothesis there is ample evidence that the market is not efficient the existence of the .com and mortgage bubbles makes it pretty obvious that the market is often not rationally valued and a couple of hedge funds profited in the billions from this

the days are long gone when offered mortgages were simply based on salary multiples these days it 's all about affordability taking into account all incomes and all outgoings different lenders will have different rules about what they do and do n't accept as incomes these rules may even vary per product within the same lender 's product list   so for example a mortgage specifically offered as buy to let might accept rental income with a suitable void period multiplier into consideration but an owner mortgage product might not similarly business rules will vary about acceptance of regular overtime bonuses and so on guessing at specific answers 1 maybe if it 's a buy to let product note that these generally carry a higher interest rate than owner mortgages expect about 2 more 2 in my opinion it 's extremely unlikely that any lender would consider rental income from your spouse 3 probably yes if it 's a buy to let product

there 's nothing much you can do here and i do n't think you 'll succeed in placing blame on the lawyers in order for ssa to have the tax withheld from your benefits you need to submit form here are the details on how to get it and what to do with it this form is voluntarily submitted i.e. no one will ask for it you have to actively send it out on your own as to repayment of the ltd benefits since they were not taxable there 's no change in the taxable income on your behalf what you got was n't taxed so what you gave back does n't provide any tax benefit as to why ssa benefits are taxable and ltd benefits are not this is because ssa is pre tax and ltd premiums were in your case apparently post tax however the ltd benefits management company does n't care or may be even know about this and they do everything they can to reduce their own liability to you if you 're entitled to ssa benefits it reduces their liability that 's why they insisted on your claim with ssa as to the ssa dragging their feet they want to reduce their taxpayers essentially liability as well however once they decided in your favor you received what was rightfully yours including back pay ssa benefits are taxable in the year received so you got a lump sum taxable as a lump sum sorry but that 's the way it is this is an example where post tax ltd premiums do n't actually pay off

this is a complicated question that relies on the us india tax treaty to determine whether the income is taxable to the us or to india   the relevant provision is likely article 15 on personal services it seems plausible that your business is personal services but that 's a fact driven question based on your business model   if the online training is personal services provided by you from india then it is likely foreign source income under the treaty   the fixed base and 90 days provisions in article 15 would not apply to an india resident working solely outside the us the question is whether your us llc was a us taxpayer   if the llc was a taxpayer then it has an obligation to pay us tax on any worldwide income and it also arguably you from article 15 which applies to individuals and firms of individuals but not companies   if you were the sole owner of the us llc and you did not make a form election to be treated as subject to entity taxation then the llc was a disregarded entity   if you had other owners and did not make an election then you are a partnership and i suspect but can not conclude that the treaty analysis is still valid so this is fact dependent but you may be exempt from us tax under the tax treaty   however you may have still had an obligation to file forms 1099 for your worker   you can also late file forms 1099 reporting the compensation paid to your worker   note that this may have tax consequences on the worker if the worker failed to report the income in those years

definitely do n't borrow from your 401k.   if you quit or get laid off you have to repay the whole amount back immediately plus you are borrowing from your opportunity cost   the stock market should be good at least through the end of this year    as one of the commentators already stated have you calculated your net savings by reducing the interest rate   you will be paying closing costs and not all of these are deductible only the points are   when calculating the savings you have to ask yourself how long you will be hanging on the property   are you likely to be long term landlords or do you have any ideas on selling in the near future    you can reduce the cost and principal by throwing the equivalent of one to two extra mortgage payments a year to get the repayment period down significantly by years   in this way you are not married to a higher payment as you would be if you refinanced to a 15 year term    i would tend to go with a eat the appraisal cost not refinance and b throw extra money towards principal to get the term of the loan to be reduced

yes you can do this yourself   i can not speak for all the credit repair companies but generally they are not reputable   even if they are trustworthy they can not do anything you can not do yourself freeze your credit   lock it down and prevent any new activity   this is for safety and i want you to do it so you know where you stand get a copy of your free copies of the three credit reports from this is the only free official place to get your reports sign up for a free credit score estimation site like http://www creditkarma.com or http://www   these sites make money by selling affiliate offers but you can easily ignore them   you ca n't get your exact fico score but they letter grades they provide help you understand where you stand dispute anything that is not accurate   get wrong items corrected with the credit agency ignore collectors who are not showing up on your report   if they are n't reporting you so what   let your own moral compass be your guide if you pay those debts or not negotiate a payment amount with the debtors you owe   if you are dealing with a debt collector there is n't any point in paying the full amount   you owed the money to somebody else and they sold it to the debt collector therefore in my mind they are as whole as they feel like being   it is up to you how much you pay but you are already going to suffer   and have suffered the credit ramifications   no sense in wasting money when they will very likely settle for dimes on the dollar   do n't let them bully you around   i suggest understand your rights and protections as offered by the fair debt collection practices act before you pay anybody anything get it in writing wait and follow up   make sure they report it correctly i would probably tackle them in order of age newest first    do n't bother with debts that are more than or nearly seven years old   anything that old is or will fall off of the credit report soon and your score will start to rise   paying on those debts will refresh them and they will harm you longer   we can debate the ethics of that advice in the comments but if you want your score to raise i suggest just waiting about anything over six years old while you tackle the newer ones this is a slow process   your credit score will still take a couple years to heal once you fix your report   but that is the point of the score after all   it is a history of how you handle money and debt

keeping your big emergency fund in stocks if you have 12 months income saved is ok    however you should keep your small emergency fund in cash    however i find that even my stock broker accounts have some cash in them as i like to let the dividends build up enough to make the dealing charges worthwhile   you do n’t wish to be forced to sell at a bad time due to your boiler needing replacing or your car breaking down      however if you lost your job in the same week that your boiler broke down and your car needed replacing then being forced to sell stocks at a bad time is not much of an issue also if you are saving say 1/3 of your income each month and you have a credit card with large unused credit limit that is paid of each month then most small emergency that are under 2/3 of your monthly income can be covered on the credit card with little or no interest charges one option is to check you bank balance on the day after you are paid and if it is more than 2x your monthly income then move some of it to long term savings but only if you tend to spend a lot less then you earn most months

gt using debt to increase your intrinsic value is a wise investment   do you believe this kind of belief the problem if you look at the data roughly 20 of college graduates will do really well for themselves which is difficult to ignore but when you look at the remaining 80 of graduates the income distributions start to look a lot like those who have less education   you being a financial advisor i 'm sure you are aware that the early years are the utmost important ones for saving the prevailing idea has been that a degree will earn you more than the other opportunity costs over the remainder of your career but that is based on the aforementioned top 20 who really serve to skew the data to the casual calculator   with that the typical highly education person ends up getting hit with no only massive debt but loses a ton of early earning potential and often can not convert that education into a higher income than anyone else it comes as no surprise to me that this group has the biggest debt problems

perhaps where we are losing touch is in how income inequality is being measured what i 'm saying is how much more wealthy the top 10 is than the bottom 10 in real numbers not by ratio the united states and other modern democracies with free markets absolutely these smaller less free nations although places like south africa and have gigantic inequality by ratio that primarily because the poor are so poor in those nations   for instance if one man makes $ 100 a year and another makes $ 100,000 the difference is $ in real numbers but 1000 times as much however if a man makes $ 10,000 a year where another makes $ 1,000,000 it is only 100 times as much but the real number difference is $ although by ratio the poorer nation has greater income inequality the wealthier nation has a far greater real gap between the upper and lower class measuring income inequalities both ways has it 's purpose but to judge by only the ratio often gives false impressions often the false impressions given are intentional as in the case of the un which has a markedly anti capitalism lean in its bureaucratic membership   try my original statement with how i am measuring income inequality in mind

what you aim to do is a great idea and it will work in your favor for a number of reasons first paying down your loan early will save you lots in interest no brainer second keeping the account open will improve your credit score by 1 increases the number of installment trade lines you have open to your positive payment history and 3 varies your credit mix if your paid your car off you will see a drop in your credit score because now you have one less trade line to address other issues as far as credit scoring it does not for your score if you have a $ 1000 car loan or a $ 100,000 car loan what matters is whether or not you pay on time and what your balance is compared to the original loan amount so the quicker you pay down the loans or mortgages the better pay them down not off as far how the extra payments will report one of two things will happen either they will report every month paid as agreed most likely or they wo nt report anything for a few years until your next payment is this wo nt hurt you but wo nt help you either someone posted they would lower the amount you paid every month on your report and thus lower your score this is not true even if they reported you paid $ month the scoring calculations do not care all they care is whether or not you 're on time and in your case you would be months ahead of though your report ca nt reflect this fact either however if you are applying for a mortgage the lower monthly payment would affect you in the sense that now you qualify for a bigger loan because now your debt to income ratio has improved people will argue to just pay it off and be debt free however being debt free does not help your credit and being that you own a home and a car you see the benefits of good credit you can have a million dollars in the bank but you will be denied a loan if you have no or bad credit   nothing wrong with living on cash i 've done it for years but good luck trying to rent a car or getting the best insurance rates and anything in life with poor credit yeah it sucks but you have to play the game i would not pay down do $ 1 though because like someone else said they may just close the account pay it down to 10 or 20 percent and you will see the most impact on your credit and invest the rest of your cash elsewhere

intellectually and logically it should n't bother me for a second to charge something for a buck   it 's a losing proposition for the merchant but their immediate business costs should be of little concern to me   they 're making a choice to sell that item to me at that price and by accepting that means of payment right   but the more i charge as opposed to paying cash the more cash back i get in my old ish age i 've gotten a little and will pay cash more often for smaller amounts because i understand the business costs but it 's not a matter of caring what other people think accepting credit cards or not is a business decision   it 's usually a good one   but with that decision come the rules which up until about a year ago meant that merchants could n't set a minimum charge amount   now that 's not the case merchant account providers can no longer demand that their merchant clients accept all charges though they are allowed to set a minimum amount that is no lower than $ 10.00 in the end it 's a matter of how much you 're willing to pay in order to influence people 's thinking of you because the business financial benefits of doing one or the other are pretty clear

yes this will reduce your total interest but not by much scenario 1 you run up bills for the month totaling $ 750 and then at the end of the month you get paid and pay $ 750 scenario 2 you pay $ 750 at the beginning of the month then over the course of the month you run up bills totaling $ 750 assume you have carryover debt of over $ 750 so you do n't have a credit balance at any point either way the net change in your balance for the month is zero assuming you spent about the same amount of money each day the difference in your average daily balance will be $ 750 if you 're paying 18 i think that 's a fairly typical credit card rate that 's 1 1/2 per month so the difference in interest will be about $ 10 note this is the most extreme case the difference between paying on the first day of the billing period and paying on the last day of the billing period and assuming that you pay all your bills by credit card so in real life the difference in the interest will probably be less you 're talking about a technique to save maybe five bucks a month i suppose every dollar helps but the real solution is to get your credit cards paid off so you 're not paying any interest

historically most economists considered a sustained negative interest rate impossible for just the reason you describe an investor could outperform a bond with a negative interest rate by simply hoarding cash for background see wikipedia by central banks in the wake of the 2007 financial crisis however demonstrates that slightly negative interest rates are possible first of all note that the zero lower bound on interest rates has everything to do with the existence of cash as an alternative it 's a lower bound on the nominal interest rate rather than the real interest rate that is on the rate before adjusting for inflation in most situations the real interest rate is more economically meaningful as it 's the real interest rate that measures the market 's preference for stuff now as opposed to stuff later there 's nothing in principle or in practice to stop a negative real interest rate there are always some people who want stuff now and some people who want stuff later a negative real interest rate just means that people who want stuff later are more dominant in the market as i stated earlier what creates the zero lower bound is the existence of cash as an alternative to bonds even though that lower bound applies it 's not strict hoarding cash in large quantities can be difficult and expensive especially when central banks are doing their best to prevent you from doing it consequently investors who strongly prefer stuff later to stuff now are willing to pay a slightly negative nominal interest rate on bonds in order to avoid those costs if it were significantly negative however you 're right that no sane investor would buy such a bond

in my opinion you should pay off the student loans as soon as possible before you start saving for the house downpayment $ is a big number but you have a great salary   nice   up until now you have been a poor college student accustomed to a relatively low standard of living   your $ 800 per month plan would have you pay off the loan in 3 years but i would challenge you to pay off this entire student loan in 1 year or less   a monthly loan payment of $ will pay off your loan in 12 months after that is done if you take the same amount you had been paying toward your student loans and save it for your condo in less than two years you 'll have a 10 down payment saved $ 50k   the whole thing will take less than three years there are three reasons why i recommend paying off the loan first before saving for the condo one is practical and two are philosophical practical you will save money on interest   paying off the loan in 1 year vs. 3 years will save you $   you wo n't find a short term safe investment that will beat 5 in interest philosophical the loan is something current and concrete that you can focus on   your condo is a dream at this point and there is lots of time to change your mind   if the $ per month amount is at all a sacrifice for you then in a few months you might be tempted to say to yourself this month i really want a vacation so i 'll just skip this month of saving   for the loan however if you establish a concrete goal of 12 months to pay off the loan it will hopefully help motivate you to allocate this money and stick to your plan philosophical getting used to borrowing money making payments to a bank and paying interest is not a great way to live   it is better in my opinion to eliminate your debt as fast as possible and start getting accustomed to saving cash for what you want   clean up your debt and resolve not to borrow any more money except for a reasonably sized mortgage on your home

the rent versus buy question is a deeply personal one in which your personal desires for a living space need to be carefully combined with what makes economic sense   do you want your own place with all the of having it be yours and all the pains of having to handle all the maintenance and be the one ultimately responsible   have you tried living for a few months putting aside the amount required for not only a mortgage payment but the taxes and insurance on a house condo in your price range to see if you can really afford it   you can use a real estate website such as to see the assessments of some for sale homes and figure out tax values   the average home insurance in the us is around $ if i remember right more for homes that are more expensive and less for less expensive ones with flooding and other hazards as a factor   make sure you can afford to pay for all these items from a financial perspective realize that you 'll always be spending money on your living space   even if you pay for a house with cash you will be paying property tax and maintenance and would be wise to continue paying for insurance   the value of the house at that point is as contributor fennec often says the rent you are n't paying i personally do n't recommend trying to time the market   you ca n't predict the future will real estate in your area be a double dip or has it bottomed and is it going up   what you can do is buy a home only when you are sure that you can deal with its relative lack of liquidity by staying there for a long time   five years is usually a reasonable minimum    there is a way that i recommend figuring out if it is likely bad financial decision to buy and that 's by looking at a financial comparison of renting versus buying   in some cases even with the bursting of the bubble it is still a bad deal to buy   dc went from renting being more cost effective to buying but san francisco is one area where buying is still not necessarily the best choice   to figure out what the case is for your area look at the new york times rent versus buy calculator   find a home for rent on craigslist similar to what you 'd look to buy   find a home for sale on one of the mls aggregator sites that represents something you think you 'd like   plug in the numbers   figure out how many years you 'd have to stay in your purchase for it to be a good deal in the likely event that the calculator says buy start saving if that 's what you really want   you 're never going to be able to absolutely guarantee that you wo n't be upside down   what you can control is getting as much principal in that house as you can   the more you have the less likely you will be upside down   build a down payment now reap the rewards later

i do n't think you can compare savings accounts and peer to peer lending the former is a liquid way of stashing some money away iow you can get at it pretty much any time you want whereas the latter is extremely illiquid you only get your money back if and when the loan has been repaid also as mentioned by the other posters there is a risk attached to p2p lending even if the borrowers are vetted by the p2p lending platform you 're essentially taking the same risks that a bank would take when writing a couple of personal loans and that 's quite far removed from a safe haven for your cash if you have enough money to invest not save invest then it might be worth putting a small amount into p2p lending but it 's anything but an alternative to a savings account

your questions in the world of technical analysis is candlestick charting an effective trading tool in timing the markets it depends on how you define effective but as a standalone and systematic strategy it tends not to be profitable see for example market timing with candlestick technical analysis using robust statistical techniques we find that candlestick trading rules are not profitable when applied to djia component stocks over period neither bullish or bearish candlestick single lines or patterns provide market timing signals that are any better than what would be expected by chance basing ones trading decisions solely on these techniques does not seem sensible but we can not rule out the possibility that they compliment some other market timing techniques there are many other papers that come to the same conclusion if used correctly how accurate can they be in picking turning points in the market technical analysts generally fall into two camps i those that argue that ta ca n't be fully automated and that interpretation is part of the game ii those that use ta as part of a systematic investment model automatically executed by a machine but generally use a combination of indicators to build a working model both groups would argue for different reasons that the conclusions of the paper i quoted above should be disregarded and that ta can be applied profitably with the proper framework psychological biases it is very easy to get impressed by technical analysis because we all suffer from confirmation bias whereby we tend to acknowledge things that confirm our beliefs more than those that contradict them when looking at a chart it is very easy to see all the when a certain pattern worked and miss the when it did not work and not missing those is much harder than it sounds conclusions

note i am in the uk i do n't know specifically about australia but i expect the general principles will be much the same everywhere what banks want is to be confident that you have a steady income stream that will continue to pay the until it completes   in general employed are fairly easy to assess most employed people will have a steady basic pay that increases through their career will usually seperate out basic pay overtime and bonuses there is little to cook the books the self employed are harder to assess income can be and there are far more for cooking the books to make it look like you are earning more than you really are so banks are likely to be far more careful about lending to the self employed they will likely want to see multiple years of buisness records so that any bursts whether natural due to the and flows of buisness or created to cook the books average out and they can see the overall pattern a large deposit will help because it reduces the risk to the bank in the event of a default similarly not being anywhere near your limit of affordability will help

i could be wrong but i doubt you 're going to be able to roll the current mortgage into a new one the problem is that the bank is going to require that the new loan is fully collateralized by the new house   so the only way that you can ensure that is if you can construct the house cheaply enough that the difference between the construction cost and the end market value is enough to cover the current loan and keep the loan to value ltv low enough that the bank is secured so say you currently owe $ 40k on your mortgage and you want to build a house that will be worth $ 200k in order to avoid pmi you 're going to have to have an ltv of 80 or less which means that you can spend no more than $ 160k to build the house   if you want to roll the existing loan in now you have to build for less than $ 120k and there 's no way that you can build a $ 200k house for $ 120k unless you live in an area with very high land value and hire the builders directly and even then it may not be possible otherwise you 're going to have to make up the difference in cash when you tear down a house you are essentially throwing away the value of the house when you have a mortgage on the house you throw away that value plus you still owe the money which is a difficult hole to climb out of a better solution might be to try and sell the house as is perhaps to someone else who can tear down the house and rebuild with cash if that is not a viable option or you do n't want to move then you might consider a home equity loan to renovate parts of the house provided that they increase the market value enough to justify the cost e.g. modernize the kitchen add on a room remodel bathrooms etc so it all depends on what the house is worth today as is how much it will cost you to rebuild and what the value of the new house will be

this comment might sound like a circle jerk but i think it 's important to say indeed innovation is what creates more productivity which is fueled by debt but debt is fueled by real savings which comes from under consuming which is easier when your productivity is higher the government can stimulate innovation yes but only at the expense of someone else    what 's really scary is the federal reserve has been manufacturing all the savings for nearly a decade now so there 's a complete mismatch between credit and savings and the overall economy the actual price of money itself is manufactured too so just about all asset prices are inherently flawed in my view    i think it 's important to piggy back your point about innovation and how productivity ca n't really go down because inventions and new methods of producing goods do n't we come up with the engine or a new drug for example it 's now here forever ideally it 's work that we do n't have to do all over again   what brings on a crash or feeling like we 're going backwards in terms of progress comes when we somehow manage to go through a boom bust like in 2008 but then take on all this debt normally we can pay off debt but when the government manufactures it and credit is created out of nothing that 's when you get into problems like not being able to pay it back because it was n't truly real or representative of real savings i feel like i 'm ranting now but i think this stuff is super important and i think you understand it

gift taxes kick in at around $ 13 k per giver per recipient per year that means that a straight up gift of $ 200 k as cash or a house will incur a tax it is possible however that if the father has a spouse he and the spouse could each give the mother and each child the full gift limit for a total of about $ 78 k per year and that money could be used by all 3 of them to buy the house jointly over a couple of years i think the children would have to be on the title since part of the gift money would be theirs and one is an adult as far as lending the money my in laws are our mortgage lenders and when we structured the loan it had to be at a market rate which could be the lowest advertised rate we found for a fixed rate mortgage independent of what we might actually qualify for or we could not deduct interest payments forgiving the loan could also be considered a gift so they would need to keep an audit trail showing that payments were made and her father would need to declare the interest income on his taxes if he bought the house as a second home and let her and her children live there rent free it might work but i 'm not sure it would in that case be an asset of his estate when he dies i do n't know anything about structuring it as a trust free rent could conceivably also be construed as a gift subject to the limits stated above disclaimer not a tax professional

in the united states if the person insures an article and then claims a loss of that article the insurance replaces the missing destroyed article if later on the item is found the original is owned by the insurance company the person who purchased the policy does n't get to keep both   of course if the item was so valuable to be priceless the insurance company would be open to an exchange of items or money   but if they suspect fraud then it becomes a legal matter even when a life is n't involved it can be a source of dispute insured v. insurer when stolen art is recovered who owns it kenneth s. levine   this essay is about the word which frequently appears    in insurance policies an insured painting is stolen and the insurance    company pays the owner ’s claim for the value of the painting many    years later when the painting is recovered its value is many times    what it was when the insurance claim was paid the insurance company    takes the position that it owns the painting while the owner says i    own the painting less the value of the insurance proceeds received    the resolution of this dispute depends on the meaning of the word    in the insurance policy when life insurance is involved the item being replace is the lost stream of income the question of returning money and how much would be a legal issue they would also want to know if there was fraud and who was involved

my schwab panel has the following options as an example when i go in to wire transfer it prompts me to select which schwab account then domestic or international wire then amount etc   this will likely depend on the brokerage i do n't think scottrade or tradeking was this integrated personally i keep brokerage funds pretty well segregated from the remainder of my finances   i transfer money in and out from a more used checking account to keep the accounting more simple

if you are investing via whoever you want wherever you want and you 're a us tax resident you will be taxed as with all the other questions clearly your transfer of funds to your parents is not a real gift and as such you will be keeping interest in the amounts income will be attributed to you and taxes will also be charged to you having the money lie in your parents accounts does n't make the money or the income any less yours

typical wire transfers are not with 4 5 but it all depends on the bank that does the transfer you can chose to send wire the money in source currency or in us $ the former the target bank in the us does the conversion so pick one that adds no or little spread the latter the sending bank does the conversion so ask about their fees spreads i have multiple times transferred money across the ocean though not from japan and never paid more than 0.3 + ~40 $ flat it should be possible to get te same range note that if you look around for current offers you might be easily able to even make some money on it some us banks are eager for new money and offer bonus if you open an account and bring significant = new money to them

gt why are you against making sure their pensions are funded   pension actuarial analyst here   pensions can give employee 's benefits for time worked long before the plan came into existence   those liabilities are paid off over 30 40 years   it 's absolutely normal   in addition pension plans may also pay off increases in benefits such as an early retirement window over that same 30 40 years   pension funds use assumptions on future investment earnings to guess their contribution   sometimes they do n't earn as much as they expect the plan to earn   sometimes they try to keep contributions low as an alternative to the plan   so putting this all together   if pension plans are instantly and always 100 funded   you do n't get pension plans with defined and guaranteed retirement benefits   you get plans where the employee defers their own money into accounts with no particular guarantees at all   and that 's why we are fine with unfunded pensions   oh by the way the pbgc charges higher fees to covered pension plans that have more unfunded liability   so if a company does n't want to pay contributions they have to pay more elsewhere   it all out

my background is in banking specifically dealing with these scenarios take my advice look for a balance transfer offer credit card at 0 your cost of capital is your good credit this is your leverage why pay when you can pay 0 find a credit card company with a balance transfer option for 0 pay no interest and own the car outright places to start check the mail or check your bank or check local credit unions some credit unions are very relaxed for membership and ask if they have zero percent balance transfers good luck

these executives are usually well aware because they 've seen the surveys and other data they say this bullshit to calm the herd internally until an actual plan is put in place     it 's more for the employees than the consumers a mass exodus of staff would cripple them before than they can adapt

that would be great if there were an objective and impartial standard for worth to society but there is n't and so the price system if by coercion works beautifully you do n't have to decide if he 's contributing to society you just decide if you want to buy his good at his price if you think he 's charging too much then do n't   of course crony capitalism subsidies and lobbyist directed government coercion kind of mess up the entire price system

is my math correct the math is correct however dividends do n't work this way the yield is post facto i.e. given the dividend that is declared every quarter once calculates the yield the dividends are not fixed or guaranteed these change from quarter to quarter or at times they are not given at all the yield is and the value is $ 114 per share assuming that the price remains exactly the same for an entire year and that i purchase only one share then this should be the math for calculating the yield 114 x = what the link is showing is that last dividend of mcd was for q3 that means total for a year will be 4 this means yield will be note this year there were only 3 dividend was on on and on it is unlikely that there will be one more dividend this year so for this year the correct post facto calculation would be + = and hence an yield of   also are there any fees deductions or would i receive the amount in full which should be $ 3.75 there are no fee deducted not sure about us tax treatment on dividends

overall i think it sounds like it 's worth it it 's hard to find that high of a rate on a checking account these days   it looks like you 're looking at this bank and i can see they have a few more requirements that seem a little tedious if you do n't do these things every month then you lose the great interest rate if you can think of an easy way to jump through these hoops and not forget then it 's probably worth it for example if you routinely eat out for lunch or buy a morning coffee you can use that card to pay for it set yourself a recurring reminder in your calendar or smartphone to remind you to login to the online banking site ultimately since this is an emergency fund it 's a good idea to keep it nice and liquid in a checking account you 're not likely going to find many other options that will give you a better and safe return and still keep your funds available for when you need them in summary it sounds like a good idea to me so long as you think you can reliably jump through their hoops
