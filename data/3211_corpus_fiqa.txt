it depends on the seller   if the seller wants they can collect the information from you and send it to the payment gateway   in that case they of course have everything that you provide at some point   they are not supposed to keep the security code and there are rules about keeping the credit card number safe    the first four digits of the credit card number often indicate the bank although smaller banks may share   but for example a capital one card would indicate the bank    other sellers work through a payment gateway that collects the information   even there the seller may collect most of the information first and send it to the gateway   in particular the seller may collect name email phone and address information   and in general the gateway will reveal that kind of information   they will not give the seller credit card info other than the name on the card expiration date and possible last four digits   they may report if the address matches the card 's billing address addresses may mean fraud    buying through someone like paypal can provide the least information   for a digital good paypal can only expose the buyer 's name which may be a business name and email associated with the payment account   however paypal still has the other information and may expose it under legal action e.g. if the credit card transaction is reversed or the good sold is illegal   and even paypal will expose the shipping address for physical goods that require shipping

perhaps in a sense it is useless but likewise the number of people that work for them is irrelevant here as well   what matters is the portion of gdp generated across company size and the means by which some of that is recaptured by the people to a repay for the investment in the economic infrastructure that allowed the companies to make that money in the first place and b invest in future infrastructure that is of benefit to companies ultimately all of which is done for the purposes of betterment of the people of the country   the relevance then is what portion of the gdp is generated by which while size category of business if we just take large versus small and medium enterprise sme with the boundary being 500 employees or fewer and we excluding farming which the stats seem to universally do u.s. gdp is generated by non farm compared to in canada they also appear to employ more than 50 of all private workers   of additional importance is the dynamic effect that is if large companies can grow faster because of lower effective taxation that means will tend to fall further and further behind not out of a fair and open marketplace but because of unfair taxation   generally speaking the reverse is preferred because diversity of competition brings huge value for innovation the same as in crop breeding techniques as well as the poor economic performance of monopolies and oligopolies you want to hinder large companies from becoming too large and instead break them up in to many smaller components hence incentives should work the reverse of the above meaning larger companies should be paying a higher percentage tax than the not to mention the too big to fail problem and all for the good of the people

the answer is in your question derivatives are contracts so are enforced in the same way as any other contract   if the counterparty refuses to pay immediately they will in the first instance be billed by any intermediary prime broker etc that facilitated the contract if they still refuse to pay the contract may stipulate that a broker can net off any outstanding payments against it or pay out using deposited cash or posted margins the contract will usually include the broker as an interested party and so they can but do n't need to report a default such that this is to credit agencies in some jurisdictions they are required to by law any parties to the trade and the courts may use a debt collection agency to collect payments or seize assets to cover payment if there is no broker or the counterparty still has not paid the bill then the parties involved the party to the trade and any intermediaries can sue for breach of contract if they win which would be expected the counterparty will be made to pay by the legal system including but not limited to seizure of assets enforced bankruptcy and prison terms for any of court rulings all of this holds for governments who refuse to pay derivatives losses as argentina did in the early 20th century but in that case it may escalate as far as war it has never done so for derivatives contracts as far as i know but other breaches of contract between countries have resulted in armed conflict as well as the hard results of failing to pay there are soft implications including a guaranteed fall in credit ratings that will result in parties refusing to do business with the counterparty and a separate loss of reputation that will reduce business even further potential employees and will be unwilling to become involved with such a party and suppliers will be unwilling to supply on credit the end result in almost every way would be bankruptcy and prison sentences for the party or their senior employees most jurisdictions allow for board members at companies in material breach of contract to be banned from running any company for a set period as well edit netting off cash flows netting off is a process whereby all of a party 's cash flows positive and negative are used to pay each other off so that only the net change is reflected in account balances for example company 1 cash flows netting off the total outgoings are 3 m + 500k = 3.5 m and total are 1.2 m + 1.1 m + 1.2 m = 3.5 m so the incoming cash flows can be used to pay the outgoing cash flows leaving a net payment into 's account of 0

i expect that the loan documents show both you and your ex partner as jointly and liable for the debt and thus you 're both responsible for it   it does n't really matter what other paperwork you have that says otherwise or what other promises might have been made   certainly the other agreements give you legal ground to go after your ex partner for the money but they give you no leverage with the bank if you end up paying this debt off to save your credit you need to make sure that the account is closed   make sure you have paperwork showing it as closed and showing that it was paid in full and then keep that paperwork forever re 1 i think it will eventually show up on your credit report   you could ask the bank for proof that you owe the money if you like but that will probably just delay the inevitable re 2 his bankruptcy filing really has no bearing on you and your obligation to repay the loan   if he did n't list this debt then he is still liable for it as well and you can still go after him under your other agreements   but either way you 're still on the debt

as far as i know any business can register for vat regardless of the nature of the business   if all the goods you sell or services you provide are vat exempt or zero rated then you will get refunds from hmrc on vat your business pays any business whose non vat exempt turnover which would include zero rated goods and services provided exceeds the registration threshold must register again even if that means they are forced to claim refunds so the only question would be whether your rather nebulous activities were enough to qualify you as a business or organisation to which the vat regime applies at all the one liner answer to that is   generally if goods or services are provided in return for a charge there â€™s a business activity for vat purposes inevitably there 's a much bigger body of statute and case law and it wo n't always be obvious whether the one liner answer applies or not to a particular activity so it may be necessary to seek specialist advice

it depends on the way you have directed the order and the execution agreement you have signed with your broker in case of dma direct market access you would direct your order to the specific exchange and that exchange would post your offer assuming you did not tag it as hidden however if you just gave your order to the broker be it via telephone email or even online they may not have to display your order to the market or chose which exchange to sell it on it will also depend where the stock is listed for most us listed and otc stocks regulation applies where your order should have been executed against if it went to the exchanges check your account opening docs and agreements the execution agreement in there it will tell you how your order should be treated in case where the broker stipulates that you have dma or that they will direct your order to lit markets public exchanges and not market making firms and dark pools then you may have a case you would need to request information to exchange your broker sent the order to in case that you gave them discretion on routing of your order read the fine print the answer lies there regarding nbbo missing you quote as suggested above is also a possibility however reg should take care of this do you have stock and date time of your order

is it equity or debt understanding the exact nature of one 's investment equity vs. debt is critical when one invests money in a company presumably incorporated or limited by buying some or all of it as opposed to lending money to the company then one ends up owning equity shares or stock in the company in such a situation one is a shareholder not a creditor as a shareholder one is not generally owed a money debt just by having acquired an ownership stake in the company shareholders with company equity generally do n't get to treat money received from the company as repayment of a loan unless they also made a loan to the company and the payment is designated by the company as a loan repayment rather shareholders can receive cash from a company through one of the following sources loan repayment is n't one of those options it 's only an option if one made a loan in the first place anyway each of those ways of receiving money based on one 's shares in a company has distinct tax implications not just for the shareholder but for the company as well you should consult with a tax professional about the most effective way for you to repatriate money from your investment considering the company is established overseas you may want to find somebody with the appropriate expertise

for the person being hired this is a tricky situation specially with the new laws there is no real magic number that can be applied as a lot will depend on what benefits you want and what is actually available this will really shift the spectrum quite a bit   under the care act everyone has to have insurance or pay a fine were really not sure what to call this yet but there are two provisions that really mess with the numbers you look at as an employee   first the cost of heath care has skyrocketed so the same benefits that you had 5 years ago now cost maybe 10 15 times as much as they used to this gets swept under the rug a bit because the main costs of insurance has only increased a tiny amount what this actually comes down to is does your new aca approved heath plan cover exactly the benefits you need or does it cut corners   sorry this is complicated and i do n't mean it to come off as a speech against the aca so i will give an example my wife has ra she really has it under control with the help of her ra doctor this is not something she ever wants to change because she has had ra from the age of 15 and because it 's she does n't want to spend 5 years working with a new doctor to get to the same place she is with her current doctor   in addition the main drugs she takes for ra are not covered under any aca plan nor are the that her doctor makes we are trying to have kids so she has to be off the main meds and a couple of the things this doctor has tried has been meds that reduce are pregnancy safe but are not for the treatment of ra you now have to take into effect rather the cost of health insurance + the cost of the things now not covered by the heath insurance + the out of pocket expenses is worth the insurance   second the aca has set up provisions to straight up trick those people that have lower income and are not paying close attention when shopping for insurance they get quotes like $ 50 a month or $ 100 a month the truth is that the remainder of the actual cost is deducted from their tax returns this takes consideration because if you thing your paying $ 50 a month for insurance but your really paying $ 650 then you need to make sure your doing your math right finally you need to understand how messed up things are right now in the us with heath care largely this goes unreported i 'm not really sure why but in order to do this i will have to give examples   for my wife to see a specialist her ra doctor the co pay is $ 75 so she goes to the doctor he charges her $ 75 and bills the insurance $ 200 the insurance pays the doctor $ 50 with out insurance the visit costs $ 50   at first you want to blame the doctor for cheating the system but the doctor has to pay for hours of labor to get the $ 50 back from the insurance company from the doctors perspective it 's cheaper to take the $ 50 then it is to charge the insurance company and by charging the insurance company he has no control over the cost of the co pay he essentially has to charge more to make the same money and the patient gets the in the process another example i got throat last year i went to the walk in clinic paid $ 75 saw the doctor got my z pack for $ 15 went home in bed and got better my wife who still had separate insurance from before the marriage got throat that went to the same clinic they charged her $ 200 for the visit $ 50 co pay and $ 250 for the z pack $ 3 co pay the insurance paid the clinic $ 90 for the visit and $ 3 for the drugs again the patient is left out in this scenario in this case it worked better for my wife unless you account for the fact that to get that coverage she had to pay $   my point is that when comparing costs of with insurance and without out insurance its often times much cheaper for the practices to have you self pay then it is for them to go through the loops of trying to insurance to make them whole this creates two rates self pay rates and insured rates when your trying to figure out the cost of not having insurance then you need to use the self pay rates these can be vastly different   so as an employee you need to figure out your cost of heath care with insurance and your cost of heath care without insurance then user those numbers when your trying to negotiate a salary the problem is that there is no magic number to use for this because the cost will very a lot for us it was cheaper to not have insurance even with a pre existing condition that takes constant attention it 's just better if we set aside $ 500 a month then it is to try to pay $ 750 a month that might not hold true for everyone for some people or conditions it may be better to pay the $ 750 then to try to handle it themselves   so for my negotiations i would go with without insurance or with insurance   now as an employer it 's a lot simpler usually you have a group plan that offers you a pretty straight $ x per year per person or $ y per year per family so you can offer exactly that salary $ x or salary $ y. as a starting point however this is where negotiations start   if your offering me $ and insurance i would rather just have $ and no insurance of course your real cost is only $ 55,000 cause you do n't care about my heath care costs only about insurance costs so you try to negotiate down towards $ 55,000 and no insurance but that 's not good enough for me so i either go else where and you loose talent or i accept $ and insurance or somewhere in between

to have to stop you right there most fortune 500 companies pay a lot of tax additionally they get targeted for audits quite a bit because of their size and complexity but at the end of the day if it shows a net profit on their income statement they 're generally paying tax   true but they make an effort to create a structure that profits and maximizes expense income tax is a real thing but it 's not the primary vehicle of taxation that some people think it it they pay more in other taxes like payroll social security and other kinds of tax   gt;a progressive scale for capital gains will just lead to high income individuals transferring the form of income to something else   you 're probably right

you are kind of thinking of this correctly but you will and should pay for insurance at some point   what i mean by that is that although the insurance company is making a profit that removing the risk for certain incidents from your life you are still receiving a lot of value    things that inflict large losses in your life tend to be good insurance buys   health liability long term care long term disability and property insurance typically fall into this category    in your case assuming you are young and healthy it would be a poor choice to drop the major medical health insurance   there is a small chance you will get very sick in the next 10 years or so and require the use of this insurance   a much smaller chance than what is represented by the premium   but if you do get very sick and do n't have insurance it will probably wipe you out financially   the devastation could last the rest of your life    you are paying to mitigate that possibility   and as you said it 's pretty low cost    while you seem to be really good at numbers it is hard to quantify the risk avoidance   but it must be considered in your analysis also along those lines is car insurance   while you may not be willing to pay for full coverage it 's a great idea to max out your personal liability if you have sufficient assets

not to my knowledge often the specific location is diversified out of the fund because each major building company or real estate company attempts to diversify   risk by spreading it over multiple geographical locations also buyers of these smaller portfolios will again diversify by creating a larger fund to sell to the general public that being said you can sometimes drill down to the specific assets held by a real estate fund that takes a lot of work you can also look for the issuer of the bond that the construction or real estate company issued to find out if it is region specific hope that helps

who says they do n't in the united kingdom the bank of england and the bank of scotland print the money in some other countries like hong kong israel and the us commercial banks were issuing the currency at some point of time but now the governments do that the problem with commercial banks issuing currency is the control if a bank is allowed to print money how can the amount of currency be controlled if it is controlled by the government then the bank will be just a printing press so what 's the point and since governments now want to control the monetary policy banks have no reason to just be printing presses for the government the governments have their own edit apparently in hong kong it is still the case as i 'm sure it is in some other places in the world as well

in general stock markets are very similar to that however you can also put in limit orders to say that you will only buy or sell at a given price these sit in the market for a specified length of time and will be executed when an order arrives that matches the price or better traders who set limit orders are called liquidity or price makers as they provide liquidity i.e. volume to be traded to be filled later if there is no counterparty i.e. buyer to your seller in the market a market maker a large bank or brokerage who is licensed and regulated to do so will fill your order at some price that price is based on how much volume i.e. trading there is in that stock on average this is called average daily volume adv and is calculated over varying periods of time we use which is the 30 day average you can always sell stocks for whatever price you like privately but a market order does not allow you to set your price you are a price taker therefore that kind of order will always fill at a market price as mentioned above limit orders will not fill until the price is hit but will stay on book as long as they are n't filled expired or cancelled

i 'd agree that this can seem a little unfair but it 's an unavoidable consequence of the necessary practicality of paying out dividends periodically rather than continuously and differential taxation of income and capital gains to see more clearly what 's going on here consider buying stock in a company with extremely simple economics it generates a certain constant earnings stream equivalent to $ 10 per share per annum and all of that profit as periodic dividends let 's say once annually assume there 's no intrinsic growth and that the firm 's value which we 'll say is $ 90 per share is completely neutral to any other market factors under these economics this stock price will show a evolution accruing from $ 90 to $ 100 over the course of a year and resetting back down to $ 90 after each dividend payment now if i am invested in this stock for some period of time the fair outcome would be that i receive an appropriately time weighted share of the $ 10 annual earnings per share less my tax if i am invested for an exact calendar year this works as i 'd expect the stock price on any given day in the year will be the same as it was exactly one year earlier so i 'll realise zero capital gain but i 'll have collected a $ 10 taxed dividend along the way on the other hand what if i am invested for exactly half a year spanning a dividend payment i receive a dividend payment of $ 10 less tax but i make a capital loss of overall pre tax i 'm up $ 5 per share as expected however the respective tax treatment of the dividend payment which is classed as income and the capital gains is likely to be different in particular to benefit from the negative taxation of the capital loss i need to have some positive capital gain elsewhere to offset it if i ca n't do that i 'm much worse off compared to half the full year return further even if i can offset against a gain elsewhere the effective taxation rates are likely to be different but note that this could work for or against me if my capital gains rate is greater than my income tax rate i 'd actually benefit and if i 'm invested for half a year but not spanning a dividend i make $ 5 of pure capital gains and realise a different effective taxation rate again in an ideal world i 'd agree that the effective taxation rate would n't depend on the exact timing of my transactions like this but in reality it 's unavoidable in the interests of practicality and so long as the rules are clear i would n't say it 's unfair per se it just adds a bit of complexity

you have multiple issues buried within this question first we do n't know your tax bracket for my answer i 'll assume 25 this simply means that in 2016 you 'll have a taxable $ 37,650 or higher   the interesting thing is that losses and gains are treated differently a 's long term gain is taxed at 15 yet losses up to $ 3000 can offset ordinary income this sets the stage for strategic tax loss harvesting in the linked article i offered a look at how the strategy would have resulted in the awful 2000 2009 decade producing a slight gain 1 not great of course vs the near 10 loss the s&p suffered over that time this was by taking losses in down years and capturing long term gains when positive and not using a carried loss   back to you a 's long term gain tax is zero so using a gain to offset a loss makes little sense just as creating a loss to offset the gain the bottom line enjoy the loss up to $ 3000 against your income and only take gains when there 's no loss this advice is all superseded by my rule do n't let the tax tail wag the investing dog for individual stocks i would never suggest a transaction for tax purposes you keep good stocks you sell bad ones sell a stock to take a short term loss only to have it recover in the 30 day waiting period just once and you 'll learn that lesson learn it here for free do n't make that mistake at your own expense

it does n't matter to the credit agencies if there is a co signer or not however your family member will need to take into consideration if they are willing to be responsible for the loan in the event you are unable to make payments being a co signer means they are agreeing to pay the loan amount it will also impact their credit score report either improve it if all goes well or destroy it if neither one of you are able to pay the loan so to you assuming you can pay all the payments and not default it makes no difference but to the co signer it could create a huge impact

without the contract it 's hard to say for sure but consumer reports indicates that it 's pretty easy to lose these deposits they 're not as well protected as other deposits or purchases depending on your state and other details   you should make an effort to comply with all of the requests from the financing arm promptly and in particular you should probably highlight that you could afford to pay for the car in cash and be prepared to show bank money market investment statements to back that up   credit is mostly a numbers game but there is a human on the other side making the decision assuming you 're remotely close and that makes a big difference    i would be prepared to walk away from your deposit if they come back and offer you a 5 apr or similar and you 're uncomfortable with the loan at that rate over 5 years a $ 20k loan at 5 apr will cost you several thousand dollars it might be worth it even if they do n't give you your deposit back   and if you 're clearly ready to walk away from the deposit that might cause them to negotiate in better faith some tips both from that article and my general experience

my opinion including the value of depreciating property one owns in a net worth calculation is silly but could be interesting you do n't expect your tv or laptop to gain value   instead you expect them to decrease in value every year until you replace them   anything you expect to hold or increase in value art a house etc is a different story if you 'd like to really get anal about this you can track your net worth like a business would track its balance sheet   i 'm not going to go into detail but the general idea is that when you purchase an item you debit the cost from cash and add the value paid to assets so your net worth does n't change when you make a purchase    you then depreciate the value of the item under assets according to a depreciation schedule   if you plan on replacing your laptop every three years you might subtract 33 of the value every year    this could be an interesting exercise i.e. even if you make money your net worth may decrease because of all the depreciating junk you own but my hunch is that it would n't be worth the effort it requires

here 's an all too common anecdote which gives me that impression   executive summaries powerpoint etc have slowly made most leaders slow and ineffective at dealing with change i worked in a company that was adamant to continue to produce a dsl modem wifi router in room movie service box as their next product that would be installed per room into a on site in hotels when i tried to explain to them people are just going to download porn online and a few wifi routers are 1/10th the price and a is a pain in the over the phone they just ignored me why well they said they had been with the company for far longer seniority was their excuse to drive a company into the ground they never gave me one technical or analytical reason why their of a project was actually worth pursuing the actually thought they knew more about technology than their engineers technicians and tech support because they had been sitting in rooms listening about technology at maybe a 10th grade level for 30 years every one of them had business degrees even the cto but that is not too bad on its own it was the fact that they had never out of their academic discipline their book shelves if they had any were filled with popular management books self help guides and dieting books oh man sorry for the long rant i hated that place tl;dr management in mba led technical companies after a certain amount of time imho just becomes a bunch of deluded self righteous good old boys that will drive your company like 60 year old drunk boys at the wheel of a school bus   my background is in computational bio which is close to economics math wise   let me do a play by play of those things and their dependency on context   1 communicating with stakeholders   how is this different from communication skills generally stakeholders are not a homogenous group so the statement is a derp   goals   much like the first this is some communications   key point is that understanding goal feasibility is dependent on experience with the system those goals measure so this fake skill splits between i mentioned and communications   a strategy    falls under expertise because it is most essential to understand technical feasibility   you can not delegate tasks well unless you   understand exactly how to perform those tasks   an organization to accomplish said goals   the first word made your definition recursive

there 's no requirement of us citizenship to open a bank account in the us any person citizen or not can do that i do n't know where this assumption of yours come from but it is false so the easiest solution is to open a bank account for your nephew next time he visits the us and get him an atm card from that account you can then deposit money to that account as much as you want beware of the gift tax consequences if he does n't want to travel to the us and can not open a us bank account remotely from russia which is probably the case then follow the 's suggestion have him open a bank account in russia and just wire money there having a foreigner tapping freely into your own personal bank account may cause legal issues both with regards to gift tax and money laundering provisions that require you to certify that the money on the account is yours only also check if there 's an issue for a russian resident to have control over foreign accounts there 's definitely such an issue for a us resident russians are generally not far behind when it comes to government oppression

it seems like a more commonly recurring issue on reddit that people are referencing logical fallacies without really understanding them   for reference ad hominem attacks are personal attacks they are person specific you can not make an ad hominem attack against a group of people such as the poor   straw man attacks are when an argument is changed to something that it is not and then beaten down it skews the topic at hand to something it is not   when i make an assumption clearly state it and then ask a question based on it with the words if yes it is not a straw man by any definition i was attempting to expand the argument to see how you view the rich vs. poor because the vast majority of arguments in favor of helping the poor come with the caveat that the rich should pay that price a higher minimum wage is an example of that those greedy business owners need to pay it am i right   i would suggest that you do not refer to these logical fallacies until you fully understand them   me as some guy that just does n't understand how the real world works   this is basically the problem with your source your arguments and your personal position you mention that you worked through high school and college you did n't mention managing people but even if you did i would be surprised if you managed long term minimum wage the kind of people who never rise above it the majority of the workers around you probably were doing much what you did using the job as a stepping stone   your source mentions most people are willing to work yet states that 46 are child care workers and 48 are home care workers do you know why the government will pay relatives who get a simple home health care provider license to care for relatives who are on medicare thus their grandma requires care and their daughter or grandchildren provide said care for a fee paid by the government the us government is literally paying people to take care of their family it is relatively the same with child care it 's disgusting   that article is making the argument that they want to work i do n't think taking a part time job caring for your family denotes a will to work i build low income housing i actually deal with the tenants who do this kind of work on a personal level you could not convince me that a 26 year old with two kids from two different fathers who on occasion provides care to their family members has a will to work i see their daily lives how does the government even check to see if the care is being provided is grandma going to lie nope   i can assume that you do n't manage minimum wage employees because it is nearly impossible good labor refuses to work at that price the market is much higher depending on the job it is usually double or triple the cleaning guy at my apartment building makes $ 12 an hour i 've paid minimum wage the only people i pay that are day laborers most of which have serious problems in their lives and even then it usually is more hell i 've seen a guy from the neighborhood pay as low as $ 25 a day to people looking for a fix   you are constantly arguing that i look down on these people it 's not entirely wrong but it 's not about the wage i am very friendly with the staff at the local mcdonalds in one of the of houston the manager is a really nice guy i asked him why certain positions kept turning over he complained that it was hard to find people and he kept having employees no show this is minimum wage and they ca n't even show up do you really believe that people want to work when simple positions that require no skill can not be filled   you make it seem as though i am assuming the worst it 's quite the opposite i am incredibly optimistic and giving but with many people in the us it does n't matter you just do n't see it on the day to day you read a study that is incredibly biased and take it to the grave there are many many people in the us who do not want to work they rely on government subsidies and refuse to improve their own lives it will always happen it 's just a matter of what the government will try to do about it next   i forgot to mention houston has built more homes in the last 5 years every year houston almost built more single family homes than the entire state of california in the year 2014 thus my painter is leaving one of the largest construction markets in the us to go to seattle because he ca n't find people to paint a building

the request to block the money is made by the party who sells the product based on this request the bank blocks the funds subsequently the party who sold the product makes a charge against this block just to give an easy example so in the online train booking there are multiple messages sent between the bank and something has gone wrong it looks like the message from bank sending back the block reference number to has not reached so as per bank there is a block and as per there is no block keep chasing to issue a letter so that you can send it to the bank and get the block removed typically the blocks by the bank are for a period of 30 days and if there is no charge against that block it automatically gets reversed

if i understand you right what you need is the minimum amount in the account until your next deposit   so for example if today is the 10th and you get paid on the 15th how much do i need to have in the account so i know how much i can spend   that amount should be all of the bills that will be paid between today and the 15th an alternative would just to keep a running balance and see what the minimum value is my personal finance software does that for me but it 's possible although a little more complicated in excel   you 'd have to find the date of the next deposit and do a looking for dates between today and that date   that 's about as far as i can get without getting off topic

one thing i would like to clear up here is that black scholes is just a model that makes some assumptions about the dynamics of the underlying + a few other things and with some rather complicated math out pops the black scholes formula black scholes gives you the real price under the assumptions of the model your definition of what a real price entails will depend on what assumptions you make with that being said black scholes is popular for pricing european options because of the simplicity and speed of using an analytic formula as opposed to having a more complex model that can only be evaluated using a numerical method as dumbcoder mentioned should note that for many other types of derivative contracts e.g. american or style exercise the black scholes analytic formula is not appropriate the other important thing to note here is that the market does not necessarily need to agree with the assumptions made in the black scholes model and they most certainly do not to use it if you look at implied for a set of options which have the same expiration but differing strike prices you may find that the implied for each contract differ and this information is telling you to what degree the traders in the market for those contracts disagree with the distribution assumption made by black scholes implied vol is generally the thing to look at when determining cheapness of an option contract with all that being said what i 'm assuming you are interested in is either called a delta gamma approximation or more generally greek based profit and loss attribution in case you wanted to google some more about it here is an example that is relevant to your question let 's say we had the following european call contract popping this in to bs formula gives you a premium of $ delta of and gamma of let 's say you bought it and the price of the stock immediately moves to 55 and nothing else changes re evaluating with the bs formula gives whereas using a delta gamma approximation gives the actual math does n't work out exactly and that is due to the fact that there are higher order greeks than gamma but as you can see here clearly they do not have much of an impact considering a 10 move in the underlying is almost entirely explained by delta and gamma

the rent vs. buy debate or strategy has been a really interesting and surprising one to me i can see both sides   for instance where i live one of the points on the local politician 's platform is that he keeps property taxes low     there are also significant tax deductions in the current tax code that favor the early stages of a primary residence home loan amortization where the payments are mostly interest     so such a place might be a more effective place to live to retain the most income for some period of time early in the loan term      often places with cheap rent are n't places someone would want to live you make important points about problems related to that places that someone with enough income to make this strategy significant needs to live are n't always going to be cheap to rent or cheap to own    for some people in their prime earning amp investing years this is a significant calculation to consider

several actually maintenance costs as landlord you are liable for maintaining the basic systems of the dwelling structure electrical plumbing hvac on top of that you typically also have to maintain anything that comes with the space so if you 're including appliances like a w d or fridge if they crap out you could spend a months rent or more replacing them you are also required to keep the property up to city codes as far as unless you specifically assign those responsibilities to your tenant and in some states you are not allowed to do so and in many cases renters expect to come out of their rent one way or the other failure to do these things can put you in danger of giving your tenant a free out on the lease contract and even expose you to civil and criminal penalties if you 're running a real slum escrow payments the combination of property tax and homeowner 's insurance usually doubles the monthly housing payment over principal and interest and that 's if you got a mortgage for 20 down also because this is not your primary residence it 's ineligible for homestead act exemptions where available states like texas are considering extending homestead exemptions to landlords with the expectation it will trickle down to renters however mortgage interest and state taxes do count as rental expenses and can be deducted on schedule c as ordinary business expenses offsetting revenues income tax the money you make in rent on this property is taxable as self employment income tax you 're effectively running a sole proprietorship real estate management company so not only does any profit you are allowed to deduct maintenance and administrative costs from the rent revenues get added to whatever you make in salary at your day job you 're also liable for the full employee and employer portions of medicare medicaid ss taxes you are however also allowed to depreciate the property over its expected life and deduct depreciation the life of a house is pretty long and if you depreciate more than the house 's actual loss of value you take a huge hit if when you sell because any amount of the sale price above the depreciated price of the house is a capital gain though it can work to your advantage by depreciating the maximum allowable to reduce ordinary income then paying lower capital gains rates on the sale   legal costs the rental agreement typically has to be drafted by a lawyer in order to avoid things that can cause the entire contract to be thrown out though there are boilerplate contracts available from state landlords associations this will cost you a few hundred dollars up front and to update it every few years it is deductible as an ordinary expense advertising putting up a for rent sign out front is typically just the tip of the iceberg online and print ads an ad agency these things cost money it 's deductible as an ordinary expense add this all up and you may end up losing money in the first year you rent the property when legal advertising initial maintenance purchases to get the place tenant ready etc are first spent deduct it properly and it 'll save you some taxes but you better have the nest egg to cover these things on top of everything your lender will expect you to bring to closing assuming you do n't have $ 100k+ lying around to buy the house in cash

i do n't think it really matters my understanding is that as a sole trader there is no distinction between your personal and business tax affairs the distinction between your personal and business account is mainly for your own personal benefit to make it easier to differentiate between wages and retained earnings if you want to maintain this distinction with regard to tax then you need to somehow differentiate between tax paid on your wage and tax paid on retained earnings you could then either make two payments or pay from either and transfer the difference from the other either way it 's just a matter of perspective rather than something with a physical difference

japan has entered the next phase unlimited money printing   investors have been watching japan for over a decade now wondering what happens to a country that has a debt to gdp ratio of big Â  to realistically pay off we are starting to get the answer for review japan was the first country in the modern central banking era to begin a policy of Â  quantitative easing an unconventional form of monetary policy that is used when interest rates have already been lowered to the zero bound quantitative easing which involves the purchase of printed money to buy government bonds was widely viewed in japan as a failure but what most people do n't understand about japan 's early qe experiments is that they were very small less than $ 20 billion a month it took prime minister abe and boj governor Â  to ramp up asset purchases significantly in what was called      abe japan 's prime minister photographer bloomberg      the results of have been mixed but the stock market is certainly higher and the yen is certainly lower although it 's not clear that either of those two developments have really helped japan 's stock market is mostly foreign owned and the weaker yen did n't materially help the balance of trade still there are a lot of people who said that japan 's endless debt deflation would have been worse Â  without so it has remained firmly in place for five years   rapidly began to cause distortions as accelerated asset purchases caused the bank of japan to hold a huge percentage of outstanding government bonds at 40 and rising as well as being the majority holder of index etfs investors who traffic in have remarked that the market now functions very poorly since so much of the market is held by the boj it seems that will get worse not better last year the boj implemented a policy of yield curve targeting ostensibly to help the banks keeping the overnight rate negative but targeting a 10 year rate at zero percent the boj has been buying longer dated bonds for years but this was the first time it ever explicitly capped a rate at longer maturities some people wondered how committed the boj would be to maintain that cap in the event that were caught up in a global duration selloff which we experienced in the last two weeks   as 10-year yields rose above 0.10 last week the boj announced that it was prepared to buy an Â  unlimited amount of bonds to keep yields close to zero percent as you can imagine buying an unlimited amount of 10-year involves printing a theoretically unlimited amount of yen so the yen weakened significantly on the news Â  it still remains about ten percent stronger than it was in 2015 we are getting closer to the endgame for japan what happens if yields rise further what happens if the yen depreciates significantly how much could it depreciate could japan have a currency crisis what happens if the boj ends up owning the entire bond market these are the questions that investors are asking and nobody really knows the answers we are in territory i believe that a currency crisis is n't just possible it 's inevitable and it probably happens at about the time that the boj owns all or nearly all of the market and has to resort to Â  canceling the debt this sounds like a neat magic trick to make the debt go away but the laws of economics are not to be conned anything is possible a currency crash a bond market crash anything this is the very definition of debt monetization that resulted in hyperinflation in places like weimar germany and zimbabwe is japan different we shall see we will find out soon as japan has taken a major step in that direction Â  is the Â  author of all the evil of this world and the editor of the 10th man newsletter for economics subscribe here   forbes articles have 8 tracking cookies and 9 tracking scripts this comment has r

there is a trade off it can be worthwhile because you save those extra trips on the other hand do n't you need to go shopping all the time for perishable items anyway on the other hand having those items on stock implies inventory costs the space they take up might be limited the money they represent is sleeping and can not be put to other usage some of them might break this trade off gives you the economic order quantity your stock levels over time based on that would look like a saw blade in addition you might want to keep a safety stock for emergencies if you use them faster than expected if there is a supply shortage

through that link what exactly do you want me to read   the changes to inflation under clinton were made to made to more accurately account for inflation so if anything things are more accurate now than in 1950 the precise details of the changes are documented on the bls website somewhere but the short of it is that the old inflation definition had the problem where if prices went up or down and then back to original you would still have inflation which is incorrect the changes lessen this effect many independent groups like the billion price project agree that the current bls methods for measuring inflation is more correct than the older methods and match actual pricing better note that the billion prices index does not include hedonics as far as i know and in practice the amount of goods to which hedonics applies in the cpi basket is so small as to not matter much anyways finally the idea is sound one should account for to products as adding value so comparing a 20 tv from 1970 to one today needs more than merely retail price to evaluate price increases certainly gets more tv than back then   if you have claims otherwise i 'd like to hear them until then i suspect we more accurately measure gdp and inflation than in 1950 not less accurately   all this still does not show there is more of the numbers than in 1950 and the poster above you said it seems he 's making excuses to obtain an he desires rather than the correct approach which is to measure carefully and then think what it means   and no one here said gdp was a universal measure of economic health

the answer is actually very simple the cost of data seriously call the cboe tomorrow and ask yourself they have two big programs   1 the penny pilot program where options trade at penny increments instead of 5 cent increments this is only extended to a select few symbols because of the amount of data this can generate is too much for the data vendors data vendors store and sell historical data the exchanges themselves often have a big data vending business too 2 the weekly options program where only select symbols get these chains because of the amount of data they will generate liquidity and demand are factors in determining if the cboe will consider enabling those series on new issues although they have to give the list of which symbols are on these programs to the sec

congratulations on deciding to save money and choosing to invest it one thing to know about mutual funds including index funds is that they typically require a minimum investment of a few thousand dollars $ 3000 being a typical amount unless the investment is in an ira in which case $ 1000 might be a minimum in some cases automated monthly investments of $ 50 or $ 100 might need to be set up if you are beginning with a small balance there is nothing wrong with your approach you now should go and look at the various requirements for specific index funds the fidelity and vanguard families are good choices and both offer very low cost index funds to choose from but different funds can have different requirements regarding minimum investments etc you also have a choice of which index you want to follow the s&p 500 index midcap indexes small cap indexes total stock market indexes etc but your choice might be limited   until you have more money to invest because of minimum investment rules etc    most important after you have made your choice i urge you to not look every day or even every month to see how your investment is doing you will save yourself a lot of anxiety and will save yourself from making wrong decisions   far too many investors ignore the buy low sell high and pull money out of what should be long term investments at the first of a downturn and end up buying high and selling low finally the time is approaching when most stock funds will be declaring dividends and capital gains distributions if you invest now you may end up with a paper profit on which you will have to pay taxes in   non tax advantaged accounts on your 2012 tax return this is called buying a dividend and so you might want to spend some time investigating now but actually make the investment in late december after your chosen fund has made its distributions the date for this will be on the fund 's web site or in early 2013

do n't sell ever   well almost a number of studies have shown that buying equal amounts of shares randomly will beat the market long term and certainly wo n't do badly   starting from this premise then perhaps you can add a tiny bit extra with your skill maybe but who knows you might suck   point is when buying you have the wind behind you a monkey would make money selling is a different matter you have the cost of trading out and back in to something else only to have changed from one monkey portfolio to the other if you have skill that covers this cost then yes you should do this but how confident are you a few studies have been done on retail broker accounts and they show the same story   retail investors on average lose money on their switches even if you believe you have a real edge on the market   you 're strategy still should not just say sell when it drops out of your criteria   your criteria are positive indicators lack of positive is not a negative indicator   sell when you would happily go short the stock    that is you are really confident it is going down otherwise leave it

credit unions have long advocated their services based on the fact that they consider your character   unfortunately they are then at a loss to explain how they determine the value of your character other than to say that you 're buddies play pool together so they 'll give you a loan your credit history score is as accurate a representation of your character in business dealings as can be meaningfully quantified   it tracks your ability to effectively use and manage debt and your propensity to pay it back responsibly or default on obligations   while it is n't perfect it is certainly one of the best means currently available for determining someone 's trustworthiness when it comes to financial matters

          legit after 5 minutes of googling and using the search bar in reddit for these jobs   actually since you edited your response here 's why i found it kinda naive you have a pretty good gig as a petroleum engineer in a company the only thing in your description that you 're interested in a job is a corporate job which is for the most part all professional jobs its ok to be curious but saying i do n't like engineering but i like corporate jobs so tell me about corporate sounding jobs even though google has tons of articles on it sounds entitled and naive     corporate finance controllers fp&amp;a treasury is a catch all for jobs that quantify and manage a company 's money this includes figuring out how much money the business is making budgeting and gaining access to money for future plans they spend most of their day on excel browsing reddit and complaining that other departments do n't take them seriously there is work life balance unless your company is at risk of bankruptcy but pay will likely be the least of this group     corporate strategy development is about finding ways to achieve the vision goals of the c suite corporate development usually are ex ib people and focused on finding companies to acquire integrate and achieve the goals of the acquisition synergies returns on investment technology product acquisition corporate strategy is usually broader and could be focused on improving the brand figuring out new uses for a product finding new partners or generally looking for good ideas to improve the company     business development usually is about growing the company through finding new customers markets or partnerships instead of selling specific products or services you 're selling your company 's abilities and brand    i 'd say with your engineering background if you can swing a corporate strategy gig you 'd have the greatest for any vp you decide i 'd say if you want to sell or are good at selling then business development may be compelling if i were you corporate finance would be the least appealing unless you are truly interested in finance

it is recommended that you get this using wire transfer the fees is slightly high it should be in the range of usd 20 30 you would get the funds faster about 3 5 days after the payment is initiated the fx conversion would be applied without your knowledge so you would have very little control over it if you are getting by paper cheque it would take around 7 10 days for the mail to arrive you would have to deposit this in local bank complete a form giving out the details as to why you received the cheque along with a letter to request the cheque to be cashed generally it takes around 25 days for the funds to get credited as you would be speaking to someone in bank you can try and negotiate a better fx rate however for such amounts bank will not go out of the way so you may not know what rate gets applied it would be the standard rate some 20 days later when the actual cheque gets processed the fees are relatively less in the range of rs 500 to rs 1000

as far as i can tell the direct deposit option would require you to have a us bank account which you do n't have so wire transfer is your only option unless you can ask them to try something else like one of the cheaper money transfer services around the charges for wire transfers tend to be fairly significant typically low tens of usd depending on your relationship with the payer and the nature of the payment try to get them to send it with all charges paid so you actually receive the amount you are owed and they cover the charges

is there any particular area of business that you have interest     what free resources do you currently use general web browsing   here are some magazines out there that i find interesting   fast company $ year 10 issues magazine focused on tech innovation leadership and design   i do n't subscribe but i regularly purchase fast company entrepreneur and inc. when i am traveling   they make for a perfect airplane read and i typically find great takeaways or clip articles from it   entrepreneur $ year 12 issues obviously by the title this is catered to the entrepreneurial mindset   it provides informational and inspirational stories from entrepreneurs and for entrepreneurs   i enjoy reading this and probably read 3 or 4 issues per year   i 'm not a regular reader but at times i have felt like content may run lean at times     inc $ year 10 issues inc. feels like a blend of fast company and entrepreneur   the articles are aimed at the business owner for starting and running operations   businessweek $ 5 year 12 issues i regularly read businessweek but primarily on their website   i have picked up issues occasionally which are great but their web provides a fair amount of access   they seem to have a nice blend of news and unique stories about specific companies products and investment   recently they had interesting articles with fair depth on the ceo of burger king and the history of   forbes $ year 26 issues i love the volume of content that forbes provides and they seem to have a nice mix on a variety of subjects   i use forbes as my of the internet for business in conjunction with several others   i actually feel like forbes and businessweek provide a perfect blend of business news with shocking little redundancy   harvard business review was n't able to quickly see a price   i reference a fair amount in regards to business discussions and think they provide excellent research material and information   the writing style and layout is n't quite as as some of the other magazines such as fast company but the quality is excellent   wsj obviously putting out a high volume of content but you definitely pay for it   i know a fair number of people who read it but i actually have never known anyone to subscribe to it if that makes sense   all the readers i know either receive a subscription through their work or university   i think that shows the content is valuable and quality but it might not justify the cost you have to pay for it as an individual reader   i use a variety of websites to get business news general education and help me overall to understand the business world   specifically from the ones listed above i check businessweek and forbes daily for morning or lunch reading   forbes in particular does a solid job due to all of their external content contributors   seems like an interesting way to provide content if you can it correctly     if you 're more interested in the finance investment world then i think yahoo finance and cnn money are great   focusing specifically on investments then i really enjoy the content i get from motley fool and seeking alpha   some articles get pretty deep in regards to finance and investing but overall i think they give great insight   i read but i 'll be honest i feel dirty   sometimes i find an interesting piece that leads me elsewhere to research more   the content is primarily distributed in a buzzfeed style format which has some questionable headlines and less professional content 7 crazy facts that sound fake but are actually true   in summary i think you could learn a good amount on a variety of topics while staying plugged into news and developments in the business world for free   i 'm sure a few other people will chime in with other great sources that i did n't capture and some that i did n't even know existed   i would start by reading a few of these sites i listed regularly and continue posting in this sub to help us keep the conversation going

here are the basic questions i usually ask any new business startup do these numbers answers seem reasonable to you and is some benchmark available that allows you to see how likely this is    remember particularly in internet based advertising ventures the client may be indirect   the person who clicks on a google context based link is not directly google 's client   the person who decided to host adwords code on their site is the direct client you 're also going to want to see a chart or some process chart indicating exactly what needs to be done at what cost and by whom   answers to these questions give a sense of not only how seriously they are taking the business but also how organised my final question who is your first client they need either someone who is going to contract the service or have a clear indication of where income is going to come from on their first day of trading their task is to sell their idea to you by proving that it will return on your investment and be profitable   from the strength of these answers you can gauge the value of your investment to them how critical it is how risky the opportunity and ultimately the stake and returns you should expect

as others have pointed out you ca n't just pick a favorable number and rent for that amount if you want to rent out your house you must rent it for a value that a renter would agree to   for example there is a house on my street that has been looking for renters for 3 years they want $ 2,500 a month this covers their mortgage and a little bit more for taxes and repairs it has never been rented once other homes in my neighborhood rent for around $ 1,000 a month there is no value to a renter in renting a house that is $ 1,500 more then a similar house 2 doors down now what you can look at is cost mitigation so i am using data from my area houses in my part of florida must have a c running in the wet months to keep the moisture from ruining the house this can easily be $ 100 a month usually more the city requires you to have water service even when not occupied though the cost is very small same with waste which is a flat fee $ 20 a month yard watering is a must during the dry months if you want to keep grass let 's say that comes out to $ 50 a month year round pest control is a must especially if your house has wooden parts like floors or a roof even modest pest control is $ 25 a month property taxes around $ 240 a month let 's say your mortgage is around $ 1,000 a month that means to sit empty your house would cost $ now if you were to rent the house a lot of those costs could go away by becoming the tenants responsibility your cost of the house sitting full would be $ let 's pad that with 10 for repairs and go with $ now let 's assume you can rent for $ 1,000 a month keep in mind all these rates are about right for my area but will change based on size and amenities   your choices are let the house sit empty for $ a month or fill it and only lose $ 240 a month keep in mind that in both cases you will be gaining equity   so what a lot of people do around here is rent out their houses and pay the $ 240 as an investment for every $ 240 they pay they get $ 1,000 in equity well interest and fees aside but you get the point it 's not a money maker for them right now but as they get older two things happen that $ 240 a month payment pays off their mortgage so they end up owning the house outright then that $ 240 a month payment turns to extra income and at some point their rental can be sold for let 's guess $ 400,000 so they paid $ and got back $ 400,000 all the while they are building equity in their rental and in the home they are living in   the important take away from this is that it 's not a source of income for the landlord as much as it is an investment you will likely not be able to rent a house for more then a mortgage + costs + taxes but it does make a good investment vehicle

this is a big and complex topic but it 's one i think people get wrong a lot   there 's a lot of ways to treat a child 's pocket money tell a kid that they 're getting $ allowance   help them keep it safe but do n't give them access to it put it in a drawer in your office or a bank on a high shelf   encourage them to save up for a big purchase   help them decide what to spend it on   when they find something they want talk it over with them to make sure it 's right for them this seems like a good approach because it encourages thrift long term thinking savings and other important elements of real life   but it 's a terrible idea   all it does is make the child think of it as if it was n't really their money   the child gets no benefits from this and will certainly not learn anything about savings give the kid $   full stop this seems like a bad idea because the kid is just going to waste it   which they will     that 's the point   there 's no way to learn except by experience try and shift control of discretionary spending to the child as and when appropriate   give them some money for clothes or a present for their birthday and let them spend it   if they 're going to be spending all day at some event give them money for lunch   and if they it tough   no kid is going to starve in one day because the spend their lunch money at a video arcade but they will learn a valuable lesson   you have to be careful here of two mistakes   first only do this for truly discretionary spending   if your kid needs clothes for school then you better make sure they actually buy it   second make sure that you do n't end up filling in the gaps   what you 're teaching here is opportunity costs and that wo n't work if your child gets to have his cake and eat it too   or go to the movies and still get that new xbox game have them get a job   and it should go without saying give them control of the money   it 's incredibly tempting to force them to save be responsible etc   but all this does is force them to look responsible for as long as their under your thumb   nothing will the lessons about why being responsible is important like being irresponsible   and it 's sure as hell better to learn that lesson with some paper route money when your 14 than with your rent money when your 24

sometimes a business must keep track of overhead expenses that can be used to determine the rates they will bill their customers especially the government when determining the rates they are allowed to charge the government they have to include direct costs and indirect costs these indirect costs include allowable overhead and they can also include profit but the government limits the maximum profit any expenses have to come out of profit   expenses include costs of amusement diversions social activities and any directly associated costs such as tickets to shows or sports events meals lodging rentals transportation and are when they talk about meals and lodging being they are referring to those not needed to support the contract if the contract expects the contractor to travel they will generally provide a travel budget that is separate from the amounts used to determine the hourly rate the term slush fund has the connotation of being illegal or hidden slush funds are used to bribe officials or are leftover funds that were supposed to be spent and are now being hidden so that they can be misused at a later date

to short a stock you actually borrow shares and sell them the shorter gets the money from selling immediately and pays interest for the share he borrows until he covers the short the amount of interest varies depending on the stock it 's typically under 1 a year for large cap stocks but can be 20 or more for small illiquid or heavily shorted stocks in this scam only a few people own the shares that are lent to so they essentially have a monopoly and can set really high borrow costs the shorter probably assumes that a pump and dump will crash quickly so would n't mind paying a high borrow cost

this depends on the terms and conditions of your ira account and those of the investments you have chosen in general you are better off investing as quickly as is feasible given those terms   money in your cash account does n't earn much of a return so the quicker you get money into something earning a return the better however pay attention to the fees and costs associated with investing   if there is a per transaction fee you may want to consolidate as it may be more efficient to do so after all if you contribute $ 500 at a shot and it costs you $ 5 to make a trade you 're paying 1 off the top to make that trade if you make 11 of them versus 0.1 to make 1 so the question is do you earn that 1 back over the course of the six months   that will depend on what you are investing in    more than likely you 're going to earn more than 1 over the course of the six months so it 's probably worth investing it in pieces still in that situation but if the transaction cost is higher or the time differential lower you may have a less clear cut answer   i invest at vanguard in their funds and have no transaction fees so i have a more obvious answer invest as soon as possible you also need to consider whether you have minimums to pay attention to maybe your investment is something you can only buy whole shares of for example or you might have a much higher fee if you make small transactions   in that case you should wait until you have the minimum to make that transaction if the fee is more than the return you 'll get so the answer is make the transactions as early as you can subject to considering the fees you will pay for making them

20-year treasury bonds are not equivalent to cash not even close   even though the bonds are backed by the full faith and credit of the u.s. government they are long term debt and therefore their principal value will fluctuate considerably as market interest rates change when interest rates rise the market value of 20-year bonds will drop and drop more than shorter term bonds would   your principal is not protected in the short term   principal is only guaranteed returned at the 20-year maturity of those bonds   but oops there is no maturity on the 20-year bond etfs because every year the etf rolls the positions into new 20-year positions for an equivalent to cash piece of a portfolio i 'd want my principal to be intact over the short term and continually reinvested at the higher short term rates as rates are rising   reinvesting at short term rates can be an inflation hedge   but money locked in for is a sitting duck for inflation still inflation aside why do we want our equivalent to cash position to be relatively liquid and principal protected when it comes time to rebalance your portfolio after disastrous equity and/or bond returns you 've got in your cash component some excess weighting since it was unaffected by the disastrous performance that excess cash is ready to be deployed to purchase equities and/or bonds at the lower current prices   rebalancing from cash can add a bonus to your returns and smooth volatility   if you have no cash component and only equities and bonds you have no money to deploy when both equities and bonds are depressed   you did n't keep any powder dry   and btw i would personally keep a bit more than 3 of my powder dry consider a short term cash deposit or good money market fund for your equivalent to cash position

time for a lawyer essentially regardless of the situation it 's not right for him to be paying the mortgage and only get half the value out of the equity in the house all other things aside no court i can think of would allow that the could happens are many but the most common include keep in mind that if he keeps paying the mortgage enough most courts will end up giving him ownership outright essentially they will say he has already bought her out by paying her half of the debt   unfortunately any way he goes he is going to need to take action when there is a missed mortgage payment a bad tax year or some other legal issue some one is injured on the property the last thing he is going to want is for the courts to decide the issue for him for example john breaks an arm while climbing a tree on the property line john takes the owners of the property to court he says but my sister owns half and the courts decide then and there that because he 's been paying the mortgage alone he owns the house alone seems like a win except now he owns the liability alone and owns john $ 1,000,000 for a silly lawsuit alone   point is this ownership of property comes with risks and responsibilities he really needs to get those risks and responsibilities under control so he can mitigate them or he could end up in a very nasty situation in the years to come

the us does n't have a value added tax which is the one usually refundable upon departing the country so sales taxes you pay in this country stay in this country and you do n't get a refund just remember to treat the tax as an implied part of the price and be aware that state and local taxes may vary so the total price may be higher in one place than in another new york city adds a few percent on top of the state sales tax for example if you are n't sure how much tax would be do n't be afraid to ask

there 's nothing you can do if he has indeed deposited the check it would appear on your account fairly quickly i 've never seen it taking more than 2 3 business days however a check is a debt instrument and you can not close the account until it clears or until the unclaimed property laws of your state kick in if he claims that he deposited the check ask it in writing and have your bank or the bank where it was deposited investigate why it takes so long to clear if he 's not willing to give it to you in writing he 's likely not deposited it whatever the reason may be even just to cause you nuisance lesson learned next time cashier 's check with a signed receipt re closing the llc if you 're the only two partners you can just withdraw yourself from the llc take out your share and drop it on him leaving him the only partner check with your local attorney for details

will 2 millions dollars check to be cash will a bank convert a check to cash   in my experience no   even for small checks    unless you happen to have a very good relationship with your banker read as have an existing large bank balance    the exception is if you go to the bank the check is drawn on    but even then i doubt they 'll cash a $ 2 m dollar check can you deposit a $ 2 m dollar check   most definitely how long will 2 millions dollars check to be cash depends on your bank 's policies relationship with you and the origination of the check   you 'll need to talk to the exact bank in question to find out   some guidelines from my own experiences out of country checks will take quite awhile say 4 weeks even for trivial amounts   i 'm not sure what a $ 2 m size would do    beyond that situation it will likely depend on whether you have more money than the check 's worth in your bank accounts   if so they may be willing to give you cash in a few days   or if you only want some of the money as cash in a few days that might be possible if the bank could n't cash for him will the bank give him some of cash    for example $ 500,000 for now and the rest wait to be cash at later    time like 24 hours or 1 week unless you already have a lot of money in your relationship with the bank i think it is highly unlikely they will let you have any of the money in 24 hours   you might get some of it in a week    the issue will be that such a large check will be viewed as having a high chance of being fraudulent so they will want to be exceptionally conservative

amortization is the process by which your loan balance decreases over time for both mortgages and credit card balances your interest charges are based on what you owe   the calculation of the balance is a little different but it still is based on what you owe you 're observing correctly that most of the first payments on a mortgage are interest   this stands to reason since an amortization schedule for a fixed rate mortgage is constructed on the assumption that you 're making your payments equally over the course of the mortgage   since you owe more at the beginning you accrue more interest and a larger fraction of your payment is interest   near the end you owe little and most of your payment therefore is principal

credit cards come with an interest free grace period of ~25 days as long as you pay your balance in full every month in other words charges made in january will appear on a bill cut on jan 31 and due around the 25th of february if paid in full by there 's no interest it is a very good idea to get in the habit of paying off your entire balance every month for this very reason do n't buy anything you ca n't afford to pay for at the end of the month when the credit card bill is due you 'll avoid interest charges build good habits and improve your credit score by just paying the minimum amount due you 'll be charged interest from the moment of purchase and the grace period on new purchases goes away credit card companies make the minimum amount due relatively low as a way to encourage you to pay more and more in interest every month do n't fall for it look for a credit card with zero annual fee sure rewards are nice but it 's more important to avoid fees keep the interest rate low and get in the habit of paying in full every month in which case the interest rate wo n't matter your bank or credit union is a good place to start looking

the fact you are asking this question the number of up votes the real cause of the banking crisis     answers which mention that shareholders will fire a public company board are on the bottom it is obvious that a company owners are interested in company value and should have direct and easy impact on a directors board if management does n't increase shareholders wealth   with large number of passive shareholders and current stock market system that impact is very limited hence your question   so bank directors upper management are n't that interested in company value they are mostly interested in theirs bonuses their wealth increase not shareholders and that 's the real problem of capitalism public companies slowly drift to function like companies in former socialistic countries these is no owner everything is owned by a nation

i think it 's a silly statement if you are prepared from the start that you might lose it then you should n't invest you invest to earn not to lose most often losses are a result of fear   remember you only lose when you sell lower than you bought for   so if you have the patience you will probably regain i ask my clients many times how much do they want to earn and they all say as much as possible last time i checked that 's not an objective and therefore a strategy ca n't be built for that   if there is   a strategy then exiting a stock is easy   without a strategy you never know when to exit and then you are exposed to   losses i 've successfully traded for many years with large amounts of money i made money in the fc and in the bubble both times it was n't because i was prepared to lose but because i had an entry and exit strategy if you have both the idea of investing what u are prepared to lose has little value

i have been renting rooms out of my house for over 7 years now   when renting to non family the arrangement is usually successful   people leave for various reasons an occasionally i will ask someone to move out if they are not working out   in the usa this works well because by keeping things formal rental agreements etc you actually have a great business with lots of deductions that end up reducing you net income quite a bit however us law makes a big distinction about whether or not you 're renting to family relatives specifically around whether or not they are paying full market rent for their room   if not then you are subsidizing them which could disqualify your property or at least the portion they are using from being legitimately rented and thus no tax deductions for said activity the other risk again in the usa is the possibility of a long term relationship falling under rules of common law marriage   this is rare unless children are involved   a couple who have children married or not may have the courts get involved to oversee the division of assets with regards to ensuring the children have a place to live and adequate financial support for the uk i would think the laws would be roughly similar   check out this website for more a detailed review

both of my primary home purchases were either at or close to asking price my first house was during the local seller 's market in 2001 2002 there were waiting lines for open houses in hindsight we bought more home than we needed at the time but that had nothing to do with offering asking price it was the market for the type of property location and features at that time my second house was a little after the peak in 2008 the value had come down quite a bit and the property was priced on the low side versus the comps to this day my second house still appraises higher than what we paid for it even though it was at asking price as a third example my brother in law got into a bidding war on his first home purchase and ended up buying it for above asking price this was normal for the houses in the area he was looking at with real estate like other people have said it really is important to either know the area you are looking at or to get an agent you trust and have them explain their reasons for their offer strategy through the comps yes agents need to make money but the good ones have been in the business a while and also live off of repeat business when you sell your house or refer friends and family to them agents do a lot less work when it comes to selling by the way so they would love for you to come back to them when it 's time to sell if i 'm not happy with the way things are going with my agent i would have a heart to heart with them and give them a chance to correct the relationship i 've spoken to a realtor friend in the past about getting out of buyer 's contracts and he told me it 's a lot easier as a buyer than a seller the buyer has most of the power during the process the seller just has what the buyer wants

you may want or at least be thinking of the annualized method described in pub 505 also downloadable in pdf and referred to in why are estimated taxes due early for the 2nd and 3rd quarters only this does n't prorate your payments as such instead you use your income and deductions etc for each of the quarters to compute a prorated tax for the partial year and pay the excess over the amount already paid if your income etc amounts are nearly the same each month then this computation will result in payments that are of 90 of your whole year tax but not if your amounts vary over the year if you do use this method and benefit from it you must file form 2210 schedule ai with your return next filing season to demonstrate that your quarterly computations and payments met the requirements you need to keep good per period or per month records of all tax relevant amounts and do n't even try to do this form by hand it 'll drive you nuts use software or a professional preparer who also uses software but i 'd expect someone in your situation probably needs to do one of those anyway but partnership puts a wrinkle on this as a partner your taxable income and expense is not necessarily the cash you receive or pay it is your allocated share of the partnership 's income and expenses whether or not they are distributed to you a partnership to operate a business like lawyers as opposed to an investment partnership probably distributes the allocated amounts at least approximately rather than holding them in the partnership i expect this is your year end draw technically a draw can be any allowed amount not necessarily the allocated amount in other words your husband does earn this money during the year he just receives it at the end if the year end distribution or allocation if different is significant say more than 5 of your total income and the partnership is not tracking and reporting these amounts promptly for the irs quarters and i suspect that 's what they were telling you affects other partners you wo n't have the data to correctly compute your quarterly taxes and may thus subject yourself to penalty for not timely paying enough if the amount is reasonably predictable you can probably get away with using a conservative high side guess to compute your payments and then divide the actual full year amounts on your k-1 over 12 months for this wo n't be exactly correct but unless the partnership business is highly seasonal or volatile it will be close enough the irs wo n't waste its time on you the quarters are much closer to weeks but it 's months that matter

by buying the call option you are getting the benefit of purchasing the underlying shares that is if the shares go up in value you make money but transferring the risk of the shares reducing in value this is more apparent when you are using the option to offset an explicit risk that you hold for example if you have a short position you are at unlimited risk of the position going up in value you could decide you only want to take the risk that it might rise to $ x. in that case you could buy a call option with $ x strike price then you have transferred the risk that the position goes over $ x to the counterpart since even if the shares are trading at $ you can close out the short position by purchasing the shares at $ x while the option counterpart will lose $ y.

savings accounts have lower fees if you do n't anticipate doing many transactions per month e.g. three or fewer withdrawals then i would suggest a savings account rather than a checking account a joint account that requires both account holder signatures to make withdrawals will probably require both account holders signature endorsements in order to make deposits for example if you are issued a tax refund by the u.s. treasury or any check that is payable to both parties you will only be able to deposit that check in a joint account that has both persons as there can be complications due to multi party account ownership if cashing versus depositing a joint check and account tax id number when you open the account you will need to specify what your wishes are regarding whether both parties or either party can make deposits and withdrawals also at least one party will need to be present with appropriate identification probably tax id or social security number when opening the account   if the account has three or more owners you might be required to open a business or commercial account rather than a consumer account this would be due to the extra expense of administering an account with more than two after the questioner specified interest north carolina in the comments i found that the north carolina general banking statutes have specific rules for joint accounts any two or more persons may establish a deposit account    the deposit account and any balance shall be as joint tenants    unless the persons establishing the account have agreed with the bank    that withdrawals require more than one signature payment by the bank    to or on the order of either person on the account the bank 's obligation i looked for different banks in north carolina i found joint account terms similar to this in pdf file format everywhere joint account if an item is drawn so that it is unclear whether one payee â€™s    endorsement or two is required only one endorsement will be     required and the bank shall not be liable for any loss incurred by the    maker as a result of there being only one endorsement also   joint accounts are owned by you individually or jointly with others    all of the funds in a joint account may be used to repay the debts of    any co owner whether they are owed individually by a co owner    jointly with other co owners or jointly with other persons or    entities having no interest in your account you will need to tell the bank specifically what permissions you want for your joint account as it is between you and your bank in north carolina

as the op expressed their thought it seemed to me they were suggesting or rather anyone who is rich however that is defined non invested money be taxed at this high rate and that strikes me as naive you do n't think they would leave the country or invest it in a savings account earning .05 or most likely spread across many so it was fdic insured    gt i bet the rich would find something to do with that idle cash overnight if it was taxed at a 75 rate or so     they were basically suggesting the us government the savings of wealthy people    the question of whether the highest effective tax rate on income should be raised is   a completely different discussion personally i favor a higher tax rate and some new tax brackets for the very highest earners i do n't really think it 's necessarily fair in a progressive system to treat the rich as a piggy bank but it is what it is they benefit the most so they are called to contribute the most    i think i 'd favor some kind of alternative minimum tax for rich people so they had to pay a minimum of of their income above some sort of cap 5 million per year 100 million per year and capital gains   applied this would close the buffet loophole    my biggest reason for this though is not because i do n't think they deserve their money it 's because coffers basically guarantee that the legislation will be written for them and by them there is always this tension between the poor and middle class that want more services and the upper class that wants to pay less taxes    i am starting to get to the point where i think it might be better to have a smaller government and less services because they abuse their power and our money so much sopa afghanistan and iraq wars etc i do like the idea of social safety nets but perhaps those should be more local    anyways sorry for the wall of text

an option that no one has yet suggested is selling the car paying off the loan in one lump sum adding cash from your emergency sum if need be and buying an old beater in its place   with the beater you should be able to get a few years out of it hopefully enough to get you through your phd and into a better income situation where you can then assess a new car purchase or more gently used car purchase to avoid the drive it off the lot income loss    even better than buying another car that you can afford to pay for is if you can survive without that car depending on your location and public transit options   living car free saves you not only this payment but gas and maintenance though it costs you in public transit terms right now it looks as if this debt is hurting you more than the amount in your emergency fund is helping   do n't wipe out your emergency fund completely but be willing to lower it in order to wipe out this debt

's answer has a very good discussion of the types of pe ratio so i will just answer a very specific question from within your question and who makes these estimates is it the market commentators or the company saying we 'd expected to make this much future earnings estimates are made by professional analysts and analytical teams in the market based on a number of factors if these analysts are within an investment company the investment company will use a frequently updated value of this estimate as the basis for their pe ratio some of these numbers for large or liquid firms may essentially be generated every time they want to look at the pe ratio possibly many times a day in my experience they take little notice of what the company says they expect to make as those are numbers that the board wants the market to see instead analysts use a mixture of economic data and forecasting surveys of sentiment towards the company and its industry and various related current events to build up an ongoing model of the company 's finances how sophisticated the model is is dependent upon how big the analytics team is and how much time resource they can devote to the company for bigger firms with good investor relations teams and high liquidity or small fast growing firms this can be a huge undertaking as they can see large rewards in putting the extra work in the   at least one analytics team at a large investment bank that i worked closely with even went as far as sending analysts out onto the streets some days to get a feeling for some companies and industries growth potential each analytics team or analyst only seems to make public its estimates a few times a year in spite of their being calculated internally as an ongoing process the reason why they do this is simple this analysis is worth a lot to their trading teams asset managers and paying clients than the pr of releasing the data although these projections are good at time of release   their value diminishes as time goes on particularly if the firm launches new initiatives etc this is why weighting analyst forecasts based on this time variable makes for a better average most private individual investors use an average or time weighted average on time since release of these analyst estimates as the basis for their forward pe

judging from your comments you seem to be confused about the way banking works   banks can only lend out money that they actually have whether from deposits or investors or loans taken from other banks government entities   the rules on how this works varies from country to country but the principle is always the same   there is no magic money let 's imagine a closed system   there 's only one town and that town only has one bank   there are 100 people total in town and each has $ 10,000   everyone deposits all of their money in the bank the bank now has $ 1,000,000 in total deposits   you take a loan for $ 100,000 and buy a house   the bank now has $ 900,000   you make your payments of $ per month $ 833 of interest and $ 132 toward principal   in this ideal world the bank has no costs associated with doing business   after one month the bank has $ 1,000,000 in deposits $ in cash on hand $ in loans and $ 833 in profit from interest now here 's the confusing part   you bought a house from someone   that person also lives in town   he takes the $ 100,000 you gave him and deposits it in the bank   the bank now has $ in deposits $ in cash $ in loans and $ 833 in profit assume 10 more people buy houses at $ 100,000 each taking loans for that whole amount for the same terms you did   assume those sellers then deposit the money back in the bank   the bank now has $ in deposits $ in cash $ in loans and $ 833 in profit   the bank is taking in $ per month $ x 11 in loan payments making profit of $ $ 833 x 11 per month from interest this process of loans and deposits and payments can go on forever without any outside influence   this is the primary way money is created   it 's like printing money without the paper of course we 're not in a closed system   banks are limited in endlessly creating money primarily by two things reserve requirements are set by government agencies   they might say banks can lend until their cash on hand or liquid equivalent is at minimum 35 of total deposits   so a bank with $ 1,000,000 in deposits would have to keep $ 350,000 in cash at any given time capital requirements work largely the same way   it 's more the bank saying what happens if a bunch of people want their deposits back   they plan a reasonable amount of cash to have on hand for that scenario

when we delta hedge we make the value of a portfolio 0   no you make the risk relative to some underlying 0   the portfolio does have a value but if whatever underlying you 're hedging against changes slightly the value of your portfolio should not change but what is the derivative of a portfolio   it 's the instantaneous rate of change of the portfolio relative to some underlying phenomenon   with a portfolio of many stocks there 's not one single factor that drives the value of your portfolio you have sensitivity to each underlying stock price and volatility interest rates the market as a whole etc for simplicity we might imagine a portfolio that has holdings in a call a stock and a bank account to borrow and lend money   you will have a delta relative to the stock and a delta relative to the underlying instrument on the option etc   those can only be aggregated for each factor e.g. if the call is an option on the same stock theta is the only one you can calculate for the portfolio as a whole it will be the aggregate theta of all of your positions since change in time is constant across all investments   all of the others are not since they are measuring to different phenomena

the us treasury is not directly involved but can affect the junk bond market by issuing new bonds when rates rise since us bonds are considered completely safe changes in yield will affect low quality debt for example if rates rose to levels like 1980 a 12 treasury bond would drive the prices of junk bonds issued today dramatically lower another price factor is likelihood of default companies with junk credit ratings have lousy balance sheets so negative economic conditions or tight short term debt markets can result in default for many of these companies whether bonds in a fund are new issues or purchased on the secondary market is n't something that is very relevant to the individual investor the current interest rate environment is factored into the market already via prices of bonds

both of these are important points i think that what /u is saying and what most people miss when it comes to ai machine learning is that it 's often nothing more than a more advanced form of logistic regression e.g. neural networks so to a degree machine learning is nothing terribly new it just requires much more processing power and has been largely limited by that   the part where it becomes a black box is that with a regular logistic regression you select your variables interactions etc you 're defining the model whereas with machine learning approaches you 're still selecting variables but you 're not defining how they interact with each other and while you can technically look inside and see what it 's doing it 's not something that really makes a ton of sense   i can easily explain a coefficient on a standard logistic regression or model but what does the weight of the 6th node of the 3rd layer of a neural network mean

there are a number of ways trading stocks is easier than commodities but the main and most important reason is that over long periods stocks in general will tend to outperform inflation as you are investing money in enterprises that generally try to become more productive over time   whereas commodities in the long term tend to rise only at the pace of inflation this is kind of the definition of inflation actually   so even uninformed investors that pick stocks at random will generally do better than someone doing the same in commodities even before the higher commodities trading fees are taken into account also your orange example may be harder than you think   once the news that a drought is an issue the price of oranges will almost immediately change well before the oranges come to market   so unless you can predict the drought before anyone else can you wo n't be able to make money this way

spend your first 50 euros on research materials warren buffett got started as a boy by reading every book in the library of congress on investing and stock market analysis you can research the company filings for canadian companies at u.s companies at and european companies at find conflicting arguments and strategies and decide for yourself which ones are right the motley fool offers articles on good stocks to add to your portfolio and why as well as why not they provide a balanced judgement instead of just hype they also sell advice through their newsletter in canada the globe mail runs a daily column on screening stocks every day they present a different stock picking strategy and the filters used to reach their end list they then show how much that portfolio would have increased or decreased as well as talking about some of the good bad points of the stocks in the list it 's interesting to see over time a very few stocks show up on multiple lists for different strategies these ones in my opinion are the stocks to be investing in while the globe 's stock picks focus on canadian and us exchanges you might find the strategies worthwhile you can subscribe to the digital version at   once you have your analytical tools ready pick any bank or stock house that offers a free practice account use that account and their screening tools to try out your strategies and see if you can make money picking stocks   my personal stock picking strategy is to look for companies with a long uninterrupted history of paying dividends that are regularly increased and do not exceed the net profit per share of the company and whose share price has a long history of increasing these are called unicorn companies because there are so very few of them   another great read is do stocks outperform treasury bills by in this paper the author looks at the entire history of the u.s. stock universe and finds that less than 4 of stocks are responsible for 100 of the wealth creation in the u.s. stock market he discusses his strategies for picking the winners but it also suggests that if you do n't want to do any research you could pick pretty much any stock at random short it and wait i avoid mutual funds because they are a winner only for the selling them a great description on why the mutual fund industry is skewed against the investor can be found in a book called the rrsp secret by greg by tony robbins also discusses why mutual funds are not the best way to invest in stocks the investor puts up 100 of the money takes 100 of the risk and gets at best 30 of the return rich people do n't invest like that

hold onto that money put it in savings with such a change in the us government who knows what will happen and if things start to go sideways having savings so that you can continue paying your mortgage and thus keep your house is going to help you more than being able to throw more money at your mortgage principle unless you can pay it off totally then do that i would build more of an emergency fund 2 years just to be on the safe side then see what other things are going on in your life and what 's going to be more advantageous for you that 's a nice low interest rate not many other loans these days are going to have an interest rate that low

first as @littleadv mentions and as i 've pointed out before anyone who participates in a market using limit orders which by the way should be every non professional investor is by definition a market maker   so i will assume that your question pertains both to official market makers and to retail investors using limit orders when you remark that there are such tight spreads in liquid assets what you are really saying is wow look at all the market makers in these products   that 's the benefit of electronic trading and algorithmic traders millions of participants each with their own opinion of the value of a financial instrument trying to find people who have very specifically opposing opinions of the value of that same instrument   this is called price discovery and is the entire point of financial markets so you ask why are there all these market makers present to create such tight spreads in assets like spy   answer because they can make money in these markets imagine towards a contradiction that market makers thought they could n't make money by offering tight spreads in spy and so spy had a wider spread than it actually does   for example say the highest bid for spy was $ and the lowest ask was $ 100.01   now imagine that a market maker with perfect knowledge of the future came along knowing that he would be able to sell spy for $ 100.01 in 5 minutes   then he would load up as many buy orders as he could for $ 100.00 or lower   he would n't bid $ 100.01 or higher because those trades would not be profitable according to his information at least not 5 minutes from now   so the spread had previously been $ 0.03 and then suddenly it was $ 0.01 all because a market maker with better information came along and realized he could make money by creating a tighter market now nobody has perfect knowledge of the future which is why markets are never infinitely tight or infinitely liquid   each market maker has to weigh possible profits against the probability that those profits will actually turn into losses   but if one market maker decides not to participate in a particular instrument there 's bound to be another market maker who will happily take his place   so the very fact that there are so many market participants with resting buy sell orders for spy right now is proof that there are market makers able to make money doing so   if they could not make money they would n't be there and the spread would be wider 10 15 years ago before electronic trading and algorithmic trading the number of market participants was far lower and the spreads were far wider meaning retail investors like you and me had a much harder time making money   the only people making money were the institutional investors the brokers and the exchanges   now that all these new millions of players are present in the market retail investors like you and me get to participate and make money too

a bid is an offer to buy something on an order book so for example you may post an offer to buy one share at $ 5 an ask is an offer to sell something on an order book at a set price for example you may post an offer to sell shares at $ 6 a trade happens when there are bids asks that overlap each other or are at the same price so there is always a spread of at least one of the smallest currency unit the exchange allows betting that the price of an asset will go down traditionally by borrowing some of that asset and then selling it hoping to buy it back at a lower price and pocket the difference minus interest so let 's say as per your example you borrow 100 shares of company x expecting the price of them to go down you take your shares to the market and sell them you make a market sell order a market ask this matches against a bid and you receive a price of $ 5 per share now let 's pretend that you change your mind and you think the price is going to go up you instantly regret your decision in order to pay back the shares you now need to buy back your shares as $ 6 which is the price off the ask offers on the order book because of this spread you have lost money you sold at a low price and bought at a high price meaning it costs you more money to repay your borrowed shares so when you are shorting you need the spread to be as tight as possible

another factor to consider is that resale value of the laptop is quite bit more if it is still under warranty   this would apply to people who replace their laptop often it is higher because the purchaser can be assured they are not getting a lemon   i determined this by comparing prices on ebay before selling my computer of course if you keep your laptop longer than the warranty this means nothing   but for me it meant i could sell my old laptop quickly and for a better price because i used my laptop for work and totally depended on it even one day of downtime would cost me a lot so it was worthwhile to keep a relatively new laptop under warranty also for those using apple care there is an undocumented perk   apple covered an out of warranty repair on a time under my apple care for my laptop even tho they were not purchased at the same time

if the rate is the same then clearing one card to zero does have one advantage getting your grace period back generally when you owe money on your credit card and you make a new purchase that new purchase get charged interest starting on day one but if you are not carrying   a balance in other words you pay off the charges every month then new purchases are n't charged until you fail to pay the balance by the due date that grace period can be 25 to 55 days depending where you are in the billing cycle having one clean card will allow you to use that card when you have no other choice lets say you have an emergency car repair while away from home you do n't have $ 500 in cash so you put it on the clean card when you get home you know that you can pay the bill and not have been charged interest

yes you are right as per my understanding while doing trade you must consider specially for starters like me the volume of the stock you are trading in should be high enough to keep you secure for quick in and out whenever the bid volume is more than the ask volume the prices will move up and vice versa to give an example if a stock is at 100 points and there are bids the transaction will occur when either the bidder agrees to pay the ask price case 1 he pays 101 his bid offer will disappear and the next best ask will be 102 and the current price will be 101 which was the last transaction or when the person giving ask price agrees to deal at best bid which was 99 in which case the share will go down

you have to balance several concerns here the primary problem is that if you go to the effort of saving your money you want to also be sure that your savings will not lose too much of its value to inflation ukraine had a terrible inflation spike in 2015 for obvious reasons even as inflation has settled down in 2016 it is stabilizing around 12 which is very high   exchange rates are your next concern if you lose a large percentage of the value of your money just in the process of exchanging it that also eats away at the value of your money if you accept the us federal reserve target of 2 inflation then you should only exchange money that you will hold long enough that both exchange fees will outweigh the 10 inflation advantage even in cases where you have placed your money in a foreign currency there 's a chance that your government could freeze accounts denominated in foreign currencies so there 's always the political risk that you have to factor in for that reason keeping foreign currency in cash also has some appeal because it can not be confiscated as easily you could still certainly be robbed so keeping all of your savings in cash is n't a great solution either all in all you are diversifying your savings if you use the strategy of balancing all three methods splitting it evenly to 5 for each method is n't the most important i would suggest taking advantage of good exchange rates as they appear to time when you buy foreign currency

i live in an area where there are large distribution centers for a number of retailers fairly near each other wal mart 's hires a lot of young kids and completely inexperienced people as soon as they get a little experience they usually get to work trying to get on with one of the other dc 's because they all pay more and offer better benefits the thing is there is always some young inexperienced kid out there willing to work their off for a and no benefits because the management is making sure they never get enough hours to earn them there 's no impetus on wal mart to make any effort to do better by their workers

gt prices can still be low and people can still make tons of money just slightly less money for those at the top and slightly more for those at the bottom rungs   you can not simply pay people a wage different to market wage why would the executives take accept a salary at 80 of the market wage when they could just get a job at 100 of the market wage   and at the other end if you simply started paying the workers 20 more suddenly all of the workers at that new price point want to get a job at wal mart they swiftly will replace all the current employees who can not perform at that level if they could why would they have been working at wal mart   you are against reality yes it sucks that some people are only capable of labour at low productivity levels totally agree simply trying to pretend that they are more productive is just ridiculous though

i think the other answers raise good points   but to your question how do i find an honest financial adviser ask your friends and family   see who they talk to and in   go meet that person understand what they do and how they view things and if you gel great   honesty and strong ethics exist in individuals regardless of laws what is it you 're trying to accomplish   you just have some money you want to put aside   you want to save for something   you want to start a budget or savings plan   your first step may be talking to a tax person not an investment adviser   sometimes the most significant returns are generated when you simply retain more of your earnings and tax people know how to accomplish that   you 're just graduating university you 're just going to get your first job   you do n't need to hunt for the right heavy 30 gains generating financial adviser   you need to establish your financial foundation   crawl walk then run there are some basics that international borders   if you do n't know much about investing most if not all retirement and individual brokerage type accounts will give you access to some kind of market index fund   you do n't need to diversify in to high fee funds because emerging markets are screaming right now   typically over a few years the fees you pay in the more exotic asset classes will eat up the gains you 've made compared to a very low fee market index fund you can open free accounts at a number of financial institutions   these free accounts at these banks all have a list of zero commission zero load funds all have something resembling an index fund   you can open your account for free deposit your money for free and buy shares in an index fund for free

i 'll take a stab at this question and offer a disclosure i recently got in ring 5.1 asx rio and   while i wo n't add to my positions at current prices i may add other positions or more to them if they fall further   this is called catching a falling and it 's a high risk move cons let 's scare everyone away pros the ecb did n't engage in as much qe as the market hoped and look at how it reacted especially commodities   consider that the ecb 's actions were tighter than expected and the fed plans to raise rates or claims so   commodities should be falling off a cliff on that news while most american western attention is on the latest news or entertainment china has been seizing commodities around the globe like crazy and the media have failed to mention that even with its market failing china is still seizing commodities   if china was truly panicked about its market it would stop investing in other countries and commodities and just bail out its own country   yet it 's not doing that   the whole china crisis is completely oversold in the west china is saying one thing oh no but doing another using its money to snap up cheap commodities capitalism works because hard times strengthen good companies   you know how many bailouts has received compared to goldman sachs   you know who owns more real wealth   oil does n't get bailed out banks do and banks ca n't innovate to save their lives while oil   hard times strengthen good companies   this means that this harsh bust in commodities will separate the winners from the losers and history shows the winners do very well in the long run related to the above point how many bailouts from tax payers do you think mining companies will get   zero   at least you 're investing in companies that do n't steal your money through government confiscation if you 're like me you can probably find at least 9 people out of 10 who think investing in miners is a very bad idea   what do they think is a good idea   duh snapchat and twitter   then there 's the old saying be greedy when everyone 's fearful and fearful when everyone 's greedy finally miners own hard assets   benjamin graham used to point this out with the dead company strategy like finding a used cigarette with one more smoke   you 're getting assets cheap while other investors are overpaying for stocks hoping that the fed qe   think strategy here seize cheap assets begin limiting the supply of these assets if you 're the saver and not borrowing then watch as the price begins to rise for them because of low supply   remember investors are part owners in companies take more control to limit the supply   using graham 's analogy stock pile those one puff cigarettes for a day when there 's a low supply of cigarettes many miners are in trouble now because they 've borrowed too much and must sell at a low profit or in some cases must lose   when you own assets debt free you can cut the supply   this will also help the federal reserve who 's been desperately trying to figure out how to raise inflation   the new patriotic thing to do is stimulate the economy by sending inflation up and limiting the supply here is key

it depends where you are going to live and how you are going to pay for your new accommodation if you are moving within the uk and intend to buy another house you run into the problem that you will find it hard to get a second mortgage if you rent out the house in kent you will probably have to change the mortgage basis on it to a mortgage that allows for letting normal residential mortgages exclude that entirely which would allow you to take out a residential mortgage it depends how much equity you have in the house if most of the value of the house is mortgaged then you 'll 1 find it hard to re mortgage on a commercial mortgage 2 may find it hard to cover the costs by letting and 3 are very sensitive to house prices falling also bear in mind that for the past three months in a row house prices in the uk have mostly either stagnated or fallen so you can not guarantee any increase in value of the house in kent what i 'm saying is there is no crystal ball that will tell you what 's financially the best thing to do talk to estate agents find out how much the house would sell for how much it would rent for talk to your mortgage lender and find out if they will let you rent it out talk to other mortgage lenders and find out how much a commercial mortgage would cost do the sums find out if renting the house would cover the costs in which case you can gamble on the housing market continuing to rise do n't rely on house prices continuing to rise as they have done before certainly where i live due to the number of new houses being built and other economic issues house prices have fallen over the past few months and may well continue to fall as more and more new houses come on the market

the formula for standard deviation is fairly simple in both the discrete and continuous cases it 's mostly safe to use the discrete case when working with adjusted closing prices once you 've calculated the standard deviation for a given time period the next task in the simplest case is to calculate the mean of that same period this allows you to roughly approximate the distribution which can give you all sorts of two standard deviations away from the mean is given by   it does n't make any sense to talk about two standard deviations away from the price unless that price is the mean or some other statistic for a given time period normally you would look at how far the price is from the mean e.g. does the price fall two or three standard deviations away from the mean or some other technical indicator like the average true range an exponential moving average of the true range some support level another security etc   for most of this answer i 'll assume we 're using the mean for the chosen time period as a base however the answer is still more complicated than many people realize as i said before to calculate the standard deviation you need to decide on a time period for example you could use s&p 500 data from yahoo finance and calculate the standard deviation for all adjusted closing prices since january 3 1950 downloading the data into stata and applying the summarize command gives me as you can probably see however these numbers do n't make much sense looking at the data we can see that the s&p 500 has n't traded close to since november 1992 clearly we ca n't assume that this mean and standard deviation as representative of current market conditions furthermore these numbers would imply that the s&p 500 is currently trading at almost three standard deviations away from its mean which for many distribution is a highly improbable event the great recession quantitative easing etc may have changed the market significantly but not to such a great extent   the problem arises from the fact that security prices are usually non stationary this means that the underlying distribution from which security prices are drawn shifts through time and space for example prices could be normally distributed in the 50 's then gamma distributed in the 60 's because of a shock then normally distributed again in the 70 's this implies that calculating summary statistics e.g. mean standard deviation etc are essentially meaningless for time periods in which prices could follow multiple distributions   for this and other reasons it 's standard practice to look at the standard deviation of returns or differences instead of prices i covered in detail the reasons for this and various procedures to use in another answer in short you can calculate the first difference for each period which is merely the difference between the closing price of that period and the closing price of the previous period this will usually give you a stationary process from which you can obtain more meaningful values of the standard deviation mean etc   let 's use the s&p500 as an example again this time however i 'm only using data from 1990 onwards for the sake of simplicity and to make the graphs a bit more manageable the summary statistics look like this and the graph looks like this the mean is the central horizontal red line and the top and bottom lines indicate one standard deviation above and below the mean respectively    as you can see the graph seems to indicate that there were long periods in which the index was priced well outside this range although this could be the case the graph definitely exhibits a trend along with some seemingly shocks see my linked answer   taking the first difference however yields these summary statistics with a graph like this   this looks a lot more reasonable in periods of recession the price appears much more volatile and it breaches the + one standard deviation lines indicated on the graph   this is only a simple summary but using first as part of the wider process of a time series is a good first step   for some technical indicators however stationary is n't as relevant this is the case for some types of moving averages and their associated indicators take bollinger bands for instance these are technical indicators that show a number of standard deviations above and below a moving average like any calculation of standard deviation moving average statistic etc they require data over a specified time period the analyst chooses a certain number of historical periods e.g. 20 and calculates the moving average for that many previous periods and the moving rolling standard deviation for those same periods as well the bollinger bands represent the values a certain number of standard deviations away from the moving average at a given point in time at this given point you can calculate the value two standard deviations away from the value but doing so still requires the historical stock price or at least the historical moving average if you 're only given the price in isolation you 're out of luck   moving averages can indirectly sidestep some of the issues of i described above because it 's straightforward to estimate a time series with a process built from a moving average specifically an auto regressive moving average process but the econometrics of time series is a topic for another day   the stata code i used to generate the graphs and summary statistics

i would be very cautious about investing any more funds into the s&p500 at this stage you are quite correct in your observation with the charts regarding the 2001 and 2008 crashes and below is the chart of the s&p500 over the last 20 years with some indicators on it   the green line on the price chart is the 100 week moving average ma and the pink line below the price chart is the moving average of the rate of change roc indicator in general the market is moving up if price is above the 100 week ma and the roc is above 0 and versa the market is moving down if price is below the 100 week ma and the is below 0 both times in 2001 and in 2008 when prices broke below the 100 week ma and then the roc crossed below the zero line well we all know what happened next in 2001 prices kept falling and the roc did n't cross back above zero for about 2.5 years in 2008 much the same happened and the roc did n't cross back above zero for over 20 months now as we are reaching the end of 2015 prices have once again broken below the 100 week ma and the roc is just above the zero line quickly heading down towards it if you have a 5 to 8 year time frame and prices do continue to fall much further after the roc crosses below the zero line your current funds and any new funds you invest in this etf will potentially see heavy losses for the next one to two years and then take another year to two years or more to recover to current levels this means that your funds will potentially have no gains at all in 5 or 6 years time a better option is to get out of the market once the roc crosses below zero and then look to get back in once the recovery has started when the roc crosses back above the zero line you might be out of the market for a year or two but once you get back in you can expect robust gains over the next 3 to 5 years if you do get out and things reverse quite quickly you can easily just get back in in and the price broke below the 100 week ma but the roc remained above zero and prices continued moving up after short corrections in the roc got very close to the zero line but did not cross below it and again prices continued to go up after a small correction you should plan for the worst and be ready if it occurs if you do n't plan you 're just hoping and hoping is what will keep you awake at night things are going against you

there are lots of reasons for the differences in price can you go to a bank b forex bureau and c central bank and post back both bid and offer prices at a given time so we can consider the spread what you 've said above for a and b are presumably offer prices because they are higher than the c central bank price if a bank or bureau bid price was higher than the central bank offer price then you could buy from the central bank and then sell them to a bureau for a higher price an almost no risk arbitrage other than the car to deliver the funds from central bank to bureau what you 've posted is a a bank will sell you 1 usd for 3.4 b a bureau will sell you 1 usd for 3.7 c we can see the bid offer for central bank is which means the central bank if you have an account will sell you 1 usd for you clearly want to buy usd from the central bank then the bank then the bureau anyway the reason for these differences is all to do with liquidity conditions in the local areas the customer types and the frequency of orders versus inventory think about it the central bank has the most frequency of orders and the biggest customers so it offers the lower price then the bank and then the bureau i think the bureau is the worst price there you have to explain further

in portugal uber competes with cabify though uber is the cheapest cabify is only marginally more expensive 10 max usually no dynamic pricing great customer service they give you water for free if necessary great for when you go out cars are newer better overall drivers are nicer and they themselves mention that cabify on top of commission it also pays them a fixed price hour which even if low it guarantees them some money on the table   i personally switched due to the pr scandals and honestly for the reasons i mentioned i do n't know how people still go for uber over here

at twenty two you can have anywhere between of your securities portfolio in equities it is reasonable to start at 100 and reduce over time   the one thing that i would mention with that is that your target at retirement should be 70 bonds   you should never have more than 30 bonds   why   because a 70/30 mix is both safer than 100 bonds and will give a higher return   absent some market timing strategy which as an amateur investor you should absolutely avoid or some complicated balancing scheme there is never a reason to be at more than 30 bonds    a 50/50 mix of stocks and bonds or a 100 bonds ratio not only returns less than the 70/30 mix it is actually riskier   why   because sometimes bonds fall   and when they do stocks generally gain   and vice versa   because of this behavior the 70/30 mix is less likely to fall than 50 or 100 bonds    does that mean that your stock percentage should never drop below 70   no   if your portfolio contains things other than stocks and bonds it is reasonable for stocks to fall below 70   the problem is that when you drop stocks below 70 you should drop bonds below 30 as well   so you keep the stock to bond ratio at    if you want to get a lower risk than a 70/30 mix then you should move into cash equivalents   cash equivalents are actually safer than stocks and bonds either individually or in combination   but at twenty two you do n't really need more safety    at twenty two the first thing to do is to build your emergency fund   this should be able to handle six months of expenses without income   i recommend making it equal to six months of your income   the reason being that it is easy to calculate your income and difficult to be sure of expenses   also you can save six months of income at twenty two    are you going to stay where you are for the next five years   at twenty two the answer is almost certainly no   but the standard is the five year time frame   if you want a bigger place or one that is closer to work then no   if you stay somewhere at least five years then it is likely that the advantages to owning rather than renting will outweigh the costs of switching houses   less than five years the reverse is true   so you should probably rent now    you can max out your 401k and ira now   doing so even with a conservative strategy will produce big returns by sixty seven   and perhaps more importantly it helps keep your spending down   the less you do spend the less you will feel that you need to spend    once you fill your emergency fund start building savings for a house   i would consider putting them in a real estate investment trust reit   a reit will tend to track real estate   since you want to buy real estate with the results this is its own kind of safety   it fell in value   houses are probably cheap   houses increasing in price rapidly   a reit is probably growing by leaps and bounds   you do this outside your retirement accounts as you want to be able to access it without penalty

typically the higher interest rates in local currency cover about the potential gain from the currency exchange rate change if not people would make money out of it however you only know this after the fact so either way you are taking a risk depending on where the local economy goes it is more secure to go with us$ or more risky your guess is as good as anyone if you see a chance for a serious meltdown of the local economy with inflation ratios and possibly new money you are probably better off with us$ on the other hand if the economy develops better than expected you might have lost some percentage of gain generally investing in a more stable currency gets you slightly less but for less risk

no that 's pretty unlikely card issuers typically base your rate on your credit score paying down debt reduces your percent of available credit used and improves your score until you are in the 1 20 range that 's optimum to this issuer you are one of a million customers there 's no emotion in this just numbers to them for what it 's worth if a card issuer raises your rate you are permitted to not accept the rate stop using the card for new charges and pay at the current rate of course this does n't apply to zero interest deals only to increases to your regular rate

diversification is just one aspect in an investment portfolio the other aspects in investment are risk taking ability liquidity local regulations tax benefits ease convenience cost of carrying out transactions etc investing in other regions is prone fx risk and other risks depending on the region of investment for example investing in emerging markets there is a risk of local regulations being changed additional tax being levied or political instability and host of such risks   investing in local markets give you better understanding of such changes and the risk associated is less plus the ease of carrying out transactions is great less expensive compared to cost of transactions in other markets diversification in investment should also be looked upon how much you invest in equities debt bullion real estate    once you have a sizeable amount of investment in equities or debt it would then make more sense to diversify this portion more to include funds from other regions unless you are an running your own business it makes sense to invest in your line of business if that is performing well the reason being that the benefit returns from the equities is much greater than the salary rise bonus for example i am in information technology and yet invest in all leading it companies because the returns from companies in these segments have been good

there is no should but i am strongly of the view that if you have savings of several months salary or more they should not only be in a separate account but with a separate financial institution or even split between two others a fraction of a percent of extra interest is reward for massively increased personal risk   the reason for this is buried in the t&cs there is almost always a right of set off if one account is overdrawn the bank reserves the right to take money from your other accounts which sounds fair enough until you consider the imbalance of power maybe your salary account gets hacked maybe that 's the bank 's fault maybe the bank has made an accounting error maybe the bank has gone bust maybe you need to employ a lawyer to act on your behalf oh dear you no longer have any savings this can not happen if your savings are with a completely separate institution then the only way that the salary account bank can touch your savings is by winning in the courts if you split the savings two ways you have also given yourself the that in the worst case only half your savings have been affected do n't put all your eggs in one basket is proverbial and there 's a folk song that 's in my memory   as through this world i wander i 've met all kinds of funny men some rob you with a six gun some with a fountain pen yet as far as i have as far as i have i 've never seen an outlaw drive a family from their home   i 've never been in this sort of trouble and the uk 's laws tend to favour the banks customers i do n't even hate bankers yet even so why take this risk when it can so easily be reduced if this sounds far fetched read the news for example

talk about coincidence we just recieved letters from our bank saying that our interest only loans will be going up by and if we want to keep our lower rate we will need to change early to now our interest only periods end in 6 months to about 16 months anyway we have decided to change to p&i early and save on our interest expenses why because the main purpose of investing is to make money not to save on tax even if you are on the highest marginal tax rate for every extra dollar of expenses you spend and claim as a deduction you will only get about 50 cents back through tax savings if you are on the lowest marginal tax rate your tax savings will reduce to less than 20 cents for every extra dollar spent if you are investing in order to save on tax you may be investing for the wrong reasons your primary reason for investing should be to make money for wealth creation a good reason to stay with an interest only loan for an investment property would be if you require the extra cash flow you would receive compared with an loan

if you start an llc with you as the sole member it will be considered a disregarded entity   this basically means that you have the protection of being a company but all your revenues will go on your personal tax return and be taxed at whatever rate your personal rate calculates to based on your situation   now here is the good stuff   if you file form you can change your sole member llc to file as an s corp.   once you have done this it changes the game on how you can pay out what your company makes   you will need to employ yourself and give a reasonable salary   this will be reported to the irs and you will file your normal tax returns and they will be taxed based on your situation now as the sole member you can then pay yourself distribution to share holders from your account and this money is not subject to normal fica and social security tax check with your tax guy and make sure to document correctly   the other thing is that on that same form you can elect to have a different fiscal year than the standard calendar irs tax year   this means that you could then take part of profits in one tax year and part in another so that you do n't bump yourself into another tax bracket   example   you cut a deal and the company makes 100,000 in profit that you want to take as a distribution   if you wrote yourself a check for all of it then it could put you into another tax bracket   if your fiscal year were to end say on sept 30 and you cut the deal before that date then you could write say 50,000 this year and then on jan 1 write the other check

it is true as noted that you generally do not know when stock that you 're holding has been loaned by your broker to someone for a short sale that you generally consent to that when you sign up somewhere in the small print and that the person who borrows has to make repay and dividends the broker is on the hook to make sure that your stock is available for you to sell when you want so there 's limited risk there there are some risks to having your stock loaned though   the main one is that you do n't actually get the dividend   formally you get a substitute payment in lieu of dividends   the payment in lieu will be taxed differently   whereas qualified dividends get reported on form 1099-div and get special tax treatment substitute payments get reported on form 1099-misc box 8 is just for this purpose   substitute payments get taxed as regular income not at the preferred rate for dividends the broker may or may not give you additional money beyond the dividend to compensate you for the extra tax whether or not this tax difference matters depends on how much you 're getting in dividends your tax bracket and to some extent your general perspective if you want to vote your shares and exercise your ownership rights then there are also some risks   the company only issues for the number of shares issued by them   on the broker 's books however the short sale may result in more long positions than there are total shares of stock financially the extra longs are offset by shorts but for voting this does not balance i 'm unclear how this is resolved i 've read that the the brokers essentially depend on shareholder apathy but i 'd guess there 's more to it than that if you want to prevent your broker from loaning out your shares you have some options

how do you know the shares will go up after you buy the ultimate risk in your scenario is that you buy at a peak and then that peak is never reached again over time stock markets go up more or less because there is a net increase in the overall production of the economy as time goes on however you wo n't experience much of that gain because you will be selling only after tiny amounts of profit have been achieved so your upside is low your plan is capital expensive because it requires you to have significant amount of cash available to make the initial purchase and your downside though unlikely has massive risk

for one the startup does n't exist yet so until march i will get nothing on hand though i have enough reserves to bridge that time i would not take this deal unless the start up exists in some form   if it 's just not yet profitable then there 's a risk reward to consider   if it does n't exist at all then it can not make a legal obligation to you and it 's not worth taking the deal yet   if everything else is an acceptable risk to you then you should be asking the other party to create the company and formalize the agreement with you as regards reserves if you 're really getting paid in shares instead of cash then you may need them later   shares in a start up likely are not easy to sell if you 're allowed to sell them at all so it may be a while before a paycheck given what you 've described for a second who pays the tax this is my first non university job so i do n't exactly know but usually the employer has to does pay my taxes and some other stuff from my income that 's what i understood if = where is the tax this i can not answer for germany   in the u.s. it would depend in part on how the company is organized   it 's likely that some or all of the tax will be deferred until you monetize your shares but you should get some professional advice on that before you move forward   as an example it 's likely that you 'd get taxed in part or in whole on what we 'd call capital gains maybe in german that would only be assessed when you sell the shares for third shares are a risk if i or any other in the startup screw really my pay might be a lot less than expected of course if it works out i 'm this is the inherent risk of a start up so there 's no getting around the fact that there 's a chance that the business may fail and your shares become worthless   up to you if you think the risk is acceptable   where you can mitigate risk is in ensuring that there 's a well written and enforceable set of documents that define what rights go with the shares who controls the company how profits will be distributed etc   do n't do this by spoken agreement only   get it all written down and then get it checked by a lawyer representing your interests

the bill proposed to under existing law employers may take tax deductions for the costs associated with moving jobs out of the country the proposed legislation would have eliminated that and used the resulting new revenue to fund a 20 percent tax credit for the costs companies run up labor back into the u.s. from as found by i will explain this in an example below    lets use allen edmonds i manufacture shoes and sell them in the us the facts we will assume is revenue or sales is $ 100 manufacturing cost is $ 50 tax rate is 10 therefore profit before tax is $ 100 = $ 50 tax is $ 5 net profit is $ 45   however suppose offshoring to canada saves money they say please and thank you at every opportunity and the positive work environment allows them to work faster correspondingly to make the same number of shoes our costs has decreased because we pay less for labour the manufacturing cost decreases to $ 30 however we incur costs to move such as severance payments to layoff contracted employees i promise to hire you and pay $ 1 a year for 2 years i fire you at the end of the first year to be fair i pay you $ 1 however it can be any legitimate expense under the sun in this case we suppose this moving cost is $ 10 revenue or sales is $ 100 manufacturing cost is $ 30 moving cost is $ 10 tax rate is 10 profit before tax is $ 100 = $ 60 tax is $ 6 net profit is $ 54 yay more jobs for canadians    however the legislation would have changed this it would have denied that moving expense if you were moving out of the country therefore we can not consider $ 10 worth of expenses for tax purposes therefore revenue or sales is $ 100 manufacturing cost is $ 30 tax rate is 10 profit before tax for tax purposes is $ 100 $ 30 = $ 70 tax is $ 7 net profit for tax purposes is $ 63 however my accounting net real profit is $ 53 i must deduct the $ 10 associated with moving the difference between the two scenarios is $ 1 in general our net profit changes by our moving cost our tax rate   there is no tax break associated with moving in canadian tax any business expense in general can be deducted as long as it is legitimate and not specifically denied i am uncertain but would assume us tax law is similar enough moving expenses in general are legitimate and not specifically denied and therefore can be deducted   offshoring and are seen as legitimate business activities as in general companies do things to increase profit forget about patriotism for the moment   the bill was to make offshoring more expensive and therefore fewer companies would find offshoring profitable however republicans defeated this bill in congress most likely the house   for completeness let us examine what would happen when we onshore bring jobs from canada to us in our example silly unions demand unrealistically high wages and increase our cost of manufacturing to $ 50 again we decide to move back to the us because if it is the same everywhere for the sake of silly national pride we move our jobs back to the us we incur the same moving cost of $ 10 therefore we have revenue or sales is $ 100 manufacturing cost is $ 50 moving cost of $ 10 tax rate is 10 profit before tax for tax purposes is $ 100 $ 60 = $ 40 tax is $ 4 however we are given a 20 tax credit for moving expense $ 10 .2 = 2 the government only assess us tax of 2 net profit is $ 38 tax credits are a one time deal so profit in the future will be $ 100 $ 5 = $ 45 same as the first example   = outsourcing = offshoring for the purposes of this article not quite the same in real life

i think living in a city where you ca n't take care of yourself has led many people to become unable of ever taking care of themselves i personally would be happy with a few acres of land a house and some solar but what makes me happy does n't make other 's happy so i wo nt even try to force my opinion of what is good in life on them the only thing stopping me from living my dream and being left alone is you and your taxes which no matter how self sufficient i am and how little i need or want the rest of society i will always be a slave to paying those taxes so your life can be easier and my life can be harder take from those who want to share your dream and leave the rest of us alone   you do n't think about that though do you    edit do you watch?v =

unfortunately economics and accounting for that matter wo n't help much with being an entrepreneur   the main thing you need to focus on is cash generation you need to maximise this there are 2 aspects revenue and costs   you need to plot these over the last 5 10 years to see trends   what is happening to revenues are they growing with inflation   if not why not   is it because people are buying online   is it because the products are not fashionable is it because people simply buy less jewelry these days   have the cost of the products gone up but the shop has n't increased prices i.e. gross margin contraction   decreasing gross margin could also be an indicator that someone is stealing from the business    what about the overhead costs of running the business   what has happened to rent salaries insurance   look for any unusual trends     in summary first you need to identify where the problem is and to do this you need to look at the trends of revenues and costs break costs down into categories

as an investor i try to interpret the suits as an attempt to in some way influence the actions of the company and not usually as a serious legal threat or as likely to lead to serious legal consequences my shallow understanding as a non lawyer is that the requirements for a lawsuit to be filed as class action suit are relatively speaking easier to meet when the company is publicly traded the shareholders are more easily described as a class so it 's more common for lawsuits that involve stock holders for large publicly traded companies to be registered as class action suits class action suits include a requirement for some advertising and notifications so all members of the class become aware of the suit and can decide whether to participate so these types of suits can be started with various goals in mind goals which might be achieved without the suit ever going anywhere including to gain some publicity for a particular point of view or to put pressure on the company to perform particular actions in most cases though they are the result of misunderstandings between the various parties with an interest in how the company is run shareholders directors and/or executive officers for most cases the result of the suit is a more in depth sharing of information between the parties involved and possibly a change in the plans actions of the company the legal technicalities differ from case to case and often the legal consequences are minor

google is a poor example since it does n't pay a dividend and does n't expect to so let 's use another example with easy numbers company x has a stock price of $ 100 and it pays a quarterly dividend many companies do let 's assume x pays a dividend of $ 4 dividends are always quoted in annual terms as is dividend yield when a company says that they pay quarterly dividends it means that the company pays dividends every quarter or every 3 months   but if a company has a $ 4 dividend you will not receive $ 4 every quarter per share you will receive $ = $ 1 per share every quarter so over the course of a fiscal year or 4 quarters you 'll get $ 1 + $ 1 + $ 1 + $ 1 = $ 4 per share which is the annual dividend   the dividend yield = annual dividend stock price so in this case company x 's div yield will be $ 100 = 4 it 's important to note that this is the annual yield to get the quarterly yield you must divide by 4 it 's also important to note that the yield fluctuates based on stock price but the dividend payment stays constant unless the company states an announcement for a real world example consider intel corp. ticker intc the share price is currently $ and the dividend is $ this makes the annual yield = $ 100 = intel pays a quarterly dividend so you can expect to receive $ every quarter for every share of intel that you own hope that clears it up

do developing country equities have a higher return and/or lower risk    than emerging market equities   generally in finance you get payed more for taking risk   riskier stocks over the long run return more than less risky bonds for instance   developing market equity is expected to give less return over the long run as it is generally less risky than emerging market equity   one way to see that is the amount you pay for one rupee lira dollar euro worth of company earnings is fewer rupees lira and more dollars euros when measured in the emerging market 's currency   this makes this question interesting   risky emerging currencies like the rupee tend to devalue over time against less risky currencies euro dollars yen like where most international investment ends up but the results are rather wild   think how badly brazil has done recently and how relatively well the rupee has been doing    this adds to the returns roughly based on interest rates of foreign stocks from the point of view of a emerging market investor on average but has really wild variations do you have data for this over a long timeframe decades ideally for multiple countries not really unfortunately   good data for emerging markets is a fairly new phenomenon and even where it does exist decades ago it would have been very hard to invest like we can now so it likely is not comparable does foreign equity pay more or less when measured in rupees or other    emerging market currency probably less on average theoretically and empirically all things included though the evidence is not strong but there is a massive amount of risk in a portfolio that is 85 in a single emerging market currency   think about if you were a brazilian and needed to retire now and 85 of your portfolio was in the real   international goods like gas would be really expensive and your local currency portfolio would seem paltry right now   if you want to bet on emerging markets in the long run i would suggest that you at least spread the risk over many emerging markets and add a good chunk developed to the mix as for investing goals it 's just to maximize my return in inr or maximize my risk adjusted return that is up to you but the goal i generally recommend is making sure you are comfortable in retirement   this usually involves looking for returns are high in the long run but not having a ton of risk in a single currency or a single market   there are reasons to believe a little bias toward your homeland is good as fees tend to be lower on local investments and local investments tend to track closer to your retirement costs but too much can be very dangerous even for countries with stronger currencies say greece

there are several reasons to pay for data instead of using yahoo finance although these reasons do n't necessarily apply to you if you 're only planning to use the data for personal use   yahoo will throttle you if you attempt to download too much data in a short time period you can opt to use the yahoo query language which does provide another interface to their financial data apart from simply downloading the csv files although the rate limit is higher for you may still run into it an api that a paid data provider exposes will likely have higher thresholds   although the reliability varies throughout the site yahoo finance is n't considered the most reliable of sources you ca n't beat free of course but at least for research purposes the center for research in security prices crsp at and wharton is considered the gold standard on the commercial side data providers like bloomberg reuters also enjoy widespread popularity although both the output from and yahoo 's current csv output are fairly standard they wo n't necessarily remain that way a commercial api is basically a contract with the data provider that they wo n't change the format without significant prior notice but it 's reasonable to assume that if yahoo wanted to they could make minor changes to the format and break many commercial applications a change in yahoo 's format would likely break many sites or applications too but their terms of use do state that yahoo may change suspend or any aspect of the yahoo finance modules at any time including the availability of any yahoo finance modules yahoo may also impose limits on certain features and services or restrict your access to parts or all of the yahoo finance modules or the yahoo web site without notice or liability if you 're designing a commercial application a paid provider will probably provide technical support for their api   according to yahoo finance 's license terms you ca n't use the data in a commercial application unless you specifically use their badges whatever those are see here in this post a yahoo employee states the finance tos is fairly specific redistribution of data is only    allowed if you are using the badges the team has created otherwise you can use or whatever method to obtain data for    personal use the license itself states that you may not sell lease or the yahoo finance modules or access    or derive income from the use or provision of the yahoo    finance modules whether for direct commercial or monetary gain or    otherwise without yahoo 's prior express written permission in short for personal use yahoo finance is more than adequate for research or commercial purposes a data provider is a better option furthermore many commercial applications require more data than yahoo provides e.g. tick by tick data for equities derivatives futures data on mergers etc which a paid data source will likely provide yahoo is also known for inaccuracies in its financial statements i ca n't find any examples at the moment but i had a professor who enjoyed pointing out flaws in the 10 k 's that he had come across i 've always assumed this is because the data were manually entered although i would assume edgar has some method for automatic retrieval if you want data that are guaranteed to be accurate or at least have a support contract associated with them so you know who to bother if it is n't you 'll need to pay for it

i 've read this claim many times in the news banks are making less profit from the lending business when interest rates are historically low the issue with most loans is they can be satisfied at any time   when you have falling interest rates it means most of the banks loans are refinanced from nice high rates to current market low interest rates which can significantly reduce the expected return on past loans   the bank gets the money back when it wants it the least because it can only re lend the money at the current market lower interest rates   when interest rates are increasing refinance and early repayment activity reduces significantly it 's important to look at the loan from the point of view of the bank a bank must first issue out the entire principal amount   on a 60 month loan the lender has not received payments sufficient to satisfy the principal until around or month depending on the interest rate   if the bank receives payment of the outstanding amount on month 30 the expected return on that loan is reduced significantly consider a $ 10,000 60 month loan at 5 apr   the bank is expected to receive $ in total for interest income of $   if the loan is repaid on month 30 the total interest is about $ 972   that 's a 26 reduction of expected interest income and the money received can only be re lent for yet a lower interest rate add to this the tricky accounting of holding a loan which is really a discounted bond which is an asset on the books and profitability of lending while interest rates are falling gets really funky and this does n't even examine default risk cost

it really depends on the answers to two questions 1 how tight is your budget going to be if you have to make that $ payment every month   obviously you 'd still be better off than you are now since that 's still $ 30 cheaper but if you 're living essentially paycheck to paycheck then the extra flexibility of the $ 400/month option can make the difference if something unforeseen happens   2 how disciplined financially have you proven you can be the i 'll make extra payments every month sounds real nice but many people end up not doing it i should know i 'm one of them i 'm still paying on my student loans because of it if you know by having done it before that you can make that extra $ 130 go out each and every month and not talk yourself into using it on all sorts of more important needs then hey go for it financial flexibility is a great thing and having that monthly nut all your minimum living expenses combined as low as possible contributes greatly to that flexibility   update another thing to consider another thing to consider is what they do with your extra payment will they apply it to the principal or will they treat it as a prepayment if they apply it to principal it 'll be just like if you had that shorter term your principal goes down additionally by that extra amount and the next month you owe another $ 400   on the other hand if they treat it as a prepayment then that extra $ 130 will be applied to the next month 's bill principal stays the same and the next month you 'll be billed $ 270    there are two practical differences for you   1 with prepayment you 'll pay slightly more interest over that 60 months paying it off because it 's not amortized into the loan the principal balance does n't go down faster while the loan exists and since interest is calculated on the remaining principal balance end result is more interest than you otherwise would have paid that sucks but   2 with the prepayment consider that at the end of year 2 you 'd have over 7 months of payments prepaid so if some emergency does come up you do n't have to send them any money at all for 7 months there 's that flexibility again   honestly while this is something you should find out about the loan it 's really still a wash i have n't done the math but with the interest rate amount of the loan and time frame i think the extra interest would be pretty minor

my opinion is that 50 savings is the number to shoot for and i strive toward that number as often as possible   10 savings for retirement 10 savings for short term emergency fund 25 payment on mortgage principal 5 savings for planned big purchases i overpay the principal so that 25 of my income goes to principal payments and i separately account for the mortgage interest home owners insurance as another expense in my budget   because of this aggressive payment schedule the house i bought 2 years ago will be payed in full in another 9 years   i own another property outright that i paid down in the same fashion and i collect rent on it as a supplement to my income   i started with a small townhouse that i could easily afford but now i have a much larger home that i can still easily afford the emergency fund does n't need to be more than 6 months of expenses which is 3 months of income if your expenses are only 50 of your income   i keep 6 months of expenses liquid and another 12 in a low risk investment   once you have your emergency fund funded you can add that percentage to a different category say 15 to retirement and 10 to planned big purchases or you can over fund it   i have had a few catastrophes that have depleted that fund so i like having the extra 12 months of income available i set the last 5 aside for wants that are not regular expenses   if i want a car i save 5 of my income until i can pay cash for it   i have an infinite number of these wants so i prioritize them and buy them in order when the cash becomes available the reason i use percentages is to keep me focused when my income increases instead of spending all the additional money that i could afford to spend each time i get a raise i instead only increase my expenses to the 50 mark   it was much harder to save 50 when i got my first job out of college but now i live quite comfortably on that percentage and i could take a large hit to my income before i would need to make significant changes to my lifestyle
