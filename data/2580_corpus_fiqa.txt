the bobs tend to show up at the top of bubbles then disappear soon after for example your next door neighbor who talks about oracle in 1999 even though he does n't know what oracle does for a living i do n't think the bobs assets represent a large chunk of the market 's value   a better analogy would be a spectrum of characters each with different time horizons everyone from the high frequency trader to the investor who buys and holds until death

actually this is a pretty good analogy to certain types of stocks specifically tech and other fad stocks around the turn of the century there were a lot of bobs buying tech stocks like they would baseball cards for tech stocks that 's what drove the internet and tech stock bubbles of high valuations at other times the tech stocks are bought and sold mainly by steve 's for business reasons such as likely not merely possible future appreciation and command a much lower valuation

baseball cards do n't pay dividends but many profitable companies do just that and those that do n't could some day profits dividends is where your analogy falls apart   but let 's take it further   consider if baseball cards could somehow yield a regular stream of income just for owning them then there might be yet another group of people call them the   these i know are the kind of people that would like to own baseball cards over the long term just for their income producing capability   would seek out the cards with the best chance of producing and growing a reliable income stream   they would n't necessarily care about being able to flip a card at an inflated price to a bob but they might take advantage of inflated prices once in a while heck even some of the would enjoy this income while they waited for the eventual capital gain made by selling to a bob at a higher price   plus the could also sell their cards to not just bobs   would be willing to pay more for a card based on its income stream how reliable it is how high it is how fast it grows and where it is relative to market interest rates   a card with a good income stream might even have more value to a dave than to a bob because a dave does n't care as much about the popularity of the player addendum regarding your comment i suppose i 'm still struggling with the best way to present my    question i understand that companies differ in this aspect in that    they produce value but if stockholders can not simply claim a    percentage of a company 's value equal to their share then the fact    that companies produce value seems irrelevant to the bobs you 're right stockholders ca n't simply claim their percentage of a company 's assets rather shareholders vote in a board of directors   the board of directors can decide whether or not to issue dividends or buy back shares each of which puts money back in your pocket   a board could even decide to dissolve the company and distribute the net assets after paying debts and dissolution costs to the shareholders but this is seldom done because there 's often more profit in remaining a going concern i think perhaps what you are getting hung up on is the idea that a small shareholder ca n't command the company to give net assets in exchange for shares   instead generally speaking a company runs somewhat like a democracy but it 's each share that gets a vote not each shareholder since you ca n't redeem your shares back to the company on demand there exists a secondary market the stock market where somebody else is willing to take over your investment based on what they perceive the value of your shares to be and that market value is often different from the underlying book value per share

personally i would advise only buying what you can afford without borrowing money even if it means living in a tent financially that is the best move if you are determined to borrow money to buy a house the person with income should buy it as sole owner split ownership will create a nightmare if any problems develop in the relationship split ownership has the advantage that it doubles the tax free appreciation deduction from $ 250,000 to $ 500,000 but in your case my sense is that that is not a sufficient reason to risk dual ownership do not charge your partner rent that is crazy

it is barely possible that this is citi 's fault but it sounds more like it is on the costco end    the way that this is supposed to work is that they your card for the necessary amount   that reserves the payment removing the money from your credit line   on delivery they are supposed to capture the preauthorization   that causes the money to transfer to them   until that point they 've reserved your payment but not actually received it   if you cancel then they do n't have to pay processing fees    the capture should allow for a larger sale so as to provide for tips and unanticipated taxes and fees    in this case instead of capturing the preauthorization they seem to have simply generated a new transaction   citi could be doing something wrong and processing the capture incorrectly   or costco could be doing a purchase when they should be doing a capture   from outside we ca n't really say    the thirty days would seem to be how long costco can schedule in advance   so the preauthorization can last that long for them    costco should also have the ability to cancel a preauthorization   however they may not know how to trigger that   with smaller merchants they usually have an interface where they can view and capture or cancel them   costco may have those messages sent automatically from their system    note that a common use for this pattern is with things like gasoline or delivery purchases   if this has been citi costco both times i 'd try ordering a pizza or some other delivery food and see if they do it correctly   if it was citi both times and a different merchant the other time then it 's probably a citi problem rather than a merchant problem

why is the stock trading at only $ 5 per share the share price is the perceived value of the company by people buying and selling the stock not the actual value of the company and all its assets generally if the company is not doing well there is a perceived risk that it will burn out the money fast there is a difference between its signed conditional sale and will get money and has got money so in short it 's trading at $ 5 a share because the market does n't feel like it 's worth $ 12 per share quite a few believe there could be issues faced i.e. it may not make the $ 12 or there will be additional obligations i.e. employees may demand more layoff compensation etc or the distribution may take few years due to regulatory and legal hurdles the only problem is the stock exchange states if the company has no core business the stock will be suspended soon hopefully they can release the $ 12 per share first what will happen if i hold shares in the company the stock gets suspended and its sitting on $ 12 per share can it still distribute it out every country and stock markets have laid out procedures for de listing a company and closing a company the company can give $ 10 as say dividends and remaining later or as part of the closure process the company will distribute the balance among shareholders this would be a long drawn process

how is the business organized if as a general partnership or llc that reports as a partnership you will be getting distributed to you each year your ownership of the earnings or loss but note this is a paperwork transfer on the form k-1 which must then carryover to your tax return it does not require the transfer of cash to you if organized as an s corp you should be holding shares of the company that you may sell back to the s corp generally as outlined in the original articles of incorporation the annual dividend earnings remaining after all expenses are paid should be distributed to you in proportion to the shares you hold if a c corp and there is only one class of stock that you also hold a percentage of the only profits that must be distributed proportionally to you are declared dividends by the board of directors most family run business are loosely formed with not much attention paid to the details of partnership agreements or articles of incorporation and so do n't handle family ownership disputes very well from my experience trying to find an settlement is the best and least expensive approach to separation from the business but if this ca n't be done or there is a sizable value to the business you may have to get your own legal counsel

unfortunately you are required but most states do have agreements with neighboring states that let the states share the collected taxes without the person having to pay double taxes so being as this is your first tax return in your current situation you might be wise to have a professional fill it out for you this year and then next year you can use it as a template additionally i really would like to see someone challenge this across state lines taxation in court it sure seems to me that it is a inter state tariff duty which the state 's are expressly forbidden from doing in the constitution

for one the startup does n't exist yet so until march i will get nothing on hand though i have enough reserves to bridge that time i would not take this deal unless the start up exists in some form   if it 's just not yet profitable then there 's a risk reward to consider   if it does n't exist at all then it can not make a legal obligation to you and it 's not worth taking the deal yet   if everything else is an acceptable risk to you then you should be asking the other party to create the company and formalize the agreement with you as regards reserves if you 're really getting paid in shares instead of cash then you may need them later   shares in a start up likely are not easy to sell if you 're allowed to sell them at all so it may be a while before a paycheck given what you 've described for a second who pays the tax this is my first non university job so i do n't exactly know but usually the employer has to does pay my taxes and some other stuff from my income that 's what i understood if = where is the tax this i can not answer for germany   in the u.s. it would depend in part on how the company is organized   it 's likely that some or all of the tax will be deferred until you monetize your shares but you should get some professional advice on that before you move forward   as an example it 's likely that you 'd get taxed in part or in whole on what we 'd call capital gains maybe in german that would only be assessed when you sell the shares for third shares are a risk if i or any other in the startup screw really my pay might be a lot less than expected of course if it works out i 'm this is the inherent risk of a start up so there 's no getting around the fact that there 's a chance that the business may fail and your shares become worthless   up to you if you think the risk is acceptable   where you can mitigate risk is in ensuring that there 's a well written and enforceable set of documents that define what rights go with the shares who controls the company how profits will be distributed etc   do n't do this by spoken agreement only   get it all written down and then get it checked by a lawyer representing your interests

damn helpful harry above me    so in general when compounding the value of an investment if you 're seeing an annualized interest rate of 4 and the interest compounds monthly or n number of times per year you 're going to multiply the principal p by the growth rate the interest rate adjusted for the number of periods that your investment grows in a year = p 1 + t where n = number of periods and t = number of years if the interest compounds annually you earn p if it compounds monthly you earn 1 + 1    apply this logic to discounting future cash flows to their net present value when discounting future cash flows you 're essentially the opportunity cost of now being unable to put your investment elsewhere and earning that corresponding interest discount rate    thus you would discount $ 1000 by 1 + and $ 2000 $ 3000 in a similar fashion then as icing on the cake sum up to get your cumulative net present value   please let me know if any portion of my explanation is unclear i would be happy to elaborate

the short answer zero 's answer gives some good reasons why   you will basically never be able to achieve diversification with individual stocks that is anywhere close to what you can get with mutual funds   owning individual stocks exposes you to much greater risk in that random one off events that happen to affect one of the companies you own can have a disproportionate effect on your assets   for instance some sort of scandal involving a particular company can cause its stock to tank there are only two reasons i can see to invest in individual stocks a. you have some unique opportunity to acquire stock that other people might not be able to get or get at that price   this can be the case if you work for a privately held company that allows you to buy stock or options or allows you to participate in its ipo   even then you should not go too crazy since having too much stock in the company you work for can double your pain if the company falls on hard times you may lose your job and your investment b. for fun   if you like tracking stocks and trying to beat the market you may want to test your skills at this by using a small proportion of your investable cash no more than 10   in this case you 're not so much hoping to increase your returns as to just enjoy investing more   this can also have a psychological benefit in that it allows you to blow off steam and indulge your desire to make decisions while allowing your passive investments index funds to shoulder the load of actually gaining value

well you wo n't be double taxed based on what you described partners are taxed on income typically distributions your gain in the partnership is not income however you were essentially given some money which you elected to invest in the partnership so you need to pay tax on that money the question becomes are you being double taxed in another way your question does n't explain how you invested but pretty much the options are either a payroll deduction some amount taken out of x paychecks or a bonus or some other payment to you that was not treated as a payroll deduction given that you got a 1099 that suggests the latter however if the money was taken out as a payroll deduction you 've already paid taxes via your w2 so i 'd double check on that regarding why the numbers do n't exactly match up your shares in the partnership likely transacted before the partnership valuation let 's illustrate with an example say the partnership is currently worth $ 1000 with 100 outstanding shares you put up $ 1000 and get 100 shares partnership is now worth $ 2000 with 200 outstanding shares however after a good year for the firm it 's valuation sets the firm 's worth at $ 3000 your gain is $ 1500 not $ 1000 you can also see if what happened was the firm 's valuation went down your gain would be less than your initial investment if instead your shares transacted immediately after the valuation then your gain and your cost to acquire the shares would be the same so again i 'd suggest double checking on this if your shares transacted after the valuation there needs to be an explanation for the difference in your gain for reference and here you learn the purpose of the gain boxes on your k1 tracking your capital basis should the partnership sell essentially when the partnership is sold you as a partner get some money that money is then taxed how much you pay will depend on what you received versus what the company was worth and whether your gain was long term or short term this link does n't go into that detail but should give you a thread to pull i 'd also suggest reading more about partnerships and k1 and not just the irs publications do n't get me wrong they 're a good source of information just also dense and sometimes tough to understand good luck and congrats

congrats to your gf   how much depends a lot on how stable her income tends to be if she has stable salary $ 20 k plus $ k in contract work then having a larger ef is important if she has a consistent track record of pulling in $ 35 k each year with contract work then she may still need a somewhat higher emergency fund to tide her over between gigs   the rule of thumb is at least 3 months expenses before you start investing for better returns if she is reliant on contract work then holding up to 6 months expenses could be wise just in case she hits a slow patch with work   after that emergency fund is covered she can look at investment opportunities with varying levels of risk return   i would also recommend putting it down in writing why she 's investing saving is she saving up for an awesome vacation maybe that 's why she really is so far above a normal ef does she want a new car maybe there 's not really so much to spare bottom line assuming her monthly expenses are around $ 2 k per month she might have $ 4,000 to $ 5,000 that she could look to start investing safely

but in the debt payoff first scenario i 'd be wiping out my debt in    two years it would take several more years if i were to just pay the    minimums and put the extra money toward investing instead right the idea is that in 2 years you are likely to have more in the savings stock account than you owe on the loan but the range of returns for x years has a smaller standard deviation the greater x is e.g. any year has about a 1 in 3 chance of being negative a 10 year period had a negative return -1 cagr in the recently but the 15 year return even around that decade would have been successful jan 1 96 dec 31 2010 returned cagr jan 1 2001 dec 31 2015 returned cagr   this tells you that the time frame is as important as your sleep factor your 2 years i 'd just kill the loans a 10 15 year horizon i 'd ask how you feel about that debt the cost of going after a potential higher return may not be worth the risk to many for some it 's fine i retired with a mortgage still in place but the money in my 401(k that could have paid off the mortgage is now about twice the remaining balance so i sleep like a baby   in the end i 'm a fan of investing for the long term vs paying off low rate debt but it 's a choice based on the individual

while i 'm sure there 's some truth to the argument that unsophisticated retail investors index against the s&amp;p 500 thinking that they 're tracking the market i do n't think it makes sense to steer the s&amp;p 500 in that direction to cater to that lowest common denominator the ad conclusion of that course of action of course would be to abolish the s&amp;p 500 entirely and move those assets into the s&amp;p total market index but clearly there 's value in having an index that tracks us large caps with single share classes just as there 's value in having an index that tracks us large caps in general   as for whether it will be a loss for passive investors it will be interesting to see how that pans out maybe good corporate governance and direct accountability by managers really do contribute positively to returns in the long run and investors will benefit from this change as a result or maybe this will result in companies with multiple share classes being undervalued and create an opportunity to earn outsized returns by investing in them and indexes that omit those companies will underperform only time will tell

your question is unclear about whether you are moving from bi weekly payments or to bi weekly payments let 's calculate each case bi weekly pay means you will be paid every two weeks the amount for each payment will be your annual salary divided by 26 possibly with a small decrease around 0.3 to account for the fact that years are slightly longer than 52 weeks i.e. there are slightly more than 26 two week periods in a year and possibly an even smaller adjustment to take account of the fact that some years are a day longer than that you will be paid literally every 14 days with some adjustments if a payday falls on a holiday if you are going to be paid twice a month then each payment will be your annual salary divided by 24 typically you are paid on the same days of each month for example the 1st and the or the last business day before those

to understand the answer we first have to understand what goodwill is goodwill in a companies balance sheet is an intangible asset that represents the extra value because of a strong brand name good customer relations good employee relations and any patents or proprietary technology an article from the economist explains this very well and actually talks about time warner directly the goodwill the bad and the ugly when one firm buys another the target ’s goodwill essentially the    premium paid over its book value is added to the combined entity ’s    balance sheet goodwill and other intangibles on the books of    companies in the s&p 500 are valued at $ 2.6 trillion or 10 of their    total assets according to analysts at goldman sachs as the economy and more firms trade down towards or even    below their book value empire builders are having to mark down the    value of assets they out on in times a recently    announced $ 25 billion goodwill charge is expected to push time warner    into an operating loss for 2008 for instance michael of    goldman sachs thinks such hits could amount to $ 200 billion or more    over the cycle investors have so far paid little attention to    intangibles but as write downs they are likely to become    increasingly wary of industries with a high ratio of goodwill to    assets such as health care consumer goods and telecoms how bad things get will depend on the american firms    used to be allowed to goodwill over many years since 2002    when an accounting rule change ended that practice goodwill has had    to be tested every year for impairment in this environment    with auditors than ever to avoid being seen to go easy on    clients companies are being told to mark down assets if there is any    doubt about their value the point out that this has no effect on cashflow since such    charges are non cash items moreover some investors take goodwill    write offs with a pinch of salt preferring to look past such    non recurring costs and accept the higher earnings    numbers to which managers understandably cling the largest companies    are thus able to survive blows that might otherwise floor    them such as the $ 99 billion loss that the newly formed but    ill conceived aol time warner as it then was reported for 2002 but    the impact can be all too real as write downs reduce overall book    value and increase leverage ratios a particular concern in these    debt averse times

this may vary some by the state but the general facts are consistent broadly the elements of check fraud typically are this means that not only do you have to have presented a check that is returned for insufficient funds but you must have known at the time that it would n't be honored    it must typically also be given for present consideration which is why the comments to the other answer correctly note that the post dated check scam cooked up by the payday loan folks should n't generally be relevant under these laws on the same site they note the cases that are clearly not present consideration so if i give you a check for $ 50 and it 's returned for nsf because i screwed up my bank accounts and had all my money in savings that 's probably not fraud   but if i decide i really want a tesla x and give tesla motors a check for $ 95,000 knowing i do n't have $ 95,000 that 's fraud how the prosecutor proves knowledge is probably beyond the scope of personal finance and money stack exchange though i imagine it tends to commonly be done so by showing the person does n't normally have that much money in their account

it sounds like you really want to support trump   i had a boss who said people make decisions emotionally and justify then logically   i get where you 're coming from   he 's on your side so you want to defend him   it probably does n't make sense to give you any more facts if you 're just going to find the reason to dismiss them   i believe that the sky is blue the grass is green and don jr admitted to attempting to collude with the russians which is illegal   maybe he actually succeeded maybe he did n't but there 's no question that he tried   that 's enough for an investigation and based upon results could justify jail time   so i really do n't like trump   let me take a moment to explain my emotions   i think he 's super dishonest   i think he 's xenophobic   immigrants are good people and contribute positively to society   nearly everyone is an immigrant once you go back far enough   i think he 's a racist   it 's ugly and good people should oppose this sort of hate   you learn this when you 're little   when he lies the things he says are obviously inconsistent   it 's insulting that he thinks we 'd believe his stupid statements    it me that 38 of america still believes his stupid stuff   i do n't know whether they 're too simple to see his dishonesty do n't really care that he 's dishonest or are too to have noticed   i do n't think our democracy lasts another generation in its current form   i think he 's corrupt and is enriching himself and his family allies with his office   he 's the first president without a blind trust   i think he does real damage to worthwhile endeavors or tries to renewable energy global alliances race relations pollution controls social safety net civility and others   i 'm disappointed that the republicans have n't called him out   politics and self interest seems to outweigh integrity congress is the check on his power   i think he 's lazy and spends too much time on vacation   he 's also inconsistent for criticizing obama for golfing too much and then he more once in office   i 'm torn about his incompetence on policy   i should probably be happy he 's around unable to pass any significant law   i just hate to see the

in 2012 the standard deduction is $ for a single person   let 's assume you are very charitable and by coincidence you donate exactly $ to charity   everything that falls under itemized deductions would then be deductible   so if your property tax is $ 6000 in your example other adjustments come into play including an exemption of $ i am just showing the effect of the property tax   the bottom line is that deductions come off income not off your tax bill the saving from a deduction is $ $ x your tax bracket

when you contribute to a 401k you get to invest pre tax money that means part of it e.g. 25 is money you would otherwise have to pay in taxes deferred money and the rest e.g. 75 is money you could otherwise invest base money   growth in the 401k is essentially tax free because the taxes on the growth of the base money are paid for   by the growth in the deferred portion   that is of course assuming the same marginal tax rate both now and when you withdraw the money if your marginal tax rate is lower in retirement than it is now you would save even more money using a traditional 401k or ira an alternative is to invest in a roth account 401k or ira in which case the money goes in after tax and the growth is untaxed   this would be advantageous if you expect to have a higher marginal tax rate during retirement moreover it reduces tax risk which could give you peace of mind considering u.s marginal tax rates were over 90 in the 1940 's a roth could also be advantageous if you hit the contribution limits since the contributions are after tax and therefore more valuable lastly contributions to a roth account can be withdrawn at any time tax and penalty free however the growth in a roth account is basically stuck there until you turn 60 unlike a traditional ira/401k where you can take early retirement with a plan another alternative is to invest the money in a normal taxed account   the advantage of this approach is that the money is available to you whenever you need it rather than waiting until you retire   also investment losses can be deducted from earned income e.g. 15 25 while gains can be taxed at the long term capital gains rate e.g. 0 15 the upshot being that even if you make money over the course of several years you can actually realize negative taxes by taking gains and losses in different tax years finally when you decide to retire you might end up paying 0 taxes on your long term capital gains if your income is low enough currently for a single person the biggest limitation of this strategy is that losses are limited to per year also this strategy works best when you invest in individual stocks rather than mutual funds increasing volatility aka risk lastly this makes filing your taxes more complicated since you need to report every purchase and sale and watch out for the wash sale rules side note you should contribute enough to get all the 401k matching your employer offers   even if you cash out the whole account when you want the money the matching typically should exceed the 10 early withdrawal penalty

primarily because they do n't want big price movements when they are in the market if they the markets either they have to buy at a higher price or they sell at a lower price or they decrease the price of their is n't always a big factor the 3 situations they did n't want to be in the first place and the most important thing is most analysts are dumb whom you should ignore they tout because they want to increase their exposure in your eyes so that they may land a job in one of those big investment companies or they might be holding stocks and want to profit from it frankly speaking if you take advice from the so called analysts be prepared to say goodbye to your money some day may n't be always one near case maybe carson block from muddy waters but he does his homework properly

1 medicare part d is not trump fault for at least the last 8 years trump wants the national health care system to work cheaper and better but still you have to be against trump despite him yet to do anything about this and not able to do anything because of democrats and some republicans   2 global warming is the exact same thing not trump fault the paris accords are not fair to the usa so that 's the end of them trump is not against anything that reduce pollution and emissions   i see who i have to deal here with you are true member and of the church of   and you just did the work yourself to prove what i just said   you have any idea what will happen in the world 20 30 years from now when we stop raising cows pigs goats and sheep   gt that would be great but that wo n't be enough to stop global warming it is also may never come to pass so it is a bad idea to do nothing today expecting technology to fix our problem tomorrow   so on one hand you say technology will not stop global warming and on the other hand you want to use technology to stop global warming   make up your mind   if global warming is man made then technology caused it and technology will solve it   gt president trump should be implementing a plan and taking steps to minimize the damage in the future instead he is ignoring the problem and rolling back what few preparations obama made   you just made it up trump is against stopping pollution and emissions or again you just concentrate on the terrible paris accords rejected by trump

to me the simple answer might be to tap the equity in the $ 400k home you owe $ on and use the proceeds to purchase the new retirement home even if you were to do that you 'd still have almost $ 100k in untapped equity in the existing home no mortgage on the retirement home nothing out of pocket other than refi fees and probably no more of a mortgage payment than you already have on the house with equity   i do n't see any reason why the bank would n't go for that especially if you 've got a good payment history on your existing mortgage i hope this helps good luck

i used to work for one of the three ratings agencies awhile ago first there are lots of different ratings the bulk of ratings are for corporate debt and public finance so senior debentures fixed income and general obligations e.g. tax free muni bonds respectively ratings agencies are not paid by the investment banks they are paid by the corporations   or state that is issuing debt the investment banks are the syndicate that pulls the transaction together and brings it to market   for mortgage backed securities collateralized debt cdo clo 's all of which are fancy structured securitizations well that is a different matter those   transactions are the ones where there is an close tie between the investment bankers and ratings agencies and those were the ratings that blew out and caused problems   ratings agencies continued to do a decent job with what was their traditional business corporate and municipal bond ratings as far as i know    what said was 100 correct s&amp;p 's fees were paid by investors the people who were purchasing the bonds until about 50 years ago around the same time that hill purchased s&amp;p in 1966 they from that model and started charging the bond issuers for ratings i do n't know if that decision was driven by hill or not though   one more thing not all credit ratings agencies are paid by the issuers one of the 10 's a designation given by the is jones their revenue comes from the investors bond purchasers not the companies issuing bonds unlike the moody 's business model so there is an alternative which i consider hopeful and reason not to totally despair   edit what mentions is also totally accurate the part about roubini who is a professor at or columbia or such and a sensible though slightly high sort is consistent with my impression as for whether it would require government action to implement the changes advocated by roubini yes i guess it would but i do n't know if the government would do that it would be better if the credit ratings agencies would find their own way to a different less conflicted payment incentive model   keep in mind too that many of the provisions of dodd frank have removed the existing regulatory requirements for credit ratings on bonds and other securities this is the scary part though there is n't anything to replace the credit ratings agencies not at the moment as far as i can tell eventually the government is supposed to come up with an alternative but that has n't happened yet which is better not requiring ratings at all or the past situation of sometimes inflated ratings which a false sense of confidence i do n't know

inflation refers to the money supply think of all money being air in a balloon inflation is what happens when you blow more air in the balloon deflation is what happens when you let air escape inflation may cause prices to go up however there are many scenarios possible in which this does not happen for example at the same time of inflation there might be unemployment making consumers unable to pay higher prices or some important resource oil may go down in price due to political reasons war has ended etc compensating for the money having less value   similarly peoples wages will tend to rise over time they have to otherwise everyone would be earning less due to inflation however again there are many scenarios in which wages do not keep up with inflation or rise much faster in fact over the past 40 years or so us wages have not been able to keep up with inflation making the average worker poorer than 40 years ago at its core inflation refers to the value of the money itself as all values of other products services assets etc are expressed in terms of money which itself also changes value this can quickly become very complex most countries calculate inflation by averaging the price change of a basket of goods that are supposed to represent the average joe 's spending pattern however these methods are often criticized as they would be hiding inflation the hidden inflation may come back later to bite us

it seems to me that oil will never again reach or exceed $ 100 a barrel   the rate at which we are abandoning fossil fuels means we will never ever run out of the stuff demand will continue to decrease and electric cars will be the first cars that are owned by the people in emerging markets in the next decade   and in a decade from now 90 of all new cars will be purely electric   beyond that fusion research on multiple fronts but not   that will never ever produce a plan for a viable power station points to total destruction of coal and gas as a fuel for power stations and when they come online you do n't even need to build new power stations all you do is build banks of reactors in the car park hook up the steam pipes to the new reactors and then the old furnaces job done

17.5 thousand miles year is pretty high mileage   you could find an accord or civic of comparable age with much lower mileage than that and it would n't be a stretch for someone even with your limited credit history to get a loan on an old car like that   you might try to have your parents cosign on a loan depending on their financial circumstances   that 's how i bought my first car 13 years ago the biggest surprise you might want to consider is the cost of full collision auto coverage which will be required by whatever bank you finance through   get quotes for that before signing any papers   i spent $ 2000 more on a motorcycle because the more powerful one cost $ 2000 less year to insure just a few years after i bought that first car   speaking of which another thing to consider given the nice la weather is a motorcycle   the total cost of ownership is much lower than a car   you will probably not want to pursue that option if you do not have medical insurance and you may not want to anyway

the issue is that the lender used two peoples income debts and credit history to loan both of you money to purchase a house the only way to get a person off the loan is to get a new loan via refinancing the new loan will then be based on the income debt and credit history of one person there is no paperwork you can sign or the ex spouse can sign that will force the original lender to remove somebody from the loan there is one way that a exchange of money between the two of you could work the ex spouse will have to sign paperwork to prove that it is not a loan that you will have to payback i picked the number 20 k for a reason if the amount of the payment is above 14 k they will have to document for the irs that this is a gift and the amount above 14 k will be counted as part of their estate when they die if the amount of the payment is less than 14 k they do n't even have to tell the irs if the ex has or you have the multiple payments can be constructed to exceed the 14 k limit

not exactly there are a few ways to manage your taxes with investments 1 for most investments you get taxed on any gain in value in the investment or dividends paid by that investment most investments with some exceptions for mutual funds you do n't take the tax hit until you sell the investment and realize the gain for bonds cds and other cash type investments you have to pay taxes in the year they pay out the interest or dividend 2 you can put money up to a certain limit in a traditional ira and can subtract that amount from your income for tax calculation for the year you invest it however you are going to pay taxes on it when you take the money out at retirement it really just delays the taxes 3 if you put the money in a roth ira you do n't get a tax break now but you do n't have to pay any taxes on the money or the gains when you take it out at retirement 4 the gains from some mutual funds can be tax exempt but that just saves you from paying tax on the increase in value   5 do n't fall for scams that try to use insurance policies as investments to avoid taxes the fees are which usually makes them a ripoff

putting the money in a bank savings account is a reasonably safe investment anything other than that will come with additional risk of various kinds that 's right not even a bank account is completely free of risk neither is withdrawing cash and storing it somewhere yourself and i do n't know which country you are from but you will certainly have access to your country 's government bonds and the likes you may also have access to mutual funds which invest in other countries government bonds bond or money market funds the question you need to ask yourself really is one for how long do you intend to keep the money invested shorter term investing should involve lower risk two what amount of risk specifically price volatility are you willing to accept the answers to those questions will determine which asset are appropriate in your particular case beyond that you need to make a personal call which asset do you believe are likely to do better or less bad than others low risk usually comes at the price of a lower return higher return usually involves taking more risk specifically price volatility in the investment vehicle but more risk does not necessarily guarantee a higher return you may also lose a large fraction of or even the entire capital amount in extreme cases leveraged investments you might even lose more than the capital amount gold may be a component of a well diversified portfolio but i certainly would not recommend putting all of one 's money in it the same goes for any asset class a portfolio composed exclusively of stocks is no more well diversified than a portfolio composed exclusively of precious metals or government bonds for some specifics about investing in precious metals you may want to see pros cons of investing in gold vs. platinum

when you invest in an s&p500 index fund that is priced in usd the only major risk you bear is the risk associated with the equity that comprises the index since both the equities and the index fund are priced in usd the fund in your question however is priced in eur for a fund like this to match the performance of the s&p500 which is priced in usd as closely as possible it needs to hedge against fluctuations in the eur usd exchange rate if the fund simply converted eur to usd then invested in an s&p500 index fund priced in usd the eur priced fund may fail to match the usd priced fund because of exchange rate fluctuations here is a simple example demonstrating why hedging is necessary i assumed the current value of the usd priced s&p500 index fund is 1,600 usd share the exchange rate is 1.3 usd eur if you purchase one share of this index using eur you would pay eur share   if the s&p500 increases 10 to usd share and the exchange rate remains unchanged the value of the your investment in the eur fund also increases by 10 both sides of the equation are multiplied by 1.1   however the currency risk comes into play when the eur usd exchange rate changes take the 10 increase in the price of the usd index occurring in tandem with an appreciation of the eur to 1.4 usd eur   although the usd priced index gained 10 the appreciation of the eur means that the eur value of your investment is almost unchanged from the first equation for investments priced in eur that invest in securities priced in usd the presence of this additional currency risk mandates the use of a hedge if the indexes are going to track the fund you linked to uses swap contracts which i discuss in detail below to hedge against fluctuations in the eur usd exchange rate since these derivatives are n't free the cost of the hedge is included in the expenses of the fund and may result in differences between the s&p500 index and the s&p 500 euro hedged index   also it 's important to realize that any time you invest in securities that are priced in a different currency than your own you take on currency risk whether or not the investments aim to track indexes this holds true even for securities that trade on an exchange in your local currency like adr 's or gdr 's i wrote an answer that goes through a simple example in a similar fashion to the one above in that context so you can read that for more information on currency risk in that context   there are several ways to investors be they institutional or individual can hedge against currency risk ishares offers an etf that tracks the s&p500 euro hedged index and uses a over the counter currency swap contract called a month forward fx contract to hedge against the associated currency risk in these contracts two parties agree to swap some amount of one currency for another amount of another currency at some time in the future this allows both parties to effectively lock in an exchange rate for a given time period a month in the case of the ishares etf and therefore protect themselves against exchange rate fluctuations in that period   there are other forms of currency swaps equity swaps etc that could be used to hedge against currency risk in general two parties agree to swap one quantity like a eur cash flow payments of a fixed interest rate etc for another quantity like a usd cash flow payments based on a floating interest rate etc in many cases these are over the counter transactions there is n't necessarily a standardized definition   for example if the european manager of a fund that tracks the s&p500 euro hedged index is holding euros and wants to lock in an effective exchange rate of 1.4 usd eur above the current exchange rate he may find another party that is holding usd and wants to lock in the respective exchange rate of eur usd the other party could be an american fund manager that manages a usd price fund that tracks the ftse by swapping usd and eur both parties can at a price lock in their desired exchange rates   i want to clear up something else in your question too it 's not correct that the s&p 500 is completely unrelated to the euro far from it there are many cases in which the eur usd exchange rate and the level of the s&p500 index could be related for example troublesome economic news in europe could cause the euro to depreciate against the dollar as european investors flee to safety e.g. invest in treasury bills however this economic news could also cause us investors to feel that the global economy wo n't recover as soon as hoped which could affect the s&p500   if the euro appreciated against the dollar for whatever reason this could increase profits for us businesses that earn part of their profits in europe if a us company earns 1 million eur and the exchange rate is 1.3 usd eur the company earns 1.3 million usd if the euro appreciates against the dollar to 1.4 usd eur in the next quarter and the company still earns 1 million eur they now earn 1.4 million usd even without additional sales the us company earned a higher usd profit which is reflected on their financial statements and could increase their share price thus affecting the s&p500 combining examples 1 and 2 if a us company earns some of its profits in europe and a recession hits in the eu two things could happen simultaneously a the company 's sales decline as european consumers scale back their spending and b the euro depreciates against the dollar as european investors sell euros and invest in safer securities denominated in other currencies usd or not the company suffers a loss in profits both from decreased sales and the depreciation of the eur   there are many more factors that could lead to correlation between the euro and the s&p500 or more generally the european and american economies the balance of trade investor and consumer confidence exposure of banks in one region to sovereign debt in another the spread of asset mortgage backed securities from us financial firms to european banks companies municipalities etc all play a role   one example of this last point comes from this article which includes an interesting line among the victims of america ’s subprime crisis are eight municipalities in norway which lost a total of $ 125 million through subprime mortgage related investments long story short these municipalities had mortgage backed securities in their investment portfolios that were derived from far down the line subprime mortgages on us homes i do n't know the specific cities but it really demonstrates how interconnected the world 's economies are when an american family 's payment on their subprime mortgage in say chicago can end up backing a derivative investment in the investment portfolio of say norway

i do n't know what country you live in or what the laws and practical circumstances of owning rental property there are but i own a rental property in the u.s. and i can tell you that there are a lot of headaches that go with it one maintenance you say you have to pay an annual fee of 2,400 for building maintenance does that cover all maintenance to the unit or only the exterior i mean here in the u.s. if you own a condo we call a unit like you describe a condo if you rent it it 's an apartment if you own it it 's a condo you typically pay an annual fee that cover maintenance from the walls out that is it covers maintenance to the exterior of the building the parking lot any common recreational areas like a swimming pool etc but it does n't cover interior maintenance if there 's a problem with interior wiring or plumbing or the carpet needs to be replaced or the place needs painting that 's up to you   with a rental unit those expenses can be substantial on my rental property sure most months the maintenance is zero things do n't break every month but if the furnace needs to be replaced or there 's a major plumbing problem it can cost thousands and you can get hit with lots of expenses while my place was vacant i turned the water heater down to save on utility expenses then a tenant moved in and complained that the water heater did n't work we sent a plumber out who quickly figured out that she did n't realize she had to turn the knob up then of course he had to hang around while the water heated up to make sure that was all it was it cost me umm i think $ 170 to have someone turn that knob but i probably saved over $ 15 on the gas bill by turning it down for the couple of months the place was empty two what happens when you get a bad tenant here in the u.s. theoretically you only have to give 3 days notice to evict a tenant who damages the property or fails to pay the rent but in practice they do n't leave then you have to go to court to get the police to throw them out when you contact the court they will schedule a hearing in a month or two if your case is clear cut like the tenant has n't paid the rent for two months or more you will win easily both times i 've had to do this the tenant did n't even bother to show up so i won by default so then you have a piece of paper saying the court orders them to leave you have to wait another month or two for the police to get around to actually going to the unit and ordering them out so say a tenant fails to pay the rent in real life you 're probably not going to evict someone for being a day or two late but let 's say you 're pretty hard about it and start eviction proceedings when they 're a month late there 's at least another two or three months before they 're actually going to be out of the place of course once you send them an eviction notice they 're not going to pay the rent any more so you have to go four five months with these people living in your property but not paying any rent on top of that some tenants do serious damage to the property it 's not theirs they do n't have much incentive to take care of it if you evict someone they may deliberately trash the place out of spite one tenant i had to evict did over $ 13,000 in damage so i 'm not saying do n't rent the place out what i am saying is be sure to include all your real costs in your calculation think of all the things that could go wrong as well as all the things that could go right

1- wells fargo does not own our current mortgage   they have bundled it and sold it as an investment 2- they make their money from servicing the loan   even if they only get $ 50 per month to service it 3 of our monthly payment that adds up to $ per month if they have a million homes under management   that is $ 600 million per year for each million homes being serviced 3- managing the escrow gets them additional profit because they can invest it and earn 2 3   if 1,000,000 homes have an average balance of $ 2,000 in their escrow accounts they can earn up to $ 60 per year or $ annually they make $ 1,000 every time they refinance the home   this is the approximate profit after paying real closing costs   refinance those million homes and you make a cool billion in profit 5- they also want to be sure that they keep us as a customer   by lowering our payment they decrease the likelyhood that we will refinance with someone else and we are less likely to default   not that they lose if we default because they do n't own the loan they make additional profit by paying off the old loan they do n't own it remember then packaging and selling the new mortgage   since they are selling it as a security they sell for future value meaning they sell our $ 200,000 loan for a valuation of $   this means that they sell for $ 200,000 plus some fraction of the additional $ 160,000   let 's say they only want a 10 premium of the $ valuation   that means they sell our $ 200,000 loan for $   they pocket $ 36,000   if they make a million of these transactions every year that is $ 36 billion dollars in profit so wells fargo refinances one million homes every year and they make $ initial profit for selling the loan with absolutely no risk plus $ for doing the loan $ annually to service the loan very little risk since it is being paid by the owner of the loan as a service fee if they can retain the loans for their entire life keep us from refinancing with someone else they can make $ that is billion dollars in servicing fees the profit they make in a refinance is much greater than the money then can make by holding the loan for 30 years

ach transfers are reversible and traceable so what 's stopping them is the ease and the speed with which they would be caught when you give a check you have to provide some information to the payee so that they could cash it you ca n't withhold the bank or the account number how would they charge you so it has to be on it and if it is on it it can be put on any other fake check that is why checks come also with your signature and are always available for you to inspect when they 're cashed if you notice something out of the ordinary check you did n't give ach transfer you did n't authorize on your statement it is your responsibility to notify the bank within x period of time 60 days i think of the statement and it will be dealt with so the best way to protect yourself would be to keep an eye on your account and verify that the transactions that you see are all authorized and do it frequently keeping large amounts of cash on your checking account is never a good idea regardless also since checks are inherently unsafe try to only give checks to people you trust and use bill pay or credit cards with anyone else

ebitda is in my opinion not a useful measure for an investor looking to buy shares on the stock market it is more useful for private businesses open to changing their structuring or looking to sell significant parts of their business one of the main benefits of reporting earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization is that it presents the company as it would look to a potential buyer consider that net income as a metric includes interest costs taxes and depreciation   interest costs are to put it simply a result of multiplying a business 's debt by its interest rate if you own a business and personally guarantee the loan that the company has with the bank your interest rates might be artificially low if you have a policy of reaching high debt levels relative to your equity in order to achieve high financial leveraging your interest cost might be artificially high either way if i bought your business my debt structure could be completely different and therefore your interest costs are not particularly relevant to me a potential buyer instead i should attempt to anticipate what my own interest costs would be under my plans for your business taxes are a result of many factors including the corporate structure of the business if you run your business as a sole proprietorship ie no corporation but i want to buy it under my corporation then my tax rates could look nothing like yours or if we operated in multiple jurisdictions etc etc instead of using your taxes as an estimate for mine i should anticipate my taxes based on my plans for your business depreciation amortization is a measure that estimates how much of a business 's fixed assets were used up during the year ie how much wear and tear occurred on your fleet of trucks it is generally calculated as a of your overall asset value it is a very loose proxy for the cash costs which will ultimately be incurred to make repairs replacements is also something which could significantly change if a business changes hands if the value of your building is much higher now than when you bought it i will have higher costs than you because i will be recording a of total costs higher than yours and therefore i should forecast my own removing these costs from net income is not particularly relevant for a casual stock investor because these costs will not change when you buy shares whatever ibm 's interest cost is reflects the debt structuring policy that the company currently has therefore when you buy a share in ibm you should consider the impact that interest has on net income similarly for taxes and they reflect costs to the business that impact the company 's ability to pay you a dividend and therefore you should look at net income which includes those costs why would a business with good net income and good ebitda report ebitda because ebitda will always be higher than net income why say $ 10 m net income when you could say $ 50 m ebitda the fact is it 's easy to report and is generally well understood so why not report it when it also makes you look better from a purely big number = good perspective i 'm not sure that reporting ebitda implies any sort of manipulative reporting but it would seem that warren buffet feels this is a risk

look at price book value and there are more than a few stocks that may have a p b under 1 so this does happen there are at least a couple of other factors you are n't considering here current liabilities how much money is the company losing each quarter that may cause it to sell repeatedly if the company is burning through $ 100 million quarter that asset is only going to keep the lights on for another 2.5 years so consider what assumptions you make about the company 's cash flow here the asset itself is the price really fixed or could it be flexible could the asset seen as being worth $ 1 billion today be worth much less in another year or two as an example suppose the asset was a building and then real estate values drop by 40 in that area now what was worth $ 1 billion may now be worth only $ 600 million as something of a final note you do n't state where the $ 100 million went that the company received as if that was burned for operations now the company 's position on the asset is $ 900 million as it only holds a 90 stake though i 'd argue my 2 previous points are really worth noting the following 6 stocks are trading at or below 0.5 x book value sep 2013 has a half dozen examples of how this is possible if the $ 100 million was used to pay off debt then the company does n't have that cash and thus its assets are reduced by the cash that is gone depending on what the plant is producing the value may or may not stay where it is if you want an example to consider how would you price automobile plants these days if the company experiences a reduction in demand the plant may have to be sold off at a reduced price for a cynic 's view here

honestly i would look for a house you can afford and one that is below the maximum amount of what they are willing to lend you   the reason is owning a house is not a quick loan that you can pay off in a year or two unless you 're rich then i would question why are you even bothering with a loan this is a long term commitment can you honestly say your job will provide the money for the mortgage the upkeep and remodeling of the house even if it 's the perfect house you will want to change something make the bathroom bigger put in a pool table etc etc living expenses and any life throws at you like most of us that answer will be no always have money and supplies for that rainy day for those lean days for that mortgage payment and if nothing happens you can always use the money to pay the mortgage off faster or take a vacation

i ’ll start with what worked for me to get me hooked this list is by no means exhaustive    one up on wall street by peter lynch discusses competitive advantages and staying close to the story of a business explores the concept of buy what you he has also written beating the   the ’s walk how randomness rules our lives by is not dissimilar to a random walk down wall street but i preferred this book as it explores the concepts of randomness and survivors bias    against the gods by peter bernstein is a dense book but in my opinion is the definitive text on the development of numbers probability theory and risk management i absolutely love this book    the most important thing by howard marks is immensely readable enjoyable and looks at value investing for the long run howard marks has been a macro behavioural investor before behavioural investing was a thing    speaking of behavioural biases thinking fast and slow by daniel kahneman is a spectacular look at how your brain ’s quick trigger responses can often be wrong   on the subject of behaviour and biases influence the psychology of persuasion by robert is another topic defining book   more books by long term veteran professional investment managers that should be enjoyed the little book that still beats the market by joel greenblatt beat the crowd by ken fisher big money thinks small by joel common stocks and uncommon profits by philip a. fisher the little book of behavioural investing by james margin of safety by seth klarman   and i ’ll be banned from this forum without mentioning the intelligent investor by benjamin graham     as per some other comments my personal opinion is that books that describe events or periods of time like poker 80s junk bonds the big short financial crisis when genius failed the ltcm collapse excellent read by rogers all the devils are here by and another financial crisis book much better than lewis ’s imo are all educational and quite entertaining but do n’t honestly have much to do with the actual nuts and bolts of the real financial industry    enjoy

the attempts to link asset prices equity risk premiums to the substitution of consumption instead of the normal beta so essentially what it 's trying to say is you prefer to smooth consumption you hate volatile consumption patterns therefore you demand higher returns in booms and will settle for lower returns in downturns it may sound counter intuitive at first but think in terms of marginal utilities in booms your marginal utility is lower as you 're already well off therefore you demand more of an asset    the tries to link asset prices to real economic theory consumption whereas capm is derived from the assumption that investors only care about mean and variance of returns no real link to the real side of the economy    there are almost no real world applications for the empirically it is almost a complete failure complex extensions have only gotten it so far see the equity premium puzzle by and 1985

the advice above is generally good but the one catch i have n't seen addressed is which specific laws apply   you said that you are in arkansas but the dealer is in texas   this means that the laws of at least two different states are in play possibly three if the contract contains a clause stating that disputes will be handled in a certain jurisdiction and you are going to have to do some research to figure out what actually applies    one thing that may significantly impact this issue is whether you were in tx or ar when you signed the contracts   if you borrowed the money in tx and the lender is in tx then it is almost certain that the laws of texas will govern   however if you were living in ar at the time you acquired the loan particularly if you were in ar when you signed the papers you have a decent case for claiming that the laws of arkansas govern   i do n't know enough about either state to know if one is more favorable to the consumer than the other but it is a question you really want to have answered   that said i would be shocked if any state did not have provisions requiring the lender to provide a copy of the terms and a detailed statement of the account and transaction history upon request   spend some time on the web site of the texas attorney general and/or because that is where the lender is they are more likely to respect texas law to see if you can track down any specific laws or codes that you can reference   you might also look into the federal consumer protection laws though i ca n't think of one off hand that would apply in the scenario you have described    then work on putting together a letter asking them to provide a copy of the contract and a full history of the account   as others noted make sure you send it certified return receipt or better yet use a private carrier such as fedex and check the box about requiring a signature above all you need to get the dialog transferred to a written form   i can not stress this point enough   everything you tell them or ask for from here out needs to be done in a written format   if they call you about anything tell them you want to see their issue offer in writing before you will consider it you do not necessarily need a lawyer to do any of this but you do need to know the applicable laws   do the research to know what your legal standing is   involve a lawyer if you feel you need to but i have successfully several large utility companies and collection agencies into behaving without needing one

rent does n't give you any ownership in a property so is largely irrelevant here if you were paying rent after the death of your parents that money would go to the owners of the house which may include you similarly whether or not someone was evicted is completely irrelevant if the will specifies how the estate should be divided that 's what 's relevant here you seem to imply that the house was left to 10 people barring specific other arrangements the most likely case is that the house will be sold by the and the proceeds divided evenly between all ten people again though it 's going to depend on the specifics of the will there are many possible cases where you may end up with nothing for example if there are a lot of debts these must be paid off before dividing up the money from the sale of the house if you are not getting the answers you need from the you need to consult a lawyer

most directly and most likely it can hurt your credit score if you miss payments since it 's being reported regardless of whether or not it benefits you this is a risk for you but a benefit for landlords since it gives renters more incentive to actually make on time payments secondarily there 's a small risk that credit ladder or one of their partners makes a mistake and you have to spend some time correcting it they do seem to have reputable partners so it 's likely that mistakes can be corrected at the cost of through customer support finally it 's important to look at where they get their money   credit ladder charges directly for premium memberships it appears that those are basically a sort of group discount thing none of the benefits seem super awesome but the cost is low enough that i think it could be worth it for some people so that 's one way to make money risk here = this service does n't make enough money and they might phase out the free tier now source of money 2 your information according to this source within the privacy policy the company states that they may use the personal information collected about you to provide third parties with statistical information about our users but this information will not be used to identify any individual user it ’s not clear if this is the intended monetization of the company it is a consideration to the user that this information may be sold risk here = they might get hacked or they might sell your non identifying information there 's no details as to whether or not they are actually doing this but they have the right to do so if they got even 10 of the renters in uk using their service then this data would be quite valuable

here 's the issue with ltc and really underwritten insurance in general no one has a crystal ball    based on today 's available rates where 's the sweet spot to buy ltc probably right around the because you probably wo n't pay much in before you start gutting the carrier assuming you can make it through underwriting in your the issue is what happens when some life event changes your underwriting status   would you rather buy prematurely or be excluded entirely   those are generally your two options when it comes to individual ltc   the underwriting eligibility window on ltc is very   narrow   there 's a very very small space between the best possible underwriting and being declined    look for an ltc agent in your area   likely someone in your circle of friends and family will know a reputable knowledgeable insurance agent who can run up some quotes at various underwriting classes   try to avoid looking at quotes for your age + 10 years to see what the quote will look like 10 years from now   10 years from now the rate tables will be significantly different whether or not you should buy ltc now rather than waiting will depend on a whole host of other criteria   personally if i was 50 and my biggest health concern was improving my run time and ltc is on my mind i 'd just pick up a policy now while i will likely be in a preferred underwriting class rather than waiting and hoping my health does n't betray me obviously i 'm a stranger on the internet and none of this is actual advice   you should find an agent local to you and talk about your options and situation

i know this can be confusing because you tend to think of money being worth the face value so let 's eliminate that for the sake of an example that will be easier to understand let 's say your friend loaned you rock worth $ 10 today he expects you to pay him back an identical rock whenever you can now let 's also assume that historically the price of rocks tends to go down every year at some point you will need to buy a rock to pay your friend back because they keep getting cheaper it costs less to buy the payback rock the longer you wait replace a dollar with a rock in the example and you have your answer this is known as the time value of money in reality this is priced into the loan via the interest rate because the lender very much understands the math going on here also it is more complicated because the longer you delay payment the more interest you pay if you will so it does n't usually work to your advantage unless they underpriced the loan 's interest rate

a $ 1 note and four quarters are both real money but how and when they become real money is different the important thing is that the fed 's stockpile of cash that it gets from the bureau of engraving and printing is n't real money i.e. yet that cash is only used for fulfilling withdrawals from reserve accounts you ca n't use it to buy a car or a house or to pay janet yellen 's salary no one not even janet can use even a single dollar to buy a diet coke in other words it 's not really an asset or a liability or anything but a stack of paper in the fed 's vaults that looks astonishingly like money but is n't the upside to this is that when the makes a delivery of fresh bills to the fed or when the fed destroys old bills that are n't usable anymore the fed 's balance sheet does n't change that 's good those are practical considerations not financial ones the downside is that there 's nothing on the asset side of the sheet to explain how the fed 's liability to a bank is reduced when the bank makes a cash withdrawal from its reserve account so the fed balances it 's balance sheet by recording an increase in a different liability the cash in circulation kinda like transferring the balance on a credit card you 're paying down one liability by increasing another one it looks a bit silly but less silly than recording the destruction of old bills as an expense of the face value of the bills coins on the other hand become money as soon as the treasury gets them from the mint if they wanted to they could pay their employees salaries by ordering coins from the mint for cheap giving them to their employees at face value and reaping fat profits as a result in fact that 's pretty much exactly what they do when someone wants quarters the treasury mints them at less than face value and then sells them at face value in practice the fed does all of this buying and then distributes the coins according to demand the important thing is that this bunch of coins is not like the fed 's stockpile of bills it 's already real money and therefore shows up as an asset not much if the fed bought coins at the cheaper price from the mint instead them like they stockpile bills then distributed them as usual the extra profit just goes to the treasury anyway like all the fed 's profit does however as things are the fed 's purchases of coins are recorded on the fed 's balance sheet at face value which is kinda silly

i 'd suggest you put only 20 down if you qualify for the 80 amount of the mortgage live in the house a year and see what expenses really are then if your non accounts are still being funded to your liking start prepaying the mortgage if you wish   it 's great to start with a house that 's only 50 mortgaged but if any life change happens to you it may be tough to borrow it back far easier to just take your time and not make a decision you may regret you do n't give much detail about your retirement savings but i 'd suggest that i 'd rather have a large mortgage and fund my retirement accounts to the maximum than to have a paid house and start the retirement account at age 35 some choose that option

of course but that 's not relevant to my example let me clarify say you hold a highly appreciated $ 10 m position in aapl and you have good reason to believe the next iphone is going to be a flop causing the stock to decline 20 you can sell now to avoid the probable decline but by doing so you will be left with let 's say $ m after paying $ 3.33 m of state and federal ltcg taxes on the appreciation $ 9 m of the $ 10 m because you bought a long time ago   however by simply doing nothing and eating the 20 decline you 'll end up with $ 8 m instead of $   many economists would criticize the tax in this example as it has led to the investor rationally suffering a $ 2 m loss instead of reallocating all $ 10 m of his her capital to a more promising enterprise furthermore if when many investors act that way they can create inefficiency in the equity markets prices not declining by as much as they should to reflect a firm 's reduced prospects

you will be rolling over the proceeds since you can only deposit cash into an ira however this should probably not affect your considerations much since the pre rollover sale is non taxable within the 401k and the period of roll over itself when the cash is uninvested is relatively short so whatever investments you choose in your 401k you 'll just sell them and then buy them or similar investments back after the rollover to the ira if you 're worrying about a flash crash right on the day when you want to cash out that can definitely happen but it is not really something you can prepare for you can consider moving to money market several weeks before the potential date of your withdrawal if you think it will make you feel safer otherwise i do n't think it really matters

two more esoteric differences related to the same cause when you have an outstanding debit balance in a margin the broker may lend out your securities to short sellers   they may well be able to lend them out even if there 's no debit balance check your account agreement and relevant regulations    you 'll never know this there 's no indication in your account of it unless you ask and maybe not even then if the securities pay out dividends while lent out you do n't get the dividends directly   the dividends go to the person who bought them from the short seller   the short seller has to pay the dividend amount to his broker who pays them to your broker who pays them to you   if the dividends that were paid out by the security were qualified dividends 15 max rate the qualified goes to the person who bought the security from the short seller   what you received were n't dividends at all but a payment in lieu of dividends and qualified dividend treatment is n't available for them    some many   all brokers will pay you a gross up payment to compensate you for the extra tax you had to pay due to your qualified dividends on that security not actually being qualified a similar thing happens if there 's a shareholder vote   if the stock was lent out on the record date to establish voting eligibility the person eligible to vote is the person who bought them from the short seller not you   so if for some reason you really want need to vote in a shareholder vote call your broker and ask them to journal the shares in question over to the cash side of your account before the record date for determining voting eligibility

the ownership of the house depends on what the original deed transferring title at the time of purchase says and how this ownership is listed in government records where the title transfer deed is registered hopefully the   two records are consistent   in legal systems that from british common law including the us the two most common forms of ownership are tenancy in common meaning that unless otherwise specified in the title deed each of the owners has an equal share in the entire property and can sell or his her share without requiring the approval   of the others and joint tenancy with right of survivorship meaning   that all owners have equal share and if one owner   dies the survivors form a new spouses generally own property   especially the home in a special kind of called tenancy by the entirety on the other hand the rule is that unless explicitly specified otherwise tenancy in common with equal shares is how the owners hold the property other countries may have different default assumptions and/or have multiple other forms of ownership see e.g. here for the intricate rules applicable in india mortgages are a different issue most mortgages state that the are jointly and liable for the mortgage   payments meaning that the mortgage holder does not care who makes the payment but only that the mortgage payment is made in full if one owner refuses to pay his share the others can not send in their shares of the mortgage payment due and tell the bank to sue the co owner for his share of the payment everybody is liable and can be sued for the unpaid amount and if the bank forecloses everybody 's share in the property is seized not just the share owned by the person   it is of course possible to for different co owners to have separate mortgages for their individual shares but the legalities including questions such as whose lien is primary and whose secondary are complicated with regard to who paid what over the years of ownership it does not matter as far as the ownership is concerned if it is a tenancy in common with equal shares the fact that the various owners paid the bills mortgage payments property taxes repairs and maintenance in unequal amounts does not   change the ownership of the property unless a new deed is recorded with the new percentages   now the co owners may decide among themselves as a matter of fairness that any money realized from a sale of the property should be divided up in accordance with the proportion that each contributed during the ownership but that is a different issue if i were a buyer of property titled as tenancy in common i or the bank who is lending me money to make the purchase would issue separate checks to each co seller in proportion to the percentages listed on the deed of ownership and let them worry about whether they should transfer money among themselves to make it equitable careful here gift taxes might   well be due if large sums of money change hands

when you compare the costs of paying your current mortgage with the rental income from the flat you 're not really comparing like with like firstly the mortgage payments are covering both interest and capital repayments so some of the 8k is money that is adding to your net worth secondly the value of the flat 130k is much more than the outstanding mortgage 80k so if you did sell the flat and pay off the mortgage you 'd have 50k left in cash that could be invested to provide an income the right way to compare the two options is to look at the different costs in each scenario let 's assume the bigger house will cost as it makes the figures work out nicely if you buy the bigger house with a bigger mortgage you will need to borrow 50k more so will end up with a mortgage of 130k and you will still have the 8k year from the flat depending on your other income you might have to pay tax on the 8k year e.g. at 40 if you 're a higher rate taxpayer leaving you with year if you sell the flat you 'll have no mortgage repayments to make and no income from the flat you 'll be able to exactly buy the new house outright with the 50k left over after you repay the mortgage on top of your old house you 'd also have to pay some costs to sell the flat that you would n't have to with the bigger mortgage but you 'd save on the costs of getting a new mortgage they probably are n't the same but let 's simplify and assume they are if anything the costs of selling the flat are likely to be higher than the mortgage costs viewed like that you should look at the actual costs to you of having a 130k mortgage and how much of that would be interest given that you 'll be remortgaging at current mortgage rates i 'd expect interest would only be 2 3 i.e around 4k so significantly less than the income from the flat even after tax the total payment would be more because of capital repayment but you could easily afford the cashflow difference you can vary the term of the mortgage to control how much the capital repayment is and you should easily be able to get a 130k mortgage on a house with a very good deal so if your figure of 8k rent is accurate considering void periods costs of upkeep etc then i think it easily makes sense to get the bigger house with the bigger mortgage given the tax impact which was pointed out in a comment a third strategy may be even better keep the flat but take out a mortgage on it in exchange for a reduced mortgage on your main house the reason for doing it that way is that you get some tax relief on the mortgage costs on an investment property as long as the income from that property is higher than the costs whereas you do n't on your primary residence the tax relief used to just be at the same tax rate you were paying on the rental income i.e. you could subtract the mortgage costs from the rental income when calculating tax it 's gradually being reduced so it 's just basic rate tax relief 20 even if you pay higher rate tax but it still could save you some money you 'd need to look at the different mortgage costs carefully as buy to let mortgages often have higher interest rates

i agree with mrchrister about first considering how necessary the renovations are is it a nice to have or a need to have as well as the importance of consulting a realtor if you are selling your home as they will advise you wisely   for instance they might advise you to replace the with a neutral ceramic tile as you would be assured a better resale value on your dollar spent than if you were to replace the old with new or there are many types of renovations that simply do n't pay off and others that do provide good return on investment like intelligent kitchen and bathroom updates   i found this roi grid at which is pretty consistent with what i remember reading in the toronto star this spring top 10 renovations ~ average return    on investment painting and interior decorating = 73 kitchen renovations = 72 bathroom renovations = 68 exterior painting = 65 flooring upgrades = 62 window door replacement = 57 family room addition = 51 fireplace addition = 50 basement renovation = 49 furnace heating updating = 48 if you are selling your home and your realtor has suggested improvements they are probably necessary and not doing them might serve as an to quickly selling your home so factor in the potential costs of carrying your home for additional weeks months or worse overlapping mortage costs if it takes your home longer to sell and you end up owning two homes simultaneously for a bit as far as your question should you pay cash for or take out a loan one factor to consider if you live in canada is the home renovation tax credit which applies to that take place until feb 1 2010 and can deduct up to $ 1,350   so if you have to do a reno and yours qualifies for this tax credit and you wo n't have the cash before that deadline factor in the cost of borrowing vs. the $ 1,350 good luck

options can have a negligible time premium for calls the time premium is never negative if it had a negative premium it would be profitable to exercise it immediately a deep in the money call has a delta of exactly one that is it 's price movements completely mirror the price movements of the underlying stock that means an option seller can buy stock and completely hedge his short option position the seller of the option may be in an position to buy with very little margin and take your money and invest it for example consider a stock trading at $ 7.50 with its january 2014    $ 4 call option trading at $ 3.50 for one option representing 100 shares a trader could take your 350 dollars and invest it and only use a small portion of the money to buy the stock on margin market makers can typically borrow money at very low interest rates if you have high borrowing costs or are unable to buy on margin then buying deep in the money calls can be a good strategy long story short option sellers are making money off selling these deep in the money calls even with almost zero time premium so in general there 's no way to make money by buying them 1 an american call is a call that can be exercised at any time up to and including its expiration date

the problem with short would be that even if the stock eventually falls it might raise a lot in the meantime and unless you have enough collateral you may not survive till it happens   to sell shares short you first need to borrow them as naked short is currently prohibited in us as far as i know now to borrow you need some collateral which is supposed to be worth more that the asset you are borrowing and usually substantially more otherwise the risk for the creditor is too high suppose you borrowed 10 k worth of shares and gave 15 k collateral numbers are totally imaginary of course suppose the shares rose so that total cost is now at this moment you will probably be demanded to either raise more collateral or close the position if you can not thus generating you a 4 k loss little use it would be to you if next day it fell to 1 k you already lost your money   as keynes once said markets can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent see also another answer which other issues with short selling as noted by options may be a safer way to do it or a short etf like lists of those are easy to find online

i am not sure about transferwise and how they work but generally when i had to transfer money across countries i ended up using a foreign currency transfer company who needed the destination account details i.e. a gbp account in the uk in your case and money from the source account basically that means your father would need to open an eur account probably in an eu country is this an option but may be in the uk is fine too depending on transfer fees and a gbp account in the uk perhaps see if there is a better business account than hsbc around i have used them as well as santander before the only fx transaction done in this straightforward set up is the one performed by the specialised company there are a few and their spread difference between interbank i.e. official and your price is likely to be around 1.0 1.5 the other expenses are transfer fees to the fx company account say a flat fee of $ 25 for the swift payment the full amount less the spread above then goes to your uk gbp account there are still the running costs of both eur and gbp accounts of course but here the advice would be just to shop around for offers free banking periods etc point being given the saving in fx conversion it might still be a better overall deal than just letting hsbc deal with it all

i encourage you to think of this home purchase decision as a chance to buy into a community that you want your children to grow up in   try to find a place where you will be happy for the next 20 years not just the next 2 or 7 years in your situation option 1 seems like a bad idea   it will create an obstacle to having children instead of establishing a place for them to grow up in option 2 is close to buying a house on a layaway plan   it offers the most financial flexibility   it also could result in the best long term outcome because you will buy in an established area and you will know exactly what quality house you will have   but you and your fiancé need to ask yourselves some hard questions   are you willing to put up with the mess and hassles of   are you good at designing such projects   can you afford to pay for the projects as they occur   or if you need to finance them can you get a heloc to cover them especially if you and your fiancé do much of the work yourselves break down the projects into small enough pieces that you can quickly finish off whatever you are working on at the time and be happy living in the resulting space   you do not want to be your husband about an unfinished project forever or silently that a project never got wrapped up   i posted some suggestions for incrementally finishing a basement on the home improvement stack exchange if you are up to the job of option 2 it is less risky than option 3   option 3 has several risks you do n't know what sort of people will live in the neighborhood 5 20 years from now   will the homes be owner occupied   or rentals   will your neighbors care about raising children well   or will lots of kids grow up in broken homes    will the schools be good   disappointing   or dangerous   whereas in an established neighborhood you can see what the neighborhood is currently like and how it has been changing unless you custom build or remodel you do n't control the quality of the construction   some neighborhoods built by in the last 10 years were riddled with construction defects you will be paying up front for features you do n't need yet   you might never need some of them   and some of them might interfere with what you realize later on might be better in stable markets new homes especially ones with lots of upgrades often decline in value during the first few years   this is because part of the value is in the and being up to date with the latest fads   this part of the value wears off over time are the homes at the edge of town already within reasonable walking distance of parks schools church grocery stores et cetera   might the commute from the edge of town to work get worse over the next 5 20 years

i 'll answer but avoiding discussion of m1 m2 etc too pedantic i do n't believe you are asking about the lifetime of either coins or paper money i think you are referencing the fractional reserve system and how a good portion of the total money supply is created by the banks lending out their deposits in effect creating money my answer to you is that if all loans were simply paid off no mortgages no car loans etc the total money in the system would collapse to some reasonable fraction of what it is today 10 or a bit less this comes from the fact that the reserve requirement for most large banks is 10   i 'm referencing money but not bills or coins think about what you make in a year how much do you touch as paper money for my wife and me it 's no more than a few percent most goes from a direct deposit to online payments so this would be the subject of a different question altogether   let me know if this addresses your question

as far as i can tell it works like this note i am assuming you were 18 on jan 1 2009 contribution limits so by the end of 2012 you will have been allowed to contribute $ 20,000 of new money you say you 've contributed $ 10,000 so you still can contribute another $ 10,000 of new money this year but let 's assume you do not now your original $ 10,000 has grown to $ 25,000   you can withdraw this without penalty   next year you will be given an allotment of another $ 5000 of new money bringing your total lifetime limit to $ 25,000 $ 10,000 = $ 15,000 new money plus you will be allowed to re contribute up to $ 25,000 of old money of course the government does n't make a distinction between old and new money so the net effect is assuming a 25k withdrawal 2012 limit $ 10 000 2013 limit $ 40 000 less 2012 contributions from the tfsa contribution room is made up of from this wording it means the 25 k you withdraw will go to the 2013 contribution room bullet 3   if you do n't re contribute it will roll over into the 2014 contribution room under bullet 2    for correctness i must add that i did not include any indexing of the annual amount

completely agree with this especially with the level 2 comment some sections in the schweser level 2 books are quite scarce and will need additional research    i just passed level 2 this june and i have pretty much never used the cfai materials they are very long and time consuming whereas the schweser resources were much shorter yet still comprehensive enough of course you are in this to improve yourself and learn as much as you can about the world of finance so if you are not under time pressure perhaps it may be better for your long term understanding to learn the content from the cfai resources    one thing i would stress is to do the mock exams and topic tests on the cfa website as this is probably the most important component of your studies use these resources to find your weaknesses and fill in the gaps from there    you should skim read those blue boxes which contain worked examples but personally i found the end of chapter questions to be too easy and a waste of time tbh   hope that helps a bit all the best for your studies    tl;dr   schweser materials are more concise and a better option regardless of what you use do official cfa amp topic tests

actually the rate of change could be more or less constant but you might have a minimum price that represents your fixed costs   so you might sell a for $ 1 which is ridiculous in terms of per unit pricing to cover fixed costs and add $ for each step in size to cover variable costs cost of raw materials and packaging so a 2 lb bag would be $ 2 a 5 lb bag would be $ 3.50 a ton would be $ etc   at the end of the day you want the marginal revenue the price that you charge for each additional pound to be more than the marginal cost the price per pound it takes to produce the bag   any amount over that goes towards your fixed costs the cost you 'd incur if you sold zero product rent utilities overhead etc it 's not an exact science and there are many variables that go into pricing

fellow here i 'm seeing the same things you 're seeing but what worries me the most is the sheer number of people i know in my professional circles who ca n't so much as use a wrench and have no clue what extra surprises you might run into when owning but are attracted by the low mortgage rates into buying 2 3 properties and using them as rental properties purely as an investment it 's not so bad for the detached homes which tend to be bought up by developers contractors but the and condos are rife with this type of owner they do n't realize that being a landlord is a job things break you 're responsible and you definitely ca n't rely on your tenants always acting as reasonable promptly paying people   i move to somewhere else in toronto about once every 1.5 years each time researching many units online and seeing ~20 in person and while there may be an increase in quality for the detached homes every other type of rental property 's quality is in steep decline as the market fills with all these non expert get rich quick types of owners

i 'd suggest buying a used car for cash car loans are a bad idea i bought my last car a few years ago for $ 8k off of craigslist and it is still running great make sure you get a car checked out by a mechanic before buying usually they 'll drop it off at a mechanic you want to have take a look or perhaps just go with you my general rule is to not take out loans for anything which decreases in value so a home mortgage would be fine a car loan is not a great plan buy cash and save for the next purchase if you buy a decent used corolla or other small import car you can get it for $ 8k it will likely last a few years at least that could end up costing you less than $ 200 per month total or less much better deal in the long run

you 're going to have a huge problem getting approved for anything as long as you have an unpaid bill on your report pay it and make sure its reported as paid in full asap once that settled your credit will start to improve slowly ca n't do anything about that it will take time you can make the situation improve a bit faster by lending money to yourself and having it reported regularly on your report how easy get a secured credit card what does it mean you put x amount of money in a cd and the bank will issue you a credit card secured by that cd your credit line will be based on the amount in that cd and you 'll probably pay some fees to the bank for the service shop around you might get lucky and find a secured card without fees if you look hard enough secured cards are reported as revolving credit just as any other credit card and are easy to get because the bank does n't take the risk you do   if you default on your payments your cd goes to cover the debt and the card gets cancelled but make absolutely sure that you do not default charge between 10 and 30 of the credit limit each month not more pay the balance shown on your credit card statement in full every month and by the due date shown on your monthly statement   it will take a while but you would typically start noticing the improvement within ~6 12 months stop applying for stuff not store cards not car loans you 're not going to get anything and will just keep dragging your scores down each time you have a pull on your report the score goes down a lot of pulls frequent pulls the score goes down a lot lenders can see when one is desperate and no one wants to lend money to desperate people   optimally lenders want to lend money to people who does n't need loans but in order to keep the business running they 'll settle for slightly less people who do n't usually need loans and pay the loans they do have on time you fail on both as you 're desperate for a loan and you have unpaid bills on your report

your gut feeling is absolutely spot on you should n't be worrying about pension now not at the age of 25 assuming that you 're not a in the middle of the most productive part of your career and already have a fat wad of crunchy banknotes under your pillow that you 're looking to set aside for a rainy day when you wo n't be able to play at your prime any longer that does n't mean you should n't invest nor that means that you must n't save there are several factors at play here   first of all as a young person you are likely to have a high tolerance for risk there is still plenty of time to recover should expected returns not even a pension fund with the most aggressive risk return strategy might just not quite do it for you you could invest into education instead improve health obtain a profitable skill create social capital by building connections pay for experience buy a house start a family or even a business next as a young professional you 're unlikely to have reached your full earning potential yet and due to the law of diminishing marginal utility a hundred pounds per month now have greater utility i.e. positive impact on your lifestyle than a seven hundred pounds will in 7 10 years time once your earnings that is to say it 's easier to save £ 700 month from £ 3000 and maintain a reasonable level of personal comfort than carve £ 100 from £ 1300 monthly income and last but not the least lets face it from a human point of view forty years is a very long investment horizon and many things might and will change one of the downsides of uk pensions is that you have very little control over the money until you reach a certain age i suggest saving up to build a cushion consisting of cash or near cash assets the size of the stash should be such that it is enough to cover all of your expenses from a minimum of 2 months to a maximum of a year the exact size will depend on your personal comfort level whatever social net you have parents wife partner and how hard it will be to find a new source of income should the current cease to produce cash on a strategic level you can start looking into investing any surplus cash into the foundation of what will bring joy and happiness into the next 40 years of your life your or your partners training and education is one of the most sensible choices whilst you 're young starting a family is another one both might help you reach you full earning potential much quicker finding what you love to do and learning how to do it really well cash can accelerate this process bringing you quicker there you want to be if you were a start up business in front of a huge market would you rather use cash to pay dividends or finance growth

short answer do n't do it unless you know something that the bank does n't it 's safe to assume that banks are a lot better at assessing risk than you are if they think he ca n't afford it odds are he ca n't afford it regardless of what he might say to the contrary in this case the best answer may be sorry for your luck you could recommend that he comes up with a larger down payment to reduce his monthly payment or that he find a way to get some extra income rather than getting you to cosign please also see this article by dave ramsey on why you should never cosign loans

i bought a house 6 months ago for $ 240,000 on an $ 80k salary am getting by just fine and am able to save money and i live on long island an extremely expensive area to live i would look at finding a few more interest rate quotes for instance wells fargo is offering 4.25 right now for fha first time home buyers loan which only require 3.5 down a lower interest rate will lower your monthly payment make the banks compete with one another this little bit of leg work will save you thousands upon thousands of dollars in the long run also try to negotiate to not paying a point down on the mortgage most of the time they are bull especially in this economy banks are desperate for new loans   however as others have said do not assume or count on rent coming in to be able to afford your mortgage unless you are married what if your friend moves out and you can not find another tenant   however i strongly recommend you talk to a financial adviser and your bank mortgage loan officer to work out the numbers you will be surprised what you can afford when you factor in your income tax and mortgage interest write offs

you ca n't buy it outright you ca n't take the time to save up if the remaining choice is between a card that charges from day one and a card with this kind of grace period the grace card is the better choice plan wisely pay it in full before that rate starts to be charged one additional note there are two groups of people the pay in and the balance carriers i believe that one should pay in full and never pay interest   a zero rate offer can be used by the balance carrier to feel great for 12 months but have even more debt after the rate kicks in   as a pay in full user i 've used the zero rate to throw $ 20 k at the 5.25 mortgage and planned a refinance to 3.5 just as it ended a $ 750 savings after the tax effect well worth the bit of effort   the fees should be in the fine print my zero rate had a transfer fee $ 50 max which was nothing in comparison to the savings

does that justify the purpose that is for individual banks to decide no bank would pay for daily expenditure if you are saying primary salary you are spending on so your declaration is right you are looking at funding your via loan and you are earning enough for living and paying of the loan i noticed that a lot of lenders do not lend to applicants whose purpose is to finance the tuition for post secondary education this could be because the lenders have seen larger percentage defaults when people opt for such loans it could be due to mix of factors like the the drag this would cause to an individual who may not benefit enough in terms of higher salary to repay the loan or moves out of country getting a better job if it is education loan have you looked at getting scholarships or student loans

gt securitize the mortgages and sell them off to clients   to expand on that these loans were being packaged with 100s of others and sold to investors who could not possibly be bothered with examining each of the properties or borrowers   they were sold for decent fees to the bank and if the bank sold them all had no risk and pocketed fees from both ends   the banks needed as many loans as possible because they thought they could sell them all   the significance of this admission is n't so much that it was always ridiculous that the illiterate and unsophisticated were taking advantage of banks generosity but that they can no longer say the ridiculous with a straight face

let 's assume that the bonds have a par value of $ 1,000   if conversion happens then one bond would be converted into 500 shares   the price in the market is unimportant   regardless of the share price in the market the income per share would be increased by the absence of $ 70 in interest expense   it would be decreased by the lost tax deduction   it would be further diluted by the increase in 500 shares   likewise the debt would be extinguished and the equity section increased   whether it increased or decreased on a per share basis would depend upon the average amount paid in per share in the currently existing structure adjusted for changes in retained earnings since the initial offering and for any treasury shares there would be a loss in value generally if it is trading far from $ 2.00 because it would be valued based on the market price   had the bond not converted it would trade in the market as a pure bond if the stock price is far below the strike price and as an ordinary pure bond plus a premium if near enough to the strike price in a manner that depends upon the time remaining under the conversion privilege    i can not think of a general case where someone would want to convert below strike and indeed barring a very strange tax inheritance or legal situation such as a weird divorce i can not think of a case where it would make sense   it often does not make sense to convert far from maturity either as the option premium only vanishes well above $ 2   the primary case for conversion would be where the after tax dividend is greater than the after tax interest payment

the calculations you suggest have some issues but i think they are not necessary to answer the question it sounds like you are buying the house either way so the question really is simply whether to pay toward your house first or your loan first   in that case the answer is simple pay whichever has the highest interest rate first   make the minimum payment on the other until the first is paid off   remember this and make it your mantra for the rest of your life   if you have any debts such as credit cards that charge a rate higher than the two options you have presented do them first now be careful as you compute the interest rates   most likely you can deduct interest on your mortgage so its effective interest rate is lower it is instead of r where t is your marginal tax rate for a while the cost of mortgage insurance will make your effective mortgage rate artificially high but it sounds like you intend to get to that 20 hurdle pretty fast so my guess is that this is not a big factor congratulations on your bonus and good luck with your new home

when using a debit card there are two limits that may be imposed on the use the current balance and the maximum daily limit if the banking institution limits your daily usage that may mean that on a particular day you may not be able to make a large purchase even though you have money in the bank otherwise as long as you have funds in the account linked to the debit card you can make the transaction the catch is that as soon as the transaction is sent to the bank one of two things happens the money is immediately deducted from the account or a hold equal to the the amount of the transaction is placed on the account a hold is generally used when the transaction is done in two parts the pre scan at a restaurant or gas station the hold reduces the amount of available funds in the account a hold or an immediate deduction limits the size of future transactions to be able to make larger transactions you need to transfer more money into the account there is no debit card transaction that you can do to   artificially allow a larger transaction unless the bank is not placing a hold or doing an immediate deduction   because a debit card is linked to a bank account some accounts have overdraft protection this protection comes in two forms they either transfer your money from another account or they make a loan either way there can be costs involved

several people have mentioned the obvious inflation   but let 's assume we are talking about real inflation adjusted prices one argument is that populations keep rising while the land does not change   so the price of homes in desirable places gets pushed up and people move to second best locations pushing those prices up etc   similar argument holds for raw materials steel granite fine wood etc another argument is that the economy has a long term upward trajectory that 's the assumption   so each generation as a whole has more disposable real income than the previous   as disposable income increases people tend to put more and more money into their homes pushing prices up   true for all goods of course but it may be more true for real estate than for other types of goods

normally interest only mortgages are taken incase one planning to sell off the property after a few years and purchase of the property is for investment in such a case instead of oneself with a huge emi one opts for an interest only mortgage and towards the end of the term sell off the house at profit and repay back the entire principal   i am not to sure if interest only mortgages are encouraged for properties you plan to live in although i do not know about the ing scheme normally there is no prepayment option on interest only mortgages its bank way of earning a fixed income for the contracted period and that s the reason why the interest rates are lower than a regular mortgage if you do the math you may be paying more in total interest than on a regular mortgage

stock issuing and dilution is legal because there must be some mechanism for small companies to grow into big companies a company sees a great investment opportunity   it would be a perfect extension of their activities but they can not afford it to get the necessary money they can either take out a loan or issue shares taking a loan basically means that this is temporary but the company will go back to being small when the loan is paid back issuing new shares basically means that the board means that this growth is permanent and the company will be big for the foreseeable future it is utterly necessary that companies have this option for raising cash and therefore it is legal as detailed in the other answers you end up with a smaller percentage of a larger company usually ending up with more or less the same value

a few thoughts you said   to me it makes sense that if he accidentally put his own money in when he was n't supposed to he could just take it out and pay the tax on it and be fine in this case he would be putting his own after tax money in and would n't be able to deduct it so the act of putting it in and taking it back out in the same tax year would be as if the transaction never occurred at all he would not have to pay the tax on it as for this question is there any penalty to his employer if they contribute to an hsa on his behalf knowing that he is not eligible and that the money will be an excess contribution it 's good that your son is prepared to treat it as regular income and pay the appropriate taxes however the employer should be the one doing that they should be treating it as regular income and taking out fica and paying their end of fica too if they are n't doing that technically they are breaking the law the employer really should n't be making the contributions at all and if they ever bothered to correct this this article suggests that the employer may be legally allowed to drain the hsa account and take their money back out of it but only for the same tax year apparently they can do this without your son 's consent if that 's true it may make sense to withdraw all money from that account immediately as soon as the money arrives since they can not take the money back if it is no longer there once the money leaves the hsa account the employer has no choice but to change it to income and if they do n't your son must declare it as such which it sounds like he is prepared to do this does n't really answer your question of whether or not the employer can be i would assume yes but not too badly the worst case scenario for them would probably be just having to pay all the back fica on those funds if they are n't doing so already maybe an interest penalty as well all that being said i 'd recommend talking to an accountant the most important thing you want to be sure of is that your son can not possibly be liable for any wrongdoing particularly i would get confirmation on pulling money out of the hsa that you know should n't be there in the first place just to make sure there is no possible way to get dinged for that

yes it is possible as long as the broker you use allows conditional orders i use cmc markets in australia and they allow free conditional orders either when initially placing a buy order or after already buying a stock see the place new order box below   once you have selected a stock to buy the number of shares you want to buy and at what price you can place up to 3 conditional orders the first condition is a place order if conditional order here you can place a condition that your buy order will only be placed onto the market if that condition is met first   say the stock last traded at $ and you only want to place your order the next day if the stock price moves above the current resistance at $ 10.00 so you would place order if price is at or above $ 10.00 so if the next day the price moves up to $ 10 or above your order will be placed onto the market the second condition is a stop loss conditional order here you place the price you want to sell at if the price drops to or past your stop loss price it will only be placed on to the market if your buy order gets traded so if you wanted to place your stop loss at $ 9.00 you would type in 9.00 in the box after if at or below and select if you want a limit or market order the third condition is a take profit conditional order this allows you to take profits if the stock reaches a certain price say you wanted to take profits at 50 that is if the price reached $ 15.00 so you would type in 15.00 in the box after if at or above and again select if you want a limit or market order these conditional orders can all be placed at the time you enter your buy order and can be edited or deleted at any time the broker you use may have a different process for entering conditional orders and some brokers may have many more conditional orders than these three so investigate what is out there and if you are confused in how to use the orders with your broker simply ask them for a demonstration in how to use them

first the annual report is just that a snapshot that shows value at the beginning and end of the period beginning = aug 08 = $ end =        aug 09 =   $ newsletter date may 10 = $ odd they chose end of august as it 's not even a calendar quarter end the $ 16b was market loss during that period nearly half of that seemed to be recovered by the time this newsletter came out the balance sheet also has to show deposits and payments made to existing retirees i have n't looked at the s&p numbers for those dates but my gut says this is right the market tanked and the plan was down but not too bad   protect the pbgc guarantees pensions up to a certain limit i believe that in general teachers are below the limit and are not at risk of a reduced benefit you do need to check that your plan is covered if not i believe the state would take over directly i hope this helps

one factor to consider is that some employers have a 401k contribution match policy that only allows a certain percentage of any given paycheck to be matched so if the company is willing to match 4 of each paycheck you could run into a problem here where you lose out on some of your company match for example suppose you get a $ 20,000 bonus you can contribute $ 18,000 per year to your 401k and this bonus could be a nice way to knock most of that out and then take home your full paycheck the rest of the year sounds pretty nice but there 's a problem the company will only match 4 of your $ 20,000 $ 800 when they otherwise would have matched up to 4 of your annual salary $ 4,000 if you 're making $ 100,000 in this example i 'd say it 's definitely worth it to make a big contribution to your 401k when you get a bonus as it 's an easy way to get a lot of money in there without really feeling a loss since it 's extra money on top of your normal paycheck but i 'd definitely be careful about this situation you do n't want to throw away free money to avoid this problem make sure that you leave enough of your annual limit so you can contribute enough to get your 4 company match on every paycheck of the year

you are not actually entitled to any raise at all unless you had something contractually legally binding which made that so i 'm answering this from the uk but it has been common practice for people over the last 10 years or so to receive no yearly raise in some sectors this is what i would consider a bad raise if wages are not kept in line with inflation you are effectively earning less every year in this regard i would not work for any employer who did not offer an annual raise that was at the very least covering the rate of inflation these rates are easy to find in your country by googling it in terms of a standard raise i would argue there is no such thing this depends on the industry sector you work in your employers opinion of your performance note i 've used the word opinion because sometimes you may think the effort you put in is different to what they think be prepared to give evidence of what you 've achieved for them with things to back it up a good raise is anything which is way above a standard raise since there is no concise of a standard raise this is also hard to quantify as others have mentioned do not stay in a role where you are not being given a raise that covers inflation because it means every year you have less purchasing power which is akin to your salary going down it 's very easy to justify to an employer you 're leaving and indeed one you 're going to why you 're making the move under these conditions

gt well they 've created what $ in the last few years   i agree with you technically but they control both the quantity and the quantity times velocity of money so they are also responsible for the lack of cashflow    the big thing i think you 're referring to is that they did this weird maneuver where they temporarily injected money into the banks basically so they could say they were solvent without actually being solvent because the were temporary the money never moved and was simply deposited at the fed if like adam smith you do n't consider money to really exist unless it moves they did not create effective money as you point out critically they did not create cashflow which is the appropriate macro definition of money the corresponding macro variable for this is ngdp   but actually the fed also controls ngdp as ben bernanke says every time the fomc makes its report they just choose not to increase it because they think that monetary policy is sufficiently i would agree with you that the present level of cashflow is inadequate but if the fed fixes it at the present level nothing will increase it this is called the critique was raising the issue to argue contra keynes that the multiplier on fiscal policy is 0 if you google it you can probably find someone to defend it better than me in any event this means it 's not very surprising that private spending and investment does n't lift ngdp nothing but the fed can lift ngdp because it can not create new cashflow on its own which it could under free banking this would be the advantage of free banking the market must now move to a new equilibrium ngdp level while it is saddled with a large number of contracts from before 2008 that were negotiated with respect to a higher expected ngdp level this deleveraging process is responsible for the present slump and the you describe

if you 're looking for ways to turn $ 1000 into more do n't just think of ways it can make money also consider whether there are any ways you can use it to save money among the advantages of this approach is that you 're not taxed for reducing your expenditures the good news is that there are a lot more ways to save a little bit of money on a $ 1000 budget than there are to make a little money on that budget the bad news is that most of them will require some additional input labor have you taken an economics course capital + labor = > output   i do n't know what you spend your money on exactly but some thoughts you may find more opportunities for things like this as you move out from college and into your own apartment and the university is n't taking care of as many of your needs just do n't confuse yourself about where the line is between actually saving money that you were going to spend anyway and just consuming more consumption is fine in and of itself and ultimately it 's what you have money for but does n't make you financially better off also when considering what to do with the money do n't just think i can spend $ 2000 on this bike and it will ultimately save me gas money unless you also know how to think i could spend $ 200 on a slightly lesser bike and still save all the gas money or maybe even spend $ 20 on a yard sale bike consider borrowing kitchen equipment from the parents instead of buying new stuff or buy it at a yard sale also make sure you actually will use the things you buy

can i be prosecuted for fraud as well yes it is possible in several jurisdictions e.g. uk you have with the fraudster and arguably been at least an involved party or accessory to a crime or attempted crime   whether you are actually prosecuted depends on whether the fraud or attempted fraud is reported or detected whether the prosecutors obtain evidence you knew or should reasonably have known that there was some criminal aspect to the events and at least partly on your actions once you became aware of the fraud however i am not a lawyer and law varies from place to place considerably according to online threat alerts if someone asks you to lend him her your bank account debit card and pin number for a fee or offer to transfer money to your bank account ask you to transfer a certain amount to another account and then asks you to keep the rest as payment please do not take part in such activity this type of activity is a money laundering scam used by criminals to trick people into unknowingly taking part in a crime that can land them in jail i would n't worry too much you have been extremely naive foolish and negligent but what matters is how you behave now probably

the stock market is no different in this respect to anything that 's bought or sold the price of a stock like many other things reflects what the seller is prepared to sell it at and what the buyer is prepared to offer for it if those things match then a transaction can take place the seller loses money but gains stocks they feel represent equivalent value the reverse happens for the buyer take buying a house for example did the buyer lose money when they bought a house sure they did but they gained a house the seller gained money but lost a house new money is created in the sense that companies can and do make profits those profits together with the expected profits from future years increase the value that is put on the company if we take something simple like a mining company then its value represents a lot of things and numerous other lesser things too the value of shares in the mining company will reflect all of these things it likely rises and falls in line with the price of the raw materials it mines and those change based on the overall supply and demand for those raw materials stocks do have an inherent value they are ownership of a part of a company you own part of the asset value profits and losses made by that company betting on things is different in that you 've no ownership of the thing you bet on you 're only dependent on the outcome of the bet

this is a perfect example of why bonds are confusing at first glance   think about it this way   you buy a 30-year russian bond at 4   an event happens that makes russia risky to invest in   you want to buy another bond but fuck 4 you and the rest of the market want 6 to compensate you for the risk   now let 's say you want to sell your 4 bond well you 're going to have to drop the price of that bond in order for it to appeal to an investor that could go out and get a 6 on a 30-year bond of that kind you 're looking at about 75 of what you bought it for    so to wrap it up high bond yields are great for buyers that do n't already own them but bad for sellers who want to get rid of their old ones it is the opposite intuition as stocks and almost everything else

the different levels are somewhat related to levels of risk writing a covered call is pretty low risk in the sense that if i buy the stock but sell a call i now have a lower cost for the stock and however low the stock drops i 'm still slightly better off than the regular stock buyer covered call writing is often used to generate premium income from a stock portfolio and less as a tool for speculation buying a call or put is simpler in execution but the risk of losing the entire amount spent i actually avoid the word invested here due to leverage involved is n't just a possibility it can be pretty likely depending on the strike price put writing and uncovered naked call writing can entail even higher risk relative to the premium received consider extreme moves in the underlying to understand the potential losses involved the more sophisticated trades are presumed to take a bit more experience and tolerance for risk and each broker has its own set of criteria to allow the client to trade at each level

etfs purchases are subject to a bid ask spread which is the difference between the highest available purchase offer bid and the lowest available sell offer ask you can read more about this concept here this cost does n't exist for mutual funds which are priced once   per day and buyers and sellers all use the same price for transactions that day etfs allow you to trade any time that the market is open if you 're investing for the long term which means you 're not trying to time your buy sell orders to a particular time of day and the pricing is otherwise equal between the etf and the mutual fund which they are in the case of vanguard 's etfs and admiral shares mutual funds i would go with the mutual fund because it eliminates any cost associated with bid ask spread

a tfsa is a tax free savings account   it is a type of account where you can buy various investments like stocks bonds or funds mutual exchange traded and money market   there are some other options but it 's best to see what your bank or broker will allow you probably specified the type of investment when you opened the account   you can look at your statements or maybe online to see what you 're invested in   my guess is some kind of high interest savings account   this is kind of the default option for banks the government created these accounts for a variety of reasons   the main stated reason was to encourage people to save    obviously they also do things to get votes   there was an outcry after the change to a type of investment called investment trusts   this could be seen as a consolation prize   these can be valuable to seniors for many reasons and they tend to vote more often   there was also an election promise to eliminate capital gains taxes in some fashion it 's not profitable for the government in fact it supposedly cost the federal government $ 410 million in 2013   banks make money by investing your deposit or by charging fees you can see what every tax break costs the government in lost revenue here

people can pretend that those are the only types that work those jobs but that is most often not the case most of the jobs in this economy are service jobs like 70 are so are we to then assume that 70 of people had better just be teenagers who need beer money obviously this is an oversimplification but i think the point is clear enough it is not as if people pop out a kid and subway suddenly says thanks for your service please report to a decent job with reasonable pay to start work monday those jobs just are n't there furthermore it is n't like subway or mcdonalds or walmart ca n't afford it or like their prices would go up significantly to shoulder it if walmart were to pay a living wage it would cost their customers an extra cent or two per item i imagine it would impact each business differently but paying employees decent wages often proves to be a more cost effective strategy because turnover and customer satisfaction go ask shake shack or or in n out its also better for the economy overall

this is actually a very complicated question the key reading in this area is a seminal paper by optimal execution of portfolio transactions 2000 they show that there 's a tradeoff between liquidating your portfolio faster and knowing the value with more certainty versus liquidating more slowly and likely for a higher price but with less certainty so for example if you sold your entire position right now you would know almost certainly how much you would get for the position or you could sell off your position more slowly and likely get more money but you would have less certainty about how much you would get the paper is available online at

dividends are declared by the board of directors of a corporation on date a to stock holders of record on date b a later date these stockholders then receive the declared dividend on date c the so called payment date all of these dates are announced on the first declaration date if there is no announcement no dividend will be paid the stock typically goes down in price by approximately the amount of the dividend on the   date it goes ex   but then moves in price to reflect other developments including the possibility of another declaration payment three months hence dividends are important to some investors especially those who live on the income they are less important to investors who are out for capital gains and who may prefer that the company reinvest its money to seek such gains instead of paying dividends in actual fact dividends are one component of total or overall return the other component is capital gains and the sum of the two represents your return

you ca n't get a heloc to the best of my knowledge without actually owning the house if you get an 80 mortgage of the purchase price not the appraised value btw you still need 20 as a down payment once you own the home you can apply for a heloc presuming you have enough equity eg the purchase price is $ 40k less than the appraised value we have n't looked at the norm at least where i live of 5 down for a traditional mortgage and 3.5 for an fha which your question touches on if you can do 5 down on a $ 1,000,000 mortgage you need $ 50,000 on the day of closing if the home is worth ie appraises for $ you 're getting 20 of the house for free presuming the bank(s will go for it you could likely then open a heloc for as much as $ 250,000 again depending on individual lender rules tl;dr if you do n't have the money ready on the day of signing via if it is a loan gift or because you have been saving you can not afford the house to clarify from comments with the op i am in no way speaking to the buyer 's ability to afford the monthly payments this is only about affording the initial costs associated with the home buying process down payment closing whatever else the bank(s require etc

there are two reasons for incorporating a business in canada limiting liability and providing some freedom in structuring your taxes since you are asking about taxes i will restrict myself to that topic first of all remember that if you do n't make much money there is n't much tax to save by clever structuring of your affairs and if you do incorporate you will pay taxes as a corporation and pay taxes again on your salary paid from that corporation it can still be advantageous because the small business tax rate is less that the higher tax brackets of personal taxes and you do n't have to pay out all of the profit as salary if you do n't incorporate you still must pay taxes on your net income from the business see brian 's answer definitely keep track of your income and expenses even if you do n't plan on making money in case you get audited if the cra wants to call your hobby a business you will need to show that you have n't made any profit i am just giving you a few bits of advice because this subject is complicated too complicated for an answer on this site if you are still interested go to your local library and get some books on the subject

it depends   very generally when yields go up stocks go down and when yields go down stocks go up as has been happening lately if we look at the yield of the 10 year bond it reflects future expectations for interest rates   if the rate today is very low but expectations are that the short term rates will go up that would be reflected in a higher yield simply because no one would buy the longer term bond if they could simply wait out and get a better return on term investments   if expectations are that the rate is going down you get what 's called an inverted yield curve   the inverted yield curve is usually a sign of economic trouble ahead   yields are also influenced by inflation expectations as is alluding in his answer so   if the stock market crashes because the economy is doing poorly and if interest rates are relatively high then people would expect the rates to go down and therefore bonds will go up however if there 's rampant inflation and the rates are going up we can expect stocks and bonds to move in opposite directions   another interpretation of that is that one would expect stock prices to track inflation pretty well because company revenue is going to go up with inflation   if we 're just talking about a bump in the road correction in a healthy economy i would n't expect that to have much of an immediate effect though bonds might go down a little bit in the short term but possibly even more in the long term as interest rates eventually head higher   another scenario is a very low interest rate environment as today with a stock market crash and not a lot of room for yields to go further down both stocks and bonds are influenced by current interest rates interest rate expectations current inflation inflation expectations and stock price expectation   add noise and stir
