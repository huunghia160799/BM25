twitter is planning to go public on nyse you 'll be able to start trading once the stock is listed for trading which would be the day of the ipo   note that since you 're trading on the secondary market you wo n't be able to buy at the ipo prices whatever the time is you 're buying from someone who bought at ipo price

very often the word secondary market is used with the stock market as we all know it   in this case the primary market would be the closed world of vcs business angels etc to which stock market investors do not have access e.g. the securities are not trading on a public stock market

i believe you are missing a complete aspect of figuring out price points you completely disregarded how price affects perceived quality people generally assume that higher price means higher quality pricing too low will give many people the impression that at that price it could n't be very good and do n't buy the product as a result   crown royal became crown royal after being a mediocre brand they did n't change the way they made whiskey instead they raised the price by 400 now it was viewed as a premium product simply because of it 's price   while i do n't want to knock your view of tycoon games but it 's just a game with one point of view it 's not the real world it 's just what a programmer thought would make the game interesting i sure would n't consider it to be some source of great business wisdom   look at what really happens taking video game consoles and games as an example they start at a high price point this makes it prestigious to own when that price point becomes saturated meaning everyone that is going to buy at the price already has they lower the price a little and do the same then when everyone that can afford that price has bought one they lower it again eventually it gets to a point where almost anyone can afford   this style taps the market for every price point and is much better model than the one you suggest there are many things that use this model like car sales the end of a model year is the time to buy because everyone that was willing to pay the full price already had and they need to move them off the lot to make room for new cars that will have a higher price point   so i do n't buy into your theory at all   edit grammatical error

this question has the united kingdom tag so the information about usa or other law and procedures is probably only of tangential use except for understanding that no this is not something to ignore it may well indicate someone trying to use your i d fraudulently or some other sort of data processing foul up that may adversely impact your credit rating the first thing i would do is phone the credit card company that sent the letter to inform them that i did not make his application and ask firmly but politely to speak to their fraud team i would hope that they would be helpful it 's in their interests as well as yours added later by the way do not trust anything written on the letter it may be a fake letter trying to lure or panic you into some other sort of scam such as closing your compromised bank account and transferring the money in it to the fraud team for safety yes it sounds stupid but con men are experts at what they do and even finance industry professionals have fallen victim to such scams so find a telephone number for that credit card company independently for example google and then call that number if it 's the wrong department they 'll be able to transfer you internally if the card company is unhelpful you have certain legal rights that do not cost much if anything this credit company is obliged to tell you as an absolute minimum which credit reference agencies they used when deciding to decline your application yes you did not make it but it was in your name and affected your credit rating there are three main credit rating agencies and whether or not the bank used them i would spend the statutory £ 2 fee if necessary with each of them to obtain your statutory credit report which basically is all data that they hold about you they are obliged to correct anything which is inaccurate and you have an absolute right to attach a note to your file explaining for example that you entries x y and z were fraudulently caused by an unknown third party trying to steal your id they may be factually correct e.g. credit search on so it 's possible that you can not have them removed and it may not be in your interests to have them removed but you certainly want them flagged as unauthorized   if you think the fraudster may be known to you you can also use the data protection act on the company which write to you requiring them to send you a copy of all data allegedly concerning yourself which it holds this costs £ 10 in particular you will require sight of the application and signature if it was made on paper and the ip address details if it was made electronically as well as all the data content and subsequent communications you may recognise the but even if not you then have documentary evidence that it is not yours as for the ip address you can deduce the internet service provider and then use the data protection act on them they may decline to give any details if the fraudster used his own credentials in which case again you have documentary evidence that it was not you and something to give the police and bank fraud investigators if they get interested i suspect they wo n't be very interested if all you uncover is   fraudulent applications that were declined however you may uncover a successful fraud i.e. a live card in your name being used by a criminal or a store or phone credit agreement in which case obviously get in touch with that company to get it shut down and to get the authorities involved in dealing with the crime in general write down everything you are told including phone contact names and keep it confirm anything that you have agreed in writing and keep copies of the letters you write and of course the replies you receive you should n't need any lawyer the uk credit law puts the onus very much on the credit card company to prove that you owe it money and if a random stranger has stolen your i d it wo n't be able to do that in fact it 's most unlikely that it will even try unless you have a criminal record or a record of financial delinquency but it may be an awful lot of for years to come if somebody has successfully stolen your id so even if the first lot of credit reference agency print outs look clean check again in about six weeks time and yet again   in maybe 3 months finally there is a scheme that you can join if you have been a victim of id theft i 've forgotten its name but you will probably be told about it your credit reference files will be tagged at your request with a requirement for extra precautions to be taken this should not affect your credit rating but might make obtaining credit more hassle for example requests for additional id before your account is opened after the approval process oh and post a letter to yourself it 's not unknown for fraudsters to persuade the post office to redirect all your mail to their address

lower fees are always better everything else equal a lower fee makes your transaction overall a better deal all else equal   other transactions costs like the sec fee on sales are mostly the same across brokers and there is unlikely to be any difference in execution quality either   when comparing brokers be sure to consider the other issues to me most of these are minor issues   for that reason i 'd say let transaction cost be your guide i hear a lot of talk about the quality of the interface   if you just want to buy or sell a stock they are all pretty easy   some brokers have better tools for monitoring the market or looking at technical indicators if you are into that

your premise is false   when you withdraw money from a tax free savings account tfsa there is no   tax   due   yes you can read that again   withdrawals from a tfsa are tax free   they are labeled tax free for a good reason   after tax money is deposited and then from that point forward no tax no tax no tax   on a normal non registered investment or savings account with no special treatment your investment earnings will be taxed whenever gains are realized or income received e.g. dividends or interest   you will necessarily have less in a normal non registered investment or savings account compared to a tfsa as long as the rate of return was positive i.e. growing perhaps you were thinking not of comparing a regular investment account to a tfsa but rather to a registered retirement savings plan rrsp in the case of an rrsp there is an up front tax deduction then earnings grow tax deferred and then on withdrawal income tax is paid at regular rates   even then with rrsps if your marginal tax rate remains the same over time not necessarily a reasonable assumption but let 's go with it then you should still realize more after tax income from your rrsp than from a normal non registered investment or savings account   though there 's likely an exception case when most income came as qualified dividends and the capital itself has n't appreciated

assume they do not you pay in $ 500/mo and every time it hits $ 3000 they pay the tax engineers call this a function it looks like this   the average balance is not $ 3000 but close to $ 1500 the very simple math is $ 1500 rate years   it looks like your equation except it 's not 58 it 's just the years and the question is whether you can make more than $ 850 on $ 1500 average before you sell i would n't be so quick to plug in 29 years as the average home ownership is 7 years and depending who knows if a refinance is in your future   the bottom line how long would it take you to get a 57 return ironically the most responsible and risk averse person would say decades banks offer less than 1 even an 8 market return while not guaranteed is close to 7 years but if you carry 18 credit card debt you can pay it down a bit each month and let it float back up every 6 months less than 4 years to break even

did recognize the problem of democracy if a society like ours is facing massive inequality he thought that the majority the poor would vote in their own interest and take away from the minority the rich so he thought the solution is to decrease inequality and increase democracy   notice madison recognized the same problem in the american system but he came to the opposite conclusion he thought democracy should be reduced and power be left in the hands of the more capable set of men the wealthy elite   now the society you are describing would probably be self destructive if people went around having a mob mentality as you describe looting and committing violence this would be more like a death cult at some point you have to recognize that common people are usually the target of oppression not the cause of it ironically all the examples you mentioned were imposed by the powerful few on the not the other way around

monetary policy has always been in play the romans frequently debased that is increased the alloy base metal ratio their coinage and the u.s. went off the gold standard numerous times especially during wars really the gold standard was only to when it was convenient so historically it did not play the role that austrians wish it would basically just because gold was historically used as currency does not mean that it controlled the money supply for example most sovereign transactions were simply recorded by symbolic money things and even if the gold standard did automatically protect the value of money inflation is a hell of a lot better than deflation anyway you want to reward people for putting their money to work not sticking it in a mattress   for further information on the history of gold currency and money in general see section 2 of this article from the lse

one option is to look at the irs witholding calculator as george notes this is by no means a perfect way to estimate how much you 'll owe   other key questions for you to answer there 's no silver bullet here the best you can do is to understand the key inputs into how your taxes are calculated and then identify the most important tax deductions that you might take then pray that you have n't missed some nuance and use a tax program early in january to check your assumptions so you 're not completely surprised when april rolls around   a final suggestion do your own taxes using a website like turbotax take the time to itemize your tax deductions just to learn what is tax deductible you can figure out how the big parts of tax law works by just looking at what you could deduct in the future

firstly the banks are far less risky than the people they lend to most of the interest banks charge borrowers covers defaults but banks rarely default to the fed especially those able to borrow from the fed   secondly most banks borrowing is in the form of overnight loans to cover short term reserve fluctuations they are not borrowing dollars to lend to you   thirdly if govt does it 's job of keeping some competition in the banking sector then the rates offered you and me should be near the actual cost to service such loans so are the true value of those loans since there are a significant number of banks that i can borrow from with a multitude of options in how to borrow there is likely still decent competition for my business   finally the fed funds rate is not currently 0 so the banks are not getting interest free money

thanks    gt how do you believe it should be approached    businesses should be more cognizant of the fact that they have enormous amounts of technical debt or what will be considered to be debt that will suddenly need to be solved   infrastructure or applications that have n't seen a dime in 5 + years shadow it that was stood up e.g. hey we use this access database that everyone completely forgot about to meet this one specific need and has somehow managed to survive that 's one of the most frequent issues that will grind to a halt the business need to involve it as early as possible in the m&amp;a process   cross platform can usually be solved by some form of extraction load processes that 's straightforward but it does take time   if you 're a company that cares enough to have a disaster recovery team you should also have an it m&amp;a team that meets regularly to have a dry run of an m&amp;a that covers the processes from end to end for 2 3 worst case scenarios new scenarios should be identified if you do enough you 'll have compiled a fairly decent playbook of scenarios after the third or fourth you 'll have a well oiled machine that your investors can and should be proud of    for perspective the best m&amp;a team i 've seen was microsoft 's and even then shit regularly hits the fan for those guys when it comes to technical debt that 's something to keep in mind

legally speaking when you convert that bit coin onto something else the israeli tax authority will look into the value of that something else compare it to the original value of the previous something else you used to buy bit coins usd in your example and charge you capital gain taxes for the difference according to the israeli law you 're supposed to pay taxes when selling converting the bit coin to something else and since you 're not using any formal bank or stock broker which will automatically deduct the taxes you have to pay the taxes yourself by not doing so you 're committing a tax fraud the real question you 're asking is whether they 'll come after you well that depends on the amounts they might pay attention there 's no statute of limitation for tax fraud in israel they may come after you in 50 years from now another thing to keep in mind if you used bit coins to buy something services or products of any kind you probably did n't pay the vat which is another case of tax fraud on your behalf ps i 'm not a lawyer or accountant so get a professional advice but i have been dealing with the tax authority in israel so i 've got a pretty good idea of what the rules are

your best bet is to talk with a banker about your specific plans    one of the causes of the housing crash was an 80/20 loan   there you would get a first for 80 of the value of a home and 20 on a heloc for the rest   this would help the buyer avoid pmi   the reason this was popular was because the buyer could not afford the home with the pmi and did not have a down payment   they were simply cutting things too close could you find a banker willing to do something like this i bet you could in your case it seems like you are attempting to increase the value of your home by using money to do an improvement so the situation is better   however sizable improvements rarely return 100 or more on investments   typically i would think the bank would want you to have some money invested too   so if you wanted to put in a pool a smart banker would have you put in about 60 of the costs as pools typically have a 40 roi    however i bet you can find a banker that would loan you 100 you do n't seem to be looking for advice on making a smart money decision and it is difficult to render a verdict as very little detail is supplied about your specific situation however while certain decisions might look very profitable on paper they rarely take into consideration risk

no you can not claim any sort of tax benefit the main problem is that your parent is not living with you though even if they were they would also have to be dependent on you i can not find a good definition of dependant but from what i can find they must have only a trivial amount of income and must rely on you for at least 50 of their living expenses useful links include note that your parent may but probably wo n't be required to pay taxes on the money you submit to them i have no experience whatsoever with indian tax law just pointing this out as a possibility

in general currency has no expiration date specifically in canada the bank of canada has been issuing banknotes since and these are still considered legal tender even though they do n't look much like the modern banknotes   before that canadian chartered banks issued currency and these also still have value however there are a few things to note   first of all with currency of that age it often has more value as a collector 's item than the face value   so spending it at a store would be foolish second store clerks are not experts in old currency and will not accept a bill that they do not recognize   if you want the face value of your old currency you may need to exchange it for modern currency at a bank having said all that there are certainly cases where currency does expire   generally this happens when a country changes currency   for example when the euro was introduced the old currencies were discontinued   after a window of exchange the old currency in many cases lost its value   so if you have some old french franc notes for example they can no longer be exchanged for euros these types of events can not be predicted in the future of course so it is impossible to say when if ever the canadian currency you have today will lose its spending value in canada

easiest thing ever in fact 99 of people are loosing money if you perform worse then 10 annually in cash average over 5 10 years then you better never even think about trading investing most people are sitting at -5 annually they win some loose some and are being by inflation and commissions in fact fall of market is not a big deal stock indexes are often jump back in a few months if you rebalance properly it is mitigated your much bigger enemy is inflation if you think inflation is small look at gold price over past 20 years some people winners at first grow to + 10 get too relaxed and start to grow already lost position that one loose trade eats 10 of their portfolio only there that people realize they should cut it off when they already lost their profits and they start again with + 0 this is hard thing to accept but most of people are not made for that type of business even worse they think if i had bigger budget i would perform better which is kind of self lie

i could be wrong but i doubt that bernie started out with any intention of defrauding anyone really   i suspect it began the first time he hit a quarter when his returns were lower than everyone else 's or at least not as high as he 'd promised his investors they 'd be so he the numbers and lied to get past the moment thinking he 'd just make up for it the next quarter   only that never happened and so the lie carried forward and maybe grew as things did n't improve as he expected it only turned into a ponzi because he was n't as successful at investing as he was telling his investors he was and telling the truth would have meant the probability that he would have lost most of his clients as they went elsewhere   bernie could n't admit the truth so he had to keep up the fiction by actually paying out returns that did n't exist which required constantly finding new money to cover what he was paying out   the source of that money turned out to be new investors who were in by people already investing with bernie who told them how great he was as a financial wizard and they had the checks to prove it i think this got so far out of hand and it gradually dragged more and more people in because such things turn into black holes swallowing up everything that gets close had the 2008 financial crisis not hit then bernie might still be at it   the rapid downturns in the markets hit many of bernie 's investors with margin calls in other investments they held so they requested redemptions from him to cover their calls expecting that all of the money he 'd convinced to leave with him really existed   when he realized he could n't meet the flood of redemptions that was when he up and the bubble burst could he have succeeded by simple investing in berkshire   probably   but then how many people say that in hindsight about them or amazon or google or any number of other stocks that turned out similarly grin   taking people 's money and parking it all in one stock does n't make you a genius and that 's how bernie wanted to be viewed   to accomplish that he needed to find the opportunities nobody else saw and be the one to get there first   unfortunately his personal crystal ball was wrong and rather than taking his by admitting it to his investors his pride and ego led him down a path of deception that i 'm sure he had every intention of making right if he could   the problem was that moment never came keep in mind one thing   the $ 64 billion figure everyone cites is n't money that really existed in the first place   that number is what bernie claimed his fund was worth and it is not the amount he actually defrauded people out of   his actual cash intake was probably somewhere in the $ 20 billion range over that time   everything else beyond that was nothing more than the returns he was claiming to get for his clients   it 's what they thought they had in the bank with him rather than what was really there

20 is almost certainly too high i agree with 2 as a very rough rule it will vary significantly depending on the industry i generally calculate an average of the previous 2 3 years working capital and deduct that from cash working capital is current assets less current liabilities current assets is comprised of cash prepaid expenses and significantly accounts receivable this means that ca is likely to be much higher than just cash which leaves more excess cash after liabilities are deducted which reduces ev which makes the ev ebitda ratio look even more pricey as noted but a balance sheet is just a snapshot of the final day of the quarter as such and because of seasonal effects it 's critical to smooth this by averaging several periods after calculating this for a few companies compare to revenue is it close to 2

i would say yes it makes sense to keep some money in taxable accounts   retirement accounts are for retirement and the various early withdrawal penalties are designed to enforce that   if you 're anticipating using the money before retirement e.g. for home purchase it makes sense to keep it out of retirement accounts on the other hand be aware that regardless of what kind of account it is in you face the usual risk return tradeoff   if you put your money in the s&p 500 and the s&p 500 tanks just before you were going to buy a house your down payment evaporates and you will have to wait and buy a house later   you can manage this by shifting the allocation of this money and perhaps cashing it out if a certain amount is gained i.e. it grows to the level of your target down payment and you are close enough to the house purchase time that you do n't want to risk it anymore basically if you invest money for a pre retirement use you may want to keep it in a taxable account but you also need to take account of when you 'll need it and manage the risk accordingly

i think people in general tend to unnecessarily over complicate this issue   here 's what i think you should do in any situation like this first and foremost put all tax considerations aside and decide whether it makes sense to sell the stock now or hold on to it for the long term based on its merits as an investment   tax considerations have absolutely nothing to do with whether the stock is a good investment   if you consider all non tax factors and decide to hold on to it for the long term then you can use the tax considerations as a very minor input to how long you should hold it in other words do n't set your time horizon to 17.5 months if waiting another 2 weeks gives you better tax treatment you 're going to pay taxes on your gains no matter what   the only difference is whether you pay capital gains tax or income tax   granted the income tax rate is higher but would n't it suck if you pay a lot less tax only because you have a lot less value in your stock so to answer your question i would say absolutely not tax consequences do not make it worthwhile to hold on to your espp shares   if you decide to hold on to your espp for other reasons and they better be good ones to put that much free profit at risk only then should you look at the tax consequences to help fine tune your strategy

i 'm a not an accountant   but my feeling has been that the distinction between asset and liability is mainly a sign convention and comes from a wish to avoid negative numbers suppose you take out a loan for $ 1000 and deposit the proceeds in your bank account   under normal accounting conventions your bank account is an asset and the loan is a liability   after the loan bank has a balance of 1000 and loan has a balance of 1000   you can compute your net worth by adding all assets and subtracting all liabilities so in this case your net worth remains 0 if you treat loan as an asset account then after taking out the loan you should give it a balance of   under this convention you have lots of negative numbers to deal with everywhere which i suspect early accountants would have found inconvenient   the asset liability convention means you only need to deal with negative numbers in unusual situations overdrawn bank account overpaid loan etc likewise in theory you could treat expense accounts as negative income but i 'm not sure why you feel the need to reinvent the wheel by simplifying double entry accounting like this   the standard conventions are not that complicated and their major advantage is that they 're standard other people will be able to understand your books if they ever need to   say you want to hire somebody to do your taxes at some point if your books are kept in your own idiosyncratic system their job will be at best error prone and at worst impossible    it 's a bit like a proposal to simplify english spelling a this mit bee in sum but if can reed it it

yes it is a very good idea to start your credit history early   it sounds like you have a good understanding of the appropriate use of credit as a substitute for cash rather than a supplement to income   as long as you keep your expenses under control and pay off your card each month i see no problems with the idea try to find a card with no annual fees a low interest rate if possible which will be difficult at your age and with some form of rewards such as cash back   look for a reputable issuing bank and keep the account open even after you get a new card down the road   your credit score is positively correlated with having an account open for a long time having a good credit usage to credit limit ratio and having accounts in good standing and paid on time

while the question is highly subjective as you noted putting extra money will of course save you interest payments it depends on how much enjoyment is worth now i would suggest you to not be overly aggressive as you might dig yourself a ditch your minimum monthly payments might get adjust upwards if some of these loans are student loans as it might seem you have a higher degree of disposable income to play with be aggressive in paying them off but not to aggressive i also think the interest is tax deductible what it really comes down to is how much more interest do you want to pay them for enjoyment now 50 months is not long its just north of 4 years i 'd say if you think you can put 800 extra towards them do n't instead if it were me i would put an extra 400 towards the highest until its paid and then take the 400 plus the monthly minimum and add that to the next highest and keep the other 400 for a rainy day you will still get paid off quick but will leave yourself some scratch if necessary

i think there are two questions here a is it better to continue living with your parents while you save up for a bigger down payment on a house or to move out as soon as possible b is it better to pay off a student loan and make a smaller down payment on the house or to keep paying on the student loan and use the cash for a larger down payment on the house regarding a this is mostly a personal priorities question you do n't say if you 're paying your parents anything but even if you are it 's likely a lot less than the cost of your buying your own home it is almost certainly economically better to stay with your parents but do you like living with your parents and do they like having you around or are they pushing you to move out are you fighting with them regularly do you just like the idea of being more independent if you 'd prefer to have your own place how important is it to you is it worth the additional cost these are questions only you can answer regarding b you need to compare the cost of the student loan and the mortgage loan start with the interest rates of each for the mortgage loan if your down payment is below a certain threshold 20 last time i bought a house you have to pay for the lender 's mortgage insurance so add that in if applicable if you are paying points to get a reduced interest rate factor that in too then whichever is more expensive that 's the one that you want to make smaller if one or both are variable rate loans well you say the student loan is fixed than you have to guess what the rates might be in the future

as others have pointed out it sounds like the problem is n't the accessibility of your money the problem is willpower so address that instead how   willpower is both a finite resource and a resource that can be increased like muscle strength   since willpower is finite break down the problem into as many pieces as possible then address only one of those pieces at a time be more sensible with my money is nebulous vague and large there 's no place to start   so break it apart first thing is the one example in your question you go out on payday with friends coworkers intending to only buy a couple of beers alcohol lowers willpower and end up blowing through far more so what about making a rule to not go out on payday   nice idea but that might still be too hard to do if you have a habit of going out with them on payday then this has become your community and you will feel the of not going out with them as well as the social pressure from them to do as you 've always done   so set up a different habit for that night one that both involves the obligation of going there instead and other people who will expect you to be there some examples would be a sport that happens to practice or compete on payday nights or some charity that happens to need you at that time   once you 've broken that habit and in the resulting of your wallet look for other similar leaks i 'm going to guess that all your money gets spent on going out to pubs as opposed say to buying bric a you do n't need if so then you need to face that you 've adopted a pub going culture and that your community has shrunk to just those kind of people it may seem like you have a lot of people in your life but if all it takes to lose connection to all of them is to stop going to pubs then you really do n't your human connections essential for an enjoyable life are too fragile too focused so if that 's the problem branch out diversify the communities you 're part of i 've already mentioned sport church is another good one i mean a living church the kind where the people are always doing stuff together and it 's fun to go to not the other kind where everyone sits in a pew for an hour a week and rushes the exits as soon as possible other possibilities are reaching out to neighbors or becoming politically involved   hmmm i started writing about willpower but i 'm ending up at community at your core do you feel like if you did n't spend this way that you would n't have any friends

the most fundamental answer is that when you short a stock or an etf you short a specific number of shares on a specific day and you probably do n't adjust this much as the price goes up and down but an inverse fund is not tied to a specific start date like your own transaction is   it adjusts on an ongoing basis to maintain its full specified leverage at all times   if the underlying index goes up it has to effectively buy in because its collateral is no longer sufficient to support its open position   on the other hand if the underlying index goes down that frees up collateral which is used to effectively short sell more of the underlying   so by design it will buy high and sell low and so any volatility will pump money out of the fund i say effectively because inverse funds use derivatives and contracts rather than actually shorting the underlying security    which brings up the less fundamental issue   these derivatives and contracts are relatively opaque the counter parties are in it for their own benefit not yours and the people who run the fund get their expenses regardless of how you do and they are hard for you to monitor   this is a hazardous combination

the biggest problem with penny stocks is that they are easily manipulated and they frequently are   many of the companies trading as penny stocks have poor track histories of accurate financials and what information that is available is not very reliable or verifiable i recall a few years ago when there were articles out there in financial circles talking about how more than a few penny stocks were being manipulated by organized crime another big issue with penny stocks is liquidity   since they 're so thinly traded not a great deal of daily volume anyone who puts enough money into a penny stock to make it worth the effort almost certainly becomes the biggest trader in the stock which can make it tough to liquidate positions   there are not enough market makers in the stock to be competitive so you have to accept the bid ask prices of whoever is willing to execute the trades so the margins evaporate quickly penny stocks are something you can trade if you 're bored have money to burn and just want to toy around with something just for the heck of it that you 'll ultimately lose out on

to know if a stock is undervalued is not something that can be easily assessed else everybody would know which stock is undervalued and everybody will buy it until it reaches its true value but there are methods to assess the value of a company i think that the 3 most known methods are if the assets of the company were to be sold right now and that all its    debts were to be paid back right now how much will be left this    remaining amount would be the fundamental value of your company that method could work well on real estate company whose value is more or less the buildings that they own minus of much they borrowed to acquire them it 's not really in the case of facebook as most of its business is immaterial i know the value of several companies of the same sector so if i want    to assess the value of another company of this sector i just have to    compare it to the others for example you find out that internet companies are being traded at a price that is 15 times their projected dividends its called a price earning ratio then if you see that facebook all else being equal is trading at 10 times its projected dividends you could say that buying it would be at a discount a company is worth as much as the cash flow that it will give me in    the future if you think that facebook will give some dividends for a certain period of time then you compute their present value this means finding how much you should put in a bank account today to have the same amount in the future this can be done by dividing the amount by some interest rates so if you think that holding a share of a facebook for a long period of time would give you at present value 100 and that the share of the facebook is being traded at 70 then buy it there is another well known method a more quantitative one this is the capital asset pricing model i wo n't go into the details of this one but its about looking at how a company should be priced relatively to a benchmark of other companies also there are a lot 's of factor that could affect the price of a company and make it away from its fundamental value crisis interest rates regulation price of oil bad management and even by applying the previous methods the value itself will remain speculative and you can never be sure of it and saying that you are buying at a discount will remain an opinion after that to price companies you are likely to understand financial analysis corporate finance and a bit of

the failure of the facebook ipo has everything to do with public access to markets it certainly was overvalued at issue and there were a host of other problems as well but the main issue that has caused the problem is that there were too many armchair analysts in on it less investors got in on facebook at $ 38 + because they liked facebook and everyone they knew liked facebook by and large they could n't read a balance sheet or describe how the firm made money as such as soon as it began to decline they sold without regard for the loss very few if any professionals actually it at launch and more than one pro shorted the position and cleaned up i find it humorous that while most people would never think of trying to buy a house a realtor they are perfectly happy buying thier own stocks without professional advice say what you want about the finance industry but for the vast majority of people having an advisor is a far smarter option

you want to know if you should pay cash or use a credit card like cash there are so many benefits to the card like purchase protection cash back and postponed payments that there needs to be a really good reason to pay cash   if you are concerned about the 10 threshold ask your credit card company to raise your limit   if you are indifferent let the merchant decide for you by asking for a discount if you pay cash   the biggest reason is that credit cards when handled make your money work for you by keeping it in less liquid higher interest investments like inflation adjusted t bills you will still be able to access it by using the credit card to float large expenses without liquidating at a loss investment accounts like schwab one are great for this since you can borrow cash at a low interest rate against your securities until your security sale clears

there 's too much here for one question so no answer can possibly be comprehensive   i think little of gold for the long term i go to moneychimp and see what inflation did from 1974 till now $ 1 to $ so $ 200 inflates to $ 950 or so gold that but hardly stayed ahead in a real way the stock market blew that number away and buying gold anytime around the 1980 would still leave you behind inflation   as far as housing goes i have a theory take median income 25 of a month 's pay each month input it as the payment at the going 30yr fixed rate mortgage income rises a bit faster than inflation over time so that line is nicely curved slightly upward give or take but as interest rates vary that same payment buys you far more or less mortgage when you graph this you find the bubble in 's graph almost non existent   at 12 the rate in 85 or so $ 1000/mo buys you $ 97 k in mortgage but at 5 $ so over the 20 years from 85 to 2005 there 's a gain created simply by the fact that money was cheaper no mania no bubble not at the median anyway just the interest rate effect over the same period inflation totaled 87 so the same guy just keeping up with inflation in his pay could then afford a house that was the price 20 years prior   i 'm no rocket scientist but i see few articles ever discussing housing from this angle to close my post here consider that homes have grown in size on average so the median new home quoted is actually 1/3 greater in size in 2005 than in 85 these factors all need to be normalized out of that crazy schiller type graph in the end i believe the median home will always tightly correlate to the one week income as payment   i refer here to the work of professor robert schiller partner of the case schiller index of home prices which bears his name

this sounds like an accounting nightmare to be 100 precise   with each payment you 're going to have to track if you can account for those then the fair thing to do is for one person to stop paying after they have paid the amount of principal they had at the beginning of the process or possibly after they have paid an amount equivalent to the total principal and accrued interest they would have paid if they paid their loans individually    the problem is one of you is likely going to pay more interest than you would have under the individual plan   in the example you gave if your brother pays off any of your loans he is going to be paying more in interest than if he paid on his 5 loans if you pay the highest rate loans first whoever has the lower total balance is going to pay more interest since they 'll be paying on the higher rates until they 've paid their fair share    i do n't see a clean way for you to up the interest savings appropriately unless you at the very end of the process    math aside these types of agreements can be dangerous to relationships what if one of you decides that they do n't want to participate anymore what if one of you gets all of their loans paid off much earlier they get the joy of being debt free while the other still has all of the debt left what if they then do n't feel to pay the other 's remaining debt are you both equally committed to cutting lifestyle in order to attack these debts in my opinion the complexity and risk to the relationship do n't justify the interest savings

ok so by doubling down you mean when i said that ms as well as 3/4 of the country do n't consider sexual orientation a protected class ok then apparently i am not the only one who has their mind made up    you entire argument is based on it being a protected class it is but only in a few states ms is not one of them i agree that they should not think like that and their business should hurt because they are but that does not mean another business can do the same thing because you agree with them   it is ok to have a difference of opinion but you seem to think that a company providing a service based on their bias is ok for some and not for others how can you not see the similar aspects of the two    i agree with you that ms is wrong in this case and i also agree that the nazi are wrong we are on the same side but i do n't think that paypal should get a free pass when it aligns with my thinking they are not offering service based on an ideal the businesses in ms were as well so i think they are both wrong and should be blasted in public either you can show biased when dealing with customers or you ca n't it is that simple    you are agreeing with a company choosing to do business with whom they want to but then you are doubling down on having another business doing the same thing because you think that sexual orientation is a protected class everywhere   if it was we would not be having this discussion but here we are you are trying to have it both ways i do n't know how else to explain it

there will be no police involved the police do not care only the feds care and they only care about large amounts over $ 100,000 what will happen is that the teller will deposit the money like nothing is unusual but the amount will trigger a suspicious transaction report to be filed by the bank this information goes to the us treasury and is then circulated by the treasury to basically every agency in the government the department of defense the fbi the nsa the cia the the irs etc what happens next depends on your relationship with your bank and the personality of the bank in my case i have made large cash transactions at two different banks one that i had a long relationship with and another that i had a long standing but dormant account the long term one was a high end savings bank in a city the dormant one was one of those retail banks think citizens or bank of america in a suburb the long term bank ignored my first deposit but after i made some more including one over $ 50,000 in cash they me via a letter i went in talked to the branch manager and explained why i was making the deposits he said that sounds plausible and that was the end of the interview it is unlikely that they transferred the information they probably just wrote it down they did this because they have know your customer regulations and they wanted to be able to prove that they did due diligence in case anybody asked about it later the suburban bank never asked any questions but they did file the in general there is no way to know if the bank will interview you or not it depends on a lot of different factors the basic factors are how much money is it are you doing a lot of business normally and how well does the bank know you if you refuse to answer the bank 's questions to their satisfaction it is a 100 chance that they will close your account they can also file higher level reports that flag your activity as highly suspicious as opposed to just the normal suspicious as long as it is a bank employee you should have no serious concerns unless the guy seems strange and asks really pointed questions if you have any question whether the employee is legitimate just verify that he she is a bank employee obviously if the feds visit you you should say nothing the chance of this happening is 1 in a million

i think starbucks makes it difficult for burger places   years ago it was unheard of to spend 4 or 5 bucks on a drink   now starbucks is taking fast food places out of the market unless they have something light or that at least taste light so a person can   feel comfortable eating at a burger joint and still purchase starbucks drink later in the day or vice versa   also all the other fast food restaurants have been like slow to breakfast fast food chains in the future need to carve the brand out of breakfast and prominent light tasting options and they should be able to take some of and starbucks market share

in general i 'd say yeah if you can pay cash pay cash if you pay cash then by definition you pay zero interest if you get a loan you 'll pay interest most people get a loan to buy a car because they do n't have the cash possible reasons not to pay cash when you could one technically you can pay cash but if you did you would have little or no reserve for emergencies like if the car costs say $ and you have $ in your bank account then technically you could afford to pay cash but you probably should n't because you do n't want to have just $ 10 left what if tomorrow something comes up two arguably you have a place to invest money that pays more than the interest on the loan like say you can get a car loan for whatever the going rate is today say 6 and you know a place to invest your money that is very safe and almost guaranteed to pay 10 it would make sense to borrow to buy the car invest the cash and then withdraw money from the investment to make the payments on the car you 'd end up 4 ahead there are a lot of catches to that strategy though the biggest is that the more the investment pays the more likely that it is risky if you thought the investment would pay 10 but it ends up paying only 4 then you will lose money by this strategy also there 's the psychological element many people say and fully intend to invest their money but then find other things they want to buy and so spend it instead if you pay cash you 're committed

what you want is a position transfer likely by    this is a transfer from one ira to another without having to liquidate positions to do so   in effect the brokerage firm is just transferring records from your existing ira to your new ira   you will need to watch out to make sure your new ira account can hold your positions for this to work   for example some brokerages allow you to hold fractional shares but others do n't   the fractional share amounts would be sold automatically prior to transfer   another example might be different fund families could be allowed between different brokerages the general process is open your new ira account initiate the from your new account your old ira account brokerage sends the positions over and after a week or so your new ira brokerage notifies you that everything is transferred i 've switched iras a couple times via this mechanism and never been charged a fee but i 've always stuck with the larger brokerages like fidelity td ameritrade and interactive brokers

it will not hurt your score to pay off your debt   it will allow your score to start healing as you plug the holes in your report what is crucial is how you pay off the debt   make sure you get in writing that paying $ x amount will fully satisfy the debt and will close the matter as in pay to delete   if you try to do a settlement this is very important also the moral brigade will not like my answer but if you are close to seven years out on your debts you might as well not pay them since they will fall off of your report after 7 years   if you pay any part of the debt however it will often reset the clock on those 7 years so tread carefully

two come to mind never finance a depreciating asset if you ca n't pay cash for a car you ca n't afford it if you decide you can finance at a low rate and invest at a higher one you 're leveraging your capital   the risk here is that your investment drops in value or your cash flow stops and you are unable to continue payments and have to sell the car or surrender it there are fewer risks if you buy the car outright   there is one cost that is not considered though   opportunity cost    since you 've declared transportation necessary i 'd say that opportunity cost is worth the lower risk assuming you have enough cash left after buying a car to fund your emergency fund which brings me to my final point   be sure to buy a quality used car not a new one   your emergency fund should be able to replace the car completely in the case of a total loss where you are at fault and the loss is not covered by insurance tldr my opinion is that it would be better to pay for a quality efficient basic transportation car up front than to take on a debt

i think it depends on how you 're approaching paying off the credit card if you 're doing some sort of debt snowball and/or throw all available cash at the card it 's not likely to matter much if you 're paying a set amount close to the minimum each month then you 're probably better off getting a loan use it to pay off the card and cut up the card well i 'd do the latter in either case mathematically it would matter if the interest rate on the card is higher than the personal loan but if you 're throwing every spare dime at the card and the some it might not matter another option if you have the discipline to pay the debt off quickly is to see if you can find a card with a cheap balance transfer move the balance over and close the inflexible card

let 's say a stock trades at $ 100 right now and you can buy a $ 100 call option when you buy the call option and the money you paid is gone one of two things can happen the share price goes up or the share price goes down   if the share price goes up you profit if the share price goes down you do n't lose because once the shares are below $ 100 you do n't exercise the call option and you do n't lose any money   so if you have a share that is rock solid at $ 100 you do n't make money if you have a share where the company owner took some ridiculous risk and the shares could go to $ 200 or the company could go bankrupt then you have a 50 chance to make $ 100 and a 50 chance to not lose anything that 's much more preferable

if i have a house that its market value went from $ 100k to $ 140k can i get heloc $ 40 k maybe the amount that you can borrow depends on the market value of the house so if you already have $ 100k borrowed against it it will be tough to borrow another $ 40k without paying a higher interest rate since there is a real risk that the value will decrease and you will be underwater    can i again ask for heloc after i finish the renovation in order to do more renovation and maybe try to end up renovating the house so its value raises up to $ 500k i doubt you can just renovate a house and increase its market value from $ 140k to $ 500k.   much of a house 's value is determined by its location and you can quickly a neighborhood   if you put $ in improvements in a neighborhood where other homes are selling for $ 140k you will not realize nearly that amount in actual market value   people that buy $ 500k houses generally want to be in an area where other homes are worth around the same amount    if you want to to a major renovation such as an addition i would instead shop around for a home improvement loan   the main difference is that you can use the expected value of the house after improvements to determine the loan balance instead of using the current value once the renovations are complete you roll it and the existing mortgage into a new mortgage which will likely be cheaper than a mortgage + heloc the problem is that the cost of the improvements is generally more than the increase in market value   it also helps you make a wise decision versus taking out a $ 40k heloc and spending it all on renovations only to find out that the increase in market value is only $ 10k and you 're now underwater so in your case talk to a contractor to plan out what you want to do which will tell you how much it will cost   then talk to a realtor to determine what the market value with those improvements will be which will tell you how much you can borrow   it 's highly likely that you will need to pay some out of pocket to make up the difference but it depends on what the improvements are and what comparable homes sell for

1 how long have you had the car   generally accounts that last more than a year are kept on your credit report for 7 years while accounts that last less than a year are only kept about 2 years iirc could someone correct me if that last number is wrong 2 who is the financing through   if it 's through a used car dealer there 's a good chance they 're not even reporting it to the credit bureaus i had this happen to me the dealer promised he 'd report the loan so it would help my credit i made my payments on time every time and nothing ever showed up   it pissed me off because another positive account on my credit report would have really helped my score   banks and brand name dealers are more likely to report the loan 3 what are your expected long term gains on the stocks you 're considering selling and will you have to pay capital gains on them when you do sell them   the cost of selling those stocks could possibly be higher than the gain from paying off the car so you 'll want to run the numbers for a couple different scenarios optimistic growth pessimistic etc and see if you come out ahead or not 4 are there prepayment penalties or costs associated with paying off the car loan early   most reputable financiers wo n't include such terms or they 'll only be in effect during the first few months of the loan but again it depends on who the loan is through in short it depends   i know people hate hearing answers like that but it 's true   hopefully though you 'll be able to sit down and look at the specifics of your situation and make an informed decision

ever wonder why certain businesses wo n't accept certain credit cards the sign above the register saying sorry we do n't accept it 's because they do n't want to pay that credit card company 's transaction fees one of the roles of the credit card company is to facilitate the transaction process between the customer you and the store and now that using credit cards over cash or check is so ingrained in our culture it creates extra work for the customer to make purchases at an establishment that is cash only credit card companies know this and so do businesses so businesses will partner with credit card companies so that customers can use their cards this way everything is handled electronically this can also benefit the business since there 's added security as they 're not dealing with cash directly and they do n't have to manually count as much cash later however a business may only budget a certain amount of their profits they want taken by credit card transactions so if a company 's fees are too high say for example and they are banking on you already having a visa card the company is n't going to go out of its way to provide the option for you if it were free for the business to use a credit card company 's service at their stores then they would all just provide the option for every card so the credit card company making money is all contingent on you spending your money by using their credit card you use the card and the store pays the company for the transaction

every company has capital even if you have a one man company you probably stated something like 100 shares of $ 1 each which means you had to take that $ 100 out of your own private pocket and pay it into the company   when the company loses money and runs out of cash they have the possibilities of 1 borrowing some money from the bank or from a loan shark 2 borrowing some money from the company owners or 3 increase the share capital for example by increasing the number of shares to 10,000 and each share holder pays his part of the $ 9,900 that 's the case that you have here   however it is only a liability in the sense that it is n't money the company earned it is money that the owners paid in they have no right to get the money back the paid in capital is actually what the owners lose if a limited company goes bankrupt

although this is off topic since it is about economics i 'm going to write a short answer in case it is decided that it is on topic i will remove this if it gets migrated the key to why printing extra money causes inflation and a change in exchange rate has nothing at all to do with whether or not it is announced or done in secret the quantity of money in circulation by whichever measure is what informs the value of the currency not whether you tell people that it has changed or not announcing it should increase the volatility somewhat around the time of the announcement but the long term effects will be the same no matter what whether or not they announce it printing more money will mean that there is more in circulation which will reduce the value of each unit of the currency by the dilution amount which in turn will increase inflation and decrease the exchange rate

yes as a general case insurance proceeds are repaying you for the damage that you have already incurred not specifically for fixing anything   since you have the legal right to sell the house as is without fixing it up at all then you have the legal right to spend the insurance proceeds how you see fit you can upgrade downgrade alter or replace your deck in any reasonable way or do nothing     you should call your agent and make sure that there is nothing unusual in your policy but this kind of homeowner decision what materials or methods to fix damage to a home is very normal and so your agent will probably you and end the conversation without a second 's thought

it 's not only a matter of staying calm when being up or down you must keep yourself from chasing a stock that appears to be running away or from betting all your money that say a crash will happen tomorrow because that would be great for you use your head not your heart empathy you need to understand what other speculators investors institutions and algorithms are going to do when there is a new development or technical signal and why for publicly traded corporations fundamentals and technical indicators only have the value that their algorithms choose to assign to them at that particular moment and every stock has a different population trading it there is no rule of thumb patience to trade successfully you must avoid trading at all costs heh if you ca n't find any good trade to do do n't open positions in order to meet your targets buy a new smartphone or to fight boredom diligence if your strategy relies on tight stops do n't make exceptions if your strategy relies on position sizing do n't close when you are a few points down luck in the end almost every trade can turn against you very badly you must prepare for the worst and hope for the best you ca n't buy luck or get luckier but you can attempt to stack probabilities diversify buy options to insure your positions reduce holding time avoid known volatility events etc

do you mean how much income tax the irs will assess loans are not income therefore they do not incur income tax so as long as the money is n't being given but being loaned you do n't have to pay income tax on it and just in case you think there 's a loophole of instead of paying my workers i 'll just loan them their paychecks and then forgive the debt at the end of the year no the irs does consider loan forgiveness to be a form of income so you need to look at whether the loan is going to you or whether your business is a separate legal entity that is getting the money if it 's a capital contribution then you are selling a stake in your company or more precisely as long as the money is going into the business the company is selling a stake in itself in that case there generally is n't tax owed here 's a question that touches on this

your plan will work to increase your total credit capacity good for your credit score and reduce your utilization also good   as mentioned you will need to be careful to use these cards periodically or they will get closed but it will work the question is whether this will help you or not   in addition to credit capacity and utilization your credit score looks at things like these factors may hurt you as you continue to open accounts   you can easily get to the stage where your score is not benefitting much from increased capacity and it is getting hurt a lot by pulls and low average age btw you are correct that closing accounts generally hurts your score   it probably reduces average age may reduce maximum age reduces your capacity and increases your utilization

this question is about property acquired before becoming a resident of the us if you bought property before you were a resident and sold it after you were a resident then you pay capital gains tax on the whole thing just see if it qualifies for long term capital gains tax treatment because it is a substantially lower tax rate you either have a tax event or you do n't and there 's nothing wrong with an audit to prove that so do n't worry too much about it unless you have a legitimate reason to be worried simply having what you perceive as a lot of money does n't make the possible lack of taxes more or less serious if he has things that have declined in value he can sell them at a loss this year and buy identical assets immediately this is called tax harvesting and creates a loss that can offset capital gains tax

you should start by calling the clinic and asking them to tell you how the visit was coded some clinics have different billing codes based on the complexity of the visit if you have one thing you are seeing the doctor about that could be coded differently than if you have 4 things you are seeing the doctor about in fact even if you are there just for one but while you are there you happen to ask a few quick questions about other possible ailments the doctor could decide to use the billing code for the higher complexity if when speaking to the billing department it is determined that the visit is using a higher complexity billing code and a higher charge as a result you could then request that it be re coded with the lower complexity visit realize if you request that they will probably have to first get approval from the doctor that saw you note i am basing this answer on first hand experience about 6 months ago in illinois where the situation i described happened to me because i asked some unrelated questions about other possible ailments at the end of a visit to an after hours clinic the billing department explained that my visit was coded for 4 issues 3 of them were quick questions i asked about at the end of the visit one of which she referred me to another doctor my additional questions probably extended the visit by 3 4 minutes in my case i never got the bill reduced mainly due to my own laziness and my knowing that i would hit my deductible anyway this year of course i ca n't say for sure if this is what happened in your case or even if this practice is widespread this was the first and only time in my life that i encountered it as a side note your primary doctor would likely rarely ever bill you for a more complex visit as it likely would n't lead to much repeat business as for your last question regarding your credit if the provider decides to lower the price and you pay the lower price this in no way can affect your credit surprising update when i called the billing office months ago i had asked if they could confirm the code with the doctor and i was told they would look into it i never heard back never followed up and assumed that was the end of it well today i got a call back months later and was informed that they had re coded the visit which will result in a lower charge it 's still pending the insurance adjustment but at some point in the future i expect to receive either a credit on my next statement or a check in the mail the price difference pre insurance in my case has gone from $ to $ 235 update i did receive a check for the difference the check was dated july 20 2016 which is just over 2 months after the phone call informing me i would receive it

yes but the rates at which they 're borrowing make all the difference   japan 's central bank is borrowing at about 2 percent on a 30 year bond and greece is borrowing at 18 percent japan would thus be paying 4.6 of gdp on debt service for government borrowing while greece would thus be paying 27 assuming that all current bonds could be converted to current rates    markets rates bonds government bonds stats money long html    further as many other commenters have noted japan retains the ability to print money and thus inflate their debt away while greece relies on the european central bank which would not the entire eurozone to help out greece 's government   as a comparison the us is currently paying 1.3 of its gdp on government debt service    my calculations are amateur please correct me if i 'm wrong   as dean baker blogs blog the interest burden of the debt   it is important to remember that most of the people in washington debates on economic policy do not know much economics they tend not to be very good at arithmetic either that is why they were blindsided by the collapse of the $ 8 trillion housing bubble that wrecked the economy   as we get endless about the crushing debt burden it is worth touching base with reality on occasion in that spirit brings you the latest data and projections on the ratio of the federal government 's interest payments to gdp courtesy of the congressional budget office cbo   interest to gdp ratio is currently at a crushing 1.3 percent near the post world war ii low however this figure the burden somewhat last year the federal reserve board refunded almost $ 80 billion to the treasury this was interest earned on government bonds and other assets it now holds that leaves a net interest burden of 0.8 percent of gdp by far the lowest of the post world war ii era   tl;dr what matters is not total size of debt alone but also borrowing costs and ability to inflate the debt away japan is paying very little on its large debt greece is paying a lot    tl;dr tl;dr i 'd like to borrow a few trillion dollars at 2 too

i use 10-k and to understand to read the disclosed risk factors related to a business sometimes they are very comical but when you see that risk factor you can understand how it will effect the company for example one company 's risk factor stated that if elizabeth warren becomes head of the consumer financial protection bureau we will have a hard time so we are expanding in mexico and taking our politically unfavorable lending practices there i like seeing how many authorized shares there are or if there are plans to issue more an example was where i heard from former employees of a company how gullible the other employees at that company were and how they all thought they were going to get rich or were being told so by upper management poor questionable misleading management is one of my favorite things to look for in a company so i started digging into their sec filings and saw that they were going to do a reverse split which would make the share prices trade higher while experiencing no change in market cap but then digging further i saw that they were only changing the already issued shares but keeping the authorized shares at the much larger amount of shares and that they planned to do financing by issuing more of the authorized shares i that this would mean the share prices would drop by after the reverse split and you mean to tell me that nobody realizes this employees or the broad market i was almost tempted to stand outside their office and ask employees if i could borrow their shares to short because there was n't enough liquidity on the stock market this was almost the perfect short but it was n't liquid or have any options so not perfect after all it traded from $ 20 after the reverse split to $ i like understanding how much debt a company is in and the structure of that debt like if a loan shark has large payments coming up soon this is generally what i use those particular forms for but they contain a lot of information a lot of companies are able to act they way they do because people do not read

gt the fact that there is way more educated people than is even remotely necessary    yes you got it    i agree with you and this is the bottom of line of the whole story   once to finish high school was not an easy accomplishment to be accepted to college was an accomplishment to survive the first year was an accomplishment and not to mention to graduate with a bachelor degree   the few who managed to accomplished that were accomplished men and women who got full benefits of their accomplishments guaranteed   today also as a former professor in college i can tell you you that anyone graduates from high school no student left behind everyone many barely know how to read write or even tackle a simple logical question and same in college i was told i ca n't fail my students except in extreme cases   so what do we have here you said it correct and clearly   having a college degree drives the value down for everybody which is exactly what is happening   further it 's just an industry to make money put people into debt give them almost worthless pieces of papers force them to also study for a master 's degree and reduce the pay for qualified people with degrees even harvard you would think that for $ tuition you get good education instead you are put in a with 500 other students for lectures   gt things need to be turned on their head    yes you got it here too   gt i propose that colleges need to receive their income as a percentage of the first 10 15 years of income from their students   disagree i propose to make the requirements for finish high school and college degrees much much higher as it was in the past   as you said too many people have worthless degrees   the few who get degree are accomplished people and will reap the benefits including their employers    this is also the best formula for people to come out of poverty and low social economic family background   right now if you are smart but from a poor background oh yes you get a degree but it 's worthless and wo n't help you much    but if the requirements are high and you are smart you are all set   as for people who fail high school and do n't get degrees they will not be spoiled as today 's kids with all their degrees someone needs to be a plumber electrician trade or a clerk and these jobs make very good many much better than bank tellers with a bachelor degree   finally there 's no way someone who graduate high school today even a relatively good student that they could survive high school of the 50s and 60s they will fail miserably also for bad attitudes discipline and capacity to handle simple requirements

apart from legal requirements to have insurance e.g. 3rd party car that other answers have covered well we can think of all insurance as protecting our usable income as we can use cashflow to pay the costs of a loan to replace whatever we decided not to insure     so for example if i do n’t insure my house contents i can replace them on my credit card if needed therefore we are paying for insurance out of our income so as to protect our income knowing that the cost of the protection is on average more than the benefit we get from it but we all know that having an income of $ 50 k is less than double the value of having an income of $ 25k.    e.g. being able to eat and remain warm is more important to us then being able to go on anther holiday   this is way when someone has a higher income it requires more money to effect their actions loss aversion is another factor we are people not logistical machines

in australia we have a 50 capital gain discount if you hold the asset for more than 12 months whether it is in shares property or other assets the main reason is to encourage people to invest long term instead of speculating or trading the government sees speculation or short term trading as more risky than long term investing for the everyday mum and dad investor so rewards people it sees taking the lower risk long term view in my opinion long term investing short term trading and speculation can all be risky for someone who is in the financial markets and the first rule of investing should be to consider the asset itself and not the tax implications

the key two things to consider when looking at similar identical etfs is the typical or indicative spread and the trading volume and size of the etf just like regular stocks thinly traded etf 's often have quite large spreads between buy and sell in the 1.5 range in some cases this is a huge drain if you make a lot of transactions and can easily be a much larger concern than a relatively trivial difference in ongoing charges depending on your exact expected trading frequency poor spreads are also generally related to a lack of liquidity and illiquid assets are usually the first to become heavily disconnected from the underlying in cases where the authorized participants aps face issues in general with stock etfs that trade very liquid markets this has historically not been much of an issue as the creation redemption mechanism on these types of assets is pretty robust it 's consequences on typical spread is much more important for the average retail investor on point 3 no this would create an arbitrage which an authorized participant would quickly take advantage of worth reading up about the creation and redemption mechanism here is a good place to start to understand the exact way this happens in etfs as it 's very key to how they work

i admit in the long term there are a good number of to work out but in the end i want to see some system where people in general can seize the means to their own well being without stepping on one another   the management you talked about is another reason why i prefer worker co ops to be the optimum form of issuing business because its not just a few people in charge it 's a whole social group acting in     when you discuss the mom and pop store having no suppliers it would be good to promote some way of each money supply to have a share of each industry within it   there are always some people in every trade looking for their next job   they just have to find a supply where there trade is in demand   the process is self feeding   next off or course the mechanism of the system would work in a way that firm 's ca n't just pay themselves with their own debt they have to issue it to their creditors first and even then it 's practically impossible to accept your own debt as payment   you would have to take some from a competitor at best     what i 've been trying to do is find some system where no one institution or no one alliance holds the keys to the definition of value   if you have five to eight dictators fighting at once as opposed to one financial dictator who can oversee all like the fed scenario you just described it 's more possible for people who are freer relatively to survive freely between the borders of these of influence as they can play each dictator off the other   at least from your dialogue i can see you 're one of those who gets what i 'm trying to aim for     here 's another idea i 've explored with it that 's similar but may make the environment slightly different so let me know what you think   what i call the revolving tax window where the government accepts different both in quantity and specific of notes in intervals of every business quarter so that the demand for specific notes changes four times a year   from january until the end of march they could accept taxes in notes from firms a f h and t and for april into june it could be just b and s and so on   the options for note issuing could be set on a list of firms registered with the sec or whoever    the combination for the quarter could be picked at random by a algorithm so no firm could make a plan to be a market dictator and a sense of is maintained in the economy     obviously the more firms are properly registered on this list the more combinations of monetary combinations you have and the more power is distributed from too much control by anybody     what you can do is choose whether or not you want there to be less or more notes in the next quarter because just like fiscal policy and conventional monetary policy the extremes have trade offs but different ones to few currencies the economy may be stimulated but you get market dictators via monetary oligopoly even if temporary   too many you avoid market dictators who will be more focused on getting a real return by investing in competing ventures based on what will actually return investment but the economy may not be as stimulated   what do you think of this structural alternative   one of the sources i 've been building my economic policy on has been debt the first 5,000 years by david if anyone 's familiar

in addition to the already good answers you also want to consider your time horizon unless you are looking out 10 + years building your down payment in an account that is invested in the market is probably subject to too much market risk are you willing to delay purchasing a home by five years if the market turns down at the wrong time a better option is to just use a savings accounts to avoid spending the money you can open a dedicated account separate savings account for a special purpose are s common feature at credit unions and probably are available at many regular banks as well then for funding the account many employers allow you to split direct deposits amongst multiple accounts so you will just need to provide the routing number and fractional amount of your paycheck for that account

while i think this is generally there are sites and communities dedicated to points churning credit card reward programs   in general no there is no easy way to get cash from a credit card and receive the spending rewards and not pay fees well in excess of your rewards value however there are people who figure out ways to do this kind of thing   like buying prepaid visa cards $ 500 at a time from drug stores on a 5 bonus rewards month   or buying rolls of $ 1 coins from the us treasury with free shipping the issue is the source of the fees   when you spend money on your card the merchant pays a fee   when you get cash from an atm not only is there no merchant remitting a fee there is an atm operator and a network both charging fees

in general we 're getting a more nuanced view of a proposition that might tend to influence policy amazon creates jobs is the implicit suggestion of the headline and it 's worthwhile to take a critical approach rather than simply accepting it as something that should influence our opinions   letting the mayor open an refinery in the centre of town also creates jobs after all but people tend to have an intuitive grasp of the costs that it would impose on the as a whole   you to what i think is a fear of developed information   having learnt of the disadvantage of a growing amazon to potential employees as compared to the preceding status quo we proceed on the assumption that the growth of amazon is a sufficient explanation for the disruption of that status quo and naively assume that we need merely prevent amazon 's business model from succeeding in order to restore the world to rights without examining any of the possible harms of our own intervention   that 's certainly something i can sympathize with   however while creative destruction describes something that does indeed happen it 's a bad idea to observe destruction and assume that either the process or the outcome is necessarily creative   destructive destruction is also a thing and it is inherently cheaper and easier than the creative variety   disruptive business models often succeed simply because they use technology to bypass regulatory traps for good or for ill   at times however this involves the discovery of a way to offload the costs of the enterprise onto society     a wonderful example of this would be bike sharing systems   where i 've seen them in north america in their first generation they tend to have physical parking stations to which the bikes must be returned   in china by contrast systems have developed where one need n't even return the bicycles to any particular location   one merely finds one wherever someone had parked it and it by scanning the code on it   the bicycles themselves are not a huge capital cost so convenience relies on a huge oversupply of bikes that have been parked dumped dropped or hidden by their previous riders all over the public space   effectively these companies have managed to make the municipal services responsible for their inventory management

i think most people have already answered this one pretty well   it 's usually worth it as long as you pay it off before the interest kicks in and you do n't get hit with any fees i just wanted to add one thing that no one else has pointed out   applying for the loan usually counts as a hard pull on your credit history   it also changes your debt to income ratio dti   this can negatively impact your credit score usually the credit score impact for these relatively small loans is n't that much   and your score will rebound over time   however if it makes your score drop below a certain threshold e.g. fico dips below 700 it could trip you up if you are also applying for other sources of credit in the immediate future not a big deal but it is something to keep in mind

the assumption that bonds have been issued with a negative coupon is not correct or at least is has not occurred thus far   we 'll look at this future possibility in the final paragraph for now lets look at the current bond market the issuance of government bonds which carry a negative gross redemption yield is the result of governments issuing bonds at an issue price which exceed the nominal redemption price and any coupon yield receivable over the life of the bond   i can find no instances of bonds with a negative coupon though many have tiny positive coupon yields the short seller of a bond with a negative gross redemption yield will be liable to pay the buyer the interest amount determined by the coupon   if the short seller has borrowed the bonds in order to sell them then the short seller will receive the interest due from the lender to offset the interest paid to the buyer   if the short seller has not borrowed the bonds but has sold them using some sort of synthetic contract such as a contract for difference then the short seller will pay the coupon without receiving any offsetting payment i thought this was an interesting question and it will be interesting to see if at some time in the future governments do ever issue bonds with a negative coupon   to date this does not appear to have happened so what would happen if we assume that a government issues a bond with a negative coupon   the buyer of the bond would be required to pay the equivalent yield to the government according to the bond contract specification   if an investor sells short such a bond they would then become entitled to receive the interest from the buyer   if they have borrowed the bonds in order to sell them short then they would pay any interest received back to the lender this chain should eventually end with the ultimate owner lender paying the government their dues   if they have sold short using a synthetic contract then presumably they would keep the interest from themselves

if i understand right you 're asking whether it 's better to withdraw a currency that is more valuable or less valuable in currency units than your home country 's currency   that is using your examples you 're asking whether it 's better to withdraw euros when the euro is worth more than the pakistani rupee or when the euro is worth less the answer is that it does n't matter   what matters is whether the euro is worth more pakistani rupees than it will be worth later   for instance suppose that the exchange rate today is such that you can buy 115 pkr for 1 eur or equivalently you can buy 1 eur for 115 pkr   realistically the rates would be different due to conversion fees but i 'll keep it this way for   if tomorrow the exchange rate changes so that you need 120 pkr to buy 1 eur then you have to spend more rupees to buy a euro so this is bad for you it would have been better to buy earlier when it was only 115 pkr for a euro   if on the other hand the exchange rate the other way so that you only need 110 pkr to buy a euro then this benefits you because you are spending less than you would have if you had bought earlier   so in these terms you want to change rupees into euros when one euro is worth fewer rupees and you want to change euros into rupees when one euro is worth more rupees it does n't matter how many pkr you spend for a euro in raw numbers   all that matters is are you spending more for that one euro than you would have spent had you bought earlier or later   indeed for your specific example it is unlikely that one rupee will be worth more than one euro in the foreseeable future as far as i can see the euro has never been worth less than about 50 rupees in practice of course it 's hard to know whether the current rate is good   you ca n't easily know how currency rates will change in the future   if you are just visiting for a short period of time it probably does n't make sense to worry about the exchange rates   just take out as much money as you need when you need it   you 're just as likely to lose money as to save money if you try to game the exchange rates   if you 're staying in a place for a longer period of time it might be worth pulling a bit extra out at a time when the rate is especially favorable but you 're still unlikely to see major savings in the long run

the answer depends on your wife 's overall situation whether you are in a community property state and other factors i 'm assuming that since your wife paid $ 5,000 more for a car than it was worth has a six year 25 auto loan and you talk about repossession as a routine event that her credit history is extremely poor if that is the case you 're unlikely to be able to refinance particularly for more than the car is worth you 're in a bad situation i 'd look for a legal clinic at a nearby law school and find out what the law says about your situation in your state if she has other debt your best bet is to put the car in a garage somewhere stop paying and demand better terms with the lender threaten bankruptcy if they do n't go for it and your wife has other debt she should look into bankruptcy given the usurious terms of the loan you have a fighting chance of keeping the car in a chapter 13 find out and the legal implications for this before proceeding if she does n't have other debt you need to figure out to get the thing repossessed on the best possible terms for you if it 's her mother 's car you 're in a moral dilemma   bottom line get rid of this thing asap and make sure that going forward you are both controlling the finances

the rate of spending growth is relevant the reason tax cuts are expected to pay for themselves is that they are expected to increase economic growth such that the absolute dollar amount of revenue is the same though it makes up a smaller relative proportion of the total economic value created over a period    this would be sufficient to pay for itself if spending growth were flat but if it 's growing particularly if it 's growing sharply just maintaining the same absolute revenue level wo n't be enough to pay the government 's bills   basically whether or not tax cuts pay for themselves depends on where we are on the laffer curve and on the level of spending growth hence my previous comment

this may be a bit advanced now but once you start really working and get a place i think this will apply more do i set up a bank account now yes there is no reason not to as an adult you will be using this much more than you think   assuming you have a little money you can walk in to any bank almost any day of the week and set up an account with them in very little time note that they may require you to be 18 if your parents wo n't be with you on the account otherwise just ask any bank representative to help you do this just to be clear if you can get a credit union account over a typical bank account this is a great idea credit unions provide exactly the same financial services as a normal bank but typically have variety of advantages over banks    bank account parts bank accounts typically have two parts a checking account and a savings account your checking account typically is what you use for most day to day transactions and your savings account is generally used for well saving money   having a bank account often gives you the following advantages they give you an ability to store money without having large amounts of cash on hand once you start working regularly you 'll find you wo n't want to keep + cash every two weeks in your wallet or apartment they help you pay bills when you set up your bank account you will likely be able to get a visa debit card which will process like a regular credit card but simply deduct funds from your checking account you can use this card online to pay utilities i.e. electricity and water general bills e.g. your cell phone and cable purchase items ex at amazon or use it in stores to pay in lieu of cash   be aware some banks will give you an atm only card before they send you the visa debit card in the mail this atm only card can only be used at atms as it 's name implies   similarly if you can invest about ~$200 to build your credit you can often get a deposit secured credit card attached to your account basically a credit card where the bank keeps your money in case you ca n't pay your bill if you treat this card with responsibility you can eventually transition to an unsecured credit card they save you hassles when cashing your check if you do n't have a bank where you can cash your check e.g. you do n't have an account you will likely be charged check cashing fees usually by places such as grocery stores or payday loan chains or even other banks furthermore if your check is over a certain amount some places may refuse to cash your check period and a bank may be your only option they give you a way to receive money electronically the most common example of this is direct deposit many employers will send your money directly to your bank account instead of requiring you to cash a check if they are prompt this money gets to you faster and saves you trouble on payday you 'll just receive a pay stub detailing your wages and the amount deposited rather than a check   also since you asked about taxes you should know that when you do eventually file with the irs they have an option to receive your tax refund electronically as well e.g. direct deposit into your bank account and that can literally save you months in some cases depending on when you file your return and how many paper checks they have to process does it cost money to setup it depends some banks have special offers some do n't most places will set up an account for free but may require a minimum deposit to open the account typically $ 50-$100 the visa debit card mentioned above generally comes free if you want a secured credit card as above you will want about an additional $ 200 so $ 250 $ 300 total note that this is absolutely not required you can exclusively use the visa debit card above if you wish bank account fees any fees charged when you have a bank account are usually minor anymore regardless the bank will hand you a whole bunch of paperwork mostly in legalese detailing exactly how your account works that said the bank person helping set things up will cover what you need to know about keeping the account in plain english the most common types of fee associated with a bank account are monthly maintenance fees and overdraft fees but these are n't always necessarily charged likewise there may be some other fees associated with the account but these vary from bank to bank   monthly maintenance fees to give some examples overdraft fees overdraft fees are typically charged when you attempt to spend more money than you have in your bank account and the bank has to cover these charges overdraft fees typically apply to using paper checks which it is unlikely you will be using but not always   that said it is very unlikely you will be charged overdraft fees for three reasons many banks have done away with these fees in lieu of other ways of generating revenue     banks that still charge these fees usually have overdraft protection options for a little more money a month effectively negating the possibility you will be charged these fees   the ability to deduct an amount of money from your checking account is now typically checked electronically before the payment is authorized that is using a visa debit card the card balance is checked immediately and even when using paper check most retailers have check scanning machines that do roughly the same thing on a personal note the bank that i have allows my account to be deducted below my checking account balance only if the payment is requested electronically e.g. someone who has my card information charges me for a monthly service in this case the funds are simply listed in the negative and deducted from any amount i deposit till the proper amount is repaid e.g. if i 'm at dollars due to a charge when my account balance was $ 0 and then i deposit $ 100 my available balance will then be $ 75 not $ 100 finally per the comment by while i minimize the likelihood you will be charged overdraft fees it is good to check into the exact circumstances under which you might be charged unexpectedly by your bank read the documentation they give you carefully including any mailed updates and you 'll reduce the chance of receiving a nasty surprise for reference here are some of the fees charged by bank of america what about taxes when you begin working an employer will usually have you fill out a tax form such as a w-4 employee 's withholding allowance certificate so that your employer can withhold the correct federal income tax from your wages if they do n't then it is your responsibility to calculate and file your own income taxes if you are self employed an independent contractor or paid under the table   if your employer is reputable they will send you additional information generally in february you need to properly file your taxes prior to april 15th the irs tax deadline for most people this additional information will likely be some variation of a w-2 wage and tax statement or possibly a form 1099-misc   do i have to worry about money in my bank account unless you have a significant amount in your bank savings account earning interest see should i save for the future below you wo n't have to pay any sort of tax on money in your bank account if you do earn enough taxable interest the bank will send you the proper forms to file your taxes how do i file taxes while it wo n't apply till next year you will likely be able to fill out a form 1040ez income tax return for single and joint filers with no dependents as long as you do n't have any kids in the meantime you will either mail in the paper form available at your local irs office post office public library etc or file electronically there will be a lot of information on how to do this when the time comes so do n't worry about details just yet   assuming your all paid up on your taxes very likely unless you get a good paying job and take a lot of deductions throughout the year on your w-4 you 'll probably get money back from the irs when you file your tax return as i mentioned above if you have a bank account you can opt to have your refund money returned electronically and get it much sooner than if you did n't have a bank account again possibly saving you literal months of waiting should i save for my future if so how much any good articles yes you should save for the future and start as soon as possible it 's outside the scope of this answer but listen to your economics professor talk about compound interest in short the later you start saving the less money you have when you retire   not that it makes much difference now but you have to think that over 45 years of working age 20 65 you likely have to have enough money for another 20 + years of not working 65 85 + so if you want $ 25,000 a year for retirement you need to make $ 75,000 a year between your job and any financial instruments you have savings account stocks bonds cds mutual funds iras job retirement benefits etc where you should stick money your money is a complicated question which you can investigate at length as you get older personally though i would recommend some combination of ira individual retirement account long term mutual funds and some sort of savings bonds there is a metric ton of information regarding financial planning but you can always read something like investing for dummies or you can try the motley fool 's how to invest online and highly recommended but i 'm only 17 so what should you do now budget sounds dumb but just look at your basic expenses and total them all up rent utilities phone cable food gas other costs and divide by two out of each paycheck this is how much money you need to save not to go into debt   try to save a little each month $ 50 $ 100 a month is a good starting amount if you can swing it you can always try to save more later invest early you may not get great returns but you do n't need much money to start investing often you can get started with as little as $ 20 $ 100 you 'll have to do research but it is possible put money in your savings account checking accounts do not typically earn interest but money in savings accounts often do that is the bank will actually add money to your savings assuming you leave it in there long enough unfortunately this rate of interest is only about 3.5 on average which for most people means they do n't get rich off it you have to have a significant amount of money $ 5,000 + to see even modest improvements in your savings account balance each month but still you may eventually get there get into the habit of putting money places that make you money in the long run do n't go into debt do n't get payday loans pawn items or abuse credit cards besides wrecking your credit even a small amount of debt $ 500 + can be very hard to break out of if you do n't have a great paying job and can even make you homeless no rent means no apartment   remember be financially responsible but assuming your parents are n't totally tight with money do n't be afraid to ask for cash when you really need it this is a much better option than borrowing from some place that charges outrageous interest or making your payments late have an emergency account as already mentioned in another excellent answer you need to have money to smooth things out when you encounter unexpected events your employer has trouble with your check you have to pay for some sort of repair bill you use more gas in your car in a month than normal etc anywhere from $ 200 $ 2000 + should do it but ideally you should have at least enough to cover a month of basic expenses build good credit avoid the temptation to get a lot of credit cards even if stores and banks are dying to give them to you you really only need one to build good credit preferably a secured one from your bank as mentioned above never charge more than you can pay off in a single month charging then paying that amount off before the due date on your next statement will help your credit immensely likewise pay attention to your rent utilities and monthly services cell phone cable etc even though these seem like options you can put off oh my electric bill is only $ 40 i 'll pay that next month late payments on all of these can negatively affect your credit score which you will need later to get good loans and buy a house   get health insurance now that the affordable care act aca a.k.a obamacare has been enacted it is now simpler to get health insurance and it is actually required you have some hopefully your employer will offer health coverage you can find reasonably priced coverage on your own or you live in a state with a health exchange even if you ca n't otherwise get afford insurance you may qualify for some sort of state coverage depending on income if you do n't have some sort of health insurance private or otherwise the irs can potentially fine you when you file your taxes not to be too scary but the fine as currently proposed is jumping up to about $ 700 for individuals in 2016 or so so even if you do n't grab health insurance which you absolutely should you need to save about $ 60 a month even if just for the fine   this answer turned out a bit longer than intended but hopefully it will help you a little bit welcome to the wonderful world of adult financial responsibility

gt   uber was n't trying to track everybody post ride for fun they were trying to model future demand for cars before somebody in they needed a ride     well i 'm sure that was one of the reasons even the primary reason perhaps    but it 's a bad idea to assume that companies are only using certain data in the ways you think they are    like when you pay with your credit card at a restaurant    you may expect them to keep a file linked to the card number so that they can track what people order over time    you probably do n't expect them to explicitly match your credit card to your fb li etc create a file of information about you with pictures and then use that info to instruct your server next time to talk about travel because you have a trip coming up    you probably do n't expect them to share your file with other restaurants so when you go to a different restaurant next week the server there knows to upsell you on the wine    you probably do n't expect them to sell that profile to data brokers who match all that to public record data like mortgages and car registrations in order to sell to yet other companies    but they do those things same deal with literally every company who obtains data    the correct calculation when deciding to give data to a company is n't what is the data and what do i think the company will do with it    the correct calculation is   what is the data   how can that data be combined with data about me from everywhere else social networks public records credit card transactions location data etc    who could potentially get their hands on it generally the company 's tech marketing partners and vendors + data brokers assume everyone    what 's the worst possible way that i imagine this could be used e.g. to show me ads for italian restaurants to show me higher prices because it looks like i 'm a big spender to prove that i 'm cheating on my wife etc    then if you 're still cool with giving them the data awesome    just remember that we have crappy memories but computers do n't    you might not recall that night in a hotel a few years ago but computers do you may not pick up on the subtle long term patterns in your own behavior like the fact that your totally random for a big mac occur predictably every 12 14 months but computers will

with a long enough time horizon no matter when you buy equities almost always outperform cash and bonds there 's an article here with some info holding period where shares have beaten cash   there was a similar study done which showed if you picked any day in the last 100 years no matter if the market was at a high or low after 1 year your probability of being in profit was only 0.5 but after 10 20 years it was almost certainly 1.0   equities compound dividends too and the best place to invest is in diversified stock indices such as the s&p500 or indices funds which pay dividends the best way to capture returns is to dollar cost average e.g. place a lump sum then add $ x every month to re invest dividends and oh to forget about it in an ira or sipp self invested pension or other vehicle which discourages tampering with your investment   yes values rise and fall but we humans are so short sighted if we had bought the s&p in 2007 and sold in 2009 in fear we would have missed out on the 25 gain excluding dividends from 2007 2014 that 's about 3 a year gain even if you bought the 2007 high cash or bonds even after the financial crisis now imagine had you dollar cost averaged the entire period from 2007 2014 where your gain would be your equity curve would have the same shape as the s&p with its drastic dip in 2009 but an accelerated growth after there are studies if you dig that demonstrate the above from experience i can tell you timing the market is nigh impossible and most fund managers are unable to beat the indices far better to dca and re invest dividends and not care about market gyrations

risk is the problem as others have pointed out your fixed mortgage interest rate is for a set period of time only let 's say your 3 might be good for five years because that 's typical of fixed rate in canada so what happens in five years if your investment has dropped 50 due to a prolonged bear market and interest rates have since moved up from 3 to 8 your investment would be underwater and you would n't have enough to pay off the loan and exit the failed strategy rather you might just be stuck with renewing the mortage at a rate that makes the strategy far less attractive being more likely to lose money in the long run than to earn any leverage or borrowing to invest amplifies your risk considerably if you invest your own money in the market you might lose what you started with but if you borrow to invest you might lose much more than you started with there 's also one very specific issue with the example investment you 've proposed you would be borrowing canadian dollars but investing in an index fund of u.s based companies that trade in u.s. dollars even if the index has positive returns in u.s. dollar terms you might end up losing money if the canadian dollar strengthens vs. the u.s. dollar it has happened before multiple times so while this strategy has worked wonderfully in the past it has also failed in the past unless you have a crystal ball you need to be aware of the various risks and weigh them vs. the potential rewards there is no free lunch

this is n't some new revelation pensions have been around for a long time and the bankruptcy code is complex and has developed over a long period of time along side it there is a strong reason why secured creditors are favored over unsecured creditors because we want creditors to actually make loans and finance operations investment expansion etc if you eliminate the secured creditors priority then loans do n't get made in the first place the company ca n't offer pensions let alone salaries because the company is n't likely to exist or at least it would be much smaller   the claims of employees are valid nobody is questioning that but they are just lower priority than those of secured creditors who only made loans on the promise that they could recover some assets if ever the loans go into default   this is also another reason pensions have gone out of style in favor of 401ks it is foolish to rely on whether a company will exist 10 20 or 30 years down the road companies are always rising and falling in the economy and there is no reason to expect one to just exist in perpetuity

if you know you will have a big bill like braces and you fully expect to hit the deductible then it can make sense the deductible can trip some people up because if they put too much into the limited purpose fsa and do n't hit the deductible for the regular insurance policy they ca n't get to all the money in the fsa because you have the ability to spend the potential money in the fsa before all the money has been contributed it can allow you to make that payment for the braces in january i did this the first year we had the hsa i knew i needed to pay a dental bill early in the year but the hsa would only have a few hundred dollars at that time so i used the limited purpose fsa to be able to make that payment this could also work if you spent a lot of money in the previous year because you have the ability to adjust how much money goes into the hsa each each pay period this idea does keep the option open to fully fund the hsa if your finances improve regarding the deductible   the law limits what you can use the limited purpose fsa for dental and vision only there is an exception if you hit the deductible for the high deductible insurance policy then you can use the funds in the limited purpose fsa for any medical reason   when i did this a few years ago i needed to send extensive paperwork to the company holding the funds before they would release the funds for dental once i sent them proof that i had met the deductible then any medical expense after that date could use the fsa with minimal paperwork if you fully fund the fsa beyond the cost of the braces and then have a light year medical expense wise you might not be able to spend all money in the fsa by the deadline regarding state taxes   i saw no difference in my states virginia treatment of the funds the state taxable income number was exactly the same as the federal taxable income number it did not treat the money in the fsa differently than the money in the hsa

the question states our insurance company is offering a 30 discount on an $    commercial policy if we install the insurance is paid in    two installments this appears to mean six monthly payments so i 'll make some comparison calculations using six monthly loan repayments to keep things simple without the loan or the insurance costs $ 4100 every six months using this loan payment formula the calculation below shows with the 30 discounted insurance maintenance and loan repayment you would be paying $ every six months   the discount required to break even is   i.e. rearranging the equation   alternatively with the discount of 30 you would break even if the six monthly repayment amount was $   solving the payment equation for s gives an equation for the loan   so with the 30 discount you would break even if the loan required was $ checking by back calculating the periodic payment amount a   likewise we can keep the loan at $ 40000 and solve for t to find the break even loan term   note in this formula log denotes the natural logarithm   now we can set some values   so with break even payments the $ 40000 loan is paid off in just under years   i.e. checking   this just beats the $ 4100 cost of proceeding without the notes if your loan repayment was monthly it would reduce the cost of the loan slightly   the periodic interest rate is calculated from the apr according to the method used in the eu and in some cases in us   the calculations above were run using mathematica

why do companies exist well the corporate charter describes why the company exists usually the purpose is to enrich the shareholders the owners of a company want to make money in other words there are a number of ways that a shareholder can make money off a stock as such maintaining the stock price and dividend payouts are generally the number one concern for any company in the long term most of the company 's business is going to be directed towards making the company more valuable for a future buyout or more valuable in terms of what it can pay its shareholders directly note that the company does n't always need to be worried about the specifics of the day to day moves of the stock if it keeps the finances in line solid profits margins earnings growth and the like and can tell people that it 's generally a valuable business it can usually shrug off any medium term as market some companies are more explicitly long term about things than others e.g. berkshire hathaway basically tells people that it does n't care all that much about what happens in the short term   of course companies are and they 're run by people to make the people running the company worry about the stock price you give them stock or stock options or something like that a major executive at a big company is likely to have a significant amount of stock if the company does well he does well if it does poorly he does poorly despite a few limitations this is really a powerful incentive if a company is losing a lot of money or if its profits are falling so it 's just losing a lot of its value as a business the owners stockholders tend to get upset and may vote in new management or launch some sort of shareholder lawsuit and as previously noted to raise funds a company can also issue new shares to the market as a secondary offering as well and they can issue fewer shares if the price is high meaning that whatever the company is worth afterward the existing owners own proportionally more of it

the thing is corporate taxes are n't paid on revenues or costs they 're paid on net income    meaning no matter what happens any investment the company makes that improves their net income automatically means more money for the company     so let 's say 12 vs 14 tax    a 2 increase in tax means a 2 lower net roi on the investment     but so long as the incremental improvement to your bottom line is there the investment is sound with or without taxes    even at a 50 corporate tax rate    you hire one more person at $ 60k yr and they make $ 120k yr in net income for you    you still keep $ 30k of the profits     it 's an incremental increase regardless   and if that person does n't make you money   say the incremental benefit is 0    well your net income just dropped $    and you just paid $ 30k less in taxes    meaning the true cost of that hire is $ 30k to your bottom line   where it hurts business is that your retained earnings do n't build up as fast    it makes the next investment harder to make is all    and as a corporation if you 're not paying dividends you need to keep reinvesting your retained

at unless you have a terminal illness you have many years to earn and save a lot more that you will have in your 401k right now unless you have already been extremely lucky in the market with your 401k investments this means that even if you lost everything in your 401k right now it probably would n't hurt you that much over the long term the net present value of all your future savings should far exceed the net present value of your 401k if you plan to earn and save responsibly so take as much risk as you want with it right now there is no real benefit to playing safe with investments at your age if you were asking me how much risk should you be taking with a $ 10 m inheritance and no income or much prospects of an income then i 'd be giving you a very different answer

thanks for the quick reply i 'd like to point out the post that triggered me to make this request in public is    reddit post   specific response   the sidebar says that political debate is not permitted in this forum and until recently i would say this request had been to but this particular ft article like others can be politically and therefore should n't be in r finance it belongs in r economics    unfortunately any posts that relate to current macroeconomic circumstances especially central banking and global unemployment will invite the ron and they really do n't add any sort of value to r finance and they do the forum and debate    i do n't think zerohedge ever has a place in this forum the source is not credible and always has too much of a political angle to be in a forum that has declared itself as not a place for politics

a cashier 's check costs money to get and is not connected to an account   you have cash   you should be able to get a bank to sell you one even without an account   find a bank where you would like to open an account and explain the situation   i ca n't guarantee that that will work but i would expect it to do so   if not the bank can probably suggest an alternative    you might also ask the landlord if you can do it with postal money orders   i am positive that you can buy those with cash   you might have to buy a bunch to reach your desired amount   or perhaps a western union money order might be better    you also might be able to open an account with your passport and social security number ssn

as far as taxes go if you contribute to the hsa account through your employer pre tax that amount is not subject to the social security 6.2 and the medicare 1.45 tax if you contribute that amount post tax you can deduct it from your income tax at the end of the year but the social security and medicare taxes have already been paid and there 's no mechanism to claim deductions on those

this sounds like a pretty cool idea and upon reflection maybe not so crazy as it sounded to me at first   one suggestion introduce some probably vaguely described rule change that makes it easy for people to contribute from their retirement account(s   that would allow you to plausibly increase the average contribution by a lot maybe from hundreds like described to thousands   if i were trying to do this right now i 'd gather as much money as i could obviously and try like hell to make alliances with pension funds and other major non profits that routinely buy a lot of common stock   then i 'd pick one fairly large bank and buy as much as possible   be aware of poison wiki and similar common arrangements that exist to prevent this sort of thing   partnering with other institutions would help to alleviate them   once i controlled with my new found buddies a major bank i 'd be quick to replace the board and fire senior management   i 'd do everything possible to get around paying any golden wiki   then make all the changes i want to the bank 's practices   the general idea would be that after this the threat of doing it to another bank would be enough to get them to change without actually having to pull off a corporate takeover

i disagree that they are taxis which is why i think that consumers should realize they do n't offer the same protections   the argument for more regulations is that taxis have regulations to keep people safe   well ok let 's go with that premise people are ok with ride sharing services because of the many added benefits but they also know that these services are n't taxis does everyone who uses them know they might be taking on an additional risk probably not but i 'd guess most people would be ok with fewer protections in order to use the added value from these services   basically it should n't have to be a level playing field if consumers willingly forfeit the protections taxis offer then that is their choice

i also do n't know the specific details for finland and/or belgium however many countries have tax treaties which generally prevent double taxation i.e. paying tax in both countries on the same base income being that both finland and belgium are eu member states i 'm quite certain there 's a provision that covers this and the same would apply you pay taxes on what you earn while in finland to finland and to belgium what you earn while in belgium all of this is similar to what you presented however there 's also a section where you 'd declare how much taxes were paid in other countries one other thing to note which will be the determining factor in the above is whether eu law requires you to change residence to be for the time you 're there if not   then you 'll be paying taxes in finland the entire time on the entire amount this comes from an irish governmental site by working in another member state and by transferring your residence there you are likely to become resident for tax purposes there the definition of fiscal residence varies from one member state to another you must comply with the laws of the country where you have established your residence the laws on personal taxation vary considerably from one member state to another and you may be liable for taxation in more than one country in general you are subject to income tax in the country where you are living but this may not be the case if you are a posted worker see below in general property is taxed in the country in which it is situated but again there are variations tax agreements have been concluded between most of the member states of the eu which are intended to avoid double taxation if you derive income from different countries in general national fiscal rules must respect the fundamental principle of non discrimination against nationals of another eu country

your understanding is incorrect   the date of record is when you have to own the stock by   the ex dividend date is calculated so that transaction before that date settles in time to get you listed as owner by the date of record if you buy the stock before the ex dividend date you get the dividend   if you buy it on or after the ex dividend date the seller gets the dividend

patience has never been my strong suit unfortunately this is what you need to build up credit the activities that increase your credit score are paying your bills on time and not using too much of the available credit that you do have the rest age of accounts recent pulls etc are short term indicators that indicate changes in behavior that will make lenders pause and understand what the reasons behind the events are also keep in mind that your credit score should n't run your life   it should be a passive indicator of your financial habits not something that you actively manipulate    is there anything i can do to raise my score without having to take out a loan with interest pay your bills on time and do n't take out more credit than you need   you 're already in the excellent category so there 's no reason to panic or try to manipulate it   even if you temporarily dip below if you need to make a big purchase house your loan to value and debt income ratio will be much bigger factors in what interest rate you can get   as far as the bofa card goes if you do n't need it cancel it   it might cause a temporary dip in your credit but it will go away quickly and you 're better off not having credit cards that you do n't need

basically yes do n't use your business account for personal spending because it may invalidate your limited liability protection transfer a chunk of money to your personal account write it down in your books as distribution or something similar and use it in whatever way you want from your personal account the irs does n't care per se but mixing personal and business expenses will cause troubles if you 're audited because you 'll have problems distinguishing one from another you should be using some accounting software to make sure you track your expenses and distributions correctly it will make it easier for you to prepare reports for yourself and your tax preparer and also track distributions and expenses i suggest gnucash i find it highly effective for a small business with not so many transactions if you have a lot of transactions then maybe quickbooks would be more appropriate

two more esoteric differences related to the same cause when you have an outstanding debit balance in a margin the broker may lend out your securities to short sellers   they may well be able to lend them out even if there 's no debit balance check your account agreement and relevant regulations    you 'll never know this there 's no indication in your account of it unless you ask and maybe not even then if the securities pay out dividends while lent out you do n't get the dividends directly   the dividends go to the person who bought them from the short seller   the short seller has to pay the dividend amount to his broker who pays them to your broker who pays them to you   if the dividends that were paid out by the security were qualified dividends 15 max rate the qualified goes to the person who bought the security from the short seller   what you received were n't dividends at all but a payment in lieu of dividends and qualified dividend treatment is n't available for them    some many   all brokers will pay you a gross up payment to compensate you for the extra tax you had to pay due to your qualified dividends on that security not actually being qualified a similar thing happens if there 's a shareholder vote   if the stock was lent out on the record date to establish voting eligibility the person eligible to vote is the person who bought them from the short seller not you   so if for some reason you really want need to vote in a shareholder vote call your broker and ask them to journal the shares in question over to the cash side of your account before the record date for determining voting eligibility

what i 've found works best when working on my personal budget is to track my income and spending two different ways bank accounts and budget categories here is what i mean when i deposit my paycheck i do two things with it it goes into my checking account so the balance of my checking account goes up by the amount of my paycheck i also deposit the money from my checking account into my various budget category balances   this is separate from my bank account balances   some of my paycheck money goes into my groceries category some goes into clothing some into car fuel entertainment mortgage phone etc   some goes into longer range bills that only happen once or twice a year such as car insurance life insurance property tax etc   some goes into savings goals of ours such as car replacement vacation furniture etc every dollar that we have in a bank account or in cash in our wallets is also accounted for in a budget category   if you add up the balances of our bank accounts and cash and you add up the balances of our budget categories they add up to the same number when we make a purchase this also gets accounted for twice the appropriate bank account or cash wallet balance gets reduced by the purchase amount the appropriate budget category gets reduced by the purchase amount in this way we do n't really need to worry about having separate bank accounts for different purposes   we do n't need to put our savings goal money in a separate bank account from our grocery money if we do n't want to   the budget category accounting keeps track of how much money is allocated to each purpose    now the budget category amounts are not spent yet the money in them is still in our bank account and we can move money around in the categories if we change our mind on how to allocate them   for example if we do n't spend all of our gas money for the month we can either keep that money in the gas category or we can move it to a different category such as the car replacement category or the vacation category   if the phone bill is more than we expect we can move money around from a different category to cover it now back to your question we allocate some money from each paycheck into our furniture category   but the money is not really spent until we actually buy some furniture   when we do the furniture category balance and bank account balance both go down by the amount of the purchase all of this can be kept track of on the computer in a spreadsheet   however it 's not easy to keep track of so many categories and bank balances   an easier solution is custom budgeting software designed for this purpose   i use and recommend ynab

overall since gold has value in any currency and is sort of the ultimate reserve currency why would anyone want to currency hedge it because gold is mostly priced in usd you currency hedge it to avoid currency risk and be exposed to only the price risk of gold in usd   hedging it does n't mean less speculative it just means you wo n't take currency risk edit responding to op 's questions in comment what happens if the usd drops in value versus other major currencies do you think that the gold price in usd would not be affected by this drop in dollar value use the etf $ gld as a proxy of gold price in usd the correlation between weekly returns of $ gld and us dollar index measured by major world currencies since the etf 's inception is around what this says is that gold may or may not be affected by usd movement it 's certainly not a one way movement there are times where both usd and gold rise and fall simultaneously is n't a drop in dollar value fundamentally currency risk per investopedia currency risk arises from the change in price of one currency in relation to another in this context it 's referring to the eur usd movement the bottom line is that if gold price in dollar goes up 2 this etf gives the european investor a way to bring home that 2 or as close to that as possible

salaries normally should n't fluctuate with inflation and deflation inflation prevents consumers from spending prices get too high ultimately taking money out of circulation this causes the market to go in to deflation or at least deflate back to normal that 's when people begin to spend again and start the cycle all over again now imagine if salaries increased with inflation inflation would never end everyone could keep affording the high prices a starbucks coffee would eventually cost $ 150 but the middle class would all be millionaires your small change would consist of a wad of useless bills and the government would have to continually print out more money just to keep up note this is not a direct answer to where goes delta but would more be directed to the part prices go up and salary does n't

their high savings is n't why they have to export capital the issue is that domestic depositors do n't have access to the sky high interest rates over the last 2 decades in china there is definitely correlation between asset levels and debt   i miss typed in my previous post i meant to say that the amount of debt is overstated because wealth is high relative to income due to the high savings rate   ultimately there is n't a good answer yet to your question the seminal work which has received many updates in the last 6 years that first attempted to understand the disconnect between the ultra high interest rate in china and the high levels of capital exports is called growing like china by song and published in the american economic review in 2011   global debt according to the is of gdp so china is actually a little below average in terms of total debt to gdp and when you 're growing at a year it is okay to lever up a little bit    on top of all of this the chinese government is well aware of these issues and will almost certainly make some comments october 18th and over the next week about debt growth   this is all complicating the issue though when you have a huge supply of money to lend interest rates fall and companies take on more debt so in general you would expect savings and debt levels to move together

first of all you 'll need a securities account nowadays most large banks offer this as a standard product for all their customers though it may require some extra paperwork then you need to buy shares in the etf this is indeed typically done through the stock market but there are alternatives some banks will sell securities to you directly but usually only those they create themselves options and such some also offer etf investment plans that allow you to buy shares for a fixed amount each month through the bank in any case the bank 's online banking interface should support all these options however fees are an important consideration with some banks the securities account is free others charge an annual fee and the fees on stock market transactions and investment plans also vary considerably so it could be worth it to consider some alternatives

there 's an ideological psychological aspect of this too apart from the practical problems eurozone leaders keep saying the mantra conversion to the euro is irreversible there are analogies of this in recent history it reminds me of the soviet leaders and their belief that communism is where history ends they genuinely thought that once a communist system is built up in a country it would stay forever they believed in the superiority of their system among other things this lead to the isolation of the soviet union from the west and the start of the cold war then in 1956 they were proven wrong with the hungarian revolution and while they tried to clean up the situation as fast as they could and forget about it their downhill inevitably started   back to the present you can easily see the importance of keeping greece in the ez if greece exits the illusion of the of the euro is gone and it would start to fall apart

it 's a matter of social policy the government wants people to make long term investments because that would lead to other long term government goals employment manufacturing economical growth in general while speculative investments and day trading are not in any way discouraged investments that contribute to the economy as a whole and not just the investor are encouraged by the lower tax rates on the profits while some people consider it to be a leaf i consider these people to be and dishonest claiming that long term social goals are somehow bad is hypocrisy claiming that short term trading contributes to the economy as a whole is a plain lie

yes it is indeed hard to get out of poverty but for the people that do and sacrifice it all in order to make a better life for their children would you then tax them so their children have to start over at nothing again   that sounds like poverty again and it does n't actually fix anything if unemployment benefits and higher taxes are the problems keeping people in poverty i do n't see how the solution should be to tax more so that we can what have more benefits programs that poverty   it feels good to demonize the rich because we all can participate the homeless can blame the $ 40k income can blame the $ 250k income can blame the $ 1 m income can blame the 1 because they have more stuff than we do but taking that stuff away does n't increase the standard of living for anyone it actually makes it more difficult for everyone

it includes whatever you want to do with your investment   at least initially it 's not so much a matter of calculating numbers as of soul searching   identifying your investment objectives means asking yourself why do i want to invest   then you gradually ask yourself more and more specific questions to narrow down your goals   for instance if your answer is something very general like to make money then you may start to ask yourself how much money do i want what will i want to use that money for when will i want to use that money etc   of course not all objectives are realistic so identifying objectives can also involve down plans that are too one thing that can be helpful is to first identify your financial objectives that is money you want to be able to have and things you want to do with that money   investment in the sense of purchasing investment vehicles likes stocks or bonds is only one way of achieving financial goals other ways include working for a paycheck starting your own business etc   once you identify your financial goals you have a number of options for how to get that money and you should consider how well suited each strategy is for each goal for instance for a financial goal like paying relatively small short term expenses e.g. your electric bill investing would probably not be the first choice for how to do that because a there may be easier ways to achieve that goal e.g. ask for a raise eat out less and b the kinds of investment that could achieve that goal may not be the best use of your money e.g. because they have lower returns

while technically true a card issuer can cancel your card for almost any reason they want it 's highly unlikely they 'll cancel it because you pay your bills there are many many people out there that pay their bills in full every month without ever paying a cent in credit card interest i would n't ever purposefully incur any interest on a credit card related anecdote i used to have a credit card that i only used for gas purchases because they gave 5 off for fuel the issuer eventually discontinued the program i assume because people like me took advantage of it so while they did n't cancel my card the bonus eventually went away i miss that card my conclusion if you can take advantage of promotional rates by all means go for it you do n't owe them any favors enjoy it as long as it lasts

research on drugs should be publicly funded in universities the private sector only invests when the hard work has been done the internet it 's a good example massive public funding in the beginning when there were profits to be made suddenly the private sector woke up the researchers that work in those pharma companies were mostly trained and educated in top universities with a mix of their tuition fees and public money then the pharma companies hire them and make billions off of their knowledge fuck that universities should do the research own the patent price it fairly according to a public democratic decision and let any y produce the drug competing on how efficiently it can produce it besides there is too much of a vested interest for making profit for private pharma so they continuously push drugs that are detrimental to society like opioids only the public sector can afford to loose money in dead end research and make up for it later

there are not always capital efficient ways for a company to reinvest its own profits this is why dividends exist   imagine a company will reinvest 80 of its profits into a project with a huge projected return but the other 20 of the company 's profits can not be reinvested efficiently because there are zero projects in which to reinvest the profits into that would return a better profit than what the company 's shareholders could make by reinvesting those profits in their own way ie a benchmark market index like an s&amp;p 500 index fund   since the shareholders could make a better return with this than the company could with any company project it would be irresponsible technically maybe even illegal for the company to reinvest that 20 of the profits   this reason for companies sometimes paying out profits to shareholders in the form of dividends is a market efficient part of the economic system and it really is great   if a ceo cfo anyone is paying out so much profit from a company that it is irresponsible to the company 's investors then that would also technically be illegal since the company is evading efficient project that would benefit its shareholders more than they could benefit themselves elsewhere in the market   these legalities with shareholder laws are not explicitly put into action very often but their effects are always there    it 's also worth noting payout strategy is very important for the strategy and financing of a company particularly for public investments

on thing the questioner should do is review the summary plan description for the 401(k plan   this may have details on any plan imposed limits on salary deferrals   if the does not have sufficient detail the questioner should request a complete copy of current plan document and then review this with someone who knows how to read plan documents the document for a 401(k plan can specify a maximum percentage of compensation that a participant in the 401(k plan can defer regardless of the maximum dollar deferral limit in internal revenue code section   for example the document for a 401(k plan can provide that participants can elect to defer any amount of their compensation salary but not to exceed ten percent 10   thus someone whose salary is $ 50,000 per year will effectively be limited to deferring at most $ 5,000   someone making $ 150,000 will effectively be limited to deferring at most $ 15,000   this is true regardless of the fact that the 2013 dollar limit on salary deferrals is $ 17,500   this is also true regardless of whether or not a participant may want to defer more than ten percent 10 of compensation this plan imposed limit on salary deferral contributions is permissible assuming it is applied in a manner   this plan imposed limit is entirely separate from any other rules or restrictions on salary deferral amounts that might be as a result of things like the average deferral percentage test

the main point to consider is that your payments toward your own home replace your rent any house or apartment you buy will have changes in value the value is generally going slowly up but there is a lot of noise and you may be in a low phase at any time and for a long time so seeing it as an investment is not any better than buying share or funds and it has a much worse liquidity (= you can not as easily make it to cash when you want to and not in parts either however if you buy for example a one room apartment for with a 2 mortgage and pay 2 interest = 1600 plus 1 principal = 800 for a total of 2400 per year = 200 per month you are paying less than your current rent plus you own it after 30 years even if it would be worth nothing after 30 years you made a lot of money by paying half only every month and it probably is not worthless you need to be careful not to compare apples with oranges if you buy a house for instead your payments would be higher than your rent was but you would be living in your house not in a room for most people that is worth a lot you need to put your own value to that if you do n't care to have a lot more space and freedom the extra value is zero if you like it put a price to it with current interest rates it is probably a good idea for most people to buy a house that they can easily afford instead of paying rent the usual rules should be considered do n't yourself leave some security etc generally it is rather difficult to buy an affordable house instead of renting today and not saving a lot of money in the process so i would say go for it

there 's a couple issues to consider when you sell your primary home the irs gives you a $ 500k exemption married filing jointly on gain   if you decide not to sell your current house now and you subsequently fall outside the ownership use tests then you may owe taxes on any gains when you sell the house rather than being concerned about your net debt you should be concerned about your monthly debt payments   generally speaking you can not have debt payments of more than 36 of your monthly income   if you can secure a renter for your current property then you may be able to reach this ratio for your next third property also only 75 of your expected monthly rental income is considered for calculating your 36 number this is not an exhaustive list of risks you expose yourself to the largest risk is if you or your spouse find yourself without income e.g. lost job accident injury no renter then you may be hurting to make your monthly debt payments    you will need to be confident that you can pay all your debts   a good rule that i hear is having the ability to pay 6 months worth of debt   this may not necessarily mean having 6 months worth of cash on hand but access to that money through personal lines of credit borrowing against assets selling stocks investments etc you also want to make sure that your insurance policies fully cover you in the event that a tenant sues you damages property etc   you also do n't want to face a situation where you are sued because of discrimination   hiring a property management company to take care of these things may be a good peace of mind

if the only jobs you have around you are manual labor dead end employment where there are no skills to be garnered if you have other options you will take them    your 55 year old former mill worker that is broke is n't going to retrain himself nor does he have the money to move to an area with higher wages at that point going on disability until you get ss is probably your best bet you see this play out in tons of small towns around the country

it can take a while for inflation to into all aspects an economy and be felt by a consumer often things that consumers use the most like gasoline wheat products corn products soy products and sugar are commodities spread across global markets with their own pricing which may be impacted by inflation in any given country   also inflation can be beneficial in some ways a $ 500/month mortgage payment was a big deal 30 years ago and now would be considered trivial that 's entirely because of inflation   run away inflation where people are burning the currency to stay warm is a different beast altogether be wary of people who conflate inflation consumer pricing and destructive currency devaluation because they 're not the same things

reminds me when people complain about not being able to retire but they never invested in any indexes or have a 401k. like no shit you have no money you did n't plan well why should i be taxed higher bc i did   i use dividends to reinvests back into stocks or indexes capital income is nt the problem its financial education do nt be upset i know how to handle my money people should be educated better on financial planning teach that in public schools and embrace people investing money not make out the rich as some kind of criminal i can agree inherited wealth is bullshit but being self made and investing well should n't be looked down upon because people struggle with the realism that its their fault they do nt have money to retire life is a bunch of opportunities and choices and yes some people get spoon fed opportunities but it 's still a choice to be financially responsible stop blaming the rich and educate the working poor and below poverty level how to financially plan their future

the answer to this question requires looking at the mathematics of the qualified dividends and capital gains worksheet start with taxable income which is the number that appears on line 43 of form 1040   this is after the adjusted gross income has been reduced by the standard deduction or itemized deductions as the case may be as well as the exemptions claimed    then subtract off the qualified dividends and the net long term capital gains reduced by net short term   capital losses if any to get the non cap gains part of the taxable income assigning somewhat different meanings to the numbers in the ops question let 's say that the taxable income is $ 74 k of which $ 10 k is long term capital gains leaving $ 64 k as the the non cap gains taxable income on line 7 of the    since $ 64 k is smaller than $ k not $ k as stated by the op and this is a return $ k $ 64 k = $ 8.5 k of the long term capital gains are taxed at 0 the balance $ 1.5 k is taxed at 15 giving $ 225 as the tax due on that part    the 64 k of non cap gains taxable income has a tax of $ if i am reading the tax tables correctly and so the total tax due is $ + 225 = $   this is as it should be the non gains income of $ 64 k was assessed the tax due on it $ 8.5 k of the cap gains were taxed at 0 and $ 1.5 k at 15 there are more complications to be worked out on the for high earners who attract the 20 capital gains rate but those are not relevant here

your mother has a problem that is typical for a woman with children   she is trying to help her children have a good life by sacrificing to get them to a point where they can live comfortably on their own   though she has a difficult situation now much of the problems come from a very few choices by her and her children and her situation can be fixed let me point out a few of the reasons why she has come to this point my mother is a single mom she is turning 50 this summer she has about $ 60k in school loans from the college i attended she has payments of $ 500/month $ 10k to my sisters college she lives on her own in a 2 bedroom apartment mother 's current income statement income essentials total $ 71 too high goal $ 2200 lifestyle total $ 150 low she should have $ 500 900 to live her life financial total $ 31 some observations and suggestions even though the $ rents seems high your mom might enjoy her apartment and consider part of her rent $ 300 a lifestyle choice spending money for time and the higher rent may make sense   but the rent is high for her income your mom should be spending more on food and budget $ 200/month your mom should be saving money for investments and retirement   she should be putting 10 into savings $ 440 plus any k pretax savings your sister should be paying for her own college   she should take her own student loans so that her mother can save for retirement   and since she only has $ 10 k left an alternative would be that you could loan her the money and she could repay you when she graduates you have money as you loaned your mother $ 8 k you should be repaying the $ 500/month on the $ 60 k student loan your mother took to help you get through college   you have benefited from the education and the increased opportunity the college education has given you   now is the time to accept responsibility and pay your debts   you could at least agree to split the expense with her and were you paying even $ 300/month leaving $ 200 for her that would still fix her budget your mom should get a car that is paid for and reduce her transportation expenses until the $ 350/month debt is resolved   she should resolve to spend no more than $ 300/month for a car and with $ 100/month for insurance be under 10 for her vehicle since your mother lives in the us nj she could avoid the $ 350/month debt payment though bk   but since there are other solutions she could exercise to resolve her problems this is probably not needed you mom could consider sharing her apartment to share expenses   paying $ for an apartment for one person seems extravagant   she might enjoy sharing her apartment with a room mate that is about it   once her children take responsibility for their lives your mom will have a manageable budget and less stress in her life mother 's revised income statement income essentials total $ 62 high need to reduce by $ 500 lifestyle total $ 450 10 low financial total $ 990 23 while you and your sister have these changes summary of changes some rent is lifestyle reduced car loan by $ 200 sister pays her college $ 500 you pay your college $ 300 mom saves 10 of her income   once your sister graduates and starts to repay you for your help with her college you can take over paying the remainder of your loans saving your mom an additional $ 200/month

good question   and it depends a bit on your current plan your future income and the plan you are moving too mostly you want to roll out of your existing 401k.   there will likely be a fee and your investment choices are limited   you will want to do a direct transfer and going with a quality company such as fidelity or vanguard   both of those have zero fees for accounts and pretty good customer service however if your future income is likely to be high there is something else to consider   if you are over the limits do a roth and are considering doing a backdoor roth a key success for this strategy is keeping your roll over ira balance low or zero    so you may want to either leave the 401 k where it is or roll it to your new 401 k plan   in that case you will have to call the two 401 k custodians and select the best choice as far as fees and fund choice

you 're asking for opinions here because it 's a matter of how you look at it i 'll give it a shot anyway for insurance purposes there 's a clear answer you insure based on how much it would cost you to replace it for some reason you 're considering as a possibility negotiating with the insurance company about that but i 've never heard of insuring something at a possible sales value unless you 're talking about a one of a kind thing or a particularly valuable artifact art jewelry etc that it would be appraised and insured based on the appraised value besides most of the stuff usually loses value once you bought it not gains so insuring per replacement costs makes more sense because it costs more as to your estimations of your own net worth to yourself its up to you i would say that something only worth what people would pay for it so if you have a car that you just bought brand new replacing it would cost you $ x but you can only sell it for $ because it depreciated by at least 10 once you 've driven it off the dealer 's lot so i would estimate your worth as $ based on the car not $ x because although you spent $ x on it you can never recover it if you sell it so you ca n't claim to have it as your net worth

if i understand correctly the traditional ira if you have 401k with an employer already has the following features actually 1 and 2 are characteristics of roth iras not traditional iras only 3 is a characteristic of a traditional ira whether you have a 401(k with your employer or not makes absolutely no difference in how your iras are taxed for the vast majority of people the rules for iras are different if you have a very high income though you 're allowed to have and contribute to both kinds of accounts in fact i personally have both traditional iras are tax deferred not tax free as people sometimes mistakenly call them they 're very different meaning that you do n't have to pay taxes on the contributions or profits you make inside the account e.g. from dividends interest profits from stock you sell etc rather you pay taxes on any money you withdraw for roth iras the contributions are taxed but you never have to pay taxes on the money inside the account again that means that any money you get over and above the contributions e.g. through interest trading profits dividends etc are genuinely tax free also if you leave any of the money to people they do n't have to pay any taxes either important point there are no tax free retirement accounts in the u.s. the distinction between different kinds of iras basically boils down to pay now or pay later many people make expensive mistakes in their retirement strategy by not understanding that point please note that this applies equally to traditional and roth 401(k)s as well you can have roth 401(k)s and traditional 401(k)s just like you can have roth iras and traditional iras the same terminology and logic applies to both kinds of accounts as far as i know there are n't major differences tax wise between them with two exceptions you 're allowed to contribute more money to a 401(k per year and you 're allowed to have a 401(k even if you have a high income by way of contrast people with very high incomes generally are n't allowed to open iras a primary advantage of a traditional ira is that you can in theory at least afford to contribute more money to it due to the tax break you 're getting also you can defer taxes on any profits you make e.g. through dividends or selling stock at a profit so you can grow your money faster

it is possible to achieve a substitute for refinancing but because of the short life of cars at least relative to housing there are no true first the entire loan will not be able to be refinanced   the balance less approximately 80 of the value of the car will have to be repaid   cars depreciate by something like 20 per year so $ 2,000 will have to be repaid now you should be able to get a loan if your boyfriend has good credit but the interest rate will not drop too much further from the current loan 's rate because of your presumably bad credit rating assumed because of your current interest rate while this is doable this is not a good strategy if you intend to have a long term relationship   one of the worst of a relationship is money   it will put a strain on your relationship and lower the odds of success the optimal strategy if the monthly payments are too high is to try to sell the car so to buy a cheaper car   the difficulty here is that the bank will not allow this if balance of the loan exceeds the proceeds from the sale so putting as much money towards paying the balance to allow a sale is best as a side note please insure your car against occurrences such as theft and damage with a deductible low enough to justify the monthly payment   it is a terrible position to have a loan no car and no collateral against the car
