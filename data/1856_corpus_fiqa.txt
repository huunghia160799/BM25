the short answer is no there a 2 ways to get cash from a life insurance policy   if the policy has cash value greater than the surrender value then the difference can be borrowed but will generally increase premiums in the future    the other method available on many term policies allows the owner to receive part of the death benefit if the insured has a physician willing to certify that he she will probably pass away within a 12 month period   several carriers also offer cash benefits for critical care

generally no it does not make sense for insurance company to alter terms and if there are such rules it can be subject to misuse

if the insurance policy is a whole life or variable life policy it might have a surrender value that the owner of the policy might be able to get by the policy in whole if it is a term life policy it has no surrender value in many cases the owner of the policy is also the insured and so ask uncle joe whether he would be willing to surrender the life insurance policy and give you the proceeds now instead of making you wait till he passes away if it is a term life policy ask him to consider not renewing the policy and from now on just give you the premium he would have been paying to the insurance company whether he will pay you increasing amounts in later years as a renewable five year level term policy might require is a more delicate matter that you can negotiate with him on the other hand if the policy owner is aunt but the insured is uncle joe and you are the beneficiary talk to aunt instead she is the one who can cancel the policy not uncle joe and for heaven 's sake do n't grease the to facilitate uncle joe 's first step onto the to heaven there are depending on where you live various laws prohibiting payments to beneficiaries who have had a hand in arranging for the happy event to occur

first the basis is what was paid for the house along with any documented upgrades any improvements not consider maintenance any gain from that point is taxable this is the issue with gifting a house before one passes it 's an awful mistake the fact that there was a mortgage does n't come into play here nor does the $ 15 k given away your question is great and the only missing piece is what the house cost keep in mind depending on the state you mil may have gotten a step up on the passing of her husband   on a very personal note my grandparents a family house 4 apartments 1938 at a cost of $ 4000 my grandmother transferred 1/2 share to my father well before she died and before my father 's death it was put into my mother 's name now that she 's in her last years i explained that since moved it to my sister 's name already there 's no step up in basis this share is now worth over $ 600,000 and after 4 deaths no step up when my sister sells she will have a gain on nearly 100 of the sale price in my opinion there 's a special place in hell for lawyers that quit claim property like this for a bit of paperwork the house could have been put into a trust to avoid probate avoid being an asset for medicaid and still get the step up even a $ 2000 cost for a good lawyer to set up a trust would yield a return of nearly $ 100,000 in taxes avoided and as my sister 's keeper i 'd have paid the $ 2,000 myself no issue that she gets the house she needs it i do n't and when the money 's gone i 'm all she has anyway

this sounds to me like a very nice little job for a computer this assumes that you have some experience of programming a computer which i believe you do a program like this does not require a lot of programming experience a beginner in any simple scripting language could implement it which is why i think it is a fairly general answer you can set up a small simulation with either your real loans or the examples you have given then have the computer work through the situation at a monthly time step until the debt is paid and have it output all the interesting information per month then you set it up with your different payment scenarios each paying proportionally each paying their own debt separately paying them in different orders etc when you have these graphs it should be possible to answer your main questions the more information you add to this simulation the more effective it gets for example i 'm sure there are various tax deductions that you can make depending on how much each of you pay that depends on all sorts of things location income age

i 've never seen anything in any irs publication that placed limits on the balance of a 401 k only on what you can contribute and defer from taxes each year   the way the irs gets theirs as it were is on the taxes you have to pay for a traditional ira anyway which would not be when you start to figure out the required minimum distribution if the balance was you 're required to take out enough to in theory run the thing out of money by your life expectancy the irs has tables for this stuff to give you the exact numbers but for the sake of a simple example their number for someone age 70 single or with a spouse who is not more than 10 years younger is   if we round that to 28 to make the math nice then you would be forced to withdraw and pay taxes on around $ 500,000 per year   so there would be a hefty amount of taxes to be paid out for sure so a lot of that $ 500 k a year going to pay taxes on your distributions but then considering you only contributed   pre tax dollars in the first place what a wonderful problem to have to deal with   oh do n't throw me in that patch mr fox

the equity you have is an asset locked away until you sell and sometimes pledged as a loan if you wish the idea that it 's dead money is nonsense it 's a pretty illiquid asset that has the potential for growth at the rate of inflation or slightly higher long term and provides you an annual dividend in the form of free rent   in this country most people who own homes have a disproportionate amount of their wealth in their house this is more a testament to the poor saving rate than anything else for me a high equity position means that i can sell my home and buy a lesser sized house for cash i am older and my own goal with the mrs is to have the house paid and college for the kid fully funded before we think of retiring for others it 's cash they can use to rent after they retire i hope that helped there 's nothing magic about this just a lot of opinions

given that you have your emergency fund and no other high interest rate debts credit cards etc you will want to put down at least enough to not have to pay private mortgage insurance pmi   pmi is solely to protect the lender if you default   it has no benefit to you   it generally means that you will need at least 20 down   after that its a personal decision depending on what else you are going to do with the money   if you are the type to spend money frivolously if you have it it might make sense to put as much down as you can   if you think that you can invest the money and over the long term make more than the historically low mortgage interest rates it might make sense to invest    one thing to keep in mind is that money that you put into the down payment is relatively illiquid meaning that it is hard to turn back into cash   if you have large expenses in the future like health problems or college for the kids it might be better to have the money in something easier to turn into cash

first it 's not always the case that etfs have lower expenses than the equivalent mutual funds   for example in the vanguard family of funds the expense ratio for the etf version is the same as it is for the admiral share class in the mutual fund version   with that in mind the main advantages of a mutual fund over an equivalent etf are from a long term investor 's point of view the main disadvantage of mutual funds relative to etfs is the minimum account sizes   especially if the fund has multiple share classes i.e. where better classes get lower expense ratios you might have to have quite a lot of money invested in the fund in order to get the same expense ratio as the etf    there are some other differences that matter to more active investors e.g. intraday trading options etc but for a passive investor the ones above are the major ones   apart from those mutual funds and etfs are pretty similar   personally i prefer mutual funds because i 'm at a point where the fund minimums are n't really an issue and i do n't want to deal with the more aspects of etfs for investors just starting out the lower minimum investment for an etf is a big win as long as you can get commission free trades which is what i 've assumed above

unfortunately the answer is almost none almost everything has a risk of decreasing but given your short time horizon and presumably given that you want back your principal in full plus a little bit you have few choices some of the following may be canadian specific terms but hopefully they are generic enough to apply savings accounts money market funds and the like should be available at any bank   interest wo n't pay you much right now but the money should be safe i presume israel has some kind of deposit insurance for normal bank accounts slightly more risky would be a short to maturity bond or stripped bond coupon   the entry amount of money for one of these may be more than you have on hand or the setup fee for an investment account might be more than you want to bother with for a one off investment given that you seem to indicate that you might need access to the money during the time frame in question the bank account option seems to be the only one really available

gt a trucking company making millions of dollars a year on us highways derives more value from the roads than i do    trucking companies run on very slim margins typical for a commoditized business and the vast majority of benefit is captured by other players employees and the government in the form of taxes    moreover you appear to be confusing revenue and profits   gt honestly anyone who says that they do n't need to pay for roads because of their level of benefit from them is limited and i will call you a liar unless you are living in a box in the woods 100s of miles away from civilization you absolutely rely on the road system even if you never set foot on it    nobody ever said this you are inventing an argument in order to counter it silly   gt though at the same time a national highway system was something no business would ever make as it derives too little value for an individual business for the scale required to reach enough of the market this is a perfect example of a project that is good for society but wo n't see the tab picked up by business voluntarily    sure again you are way off on a tangent though nobody here has argued against infrastructure nor taxes required to fund them    gt it is foolish to assume your market value increases do not rely on infrastructure to happen as much as paper trading inflates value for the most part it is still tied to some kind of real work or rather the expectation of being done somewhere that assumption of ability for a corporation to serve it 's shareholders is based on the fact that companies have infrastructure needs handled and that expanding delivery to three new markets wo n't be hampered because the company must first complete the highway to serve these markets   again you seem confused about the argument we are not arguing about the basis of stock valuations and appreciation which you happen to be wrong on btw we are talking about the relative value of infrastructure gained by the wealthy vs. non wealthy replace stock market with 30 year us bonds actually do n't the next thing i 'll see from you is some kind of comment about how infrastructure forms the basis for interest rates   gt;the existence of infrastructure not only supports the market but allows you to exploit it the internet here makes a great example prior to funding and a push by the government to standardize military and academic networks and technology as well as make more powerful in order to stay ahead in tech race we had a mish mash of proprietary networks with very poor abilities to use them today we have the internet a largely private system today however it would not exist without the involvement and funding from the government for the multiple programs that led to it 's existence   great nobody ever said otherwise   gt if the taxes really outweighed utility businesses would not operate in the area at all the thing is they do n't and taxes are not preventing businesses from growing    i said personal utility i personally employ 40 families i pay considerable taxes for them they pay income and sales taxes on top of that it 's a huge amount of money the government receives that they would n't have had i not chosen to go into business   incidentally this brings up another point does n't the government owe me something for generating that many jobs why am i not getting a tax break   gt yes but that is because unless you are doing it all yourself then you did not generate that $ 10 as a business owner you are in charge of managing resources to help generate that $ 10 you yourself however did not generate that $ 10 you had employees and contractors and people managing your building payroll and yes even taxes every person involved in getting the product or service from idea to the door are all part of that $ 10 if your efforts in that co are netting you 15 of the total then you are beating the market already and i am not sure what your problem is if you are looking to double or triple your investments you are looking for las vegas not wall st or main st.   i see you do n't understand how business works   gt i think the issue i see among people with your opinion is a failure to understand 2nd and 3rd order effects your bubble extends to what you do in your daily life and the parts of it you visibly see and touch the world you see and touch every day is supported and made comfortable by a whole system and people whom you will never see or know    the issue i see among people with your opinion is that it is naive and obviously not based in any real world experience if you had ever actually run a business you would realize how many people get paid before you do including the government you have maybe a 5 chance of making an above average wage and you fight like hell every day to stay afloat    i encourage you to open your eyes and try to see the perspective of people who are actually making a difference in this world and not the political and

an index is just a mathematical calculation based on stock prices anyone can create such a calculation and given a little effort publish it based on publicly available data the question of open source is simply whether or not the calculator chooses to publish the calculation used given how easy an index is to create the issue is not the open source nature or otherwise but its credibility and usefulness

some technical indicators e.g. williams r indicate whether the market is overbought or oversold    every time a stock or commodity is bought it is also sold and vice versa so how can anything ever be over bought or over sold but i 'm sure i 'm missing something what is it you 're thinking of this as a normal purchase but that 's not really how equity markets operate first just because there are shares of stock purchased it does n't mean that there was real investor buyer and seller demand for that instrument at that point in time   markets have dedicated middlemen called market makers who are responsible to make sure that there is always someone to buy or sell this ensures that all instruments have sufficient liquidity   market makers may decide to lower their bid on a stock based on a high number of sellers or raise their ask for a high number of buyers during an investor rush to buy or sell an instrument perhaps in response to a news release it 's possible for market makers to accumulate a large number of shares without end investors being involved on both sides of the transaction   this is one example of how instruments can be over bought or over sold since williams r creates over bought and over sold signals based on historical averages of open close prices perhaps it 's better to think of these terms as over valued and under valued   of course there could be good reason for instruments to open or close outside their expected ranges so williams r is just a tool to give you clues not a real evaluation of the instrument 's true value

if you think about it it 's really all one big pot of money   the idea behind an emergency fund is that you want to make sure your financial life has stability it 's not going to be suddenly driven into the red below $ 0   as long as that does n't happen you can figure out how to live your life as you want the reason we separate out an emergency fund is to simplify decision making   in theory every single purchase you make should include a consideration of how it you   every $ 100 you spend on groceries is $ 100 you wo n't be able to bring to bear if you get fired or have a major accident   in practice this would be a crippling way of thinking about things   you do n't know what emergencies can hit you nor when they will hit   that 's why they 're emergencies   if you had to think about them all the time it 'd be horrible   you would end up simply not thinking about it like most people and then the emergency hits when you do n't have enough cash to stay solvent the purpose of an emergency fund is to help make these decisions easier   if you have money set aside for emergencies that you only have to think about every now and then you can make the decisions in the rest of your financial life without too much concern for them   you do n't have to worry about that $ 100 in groceries because you are confident that if an emergency hits that $ 100 wo n't be the straw that broke the 's back because you have reserves to draw on so you should define an emergency fund in a way which is most helpful for you to remain stable and solvent without having to fret about it too much   for most people the criteria for tapping that fund is very high because the goal is to not have to think about it all that much   if you wanted to you could feel free to lump those medium predictability items into the emergency fund but it just means you have to spend more time and effort thinking about the state of the fund   every medium predictability purchase has to come with the thought process what is the state of the emergency fund could this purchase meaningfully destabilize my ability to handle emergencies   your emergency fund might yo yo under these extra purchases which could force you to think about the state of your emergency fund for normal purchases   that 'd be bad different people might want to think about things different ways   i 'm a big picture guy so i prefer to think about all of my assets as one big account when i make a lot of my decisions   my wife on the other hand prefers not to have to think that way when she makes her purchases   for her having a very discrete emergency fund has great value   for me it has less   so when i look at the finances i choose to lump the emergency funds in with say the funds to re do our backyard something we are looking at doing over the next 2 5 years   for me that is the most natural way to deal with analyzing the risks i just have to be aware of how backyard purchases interact with our safety net   my wife prefers to keep those funds separate in her head so that she can look at how to spend money on the backyard without thinking about how it affects our emergency   while complicated it shows that even within a household it 's possible to think about emergency funding two different ways   it causes minimal headaches though a fair bit of book keeping so define emergency fund however suits you and your life best   however practically speaking most people find it desirable to not put those medium predictability purchases into the same bucket as emergencies   those that do find it desirable to put them in the same bucket typically have a personal reason for why that suits their needs better

nope anything is that has the required information is fine   at a minimum you need to have the routing number account number amount pay to line and a signature the only laws are that it ca n't be written on anything illegal like human skin and it has to be portable not carved on the side of a building for example that said the micr line and standard sizes will make things for they bank but are hardly required   you could write your check on notebook paper so long as it had the right information and the bank would have to cash it keep in mind that a check is an order to the bank to give your money to a person and nothing more you could   write it out in sentence form give bill $ 2 from account routing number signed and it would be valid in practice though it would be a fight mostly the bank would try to urge you to use a standard check or could hold the funds because it looks odd till they received the ok from the other bank but if you rant to fight that fight

it is a very complex question to answer and it really depends however here are some points to consider and verify with your accountant or tax expert   first if you exercise now the downside is that you may be subject to alternative minimum tax amt based on the theoretical gain on the stock current price minus your strike price when you file your tax return   the other obvious downside is that if the company goes nowhere you are stuck with the stock and potentially lose money   the benefit is that the clock starts ticking for long term capital gains so if you sell after 1 year from the exercise date or your company gets sold then the gain would be taxed as long term capital gain which is taxed at a lower rate if your company were to get sold the gains are not necessarily taxed as ordinary income   if it is a cash transaction then most likely unless you have exercised and held the stock for over a year   however if it is a stock sale then you may end up getting stock of the company that acquires your company   in that situation the tax event would be when you sell the new shares vs. the time of company sale finally whether to exercise or not also depends on how you feel about the prospects of the company   if you think they will be sold or of more value down the road then exercising makes sense   if you are not sure then you could hedge your bets by only exercising a portion of it you should definitely consult with a financial advisor or a tax consultant regarding these matters

all fair points and i agree that there is no silver bullet perhaps it 's human nature maybe a product of our ideologies whatever but i think you hit it on the head when you said that people treat their agenda as a perfect solution when in reality there is no such thing automation will kill jobs livable wage is variable not everyone fits a uniform mold and conversely not every business operates the same some are completely profit driven others are more conscious of their societal obligations regardless of legal requirement so all businesses into the same obligations seems like a losing battle as well if the long term data backs up the finding that higher minimum wages kill jobs at a disproportionate rate when accounting for factors like automation then the evidence should be conversely i do believe that we will reach a point possibly even in this lifetime where so much automation exists there will be fewer and fewer opportunities to get your foot in the door or things of that nature and a universal basic income will be needed how that is paid for what the societal and social implications are those are questions for another day but that day is also fast approaching

when debit cards were first made available one of the advertised strengths was that if you never wrote a check and always used a debit card you could never be overdrawn they money would be instantly withdrawn from the account and the balance would always reflect perfectly the amount of money in the account of course some saw the loss of float as a weakness but for others this instantaneous aspect was what they needed   if only that were true i have seen debit card transactions take a couple of days to appear i have seen a $ 1 hold for gas not be removed and the real amount withdrawn for 2 or 3 days horror stories about having a $ 3 coffee end up costing $ 30 because of overdraft fees can only occur if the transactions are n't instant   the contactless feature does n't make the time delay any shorter the delay for an individual transaction assuming there are no unusual network problems still depend on the vendor policies the card network policies and the bank policies but from the viewpoint of the cashier the transaction has been completes and the customer can leave with their coffee from the viewpoint of the bank account it may still be waiting

the basic idea behind a derivative is very simple actually   it is a contract where the final value depends on is derived from the value of something else   stock for instance is not a derivative because the contract itself is actually ownership of part of a company   whereas car insurance is a derivative because the payout depends on the value of something else namely your and other peoples cars the problem with such a simple definition is that it covers such a broad class   it covers simple contracts like futures where the end value just depends on the price of something on a future date   but it extends to contracts complicated enough that people in finance call them exotics derivatives are broadly used for two things reducing risk sometimes called insurance and speculation   a farmer can use derivatives to make sure she gets paid a certain amount for her corn   a banker can group a bunch of loans together and sell slices to reduce the pain of a particular loan failing   at the same time people can use the same instruments to speculate on the price of for example that corn or those loans and the main advantage is that they do n't have to buy the corn or loans directly   any farmer will tell you corn can be very expensive to store derivatives generally cause problems both individually and sometimes world wide when people do n't properly understand the risks involved   the most famous example being mortgage backed securities and the recent great recession   you can start understand the instruments and their risks by this wonderful wikipedia article and later perhaps a used collection of cfa books which cover derivatives in great detail edit michael mentioned hull 's text on derivatives a wonderful middle ground between wikipedia and the cfa books that i ca n't believe i did n't think about myself

taxation is only theft if you believe that you are the owner of the money the government collects as a tax   i argue that the concept of ownership only has meaning in the context of what property rights your fellow man is willing to respect   if like me you believe that taxes are a financial obligation that you must pay to participate in society then the government has every right to collect those taxes from you   i 'm sure you can imagine a set of rules by which the money actually belongs to you but if you 're the only one who wants to play by those rules those rules do n't matter a hell of a lot

i 'm expanding on what had added to his answer the assumption of same tax bracket in retirement is convenient but simplistic if you are in for instance the second lowest bracket now and happen to remain in the second lowest bracket for retirement then roth and traditional account options may seem equal and your math backs that up on the surface but that 's making an implicit assumption that tax rates will be constant yet tax brackets and rates can change and they do the proof i.e. your 15 bracket could become say the 17 bracket or perhaps the 13 bracket all the while you might remain in the second lowest bracket so given the potential for fluctuating tax rates it 's easy to see that there can be a case where a traditional tax deferred account can yield more after tax income than a roth post tax account even if you remain in the same bracket when your tax bracket 's tax rate declines so do n't just consider what bracket you expect to be in consider also whether you expect tax rates to go up down or remain the same for twenty something young folk retirement is a long way away ~40 years and i think in that time frame it is far more likely that the tax brackets wo n't have the same underlying tax rates that they have now of course we ca n't know for sure which direction tax rates will head in but an educated guess can help is your government deep in debt or flush with extra cash on the other hand if you do n't feel comfortable making predictions much better than simply assuming brackets and rates will stay the same as now so it does n't matter is to instead hedge your bets save some of your retirement money in a roth style account and some in a traditional pre tax account consider it tax diversification see also my answer at this older but related question

first i would like to use a better chart   in my opinion a close of day line chart a lot of important information   here is a daily log chart   the initial drop from the close on oct 3 was to intraday to close at on oct 10   after this the market was still very volatile and reached a low of on nov 20 closing only slightly higher than this   it traded as high as on jan 6 2009 but the whole period of nov 24 feb 13 was somewhat of a trading range of roughly 800 900   despite this the news reports of the time were frequently saying things like this is n't going to be a v shaped recovery it is going to be u shaped   the roughly one week dip you see feb 27 mar 9 taking it to an intraday low of only about 11 below the previous low on first glance appears to be just a continuation of the previous trend    however the mar 10 uptrend started with various news articles such as this one which i recall at the time suggested things like the parts of the glass steagall act of 1933 which had been repealed by the gramm leach bliley act   although these attempts appear to have been unsuccessful the widespread of such attempts in the media seemed to have reversed a common notion which i saw widespread on forums and other places that we are going to be in this mess forever the market has nowhere to go but down and therefore shorting the market is a good idea now   i do n't find the article itself but one prominent theme was the up tick rule on short selling source from this viewpoint then that the last dip was driven not so much by a recognition that the economy was really in the toilet as this really was discounted in the first drop and at least by late november had already been figured into the price   instead it was sort of the opposite of a market top where now you started seeing individual investors jump on the band wagon and decide that now was the time for a into selling short   the fact that the up tick rule was likely to be re had a noticeable effect on the final slide

when you are starting out using a balanced fund can be quite advantageous a balanced fund is represents a diversified portfolio in single fund the primary advantage of using a balanced fund is that with it being a single fund it is easier to meet the initial investment minimum   later once you have enough to transition to a portfolio of diversified funds you would sell the fund and buy the portfolio with a custom portfolio you will be better able to target your risk level and you might also be able to use lower cost funds   the other item to check is do any of the funds that you might be interested in for the diversified portfolio have lower initial investment option if you can commit to adding money on a specified basis assuming that you are able to also there might be an etf version of a mutual fund and for those the initial investment amount is just the share price the one thing to be aware of is make sure that you can buy enough shares that you can rebalance holding a single share makes it hard to sell some gain when rebalancing i would stay away from individual stocks until you have a much larger portfolio assuming that you want to invest with a diversified portfolio the reason being that it takes a lot more money to create a diversified portfolio out of individual stocks since you have to buy whole shares with a mutual fund or etf your underlying ownership of can be fractional with no issue as each fund share is going to map into a fraction of the various companies held and with mutual funds you can buy fractional shares of the fund itself

you can if the market is open in a normal trading phase no auction phase works and there is an existing bid or offer on the product you want to trade at the time the market learns of your order keep in mind there are 2 prices bid and offer if the current bid and current offer were the same it would immediately result in a trade and thus the bid and offer are no longer the same market makers are paid given lower fees in order to maintain buy and sell prices called quotes at most times these conditions are usually all true but commonly fail for these reasons most markets have an order type of market order that says buy sell at any price there are still sanity checks put in place on the price with the exact rules for valid prices depending on the stock so unless it 's a penny stock you wo n't suddenly pay ten times a stock 's value the amount you can buy sell is limited by the quantity that exists on the bid and offer if there is a bid or offer the quantity is always at least 1

part of living in a dynamic world unfortunately failure to accept that leaves you in the dust keeping that same mindset personally i think that outsourcing will forever be a popular solution to profit maximization without altering our corporate tax laws   however with adequate adjustments to tax incentives some of these large corporations could be taxed properly and stop claiming they are generating their profits overseas all the while dodging our socioeconomic responsibility of contributing to the system    great thanks for the share

the irs has been particularly vague about the substantially identical investment part of the wash rule   many brokers schwab for instance say that only identical exactly the same etf matter for the wash rule in their internal calculations but warn that the irs might consider two etfs over the same index to be substantially identical   in your case the broker has chosen to call these a wash despite even having different underlying indices   talking to the broker is the first step as they will report it to the irs   though technically you have the final say in your taxes about the cost basis   discussing this with the irs could be rather painful first though it is probably worth checking with your broker about exactly what happened   there are other wash sale triggers that frequently trip people up that may have been in play here

yes it really will hurt you to keep pulling your money from your ira your best bet is to set up a payment plan with the irs and pay the taxes you owe now as well as adjust your withholding with a new w-4 to your payroll department so that you do n't have a large tax liability next year these tax advantaged plans really are designed to penalize you if you pull the money out early to give you incentive to keep the money for retirement your best bet is to make a monthly budget that includes your tax payments for taxes owed this year as well as higher deductions from your paycheck to properly withhold taxes for next year

on reading couple of articles some research over internet i got to know about diversified investment where one should invest 70 in equity related rest 30 in debt related funds yes that is about right although the recommendation keeps varying a bit however your first investment should not aim for diversification putting small amounts in multiple mutual funds may create paper work and tracking issues my suggestion would be to start with an index eft or large cap then move to balanced funds and mid caps etc   on this site we do n't advise on specific funds you can refer to or or quite a few other personal finance advisory sites to understand the top funds in the segments and decide on funds accordingly ps rather than buying paper buy it electronic better you can now buy it as demat if you already have an demat account it would be best to buy through it

to answer your question retirement revolution may fit the bill to some extent i 'd also like to address some of the indirect assumptions that were made in your bullet points   i 'm convinced that the best way to overcome this is not simply to hold down a good job with every year max out your ira accounts and 401(k)s invest another 10 20 on top and live off of the savings and whatever social security decides to pay you instead the trick is to not retire to make a transition into an income producing activity that can be done in the typical retirement years hopefully one that is closer to one 's calling i.e. more fulfilling   this takes time not money   if people just shut off the tv and spent the time building up a side business that has a high passive component they 'd stand a much better chance of not their money

credit is not free money the idea is you will repay all of it within a reasonable amount of time it is abundantly clear you either do n't really understand this concept or completely failed at planning for it or even at keeping up with how much you owe you are blaming the bank for letting you go over the limit the reason most banks will authorize that for credit customers is they do n't want to people in some sort of an emergency situation i 'd recommend you cut back on your spending and work on paying the balance down if you have been charged any over the limit fees you can attempt to negotiate getting those credited most banks will compromise on that the first time i do n't really recommend it but if there are some circumstances surrounding this that are temporary and you are very confident about being able to manage money better in the future chances are you might be able to get approved for another card if you otherwise have had some good credit history and this situation is very recent it may not even show up on your credit report yet and another bank might happily approve you they may even offer a low or zero interest for some time balance transfer deal which you should use to get the other card within the limit if that ends up working it 's very important that you keep in mind having dodged the bullet once does n't mean you will ever be able to do it again get your budget in order and pay things off

in my opinion i would if the income is from this year you can tax shelter $ plus somewhere between $ 50,000 and $ 300,000 depending on age in a 401(k and defined benefit plan this will take care of the current tax burden afterwards set aside your remaining tax liability in cash the after tax money should be split into cash and the rest into assets the split depends on your level of risk tolerance build a core portfolio using highly liquid and non correlated etfs think spy tlt qqq ect once these core positions are locked in start lowering your basis by systematically selling a 1 standard deviation call in the etf per 100 units of underlying this will reduce your upside extend your breakeven and often yield steady income similarly you can sell 1 standard deviation iron should the vix be high enough point is you have the money to deploy a professional type systematic strategy that is non correlated and income generating

unless other people believe you have a reason for selling at a lower price your sale probably has no lasting effect at all on the market of course if people see you dump a few million dollars worth of shares at a discount they may be inclined to believe you have a reason but if you just sell a few they will conclude the reason is just that you needed cash in a hurry

that would not count as income since you would essentially be transferring money between accounts though i believe that would also be against your credit card provider and/or square 's terms of service edit as has been mentioned square may report this to the irs as income for you however more importantly this is 100 against square 's tos user agreement which you are required to accept in creating an account restricted use you also may not use the services to process cash advances you may not use the invoices feature of the services to send invoices to yourself or in any other manner for which the invoices feature is not intended commercial entity agreement at visa mastercard 's you may be required to agree to this as well for the acceptance of card payments that are commercial entities as defined by visa inc. and mastercard international inc. collectively the card brands aka if you use it to accept visa or mastercard relevant portion cash advances seller shall not disburse or advance any cash to a customer except as > authorized by the card brand rules or to itself or any of its representatives agents or employees in connection with a transaction nor shall seller accept payment for effecting credits or issuing refunds to a customer this is a form of what is known as credit card kiting

there are five main drivers to real estate returns income cash flow from rental payments depreciation as an expense that can be used to reduce taxes equity the gradual paydown of the mortgage the increases underlying equity in the property appreciation any increase in the overall value of the property leverage the impact of debt financing on the deal increasing the effective cash on cash return asset has a detailed walk through of the components and a useful comparison to stocks so interest rates are certainly a component as they increase the expenses but they are just one factor depending on a particular market 's conditions appreciation or rent increases could offset or exceed any increase in the interest expense my own experience is mostly with non listed reits including reg a+ investments like the ones from and commercial and for right now in both cases there 's plenty of capital chasing yield to go around and in fact competition among new funding sources like reg d and reg a+ platforms seems to be driving down borrowing rates as platforms compete both for borrowers and for investors personally i pay more attention to where each local market and the broader national market is along the real estate cycle spoiler the last trough was 2008 dividend capital puts out a quarterly report that 's super useful

as well as the visual impact employees do n't see the money disappearing directly from their paycheck so do n't feel as heavily taxed there 's usually one practical difference at least in the uk employers are generally prohibited in law from explicitly passing the tax onto their employees of course the presence of the tax will affect how much they are willing to pay especially over the long term and when deciding on pay rises but if there 's a sudden increase in the tax rate that will fall on employers immediately they would n't be able to reduce their employees pay directly

correct me if i am wrong but germany has a very extremely diversified economy it does not depend primarily upon oil exports like other countries but rather on very complex machinery and other finished products so being locked upon a system that puts exports ahead of anything else from my perspective is not bad for the german economy if an industry collapses the whole country does not go into panic straight away like oil rich exporting economies

stocks are regarded as an inflation hedge because when your money is worth less everything else is worth more i.e. stocks are more expensive go up simply because your money is worth less but not because of better earnings across individual companies so that general idea can effect sentiment whereby if everyone believes it then more people buy stocks if they think there will be a lot of inflation but it does n't explain actual behavior whether more people buy hold or sell it 's worth noting that individual companies and stocks also may be adversely affected by inflation since their own assets or accounting may already be outside of the currency and/or they may already be engaging in their own hedging

they are called financial products because they are contracts that are produced by the financial industry for example you could also say that a car manufacturer does not sell you a car but a contract that will gives you ownership of a car and if a contract is a service and not product in that case a car manufacturer is only selling services it seems like it is more about the definition of product than financial product i think that as long as something is produced by the effort of labor it could be called a product and since financial contracts are produced by the people working in the finance industry they can be qualified as products too maybe this page of wikipedia could explain things better than i just did

wikipedia has a good summary historically branch banking in the united states especially interstate branch banking was viewed by regulatory authorities and this was codified with the enactment of the act of 1927 which specifically prohibited interstate banking over the next few decades some banks attempted to circumvent 's provisions by establishing bank holding companies that operated so called independent banks in multiple states to address this the bank holding company act of 1956 prohibited bank holding companies headquartered in one state from having branches in any other state most interstate banking prohibitions were repealed by the interstate banking and branching efficiency act of 1994 research has also found that anticompetitive state provisions restricted out of state growth when those provisions were more restrictive than the provisions set by the interstate banking and branching efficiency act or by neighboring states some states have also had restrictive bank branch laws for example illinois outlawed branches other than the main office until 1967 and did not allow an unlimited number until 1993

i came to us as an international student several years ago and i have also experienced the same situation like most of the international students in finding ways to build credit history below i list out some possible approaches you may want to consider i. get a student job at campus recommended i think the best way is to get a student job in university say a teaching assistant or student helper in this case you can be provided with a social security number and start to build your own credit history ii get credit card you can also consider to apply for a credit card there are indeed some financial institutions that can provide credit cards for international students with no or limited credit scores requirement say discover and bank of america however it is relatively hard to get approved simply because hey may put more restriction in other aspects for example you may be required to keep sufficient bank balance above several thousand dollars during a period of time or you should prove that you have relatives with citizenship in us who can provide your financial aid if needed iii apply for a loan recommended getting a loan product is another alternative to get out of this difficult situation but most of people do n’t realize that there are some fintech start ups in united states that specifically focus on international loan financing one representative example is an online lending company that specializes in providing car loan for international students with no ssn or credit history i once used their loan product to finance a honda accord and reported my loan transaction records to us credit bureau during my repayment process later when i officially got my ssn number i found my credit history has been automatically and i do n’t have to start from all over again it never be an easy journey for international students to build credit history in united states what approach you should make really depends on you own situation i hope the information above can be useful and good luck for your credit journey

as far as i understand op seems to be literally asking why regarding the various contracts on various exchanges etc is it that in some cases they are cash settled and in some physically settled the answer is only that the exchange in question happens to offer it that way note that it 's utterly commonplace for contracts to be settled out physically and happens in the billions as a daily matter   conversely in cash settled contracts play out each day   both are totally commonplace different businesses or entities or traders would use the two varieties for reasons the different exchanges offer the different varieties ultimately i guess because they happen to think that niche will be profitable   there 's no council or something that enforces which mode of settlement is available on a given offering recall that a given futures contracts market is nothing more than a product offered by a certain exchange company just like burger king sells different products i believe in another aspect of the question op is asking basically   why is there not a futures contract of the mini or micro variety for extremely small amounts of currency futures which is physically settled rather than cash settled if that 's the question the answer is just whatever nobody 's done it yet   or it may well exist   but it seems extremely unlikely   physically settled currencies futures are for entities operating in the sorry if the question was misunderstood

second mortgages were also a popular way for home buyers without a down payment to borrow 100 of the money but avoid certain extra fees if they borrowed all the money from a single lender for example to borrow $ 100,000 on a house would incur something called pmi private mortgage insurance   so to borrow $ 100,000 to buy my house my payment might be $ 800/month but i would have an additional $ 100/month of pmi to pay   these numbers are totally made up and not based in math in any way so instead of that borrows might get a first mortgage for $ 80,000 so they do n't have to pay the pmi and get a second mortgage for the difference   this can be beneficial if the second mortgage payment is less than the pmi for borrowing 100 as far as i know they are n't as easy to get these days like any loan you need to be qualified and i think 100 financing is probably harder to come by   the negative connotation is no worse than any other loan   i am personally against borrowing money but if you had big medical expenses major home repairs or some other emergency i could see it justified   probably not for a big vacation or for new car though

first i must say that i 'm not a ramsey fan sometimes loans will make your financial situation significantly better especially if its a 0 loan generally i do think that leveraging has its place its the ab use of loans what causes problems not the use re your question you 're right in trying to first build up an emergency fund you should have enough in it to be able to pay for yourself for at least half a year of unemployment or zero income you only have one month your family member gave you money for free which is admirable but i 'm sure there 's a limit to everyone 's generosity and he might not give it to you for free again once you pay it off thus you should be able to handle your future troubles on your own and emergency fund is a crucial part of this pay as agreed try not to be late and you 'll pay the loan off within 3 years if you accumulate enough emergency fund and you still have some extra left pay some extra on the loan in order to pay it off early do make sure you take full advantage of the employer 's 401k match this has imho much higher priority than paying off the 0 loan early

i 'm afraid the great myth of limited liability companies is that all such vehicles have instant access to credit   limited liability on a company with few physical assets to underwrite the loan or with insufficient revenue will usually mean that the owners or others will be asked to stand surety on any credit however there is a particular form of credit available to businesses on terms with their clients   it is called factoring factoring is a financial transaction    whereby a business sells its accounts    receivable i.e. invoices to a third    party called a factor at a discount    in exchange for immediate money with    which to finance continued business    factoring differs from a bank loan in    three main ways first the emphasis    is on the value of the receivables    essentially a financial asset not    the firm ’s credit worthiness    secondly factoring is not a loan it    is the purchase of a financial asset    the receivable finally a bank loan    involves two parties whereas factoring    involves three recognise that this can be quite expensive   most banks catering to small businesses will offer some form of factoring service or will know of services that offer it   it is n't that different from cheque services pay day services where you offer a discount on future income for money now an alternative is simply to ask his clients if they 'll pay him faster if he offers a discount since either of interest payments or factoring would reduce profitability anyway

the tax system in general and income tax in particular is used for several purposes at once one of those purposes is to raise money to run the government it is n't the only purpose of income tax and income tax is n't the only source of money to run the government try a thought experiment let 's say it costs $ 10,000 per person per year to run the government it might actually cost far more or far less that 's not the point a super simple tax system would just ask each person for $ 10,000 but such a system is n't fair some people do n't even earn $ 10,000 so they are literally not able to pay that some people who earn a lot can easily afford to pay more so a still pretty simple approach asks each person to pay a particular percentage of their income and the hope is that this will add up to enough to run the government this still does n't feel fair to everyone 10 of your income is hard to find when you 're spending it all on rent and food and easy to find when you have way more than you need so many countries have what 's called a progressive system of income tax where you pay no tax on the first x of your income then a small percentage on the next y a larger percentage on the next z and so on   but you asked about business profit some places do n't tax business profits at all they just collect income taxes on people once the money reaches them as salary or dividends other places do just as a person who does n't earn any income ca n't send the government money a business that spent more on expenses than it brought in as revenue ca n't send the government money either so the tax is on profit that seems fairer to most people anyway things then get even more complicated for both business and personal income taxes because the government uses the system to encourage certain behaviours and to help people facing hard times if you want to encourage people to get training and move into higher paying jobs you might make tuition tax deductible most countries give a tax deduction for each small child you have this is n't because people with children use less of the services government provides is it instead it 's an acknowledgement that people with children generally have less money to spend or an encouragement to have children or something tax motivations are complicated   if you charged all businesses a flat tax regardless of whether they were making or losing money people might be hesitant to start companies that lose money at first there might be less entrepreneurship in that country if instead you only tax profits it feels fairer and more people are likely to join in so that 's what most governments do is the imaginary business owner who is not turning a profit somehow getting a free ride they are still paying tax if they took any salary for themselves there was personal income tax on that everything the company bought it paid sales tax on there may have been excise taxes and such in other things they bought the economic activity of the business has been driving the wheel of the local economy and spinning off some taxes at various levels that whole time whether the business itself is chipping in some corporate income tax too may not end up being particularly relevant example a sole proprietor has revenue of $ 100,000 and spends $ 10,000 on supplies and such if the salary to the owner is $ the company has a $ 1000 profit which it pays tax on if the salary to the owner is $ the company has a $ 1000 loss and does n't pay tax and may be able to use the loss to reduce taxes in a future year so what the owner is paying personal income tax on roughly $ 90,000 the government is getting the support it needs yes some owners do all the encouraged things so that some income is not taxed either in the business or the personal sphere that is presumably what the government wanted when it set those things up as deductions making charitable contributions hiring new employees building new facilities essentially the government is paying the business to do those things because they 're good for the country the overall government budget funded by personal and corporate income tax along with sales tax taxes etc is supposed to achieve certain goals which include roads and schools but also job creation and the like this is one of the ways they do that

private companies can serve the campaign donation needs of congress the usps ca n't   that 's the driving force behind privatization in the us raising campaign funds is the one thing congress is good at government agencies are n't allowed to make political donations but they can be replaced with private companies that can replace well paid workers who might donate to democrats with corporate executives who donate to republicans and minimum wage workers who ca n't afford to donate to anyone taxpayers get to pay even more because competition only lowers prices in profitable markets while government provides unprofitable but necessary services   for example the usps is required to provide universal service which is costly but contributes to a better society and a more robust economy fedex and ups do n't want to service rural locations cities and suburbs are more profitable

many web sites and articles warn against buying former rental cars    because people renting these cars often them rental cars are typically driven by people over 25 these are typically people with some financial means air travel credit card additionally rental cars are subject to frequent inspection and likely to be on tighter maintenance schedules than many owners would keep so while some people may drive a rental harder than they would their own car it 's not typical and not likely to result in some hidden damage that makes a rental less desirable all else being equal on the used car market does the fact that they sell the car mean during this time suggest that they know the car 's cost of further maintenance or other costs will be higher or is there another reason they sell at this time which has a calculated advantage to them but which is less than idea statistically for me the purchaser rental companies buy at incredible volumes as such some manufacturers have programs where they will buy back used cars from the rental company at a set price and/or time other incentives are guaranteed depreciation wherein the manufacturer will make up the difference if the used vehicle does n't sell for a set percentage of it 's purchase price after a set amount of time outside of these incentive programs rental companies also get substantial volume discounts and they typically are buying base models which hold value better than their higher trim counterparts according to kbb market analyst so the conventional wisdom about depreciation does n't really apply the timing of their sales is primarily based on their purchasing arrangements and their desire to keep an up to date fleet not on projected maintenance repair costs the best you can do with any used car purchase is to test drive get a pre purchase inspection and review whatever history is available

qe is artificial demand for bonds but as always when there are more buyers than sellers the price of anything goes up when qe ends the price of bonds will fall because everyone will know that the biggest buyer in the market is no longer there   so price of bonds will fall and therefore the interest rate on new bonds must increase to match the total return available to buyers in the secondary market

yes it does matter you are right that lower demand for a stock will drive its price down lower stock prices can hurt the company take a look at 's answer to this question a declining share price will make it hard to secure credit attract further investors build partnerships etc also employees are often holding options or in a stock purchase plan so a declining share price can severely dampen morale in an extreme case if share prices plummet too far the company can be pressured to reverse split the shares and eventually take the company private this recently happened to playboy if you do not want to support a company for whatever reason then it is wise to avoid their stock

in many cases spanning across years will indeed be beneficial deductions you get to take twice as much in deductions twice the standard deduction or itemizing if you can when you span over two years than in one   ira you can only contribute in years when you have earned income you have all the income in year 1 and none in year 2 you can only contribute in year 1 you have half of the income in year 1 and half of the income in year 2 you can contribute in both years up to the limit earned income whichever is less social security you get 4 credits for each year you earned k in you earned 32 k in year 1 and nothing in year 2 you get 4 credits you split it in half for each year you get 8 credits the list can go on if you can do the planning ahead of time and can chose the time periods of your work freely which is not something most people can do you can definitely plan ahead with taxes in mind this is called tax planning

this is a bit unusual but not unheard of i have known more than one car whose owner was not its driver   besides the obvious risk that the legal owner of the car will repossess it this seems fairly safe   your insurance should cover any financial liability that you incur during an accident   even if the car is repossessed by the owner you are only out the registration fees i would suggest you avoid looking this gift horse in the grill   her father on the other hand might be in for some drama and financial mess if he has a falling out with his friend this arrangement reminds me of where one spouse owns the car but the other drives it and pays the loan   usually when the relationship goes south one spouse is forced to sell the car at a loss

ror for options you bought is fairly easy current value initial cost gives you the actual return if you want the rate of return you need to annualize that number you divide the return you got above by the number of days the investment was in place and then multiply that number by the number of days in a year 365 if you 're using calendar days about 255 if you 're using trading days ror for options you sold is much more complex the problem is that ror is basically calculating the size of your return relative to the capital it tied up to earn it    that 's simple when you bought something the capital tied up is the money you put up    it 's more complex on a position like a short option where the specific transaction in question generates cash when it 's put on     the correct way to deal with this is to a bundle your strategy options stock and collateral into one ror where appropriate and b include any needed collateral to support the short option in the calculation so if you sell a cash secured put where you have to post the money that you 'd need to take delivery of the shares if they were put to you the initial cost is the total amount you 'd need to put the trade on    in this case it 's the cash amount less the premium you collected for selling the put   that 's just one example     but the approach holds more broadly   if you 're using covered calls your original cost is the cost of the stock less the premium generated by the sale of the call

there 's no additional income tax burden created when you decide to make roth ira contributions your roth ira contributions are taxed at the same time all your income is taxed if you earned that $ 100 by working a job then your employer likely withheld taxes when they paid you if you earned it through self employment then you 'll pay estimated taxes on that income quarterly etc in any case when you file your annual tax return the actual taxes owed vs taxes paid gets reconciled and you 're left with a refund or owe an additional sum

how realistic is it that i will be able to get a home within the 250,000 range in the next year or so   very unlikely in the next year   the debt income ratio is n't good enough and your credit score needs to show at least a year of regular payments without late or default issues before you can start asking for mortgages in this range you do n't mention how long you 've been employed at these incomes this can also count against you if you have n't both been employed for a full year at these incomes they will look even more on the employment situation if they are n't both full time jobs although if you have a full year 's worth of paychecks showing the income is regular then that might mitigate the full time part time issue next year or so if you pay down your high interest debt car credit cards and maintain employment keep your check stubs and tax returns the loan officer will want copies then there 's a slight chance and from this quick snap shot of our finances does it look like we would be able to qualify for a usda loan probably not   mostly for the same reasons the only time a usda loan helps is when you would be able to get a regular loan if you had the down payment even with an available down payment of 50k you would n't be able to get a regular loan therefore it 's unlikely that you 'd qualify for a usda loan if you are anxious to get into a house choose something much smaller in the range it would improve your debt loan ratio enough that you might then qualify for a usda loan   however i think you 'd still have issues if you have n't both been employed at this rate of income for at least a year and have made regular payments on all your debts for at least a year i 'll echo what others have suggested though strengthen your credit eliminate as much of your high interest debt as you can car credit cards and keep your jobs for a year or two   start a savings plan so you can contribute a small down payment at least 3 5 of the desired home price when you are in a better position to buy during this time keep track of your paycheck stubs you may need them to prove income over the time period your loan officer will request note that even with a usda loan you still have to pay closing costs and those can run several thousand dollars so do n't expect to be able to come to the table with no cash lastly there 's good reason to be very conservative regarding house cost and size   if you can consider buying the house as if you only had the per year   move the debt to the person making the lower income and if you buy the house in the name of the person only making per year then the debt loan ratio looks very positive   further it may be that the credit history of that person is better and the employment history is better   if one of you has better history in these ways then you might have a better chance if only one of you buys the house   banks ca n't tell you about this but it does work   keep in mind though that if you two part ways it could be very unhappy since one would be left with all the debt and the house would be in the other 's name   not a great situation to be in so make sure that you both carefully consider the risks associated with the decisions made

first of all congratulations on admitting your problem and on your determination to be debt free   recognizing your mistakes is a huge first step and getting rid of your debt is a very worthwhile goal when considering debt consolidation there are really only two reasons to do so reason 1 to lower your monthly payment   if you are having trouble coming up with enough money to meet your monthly obligations debt consolidation can lower your monthly payment by extending the time frame of the debt   the problem with this one is that it does n't help you get out of debt faster   it actually makes it longer before you are out of debt and will increase the total amount of interest that you will pay to the banks before you are done   so i would not recommend debt consolidation for this reason unless you are truly struggling with your cashflow because your minimum monthly payments are too high   in your situation it does not sound like you need to consolidate for this reason reason 2 to lower your interest rate   if your debt is at a very high rate debt consolidation can lower your interest rate which can reduce the time it will take to eliminate your debt the consolidation loan you are considering is at a high interest rate on its own   now it is true that some of your debt is higher than that but it looks like the majority of your debt is less than that rate   it does n't sound to me that you will save a significant amount of money by consolidating in this loan   if you can obtain a better consolidation loan in the future it might be worth considering from your question it looks like your reasoning for the consolidation loan is to close the credit card accounts as quickly as possible   i agree that you need to quit using the cards but this can also be accomplished by destroying the cards   the consolidation loan is not needed for this you also mentioned that you are considering adding $ 3,000 to your debt   i have to say that it does n't make sense at all to me to add to your debt especially at when your goal is to eliminate your debt   to answer your question explicitly yes the cash buffer from the loan is a very bad idea here is what i recommend this is based on this answer but customized for you cut up destroy your credit cards   today   you 've already recognized that they are a problem for you   cash checks and debit cards are what you need to use from now on start working from a monthly budget assigning a job for every dollar that you have   this will allow you to decide what to spend your money on rather than arriving at the end of the month with no idea where your money was lost   budgeting software can make this task easier   see this question for more information your first goal should be to put a small amount of money in a savings account perhaps $ 1000 $ 1500 total   this is the start of your emergency fund   this money will ensure that if something unexpected and urgent comes up you wo n't be so cash poor that you need to borrow money again   note this money should only be touched in an actual emergency and if spent should be replenished as soon as possible   at the rate you are talking about it should take you less than a month to do this after you 've got your small emergency fund in place attack the debt as quickly and aggressively as possible   the order that you pay off your debts is not significant the optimal method is up for debate   at the rate you suggested $ 2,000 2,500 per month you can be completely debt free in maybe 18 months as you pay off those credit cards completely close the accounts   ignore the conventional wisdom that tells you to leave the unused credit card accounts open to try to preserve a few points on your credit score   just close them after you are completely debt free take the money that you were throwing at your debt and use it to build up your emergency fund until it is 3 6 months worth of your expenses   that way you 'll be able to handle a small crisis without borrowing anything if you need more help motivation on becoming debt free and budgeting i recommend the book the total money makeover by dave ramsey

unless you have a history of over using credit i.e. you 've gotten yourself into debt trouble then i think that the banker is giving you bad advice in telling you to get your own credit limit reduced   having more credit available to you that is left unused will make your utilization ratio lower which is generally better for your credit score according to this article on creditkarma.com   the sweet spot seems to be 1 20 utilization of your total credit   but remember this is only one factor in your credit score and not even the having a long history of on time payments counts the most my own personal experience seems to bear this out   i have two major credit cards that i use   one card has a high credit limit high for me anyway and i use it for just about everything that i groceries gas durable goods services you name it   the other card has a limit that is about 1/3 of the first and i use it for a few recurring bills and occasional purchases where they do n't take the first card   i also have a couple of department store cards that i use rather infrequently typically 1 purchase every 3 months or so   at the end of each month when the respective statements post each card has a balance that is 15 or less of the credit limit on that card   i pay off the entire balance on each card each month and the cycle repeats   i have never been late on a payment and my credit history for all of these cards goes back 10 years   my credit score is nearly as high as it can go   if having unused credit were a detriment i would expect my score to be much lower so no having too much credit available is not going to hurt you unless you are not using it at all or are tempted to abuse it use too much   the key is to use common sense   have a small number of cards keep them active spend within your means so you can pay off the balance in full after the statement posts and never be late on your payments   that 's all it takes to have good credit

a leveraged trade program   what exactly is that   so let me get this straight   you put just 10 of the total amount of what you 're trading into an account with citi citi 's going to give you 10 1 leverage on your money why and then in 90 days they 'll give you your money back and a loan for ten times the amount either the heat has gotten to me or this is the craziest thing i 've read today you did n't specify what it is you 'd be trading and if your acquaintance did n't share that with you either then it sounds beyond suspect it sounds like total fraud   i could n't imagine a scenario whereby citi would be involved in a scheme like this whatever it is    i suspect that your friend has you opening an account at citi because it makes the whole scam sound more legitimate by tying to a big bank name   it might be worth your time to actually call citi i looked up their number for you   it 's 1 800 and ask them about this particular idea   when they get done they 'll tell you the same thing everyone else is run from this you 're very right to suspect that you ca n't leverage money without it   what would be the point for someone to essentially give you credit on a basis and then not the collateral if you do n't know anything about trading and how leverage works then it would be highly for you to jump into something that you do n't understand   your acquaintance may have been sucked into investing their own money and now they think they 're doing you a favor by telling you about this incredible opportunity   it 's how most scams work   they get the suckers to sign up friends and relatives because they 're playing on the trust between those people stick to what you know or what someone can give you a clear and reasonable explanation of   and have someone you really know and trust preferably a friend or family member who is reasonably successful in managing their own finances to act as a sounding board when things like this come along to help keep you from doing something stupid that you 'll really regret hope this helps good luck

your understanding of the stock market is absolutely correct theoretically however there is a lot more to it a stock on a given day is effected by a lot of factors these factors could really be anything for example if you are buying a stock in an agricultural company and there was no this year there is a big chance that your stock will lose value there is also a chance that a war breaks out tomorrow and due to all the government spending on the war the economy collapses and effects the prices of stocks why does this happen this happens because bad or war can get people to lose confidence in a stock market on the other hand gdp growth and low unemployment rates can make people think positive and increase the demand in a stock driving the prices up the main factor in the stock market is people perceive certain news this causes a stock to rise or fall even before the event actually happens for weather pundits predicted good for next year that news is already known to people so if the weather was correct it might not drive the prices up however if the was way better than people expected it to be it would drive the price up and vice versa    these are just examples at a basic level there are a lot of other factors which determine the price of the stock the best way to look at my personal opinion is the way warren buffet puts it i.e. look at the stock as a business and see the potential growth over a long period of time   there will be unexpected events but in the long run the business must be profitable there are various ways to value a company such as price to earnings ratios peg ratios discounted cash flows and you can also create your own see what works best for you and record your success failure ratio before you actually put money in   good luck

yes management fees cut directly into your profits a fund which achieves 8 growth but costs 1 to maintain delivers only 7 to you compounded over years even a relatively small difference can add up to a significant amount of money this is one of the advantages index funds have they may not be as sophisticated as human managed funds but their expense ratio is so much lower that the end result for the investor is often as good as or better than the more expensive products in fact at least one study found that for each category they researched low expense ratio was a better predictor of good return on investment than anything else they looked at that does n't mean cheapest is always best or most expensive is always worst but it does mean you should be very very sure an expensive fund really is that much better before choosing it and sticking with simple index funds may be a perfectly reasonable choice

well yes but you should also begin to understand the sectoral component of real estate as a market too in that there can be commercial property   industrial property and retail property each of which is capable of having slightly tho usually similar of course different returns yields and risks   whereas you are saving to buy and enter into the residential property market which is different again and valuation principles are often out of here because buying a home although exposing your asset base to real estate risk is nt usually considered an investment as it is often made on emotional grounds not strict investment criteria

what is the formula for calculating the total cost of a loan with extra payments towards the principal the formula you require is the standard one for calculating the time to repay   with larger repayments the time to completely repay the loan is reduced where the total cost of the loan is then n d. explanation calculation the formula for a loan is derived from the sum of the cash flows discounted to present value being equal to the principal   for further info see the section here titled calculating the present value of an ordinary annuity the summation can be reduced to a closed form by induction   rearranging for d and n with the op 's figures the original monthly repayment is $ adding $ 200 each month with the higher repayment the loan is repaid in months instead of 360   of course a bank would simply take a reduced payment in month but the amounts work out the same the saving is $ addendum if the repayments increase was made part way through the term of the loan the summation and formula would be   where then for example if for the first ten years the payments are $ and for the remaining time the repayments are $ the loan is completely repaid in months the saving is plotting over a range of m months

first off great job on your finances so far you are off on the right foot and have some sense of planning for the future   also it is a great question    first i agree with @littleadv take advantage of your employer match do not drop your 401(k contributions below that also good job on putting your contributions into the roth account second i would ask are you out of debt   if not put all your extra income towards paying off debt and then you can work your plan third time to do some math   what will your business look like   how much capital would you need to get started   are there things you can do now on a part time basis to start this business or prepare you to start the business come up with a figure find some mutual funds that have a low beta and back out how much money you need to save per month so you have around that total   then you have a figure e.g. assume you need $ 20,000 and you find a fund that has done 8 over the past 20 years   then you would need to save about $ to be ready to go in 10 years or $ to go in about 5 years   it 's a time value of money calculation the house is really a long way off but you could do the same kind of calculation   i feel that you think your income and possibly locale will change dramatically over the next few years   it might not be bad to double what you are saving for the business and designate one half for the house

only select items first i agree beware the factor any of those items may very well lead to greater consumption which will impact your worse than your bottom line and in this category chips and snacks in general you 'll typically get twice the size bag for the same price as supermarket for a large family this might work ok if one is interested in saving on grocery items the very first step is to get familiar with the unit cost often cents per ounce of most items you buy warehouse store or not this knowledge will make you a better buyer   in general the toiletries are cheaper than at the store but not as cheap as the big sale coupon cost at the supermarket or pharmacy cvs so if you pay attention you may always be stocked up from other sources all that said there are many items that easily cover our membership cost for costco the meat beef $ i can pay up to $ 18 at the supermarket or big 12 to the lb $ easily $ 15 at fish dept funny i buy the carrots mentioned they are less than half supermarket price per lb so i am ahead if we throw out the last 1/4 of the bag more often than not it 's used up 100   truth is everyone will have a different experience at these stores costco will refund membership up to the very end so why not try it and see if the visit is worth it last year i read and wrote a review of a book titled the paradox of choice the book 's premise was the diminishing return that come with too many things to choose from in my review i observed how a benefit of costco is the lack of choice there 's one or two brands for most items not dozens if you give this a bit of thought it 's actually a benefit

gt would they go up at all   i assume based on the rest of your post that this is in reference to new tenants   gt if the minimum wage goes up some workers might choose to move out from living with relatives or roommates so there would be some increase in demand but we would n't be overflowing with potential   i was referring to the areas where people who are currently making $ 15/hr live people can always live in cheaper areas but the neighborhood generally reflects that so people would rather live in the nicer places with less crime and better roads    that you assume people will have relatives that they can live with tells me something   gt and if rents started going up these new entrants to the housing market would likely fallback on their original housing setup with would moderate the impact   looks like you 're starting to get it   gt as far as gas goes while i do n't have specific numbers in front of me i think it 's a reasonable assumption that us labor costs are a relatively small percentage of what you pay at the pump so even if those costs went up you would n't expect prices to surge   oh sorry i thought you meant gas for the and heat you mean gasoline maybe the have it right by calling it petrol    that will increase as the value of our dollar decreases in relation to the rest of the world due to the fact that we do n't really make anything anymore

with respect to the 401(k before taking a hardship withdrawal one must first deplete the ability to take any 401(k loans available this is a regulation the 401(k loan limit is the lesser of $ 50k 50 your vested balance or $ 50k minus the highest loan balance within the last year here 's the good news it is not a taxable event you can pay back over a maximum of 5 years interest is low usually 4.25 or so the bad news if you terminate employment then the loan balance must be repaid or else it becomes taxable income plus a 10 penalty i suggest you consider eliminating the credit card debt via this option pay back as aggressively as possible and if when you terminate you can take the 10 penalty it will be far less of an impact than 25k accruing approximately 25 annually

in general there should be a liquidity premium which means that less liquid stocks should be cheaper that 's because to buy such a stock you should demand a higher rate of return to compensate for the liquidity risk the possibility that you wo n't be able to sell easily lower initial price = higher eventual rate of return that 's what 's meant when investopedia says the security would be cheaper on average is liquidity good it depends here 's what illiquidity is imagine you own a rare piece of art say there are 10 people in the world who collect this type of art and would appreciate what you own that 's an illiquid asset because when you want to sell maybe those 10 people are n't buying maybe they do n't want your particular piece or they all happen to be short on funds or maybe worse only one of them is buying so they have all the negotiating leverage you 'll have to lower your price if you 're really in a hurry to sell maybe if you lower your price enough you can get one of the 10 buyers interested even if none were initially an illiquid asset is bad for sellers illiquid means there are n't enough buyers for you to get a bidding war going at the time of your choosing you 'll potentially have to wait around for buyers to turn up or for a stock maybe you 'd have to sell a little bit at a time as buyers want the shares illiquid can be bad for buyers too if the buyer is for some reason in a hurry maybe nobody is selling at any given time but usually buyers do n't have to be in a hurry an exception may be if you short sell something illiquid brokers often wo n't let you do this btw in that case you could be a forced buyer and this could be very bad on an illiquid security if there are only one or two sellers out there they now have the negotiating leverage and they can ask whatever price they want illiquidity is very bad when mixed with margin or short sales because of the potential for forced trades at inopportune times there are plenty of obscure penny stocks where there might be only one or two trades per day or fewer the spread is going to be high on these because the bids at a given time will just be lowball offers from buyers who are n't really all that interested unless you want to give your stock away in which case they 'll take it and the asks are going to be from sellers who want to get a decent price but maybe there are n't really any buyers willing to pay so the ask is just sitting there with no takers the bids and asks may be limit orders that have been sitting open for 3 weeks and forgotten about contrast with a liquid asset for example a popular model used car in good condition would be a lot more liquid than a rare piece of art though not nearly as liquid as most stocks you can probably find several people that want to buy it living nearby and you 're not going to have to drop the price to get a buyer to show up you might even get those buyers in a bidding war from illiquid penny stocks there 's a continuum all the way up to the most heavily traded stocks such as those in the s&p500 with these at a given moment there will be thousands of buyers and sellers so the spread is going to close down to nearly zero if you think about it just statistically if there are thousands of bids and thousands of asks then the closest bid ask pair is going to be close together that 's a narrow spread while if there are 3 bids and 2 asks on some illiquid penny stock they might be dollars away from each other and the number of shares desired might not match up you can see how liquidity is good in some situations and not in others an illiquid asset gives you more opportunity to get a good deal because there are n't a lot of other buyers and sellers around and there 's some opportunity to negotiate within the wide spread for some assets maybe you can literally negotiate by talking to the other party though obviously not when trading stocks on an exchange but an illiquid asset also means you might get a bad deal especially if you need to sell quickly and the only buyers around are making lowball offers so the time to buy illiquid assets is when you can take your time on both buying and selling and will have no reason for a forced trade on a particular timeline this usually means no debt is involved since creditors including your margin broker can force you to trade it also means you do n't need to spend the money anytime soon since if you suddenly needed the money you 'd have a forced trade on your hands if you have the time then you put a price out there that 's very good for you and you wait for someone to show up and give you that price this is how you get a good deal one more note another use of the term liquid is to refer to assets with low or zero volatility such as money market funds an asset with a lot of volatility around its intrinsic or true value is effectively illiquid even if there 's high trade volume in that any given point in time might not be a good time to sell because the price is n't at the right level anyway the general definition of a liquid investment is one that you 'd be comfortable cashing out of at a moment 's notice in this sense most stocks are not all that liquid despite high trading volume in different contexts people may use liquid in this sense or to mean a low bid ask spread

perhaps an example will help make it more clear any given year   revenue   200 k profit 60 k you get 40 k in profit plus any salary he gets 20 k next year you attract the attention of a competitor and they offer and you accept to sell   you would get 100 of the proceeds this is kind of a bad deal for him as you could easily play accounting tricks to diminish the company 's profits and reduce his pay   for the given example you could pay yourself a 60 k bonus and reduce the profit to zero and eliminate his compensation   there should probably be a revenue metric included in his compensation edit it is really nice to hear you have a desire to treat this person fairly   honesty in business is necessary for long term success   i would simply make his salary dependent upon the revenue he generates   for example lets say you can make a widget for 4 and you expect to sell them for 10   your profit would be 6 and with the suggested split he would receive $ 2 you $ 4 instead i would have him receive like 15 of the revenue generated this allows for some discounts for bulk items and covers the cost of processing sales   it also allows him to share revenue with his staff    alternatively you could also do a split   perhaps 7.5 of revenue and 10 of profit

a matching pension scheme is like free money no wait it actually is free money you are literally earning 100 interest rate on that money the instant you pay it in to the account that money would have to sit in your credit card account for at least five years to earn that kind of return five years in which the pension money would have earned an additional return over and above the 100 mathematically there is no contest that contributing to a matching pension scheme is one of the best investment there is you should always do it well almost always when should you not do it

as described by the other answers there are pretty harmless explanations for that behaviour you could be slightly worried because he gave you exceptionally good deals for both instruments but that 's neither here nor there maybe he simply prices all items way up to be able to give a great discount on either sale you ca n't ever know the actual price you pay in the end is what counts what i would do if i expect in advance or if i notice during the negotiation that i am put under pressure in this way i usually try to do exactly the same in reverse that is i take   a minute to explain up front that i will not under any circumstance buy right now but that this is a purely informational event i will make sure not to have my money card with me any high end salesman worth his sale should have no problem with that at all money aside you are shopping for something that will mean a lot to you the salesman is not some of arbitrary wares everybody understands that not only do you not want to pay too high a price but also that you want to really get the item you want and want to be happy with it for a long time this is a tough decision often and if the salesman can not or does not want to respect that then it would be a clear signal for me that dubious things are going on in fact you would probably be if you got the wrong item for a great price than if you got a great item for a slightly too high price that is something you should probably not tell the salesman but can keep in mind so getting the greatest deal of all times is probably not so high on your priority list

the other answer has mentioned factual resident and you have raised the existence of a tax treaty in your comment and provided a link to a page about determining residency i 'd like to highlight part of the first link you are a factual resident of canada for tax purposes if you keep    significant residential ties in canada while living or travelling    outside the country the term factual resident means that although you left canada you    are still considered to be a resident of canada for income tax    purposes notes if you have established ties in a country that canada has a tax treaty    with and you are considered to be a resident of that country but you    are otherwise a factual resident of canada meaning you maintain    significant residential ties with canada you may be considered a    deemed non resident of canada for tax purposes i 'll emphasize that considered to be a resident of canada for income tax purposes means you do need to file canadian income tax returns the notes section does indicate the potential treaty exemption that you mentioned but it is only a potential exemption note the emphasis theirs not mine on the word may in the last paragraph above please do n't assume may is necessarily favorable with respect to your situation the other side of the may coin is may not the determining your residency status page you mentioned in your comment says this if you want the canada revenue agency 's opinion on your residency    status complete either form determination of residency status    entering canada or form determination of residency status    leaving canada whichever applies and send it to the international    and tax services office to get the most accurate opinion    provide as many details as possible on your form so given your ties to canada i would suggest that until and unless you have obtained an opinion from the canada revenue agency on your tax status you would be making a potentially unsafe assumption if you yourself elect not to file your canadian income tax returns based on your own determination you could end up liable for penalties and interest if you do n't file while you are outside of canada tax residency in canada is not a simple topic for instances let 's have a look at determining an individual ’s residence status it 's a long page but here 's one interesting piece   the courts have stated that holders of a united states permanent residence card otherwise referred to as a green card are    considered to be resident in the united states for purposes of    paragraph 1 of the residence article of the canada u.s. tax    convention for further information see the federal court of appeal 's    comments in v r 2004 fca 2004 dtc    whereas you are in the u.s. on a tn visa intended to be temporary so you would n't be exempt just on the basis of your visa and the existence of the treaty the cra would look at other circumstances consider the centre of vital interests test centre of vital interests test if the individual has a permanent home in both contracting states it    is necessary to look at the facts in order to ascertain with which of    the two states his personal and economic relations are closer thus    regard will be had to his family and social relations his    occupations his political cultural or other activities his place of    business the place from which he administers his property etc the    circumstances must be examined as a whole but it is nevertheless    obvious that considerations based on the personal acts of the    individual must receive special attention if a person who has a home    in one state sets up a second in the other state while retaining the    first the fact that he retains the first in the environment where he    has always lived where he has worked and where he has his family and    possessions can together with other elements go to demonstrate that    he has retained his centre of vital interests in the first state emphasis on last sentence is mine anyway i 'm acquainted with somebody who left canada for a few years to work abroad they assumed that living in the other country for that length of time > 2 years meant they were non resident here and so did not have to file unfortunately upon returning to canada the cra deemed them to have been resident all that time based on significant ties maintained and they subsequently owed many thousands of dollars in back taxes penalties and interest if it were me in a similar situation i would err on the side of caution and continue to file canadian income taxes until i got a determination i could count on from the people that make the rules

how long you need to keep tax records will depend on jurisdiction in general if you discard records in a period of time less than your tax authority recommends it may create audit problems down the road ie if you make a deduction supported by business expense receipts and you discard those receipts next year then you wo n't be able to defend the deduction if your tax authority audits you in 3 years generally how long you keep records would depend on a how much time your tax authority has to audit you and b how long after you file your return you are allowed to make your own amendments in your case us based the irs has straight forward documentation about how long it expects you to keep records period of limitations that apply to income tax returns keep records for 3 years if situations 4 5 and 6 below do not apply to you keep records for 3 years from the date you filed your original return or 2 years from the date you paid the tax whichever is later if you file a claim for credit or refund after you file your return keep records for 7 years if you file a claim for a loss from worthless securities or bad debt deduction keep records for 6 years if you do not report income that you should report and it is more than 25 of the gross income shown on your return keep records indefinitely if you do not file a return keep records indefinitely if you file a fraudulent return keep employment tax records for at least 4 years after the date that the tax becomes due or is paid whichever is later note that the above are the minimum periods to keep records for your own purposes you may want to keep them for longer periods than that for example you may be in a position to discover that you would like to a prior tax return because you forgot to claim a tax credit that was available to you if you would have been eligible to in that period but no longer have documentation you are out of luck

you say that you inherited the money from your mother and are now paying these people using money that is already yours   because of that the money is considered a gift from you to them and the fact that you are doing it in accordance with your mother 's wishes does n't change that   for it to be considered a bequest from your mother 's estate directly to these beneficiaries it would have had to be handled via the regular by the book inheritance procedure and been given to them directly rather than to you with informal instructions to pass it on to them if one gives another person more than $ 14 k in any calendar year there is the potential gift tax issue to address i 'll explain why it 's more a matter of addressing than paying as there are a number of legal ways around this   form 709 is what you 'll use in the end you 'll report the gifts over $ 14 k but no tax will be due as they 'll simply go against your lifetime gifting allowance currently $ 5.49 m per person   note 2 ways to avoid even this obligation if you have a spouse you have a combined $ yr gifting per recipient with no reporting required similarly if the recipient has a spouse you can gift them $ i.e. couple to couple can gift $ 56k yr last why not just gift $ 14 k before december and in january give the second installment if i had money coming in separate from a will i 'd be happy that you honored a verbal request and would n't be so greedy as to expect you to risk a dime of your own finances to transfer the funds immediately

if your employer offers a 401k retirement plan then you can contribute a portion of your salary to your retirement and that will lower your effective income to remain in the 15 bracket although as others have pointed out only the dollars that exceed the 15 bracket will be taxed at the higher rate anyway and if your employer offers any kind of 401k matching contribution that 's effectively a pay raise or 100 return on investment depending on how you prefer to look at it

gt from what i understand the prices of futures are decided after the parties discover the price they think is appropriate for the underlying asset after some time    what do you mean by that the price you buy a futures contract at in the market is the price you get   the concept of price discovery does n't always apply as directly to derivatives as it does to equities when you buy a futures contract not only are you price discovery for the underlying asset you 're also signaling the value of tangible things like storage weather and transportation costs as well as intangibles such as future macroeconomic events global policy decisions etc   also consider that derivatives markets have significant percentages of market participants who are the classic example is a farmer who 's going to be harvesting his corn in oct nov but wants to lock in the price of his corn right now so he can sell futures contracts for delivery any time after nov at whatever they happen to be priced at currently in the market maybe he sells dec contracts for 400 400 cents per bushel 5k bushels per contract assuming he 's based in the us and trading these at trading agricultural grain and whatever happens to the price of corn between now and december he knows he can deliver his corn for $

if you have doubts about the long term prospects at your employer or jobs in your area you may want to keep the option of moving to find a new job open while you save up for a larger down payment on a house   while there are insurance products out there that claim to cover your mortgage they often have loopholes which make them difficult to collect on insurance companies are in business to make money and premiums are high when it 's likely that people will try to collect splitting those premiums into your mortgage and your own self insured unemployment fund i.e. an emergency fund in a money market bank account will usually be a better deal as always make sure you have term life insurance for a family and long term disability insurance just in case something really bad happens in the near term buying a home is a better financial decision when you know you 'll be in an area for at least 5 years saving until you have 20 down on place that you can afford to pay off in 15 years even if you take a 30 year loan will be a lot cheaper and less stressful

a good quick filter to see if a property is worth looking at is if the total rent for the property for the year is equal to 10 of the price of the property   for example if the property is valued at $ 400,000 then the rent collected should be $ 40,000 for the entire year   which is $ per month if the property does not bring in at least 10 per year then it is not likely all the payments can be covered on the property   it 's more likely to be sinking money into it to keep it afloat you would be exactly right as you have to figure in insurance utilities taxes maintenance repair mortgage payments new roof new furnace etc paint etc also as a good rule of thumb expect a vacancy rate of at least 10 or 1 month per year as a precaution if you have money sitting around look into real estate investment trusts   iirc the average dividend was north of 10 last year   that is all money that comes back to you   i 'm not sure what the tax implications are in australia however in canada dividends are taxed very   no mortgage property tax tenants to find or maintenance either

first of all kudos for thinking about budgeting at 21 years old   so many people do n't plan with their money and years later wonder where it all went you are doing a lot of things right with your budget   you 've got saving goals namely your next car and a down payment on a house   you are saving almost 20 of your income for retirement which is amazing i like the luxury fund too   it is good to put some money aside that you can spend on whatever you want guilt free because you know that everything important is already planned for when it comes to budgeting one thing to remember is that your budget does not have to be perfect and it is not set in stone   if you find that your amount for living costs which i 'm assuming includes things like food utilities and rent is too low you can allocate more money to it and reduce something else   there is no need to feel bad if you end up having to change some things around in the budget congratulations on being debt free   i would encourage you to stay out of debt   keep the credit cards paid in full each month and save up for your next car so you can pay cash for that too another saving goal that i would recommend adding to your budget would be an emergency fund   this is basically a pile of cash that is available to you in case something unexpected and urgent comes up that you have n't planned for   by having the emergency fund in place you wo n't be forced to go into debt due to an emergency   the amount recommended is usually 3 to 6 months worth of your expenses

honing in on your last question is there a better way   i think there is but it would require you to change the way you handle your spending and that may not be of interest to you   right now you have a lot of manual work keeping track of expenditures and then entering the every day the great thing about switching to a habit where you pay for everything using a debit or credit card is that you can skip the manual entry by importing your transactions from your bank you mention that your bank does n't allow for exporting there 's still a chance that your bank can connect with a solution like wave accounting which is free and made for small business accounting full disclosure i represent wave if your current bank does n't permit export or connections with wave it may be worth switching to a different bank it 's a bit of a pain to make the switch i know but you really will save a massive amount of time and effort over the course of the year as well as minimize the risk of human error compared to entering your receipts on a daily basis in wave you can still enter all of your cash receipts manually if you want to continue with your current practice of cash payments one important thing to mention too if you 're looking for a better way of doing things make sure it includes proper backup there would be nothing worse than entering all that data onto a spreadsheet and then something happening to your computer and you lose it all   wave accounting is backed up hourly and uses bank level security to keep your information safe one last thing as i mention above wave accounting is free   so if it is a good match for your small business accounting needs it will also be a nice fit for your wallet

when the index is altered to include new players exclude old ones the fund also adjusts the largest and i would say most important index funds are whole market funds like all world ex us or vt total world stock or all japan   and similarly for bonds reits etc   so companies do n't leave or enter these indexes very often and when they do by an initial offering or bankruptcy it is often at a pretty small value some older indices like the djia are a bit more arbitrary but these are generally not things that index funds would try to match more narrow sector or country indices can have more of this effect and i believe some investors have made a living from index arbitrage   however well run index funds do n't need to just blindly play along with this you need to remember that an index fund does n't need to hold precisely every company in the index they just need to sample such that they will perform very similarly to the index   the largest company in the s&p 500 is not likely to have all that much of an effect on the overall performance of the index and it 's likely to be fairly correlated to other companies in similar sectors which are also covered by the index   so if there is a bit of churn around the bottom of the index it does n't necessarily mean the fund needs to be buying and selling on each transition   if i recall correctly it 's been shown that holding about 250 stocks gives you a very good match with the entire us stock market

this does not seem to me to be a very good indication regarding the    risk of the person not paying their balances off if you do not have a source of income then how are you going to repay your debt   not to mention there is for creditors to garnish wages   that is not possible if you have no income   the risk assessment is about the ability of the creditor to recover any moneys loaned and costs and still make a profit for example students have their parents pay them some pocket money to    cover for expenses or a person might be working on    consulting gigs that do not have a fixed monthly or yearly component most credit card companies that are willing to issue to college students will allow you to include money from your parents in your income   credit card companies are looking for customers that will carry a balance and incur fees but be able to pay them   these companies do not make money off of fees and interest that they do not collect   as such work increases risk is it possible for people to get approved for unsecured credit cards    if they do n't hold or have not held for some time a job at the time    of application i was able to while i was in college   though i did have a part time job   if you can show that you have the ability to pay you can usually get a credit card if you do not have bad credit   it will probably be high interest and have alot of fees some of them you will have to pay upfront   but what you probably mean to ask is is it possible to get a no cost unsecured credit card with out a reliable source of income   the answer to that is probably not   even the ones that look like they are free probably have hidden fees

i agree this is an great discussion   i think i understand your position now black scholes is an equilibrium model because its a model that in effect says here 's the price of an option if the underlying follows this stochastic process i guess my question is then what would a strictly no arbitrage equity option model look like then e.g. one analogous to hull white does such a concept even make sense

it does n't bitcoin is n't big enough to have economic relevance and the design of bitcoin means that it pretty much never could be   now cryptocurrencies in general maybe they would someday have some relevance they 'd have to be much better designed than bitcoin but the advantage they might in theory convey which would have actual economic relevance is to lower many   transactions costs by taking banks out of the middle and if they did enough of that then they 'd force banks to lower costs to compete that could in theory be significant

the point of insurance is to trade high variable costs for much lower fixed costs the question is n't whether you can afford what would be a catastrophic event for anyone else but whether it would be better to pay a small amount regularly vs. a possibly larger amount occasionally one of the reasons to buy insurance is to avoid costly litigation rich people are more frequently targeted for litigation by purchasing liability insurance the insurance company pays for the litigation and/or settlement if you are wealthy enough to keep an experienced litigation firm on retainer you may not need that benefit but it might be worth giving that stress to a third party life insurance is also an important part of estate planning because of the tax treatment of insurance payouts compared to the tax treatment of a large estate there are certainly classes of insurance that make less sense for those with great cash flow but money does n't all the benefits of insurance

fwiw i 've got a printed invoice that was included in a shipment of books that i received in july 2013 in the right side side panel at the bottom and in fine print it reads   inc.    410 avenue    north seattle wa    gst registration number no tps    etc if i view the same order online at the on screen version does not have that detail   interestingly at the bottom of the online invoice page it says please note this is not a vat invoice that probably should 've said gst hst for canada and not vat which is presumably for the united kingdom   so it would appear that amazon may only print their gst hst details on the shipped invoice printout which made me wonder did you purchase something that was fulfilled electronically i.e. no physical shipment to you e.g. a kindle book an app or a service like cloud drive if no physical invoice shipped means one does n't get the required gst details then there 's still a canadian tax requirement amazon is n't fulfilling on such invoices though not as broad an issue as you suspected on the other hand if you did get a physical invoice and your comment confirmed you did then what you were seeking was most likely printed on that version just as mine was at the moment i 'm not sure why amazon would n't also include the gst number on electronic versions of invoices whether received by email or viewed on the web site but if i find out more i 'll update my answer later

well first off yes every year the younger generation grows up but remember that the older generation also dying off leaving the market place also what happens if the younger generation ca n't take up enough debt in order to pay for previous commitments   secondly i think you 're confusing the money supply with actual production the two are pretty much divorced from each other money does n't require a resource per se at least not since leaving the gold standard it just requires that someone is able willing to take on debt for example every time you take a loan out from the bank you are effectively creating money this is called bank credit and if you live in a country that uses fractional reserve banking then it makes up a very large part of your money supply think like up to 95 when bank 's create money they only create the principle amount ie the original loan amount and not the interest amount as well this means that someone else needs to take out a loan so that you can repay the amount in interest that you owe on your new loan this does n't normally affect you because there are lots of people taking out lots of loans all the time and money is circulating around in the economy the problem is that eventually the system gets to a stage where people ca n't really take out loans any more they just have too much debt and so you end up with a liquidity crisis like in 2008    so what i was saying is that either i 'm missing something pretty obvious and i 've got this wrong or this is exactly how it works and economists like to just ignore it for the benefits that it offers

the cause of incomplete inaccurate financial data 's appearing on free sites is that it is both complicated and expensive to obtain and parse these data even within a single country different pieces of financial data are handled by different authorities   in the us for example there is one generally recognized authority for stock prices and volumes but a completely different authority for corporate earnings data sec   for futures and options data the only authority is each individual exchange   each of these sources might have a vastly different interface to their data some may have websites others may have others may have to which you must subscribe etc now throw in the rest of the world and all their exchanges and regulatory agencies and you can see how it 's a difficult job to gather all this information parse it on a daily or more frequent basis and check it all for errors there are some companies e.g. bloomberg whose entire business model is to do the above   they spend tens of millions of dollars per year to support the infrastructure and manpower required to keep such a complex system working and they charge their consumers a pretty penny in return do google yahoo pay for bloomberg data access just to display information that we then consume for free   maybe   maybe they pay for some less expensive reduced data set   or a data set that is less rigorously checked for errors even if they pay for the best data available there 's no guarantee that a company 's last earnings report did n't have a glitch in it or that bloomberg 's latest download from the canadian agency for corporate dividends and census taking did n't get cut off in the middle or that the folks at yahoo built a robust system that can handle a particular file 's not arriving on time   bloomberg has dozens or even hundreds of employees focused on just this one task yahoo probably has 5 moral if you really need the best available data you must go to the or you must pay a provider to whom you can then complain when something is wrong   with free data you get what you pay for

i think it may be best to take everything you 're asking line by line once you buy stocks on x day of the month the chances of stocks never actually going above and beyond your point of value on the chart are close to none this is not true companies can go out of business or take a major hit and never recover   take volkswagen for example in 2015 due to a scandal they were involved in their stocks went downhill now their stocks are starting to rise again the investors goal is not to wait as long as necessary to make a profit on every stock purchase but to make the largest profit possible in the shortest time possible sometimes this means selling a stock before it recovers if it ever does i think the problem with most buyers is that they desire the most gain they can possibly have however that is very risky this can be true every investor needs to gauge the risk they 're willing to take and high gain investments are riskier   therefore it 's better to be winning small medium amounts of money of the time than any amount of money < ~25 safer investments do tend to yield more consistent returns but this does n't mean that every investor should aim for low yield investments again this is driven by the investor 's risk tolerance to conclude profitable companies stock tends to increase over time and less aggressive investments are safer but it is possible to lose from any stock investment

i 'm going to diverge from most of the opinions expressed here it is common for financial advisors to assume that your portfolio should become less risky as you get older   explanations for this involve hand waving and saying that you can afford to lose money when young because you have time to make up for it later   however the idea that portfolios should become less risky as you get older is not well grounded in finance theory   according to finance theory regardless of your age and wealth returns are desirable and risk is undesirable   your risk aversion is the only factor that should decide how much risk you put in your portfolio do people become more risk averse as they get older   sometimes   not always   in fact there are theoretical reasons why people might want more aggressive portfolios as they age   for example as people become wealthier they generally become less risk averse young people are not normally very wealthy when you are young most of your wealth is tied up in the value of your human capital   this wealth shifts into your portfolio as you age depending on your field human capital can be extremely risky much riskier than the market   therefore to maintain anything like a constant risk profile over your life you may want very safe investments when young   you mention being a hedge fund manager   if we enter a recession your human capital will take a huge hit because you will have a hard time raising money or getting keeping a job   no one will value your skills and your future career prospects will fall you will not want the double whammy of large losses in your portfolio hedge fund managers are clear examples of people who will want a very safe personal portfolio during their early working years and may be willing to invest very aggressively in their later working and early retirement years in short the received wisdom that portfolios should start out risky and get safer as we age is not always and perhaps not even usually true   a better guide to how much risk you should have in your portfolio is how you respond to questions that directly measure your risk aversion   this questions ask things like how much you would pay to avoid the possibility of a 20 loss in your portfolio with a certain probability

you 're right about your suspicions i 'm not a professional i suggest you talk to a real one a one with cpa ea or attorney credentials and license in your state but i would be very cautious in this case the irs will look at all the facts and circumstances to make a claim but my guess would be that the initial claim would be for this to be taxable income for your husband he 'd have to prove it to be otherwise it does seem to be related to his performance and i doubt that had they not known him through his employment they 'd give him such a gift i may be wrong so may be an irs revenue officer but i 'd bet he 'd think the same did they give gifts like that to anyone else if they did was it to other employees or they gave similar gifts to all their friends and family did those who gave your husband a gift file a gift tax return had they paid the gift tax were they principles in the partnership or they were limited partners i.e. not the ones with authority to make any decision was your husband instrumental in making their extraordinary profit or his job was not related to the profits these people made these questions are about the facts and circumstances of the transaction based on what he can find out and other potential information your husband will have to decide whether he can reasonably claim that it was a gift beware unreasonable claims lead to equally unreasonable penalties and charges irs and your state will definitely want to know more about this transaction its not an amount to slide under the radar this is not a matter where you can rely on a free opinions written by amateurs who do n't know the whole story you or rather your husband are highly encouraged to hire a paid professional a cpa ea enrolled agent or tax attorney with enough experience in fighting gift vs income characterization issues against the irs and the state do n't forget your state an experienced professional may be able to identify something in the facts and the circumstances of the situation that would lead to reducing the tax bill or shifting it to the partners but it is not something you do on your own

traditional ira contributions can be made if you   have compensation and the amount of the contribution is limited to the smaller of your compensation and $ 5500 $ 6000 if age 50 or more note that compensation which generally means earnings form working is not just what appears on a w-2 form as salary or wages it can be   earnings from self employment too as well as commissions alimony etc but not earnings from property pensions and annuities certain types of partnership income you must also not have attained age 70.5 in the year for which the contribution is made   even if you do n't have any compensation of your own you can nonetheless make a traditional ira contribution if your spouse has compensation as long as you are filing a joint tax return with your spouse for spouses filing a joint return the   limits are still the same $ for each spouse and the sum total of traditional ira contributions for both spouses also must not exceed the sum total of earned income of both spouses the age limits etc are all still applicable note that none of this says anything about whether the contributions are deductible   everyone meeting the above requirements is eligible to make contributions to a traditional ira whether the contributions can be deducted from current income depends on the income   those with high enough incomes can not deduct the contribution this is different from roth iras to which people with high incomes are not permitted to make a contribution at all finally the source of the cash you contribute to the ira can be the proceeds of the stock sale if you like you are not required to prove that the cash received from compensation is what you sent to the ira custodian read publication 590 available on the irs website if you need an authoritative reference

i am assuming you mean derivatives such as turbo 's or factors when you say derivatives these derivatives are rather popular in european markets in such derivatives a bank borrows the leverage to you and depending on the leverage factor you may own between 50 to + -3 of the underlying value the main catch with such derivatives from stocks as opposed to owning the stock itself are counterpart risk the bank could go bankrupt in which case the derivatives will lose all their value even if the underlying stock is sound or the bank could decide to phase out the certificate forcing you to sell in an undesirable situation spread costs the bank will sell and buy the certificate at a spread price to ensure it always makes a profit the spread can be 1 5 or even 10 pips which can translate to a the bank taking up to 10 of your profits on the spread   price complexity the bank buys and sells the long certificate at a price that is proportional to the price of the underlying value but it usually does so in a rather complex way if the share rises by € 1 the long certificate will also rise but not by € 1 often not even by leverage € 1   the factors that go into determining the price are   are normally documented in the prospectus of the certificate but that may be hard to find on the internet furthermore the bank often makes the calculation complex on purpose to commissions or other kickbacks to itself in it 's certificate prices   double commissions you will have to pay your broker the commission costs for buying the certificate however the bank that issues the derivative certificate normally makes you pay the commission costs they incur by hiding them in the price of the certificate by reducing your effective leverage in effect you pay commissions twice once directly for buying the derivative and once to the bank to allow it to buy the stock   so as havoc p says there is no free lunch the bank makes you pay for the convenience of providing you the leverage in several ways as an alternative futures can also give you leverage but they have different downsides such as margin requirements however even with all the all the drawbacks of such derivative certificates i think that they have enough benefits to be useful for short term investments or speculation

paying down your mortgage saves lots of interest with a long term mortgage you end up paying twice us much to the bank than the sales price of the house even low mortgage interests are higher than short term bonds the saving of those interest are as much an investment as the interest you get from a bond however before paying off a mortgage other higher interest loans should be paid off also it should be considered if the mortgage interest create a tax reduction in the comparison with any other options

the worth of a credit score cs is variable   if you buy your stuff outright with 100 down then your cs is worthless if you take a loan to buy stuff then it is worth exactly what you save in interest versus a poor score but there is also the access benefit of cs where loans will no longer be available to you forcing you to rent if you consider rent as money down teh then this could factor in the formula for cs worth is different for everyone bill gates cs is worth zero to him walking away from a mortage is not the same as walking away from a loan   a mortage has collateral there are 2 objects the money and the house if you walk away the bank gets the house as a fair trade they keep all money you put against the house to boot sometimes the bank profits when you walk away   so in a good market you could consider walking away to be the moral michael thing to do

what is your investing goal and what do you mean by investing do you necessarily mean investing in the stock market or are you just looking to grow your money also will you be able to add to that amount on a regular basis going forward if you are just looking for a way to get $ 100 into the stock market your best option may be drip investing drip stands for dividend re investment plan the idea is that you buy shares in a company typically directly from the company and then the money from the dividends are automatically used to buy additional fractional shares most drip plans also allow you to invest additional on a monthly basis even fractional shares the advantages of this approach for you is that many drip plans have small upfront requirements i just looked up coca cola 's and they have a $ 500 minimum but they will reduce the requirement to $ 50 if you continue investing $ 50/month the fees for drip plans also generally fairly small which is going to be important to you as if you take a traditional broker approach too large a percentage of your money will be going to commissions other stock drip plans may have lower monthly requirements but do n't make your decision on which stock to buy based on who has the lowest minimum you only want a stock that is going to grow in value they primary disadvantages of this approach is that you will be investing in a only a single stock i do n't believe that can get started with a mutual fund or etf with $ 100 you will be fairly committed to that stock and you will be taking a long term investing approach the motley fool investing website also has some information on drip plans it 's a fairly old article but i imagine that many of the links still work and the principles still apply if you are looking for a more medium term or balanced investment i would advise just opening an online savings account if you can grow that to $ 500 or $ 1,000 you will have more options available to you even though savings accounts do n't pay significant interest right now they can still help you grow your money by helping you segregate your money and make regular deposits into savings

wrong people create money by lending it to the banks   banks are just exchanges between depositors and lenders i.e. an iou exchange   when you deposit $ 1000 you loan the bank $ 1000 and the normal way you deposit $ 1000 is by an iou of $ 1000 by someone else like your employer not by showing up in the bank with cash   nb checks are ious   the issuing central bank do create money if the normal banks have more customers wanting to borrow than lend however that source of money may be raised by the central bank issuing bonds rather than new money

given your time frame i 'm not sure if investing in a 529 is your best option if you 're investing in a 529 you may have to deal with market volatility and the amount you invest over the course of three years could be worth less than what you had initially invested when it comes to your child 's college education the main idea of starting a plan like a 529 is the time frame for your investments to grow you also have the option of pre paying your child 's college but that has restrictions most of the state sponsored pre pay plans limit you to state schools if that was n't obvious also the current political situation is tricky and may influence the cost of education in ~3 4 years but i 'm not sure this is the proper place for that discussion also as far as the viability of these it depends state by state i live in illinois and do n't think i would count on a payout given our current financial situation you could however look into paying tuition now for a state school and it will be risk free in terms of inflation but again it 's hard to anticipate the political scope of this they also have private pre pay plans but that would limit your child 's university options just as the state pre pay check out this investopedia article on 529 plans it 's basic but will give you a high level overview bankrate has an overview as well

gt;what makes you think anything would change if they allowed match money to be distributed tax free they are missing out on a future tax revenue opportunity   i agree that it 's highly unlikely that matching contributions would be made entirely tax free if anything i would expect employer contributions to be treated the same way that after tax non roth 401(k contributions are treated today to the extent that they exceed the new contribution limits it 's also possible that only individual contribution limits will be reduced and employer contribution limits will remain much higher i have n't seen any reporting on the latter   gt;i think the more likely way they would stick it to us is to sunset the roth 401(k all together and make plans go back to the old school pre tax and after tax only where even the earnings on after tax are taxed at distribution   i 'm optimistic that roth 401(k)s are here to stay trump 's priorities seem to be centered around short term budget characteristics with far less concern for the long term as is characteristic of populist administrations in general and eliminating roth 401(k)s would be unpopular and have a negligible impact on tax revenue in the short term

when coming to that conclusion you only consider half of the facts yes all money is debt   but what you miss is that there are other values and assets out there not just money these actually match each other to some degree if the value of all these other assets grow at the same pace as the money supply then there will be a balance   if one grows faster than the other there will be inflation or deflation at least there should be which is the problem not understood

the hard and fast rule is to pay off high interest loans first but each individual 's situation is different so there are some things to consider student loan interest is tax deductible up to $ 2,500   will your student loan interest exceed $ 2,500 for the year   if so i would try to pay down the student loan first to bring down the total interest for the year so that you get as much interest back as possible on your tax return   also it may be beneficial to pay off the car first to close that account so that you are only left with the 1 loan   once you have the car loan payment out of the way you can dedicate that amount to paying off the student loan i 'm in almost the same situation as you   i currently have a mortgage and car payment   in 6 months my grace period will be over and my student loan payments will start   i have $ 100k in student loan debt   so i will have a $ 1,100 mortgage payment $ 1,100 student loan payment and $ 700 car payment car loan is 0   i do n't want to have 3 loans active so i will pay off my car loan in a 2 3 months to get that out of the way   then i will pay down my student loan by paying $ 700 extra every month

if the investments are in a non retirement taxable account there 's not much you can do to avoid short term capital gains if you sell now ways to limit short term capital gains taxes donate you can donate some of the stock to charity before selling it transfer you can give some of the stock to say a family member in a lower tax bracket but there are tons of rules gift limits and wo n't work for little kids or full time students they would still pay taxes at their own rate protect your gains by buying puts wait it out until the long term capital gains rate kicks in this allows you to lock in your gains now but you wo n't benefit from potential future appreciation buying puts also costs $ so do the roi calculation you could also sell a call and buy a put at the same time and lock in your gains for certain but the irs often looks at that as locking in the short term capital gain so be careful and talk to a tax professional if you are considering that method die there 's a step up basis on capital gains for estates source

yeah i was a libertarian until they said they want to end the federal reserve i 'm more of a conservative    your point that a minimum wage at a major metropolitan area is often not a livable wage is irrelevant wages are a   fee given to employees for their work the way an employee earns a high wage is by providing value that is greater than that wage if the value an employee brings to an employer is less than the wage he 's paid an employer will lay off that individual because the employee costs the employer money therefore setting a minimum wage simply means you ban certain individuals usually first time workers or otherwise unskilled from the workforce because they currently do not have the skills and/or experience to justify that wage furthermore the higher you set the minimum wage the more people you deprive of jobs

the simple answer is that what you are doing is an incredible waste of time the normal process is to charge say in january the bill is cut at month end and due by the 15th of february no interest accrues as long as the credit line is sufficient for your monthly spending that 's it   now if you are watching your score closely utilization might become an issue if the statement amount is much over 20 there 's an impact to your score this is easily addressed with a second monthly payment made just before the bill is cut   keep in mind the phrase carrying a balance commonly means not paying the bill in full and letting interest accumulate i understand you did n't mean that the way you are paying your account is n't common and really serves no value

i respectfully disagree with @johnfx 's comment regarding new vs used   john knows what is talking about though he gave an awesome answer on buying a car   what are some tips for getting the upper hand in car price negotiations the answer to your question is based on whether or you not you can stand to have a small loud cheap but reliable car for the next 10 or 15 years if you plan to keep your new car until it dies 20 years from now then a new car can be a fine choice   i just bought a car and the difference between my 2013 hyundai and a comparable 2012 hyundai was n't much   furthermore it was hard to even find a 2012 which justifies the higher price from dealerships and the private market   doing math in my head told me the reduced usage i will get out of the car was n't offset by the slightly lower price depending on the specific age insurance on newer cars can be cheaper than insurance on older cars but you have to have carry more insurance so consider that as well   there might not be a different between a 2010 and a 2012 but there will likely be for a 2005 and the 2013 new cars can be cheaper to operate   lower fuel costs better safety and possibly pollution costs   they are tuned up and you know everything about their history repairs and factory warranties might not be available on a used car so if you car turns out to be a problem your out of pocket is limited these programs do n't mean anything   get an independent certified mechanic to check out any used car you buy   if the dealer wo n't let you get the car checked out then they are n't worth your business   certified cars do n't justify their cost according to consumer reports they are more for marketing than reliability do n't waste money on a third party warranty   either the car is good and does n't need it or it needs a warranty and you should n't buy it   if you new car comes with a factory warranty that is fine   radio host clark howard is indifferent if you want to purchase a factory warranty separately but never a third party just out of college you probably will be better off spending the least amount of money you can for a good used car if for no other reason this likely is n't going to be your car in the near future   only you can answer that if you have a feeling you wo n't keep your tiny car well into your 30s then definitely do n't buy a new car    also my experience only applies to my make and model   certain models of cars keep their value and the difference between new and used is n't much for the most recent model years but there are many more makes and models that do n't pan out that way

regardless of if the higher profits are create from higher volumes and more workers the key word there is profits not revenue not income or any similar word profits a word used to describe the amount left after paying expenses such as the salaries of those additional workers if any   the point is the worker deserve a share of those profits it is their work that has made them in addition to the work of the ceo of course but still the ceo could not have created better margins or done better deployment of capital if it were not for the efforts of those workers in the first place   this is the main problem with the economy right now no one feels the responsibility to those who have helped them succeed they keep using a slash and burn financial strategy slash salaries and benefits and burn up your labor force to extract every dollar you can for the top the only problem is now they 're running out of things to slash and the workers they 've burned have nothing left and they wonder why the economy is in the crapper   i keep being reminded of a quote from as said by the evil    i raise their taxes only to be told there 's nothing left for me to tax imagine

the justification for an act typically comes after the decision is made people operate under a fairly universal set of instincts and social behaviors so i think condemning him for this behavior directly is short sighted    i would ask instead why do people feel that cheating organizations like target is so emotionally easy i would wager that is not the sort of person who would steal his neighbors unlocked bike from his porch or hustle a man for bus fare so what is different   we seem generally as a population to have less emotional investment in strangers than ourselves even less in people from other cultures and even less in animals we will fight hard to save the lives of 5000 of our soldiers less hard to save a million of their and we certainly do n't give a fuck about taking a bee 's honey or killing a chicken and eating it again generally    i would propose that organizations like big box stores fall somewhere between animals and foreign peasants as far as our feelings of responsibility towards them it is a little more complicated than that because obviously a big box store supports the lives of a certain number of people but if a big box store were delicious and did not support people i would wager it would not survive for very long   so the defining difference seems to be whether or not you are a person who makes a rational decision that the store provides more good for your people or if it is a net harmful force whether you have strong ingrained emotional belief structures regarding cheating or and whether your rational mind your emotional decision making mine rarely does though i try   a person who thinks that they do more harm to the population than good even with a strong sense of the of stealing might steal from the store even though they would never steal from another person they would be completely morally justified in this act   similarly a person who thinks that the store does more good than harm and does not steal from the store regardless of whether or not they think stealing is wrong would also be morally just in their actions    a person who thinks they do no harm to the community but has no negative emotional connection to the act of theft might steal from both the store and their neighbor they would obviously not be justified   a person with a strong sense of the of stealing which their rational decision regarding the value of a big box store will not steal but they may not be morally justified in the decision depending on their rational take   i think i fall into the first category i think it is wrong not to do harm to an organization like target when it is possible to do so yet i generally do n't go about this by stealing because getting caught would be much worse than whatever harm i could do by jacking a few dollars worth of merchandise this offer allowed a means of theft without getting caught and had i been aware of it i probably would have availed myself of it   as it stands i just work extremely hard in the field of with the hopes that one day i will contribute to technologies which will allow humans to live and thrive without having to buy food clothes medicine or shit from target

in major east coast cities the universities often own large of real estate because they 're simply very rich institutions with the longest and time horizons in the entire city   but yeah mit is pretty much the engineering school in the united states   can maybe compete   and no i 'm not saying that because i like mit   i think they 're suicide inducing slave with a depressing campus who own half of cambridge but pay no property taxes because they 're a university   i like the land grant state universities and went to amherst

i think it depends on who is being paid for your app   do you have a company the is being paid   or is it you personally if you have a company then that income will disappear by offsetting it through expenses to get the software developed if they are paying you personally then you can probably still get the income to disappear by file home office expenses i think either way you need to talk to an accountant if you do n't want to mess with it since the amount of income is small then i would think you can file it as additional income maybe a 1099

so are you saying neither the older generation or our generation assuming you 're under 35 are prepared for actually making decisions and being responsible   because could n't one argue that corporations evolve with the environment around them the same reason we have things like banks sponsoring gay rights which i 'm not saying is a bad thing for anything just the fact that we 've made it acceptable for ceos to do this stuff in the same way that all things equal would never have happened in 1995

gt the bpp 's inflation measure is markedly different from the government 's the economists average all the prices online meaning the basket of goods is whatever you can buy on the web some items like books are most often bought online others like cats are not plus the researchers do not weight certain items prices even if they tend to make up a larger proportion of household spending   see that last line is where the problem with this alternate independent system lies   it may not adjust the prices in the same manner as the cpi but it operates on an equally flawed assumption which at it 's fundamental root is still the same as the hedonic adjustment   the fact that dvd 's may have dropped from $ 20 to $ 5 each or that last years nearly obsolete model of a laptop computer tablet or cell phone has likewise dropped from $ 500 to $ 250 and in that sense just like the cpi excluding things like gas amp from the core inflation rate the bpp similarly creates a false picture of inflation as being just a crude aggregated average of price changes   the problem that the cpi or other indices include weighting and adjustments it is that the weighting and adjustments are biased and they have been altered many times over the past decades and the methodology being used is one that is biased to create a lower inflation rate one that a reduction in lifestyle quality of goods as being an acceptable change rather than a sign amp signal of the actual problem   thus far the bpp has tracked the cpi closely   yes it has extremely closely   so closely in fact that it belief
