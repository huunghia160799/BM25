looking at your dates i think i see a pattern   it appears that your statement closing date is always 17 business days before the last business day of the month   for example if you start at may 31 and start counting backwards skipping saturdays and may 30 memorial day you 'll see that may 5 is 17 business days before may 31   i can not explain why bank of america would do this   if you ask them let us know what they say if it bothers you find another bank   i do most of my banking checking savings etc with a local credit union their statements end on the last day of the month every month without fail very nice in my opinion i have two credit cards with nationally known banks and although those statements end in the middle of the month they are consistently on the same date every month one of them is on the 13th the other date i ca n't recall right now you are right a computer does the work and your statement date should be able to fall on a weekend without trouble even when these were assembled by hand the statement date could still be on a weekend and they just would n't write it up until the following monday   you should be able to find another bank or credit union that does this

they need to spread the work for all customers over the whole month and they do n't work on weekends combine the two and the rule becomes clear if months have minimum of n working days of all customers gets set on each day you seem to be on day 5 if the month starts with a monday the fifth working day is the 5 friday if there is a sat or sun in between it will be the 6th and if there is both a sat and a sun in there it will be the 7th however the statement itself is not very important at all it is just the day where they print it on paper or even only on a pdf you can see your bank account activity every day 24/7 by checking online and nothing keeps you from printing it on every 1st of the month if you want or every day or whenever you prefer

you can make a rough calculation of the annual turnover rate of stocks by calculating the institutional investors holding of that stock institutional investors are the only firms that are required to provide such data the good this is they usually make the lion share of trading activity on the other hand this task might proof    a different ratio that could be used as a substitute share turnover which is calculated as   share turnover gives the number of shares traded as a fraction of the number of shares outstanding for example if you compare the results of stock turnover for three companies and the results came as follows   company a share turnover 1.5 times company b share turnover 3 times company c share turnover 0.3 times from the results we can conclude that for a particular period company c had the least activity and the number of shares traded for that period was only a small fraction of the shares outstanding while other traders of company c hold most shares and never trade them if you make a cross analysis of a list of businesses you intend to invest in you could figure which one has the least number of in the shares traded

powers makes a good point trading costs may eat up a significant portion of your roi a fee as little as 2 can consume more than 50 of your long term roi a rule of thumb is keep your fees to less than 1 one way to do that is to buy stock in companies that have a drip with a share purchase plan often the allows investors to purchase shares for low fees or free once you have the ability to purchase shares for virtually free you can   use roughly you send more money to the companies whose share prices are near their 52-week low and less money to those who are near their 52-week high getting back to your original question

the ruble was is and will be very unstable because of unstable political situation in russia and the economy strongly dependent of the export of raw resources what you can do i assume you want to minimize risk the best way to achieve that is to make your savings in some stable currency euro and swiss franc are currently very stable currencies so storing your surpluses in them is a very good option if you want to keep your money safe to prevent political risk you should keep your money in countries with stable political regime which are unlikely to nationalize the savings of the citizens in predictable future as for your existing savings in rubles it 's a hard deal i assume as the web developer you have a plenty of money which have lost a lot of value if you convert them to euro or francs you will the current value after the loss you 'll safe them ruble falling down but in case the ruble will return to previous value you 'll loose   keeping savings in currencies is however speculation like investing in gold etc so if you can mentally accept the loss and want to sleep good convert them you have also option to invest in properties for example buy an extra appartment it 's a good way to deal with financial surplus in europe in us however you should be aware in it 's connected with the political risk the real estates can be confiscated in any moment by the state and you ca n't run away with it the savings can also be confiscated but there 's a fair chance you 'll manage to rescue them if you act quickly

it depends on whether you want a career as a fund analyst or if you want to be an trader a fund manager will have many constraints that a private investor does n’t have as they are managing other people ’s money   if they do invest their own money as well they usually would invest it differently from how they invest the fund 's money many would just get someone else to invest their money for them just as a surgeon would get another surgeon to operate on a family member my suggestion to you is to find a job you like doing and build up your savings whilst you are building up your savings read some books you said you do n’t know much about the financial markets then learn about them get yourself a working knowledge about both fundamental and technical analysis work out which method of analysis if not both suits you best and you would like to know more about as you read you will get a better idea if you prefer to be a long term investor or a short term trader or somewhere in between or a combination of various methods now you will start to get an idea of what type of books and areas of analysis you would like to concentrate on once you have a better idea of what you would like to do and have gained some knowledge then you can develop your investment trading plan and start paper trading once you are happy with you plan and your paper trading you can start trading with a small account balance not more than $ 10,000 and preferably under $ 5,000 no matter how well you did with paper trading you will always do worse with real money at first due to your emotions being in it now so always start off small if you want to become good at something it takes time and a lot of hard work you ca n’t go from knowing nothing to making a million dollars per year without putting in the hard yards first

i do n't know the details of whether or not you should pay this money or who is at fault but clearly you believe that you do not owe the money and the bank investigation seems to agree with you since they gave you your money back   since you have your money and they have n't sued you the only issue yet remaining is your credit report here is what i would suggest   first make sure you check all three credit reports to see which reports the collection appears on then dispute the report with each credit bureau reporting the problem there is an article on creditkarma that explains the process when you file your dispute with the credit they will investigate this usually involves asking the creditor for proof of the debt and if you did n't sign anything they probably wo n't have any proof hopefully the credit bureaus will come to the same conclusion as the bank did and remove the collection from your credit reports   in my opinion it does n't make sense to pay them now if you do n't believe you owe it paying them wo n't remove all the bad stuff from your credit report but it will improve it and you do n't want to pay them and then immediately sue them   if however the credit bureaus side with the landlord and leave this on your report paying the $ 300 is better on your report than leaving the unpaid debt on there

note the main trade off here is the costs of holding cash rather than being invested for a few months vs trading costs from trading every month   let 's start by understanding investing every month vs every three months   first compare holding cash for two months at for most canadians right now and then investing on the third month vs being invested in a single stock etf ~5 annually   at those rates she is forgoing equity returns of around   these costs and the $ 10 for one big trade give total costs of $ dollars    if you were to trade every month instead there would be no cost for not being invested and the trading costs over three months would just be   so in this case it would be better to trade monthly instead of every three months however i 'm guessing you do n't trade all $ 2000 into a single etf   the more etfs you trade the more trading more infrequently would be an advantage   you can redo the above calculations the amount across more etfs and including the added trading costs to get a feel for what is best   you can also rotate as suggests but that can leave you unbalanced temporarily if not done carefully   a second option would be to find a discount broker that allows you to trade the etfs you are interested in for free   this is not always possible but often will be for those investing in index funds   for instance i trade every month and have no brokerage costs dollar cost averaging and value averaging are for people investing a single large amount instead of regular monthly amounts   unless the initial amount is much much larger than the monthly amounts this is probably not worth considering edit hopefully the above edits will clarify that i was comparing the costs including the forgone returns of trading every 3 months vs trading every month

the actual physical act of obtaining the sequence data is n't the cause of the delay   the current estimates of 8 10 weeks for tumor genome sequencing are mainly due to the data processing     pooling data and processing power would actually be a huge advantage in this   after you have all the sequencing data you need to identify changes in the tumor and then determine what exactly they mean the really difficult part   if centers around the world pool their data and correlate it to clinical information the data set expands exponentially which helps everyone   otherwise each center will have their own data set which will probably get published eventually but there will be a huge delay before this information gets to the appropriate people where it can help   data pooling of this sort is already done in a lot of other cases newborn screening etc

i used to own a few investment properties so i 'm pretty familiar with this   as mrchrister mentions lenders see investment mortgages as higher risk people who fall into financial trouble are much more likely to let their investment properties go than their personal residence   consequently the interest rates and downpayment requirements are generally higher typically a mortgage for an investment property will require 20 down vs. as low as 3 5 down for a personal residence   with excellent credit and some shopping around you could probably do 10 down   interest rates are typically about a half percent higher as well you 'll also find that the more investment properties you have the harder it becomes to finance new ones   banks look at debt to income ratios to determine if you are over extended   typically banks like to see that your housing payments are less than 20 or so of your income   however with rental properties housing payments generally account for far more than 20 of your rental income   other income you have can offset that but after buying 2 3 houses or so your dti generally into the range where lenders are uncomfortable lending to you anymore   this is why you 'll find that many rental properties are bought on land contracts with owner financing rather than with mortgages

well there are a few comments that need to be made here i suppose though at work now so this will be short    first there is the difference between banking which indeed mostly looks at capital adequacy ratios and uses var as one of the methods to get to the risk weighted assets then there is the buy side which is more interested in how much would i stand to lose in portfolio x if markets head south and how does that relate to what a have promised my client in the first situation it is the bank itself taking on the risk in the second the risk lies entirely with the client an asset manager could lose 100 on your regular old equity mandate and it would n't hit him except for loss in fees whereas a significant trading loss for a bank can put it out of business    my personal view is that all of these metrics are merely useful instruments and for a large part they all tell me the same thing a higher duration on a fixed income mandate will give a higher var a higher shortfall more negative results on rates stress scenarios etcetera they only really become useful when imposing limits on them or using them to steer based on whatever the prevailing risk appetite is at a certain point in time or when looking at trends or relative risk of portfolio a vs b   do n't get me wrong i too can debate for hours about var parameters confidence intervals look back periods return frequency decay factors parametric or historical monte carlo simulation etcetera but i think in practise that is really of limited use if you take any ex ante risk measure and you thoroughly understand it make an informed choice about risk appetite and steer on it you basically have done your job as a risk manager   sorry i know i am not answering your questions in a structured way but am on my phone so it 's hard to keep overview pm me if you want to discuss things in detail

if you have the money and the determination to pay off all the cards in six months then the order will make little difference to your credit score and to your finances   if you had less money available say you could pay off $ 500 a month in total then it would be good for financial reasons to pay off the credit card with the highest interest rate first so you pay less interest it would be good for psychological reasons to pay the card with the smallest amount first so you feel successful quickly and some people need that feeling of success to continue paying off just psychological and if these things contradict each other figure out what is more important   and whatever you do paying back your debt is better than not paying it back so if you ca n't make up your mind then you pay 1 then 2 then 3 then 4 then 5

put options for kids you have a big box of candy bars you saved up your allowance to get a lot of them so you could have one whenever you want one but you just saw a commercial on tv for a new toy coming out in one month your allowance alone wo n't buy it and you want that toy more than you want the candy so you decide that you 'll sell the candy to your friends at school to buy the toy now you have a choice you can sell the candy now and put the money in your piggy bank to buy the toy later or you can save the candy and sell it in a month when you actually need the money to buy the toy you know that if you sell all the candy you have today you can get 50 cents a bar that 's not quite enough to buy the toy but your allowance will cover the rest   what you do n't know is how much you might be able to sell the candy for in a month you might be able to get 75 cents a bar if you did you could pay for the toy with just the money from the candy and even have some left over but you might only be able to sell them for 25 cents each and you would n't have enough to buy the toy even with your allowance you 'd like to wait and see if you could get 75 cents each but you do n't want to risk getting only 25 cents each so you go to your father he and his co workers like these candy bars too so he 'd be willing to buy them all and sell them to his friends the way you 're planning to do with yours you ask for the option to sell him all the candy bars for 50 cents each in one month if you find out you can get more for them at school you want to be able to take that deal but if you ca n't sell them for 50 cents at school you 'll sell them to your dad now your dad knows that he could have the same problem selling the candy at 50 cents or more that you are afraid of so he offers a compromise if you pay him $ 5 now he 'll agree to the deal you figure that even without that $ 5 between your allowance and the candy money you can still buy the toy so you take the deal   in one month you can offer the candy at school if nobody will pay 50 cents you can sell the candy to your dad when you get home but if the kids at school will pay 50 cents or more you can sell it all at school either way you have enough money to buy the toy and you can also choose which price to accept but you had to pay your dad $ 5 and you ca n't get that back so if it turns out that you can sell the candy at school for 50 cents same as today then because you paid the $ 5 you do n't end up with as much as if you 'd simply waited in the financial market this type of option is a put option someone who owns something that 's traded on the market like a stock can arrange to sell that stock to someone else at an agreed on price and the seller can additionally pay some money to the buyer up front for the option to not sell at that price now if the stock market goes up the seller lets the contract expire and sells his stock on the open market if it goes down he can exercise the option and sell at the agreed upon price to the buyer if however the stock stays about the same whether he chooses to sell or not the money the seller paid for the option means he ends up with less than he would have if he had n't bought the option call options for kids let 's say that you see another ad on tv for another toy that you like that was just released you check the suggested retail price on the company 's web site and you see that if you save your allowance for the next month you can buy it but in school the next day everybody 's talking about this toy saying how they want one some already have enough money others are saving up and will be able to get it before you can you 're afraid that because everyone else wants one it 'll drive up the price for them at the local store so that your month 's allowance will no longer buy the toy so you go to your dad again you want to be able to use your allowance money for the next month to buy the new toy you 're willing to wait until you actually have the money saved up before you get the toy but you need that toy in a month so you want your dad to buy one for you and hold it until you can save up to buy it from him but you still want it both ways if the price goes down in a month because the toy 's not so new anymore and people do n't want it you do n't want to spend your entire month 's allowance buying the one from your dad you just want to go to the store and buy one at the lower price you 'll pay him $ 5 for the trouble right now whether you buy the toy he got you or not your dad does n't want to have a toy he 's not using sitting around for a month especially if you might not end up buying it from him so he offers a different deal in one month if you still want it he 'll stop by the store on his way home and pick up the toy you 'll then reimburse him from the allowance you saved up if it ends up costing less than a month 's allowance so be it but if it costs more than that you wo n't have to pay any more this will only cost you $ 3 because it 's easier for him but because he 's not buying it now there is a small chance that the item will be out of stock when he goes to buy it and you 'll have to wait until it 's back in stock you agree on the condition that if you have to wait longer than a month for your toy because he could n't get one to sell you he pays you back your $ 3 and knocks another $ 5 off the cost to buy the toy from him the basic deal to buy something at an agreed price with the option not to do so is known as a call option someone who wishes to buy some stocks bonds or commodities at a future date can arrange a deal with someone who has what they want to buy them at a specific price the buyer can then pay the seller for the option to not buy the counter offer dad made where he will buy the toy from the store at whatever price he can find it then sell it to you for the agreed price is known as a naked call in finance it simply means that the seller who is in this case offering the option to the buyer does n't actually have what they are agreeing to sell at the future date and would have to buy it on the open market in order to turn around and sell it this is typically done when the seller is confident that the price will go down or wo n't go up by much between now and the date of the contract in those cases either the buyer wo n't exercise the option and will just buy what they want on the open market or they 'll exercise the option but the difference between what the seller is paying to buy the commodity on the market and what he 's getting by selling it on contract is within the price he received for the option itself if however the price of an item skyrockets the seller now has to take a significant real loss of money by buying something and then selling it for far less than he paid if the item flat out is n't available the buyer is usually entitled to penalties for the seller 's failure to deliver if this is all understood by both parties it can be thought of as a form of insurance

right because there was no profits the company managed to grow by keeping very tight control of costs with respect to revenue it 's not a loophole the alternative is spending less or charging more either of these things probably has significantly worse outcomes to the company slower growth due to lack of reinvestment in the business or slower growth due to not attracting as many customers through competitive pricing what they have done is become a very valuable company due to a strong revenue stream you can ask whether a strong revenue stream alone is enough to justify their valuation but investors seem to think so and it also seems to indicate that they expect the stock price to continue rising or they would n't spend that much   when amazon started i remember people joking they lose money on every sale but they make up for it in volume seems to have worked out for them in the long run

some other suggestions index tracking mutual funds these have the same exposure as etfs but may have different costs for example my investment manager in the uk charges a transaction fee on etfs but not funds but caps platform fees on etfs and not funds target date funds if you are saving for a particular date often retirement but could also be buying a house kids going to college mid life crisis motorbike purchase a luxury cruise to see an eclipse etc these will automatically rebalance the investment from risk tolerant ie equities to risk averse ie fixed income as the date approaches you can get reasonably low fees from vanguard and i imagine others income funds etfs focusing on stocks which are expected to pay a good dividend the idea is that a consistent dividend helps smooth out volatility in prices giving you a more consistent return historically that worked pretty well but given fees and the current low yields it might not be smart right now that said vanguard equity income costs 0.17 and i think yields which is n't bad

the gnucash manual has a page with examples of opening new accounts the tl;dr is use the equity opening balance to offset your original amounts the further explanation from the gnucash page is as shown earlier with the assets checking account the starting    balances in an account are typically assigned to a special account    called equity opening balance to start filling in this chart of    account begin by setting the starting balances for the accounts    assume that there is $ 1000 in the savings account and $ 500 charged on    the credit card open the assets savings account register select view from the menu and check to make sure you are in basic ledger style you will    view your transactions in the other modes later but for now let ’s    enter a basic transaction using the basic default style from the assets savings account register window enter a basic 2 account transaction to set your starting balance to $ 1000 transferred    from equity opening balance remember basic transactions transfer    money from a source account to a destination account record the    transaction press the enter key or click on the enter icon from the assets checking account register window enter a basic 2 account transaction to set your starting balance to $ 1000 transferred    from equity opening balance from the liabilities visa account register window enter a basic 2 account transaction to set your starting balance to $ 500 transferred    from equity opening balance this is done by entering the $ 500 as a    charge in the visa account or decrease in the opening balance    account since it is money you borrowed record the transaction    press the enter key or click on the enter icon you should now have 3 accounts with opening balances set assets checking assets savings and liabilities visa

this is rather simple if you understand a trailing limit order but to be sure i am going to explain a limit trailing limit and trailing lit order i am going to use an example assuming that you already own a stock and want to sell it limit order i place an order to sell 100 pg this order will only be executed if the bid price of pg is at $ or greater trailing limit order i place an order to sell 100 cat with a trailing 5 this order will be executed when cat drops 5 below the highest point it reaches after you place this order so if you place this order at and the stock drops 5 to $ your order will be executed however if the stock jumps to $ 98 the order will not be executed until the stock falls to $ the sell point will go up with the stock and will always remain at the specified or $ amount behind the high point trailing limit if touched order i place an order to sell 100 intc with a trailing 5 if the stock touches $ 25.00 essentially this is the same as the trailing limit except that it does n't take effect until the stock first gets $ 25.00   i think the page they provide to explain this is confusing because i think they are explaining it from the shorting a stock perspective instead of the selling a stock you want to profit from i could also be wrong in how i understand it my advice would be to either call their customer support and ask for a better explanation or what i do in my finances avoid things i do n't understand

currently there is simply no reason to do so it 's not a problem it is no more of a problem or effort to denote 5,000 than it is to denote 50.00 but if there were a reason to do so it would n't be all that difficult of course there would be some minor complications because some people mostly old people presumably would take time getting used to it but nothing that would stop a nation from doing so in iceland this has happened on several occasions in the past and while iceland is indeed a very small economy it should n't be that difficult at all for a larger one a country would need a grace period while the old currency is still valid new editions of already circulating cash would need to be produced and a coordinated time would need to be set at which point financial institutions change their balances of course it would take some planning and coordination but nothing close to for example two or more currencies into one like the did with the euro the biggest side effect there was an inflation shot when the currencies got changed in each country but this can be done even with giant economies like germany and france cutting off two zeros would be a in comparison but in case of currencies like the japanese yen there is simply no reason to take off 2 zeros yet northern americans may find it strange that the numbers are so high but that 's merely a matter of what you 're used to there is no added complication in paying vs. 50 at a restaurant it merely takes more space on a computer screen and bill and that 's not a real problem besides most of the time even in n america the cents are listed as well and that does n't seem to be enough of a problem for people to concern themselves with it 's only when you get into hyper inflation when the shear space required for prices becomes a problem that economies have a real reason to cut off zeros

options have legitimate uses as a way of hedging a bet but in the hands of anyone but an expert they 're gambling not investing they are extremely volatile compared to normal stocks and are one of the best ways to lose your shirt in the stock market yet invented how options actually work is that you 're negotiating a promise that at some future date or range of dates they will let you purchase some specific number of shares call or they will let you sell them that number of shares put at a price specified in the option contract the price you pay or are paid to obtain that contract depends on what the option 's seller thinks the stock is likely to be worth when it reaches that date note that if you do n't already own the shares needed to back up a put option you 're promising to pay whatever it takes to buy those shares so you can sell them at the agreed upon price note that by definition you 're betting directly against experts as opposed to a normal investment where you 're usually trying to ride along with the experts you are claiming that you can predict the future value of the stock better than they can and that you will make a profit on the difference between the value locked in by the option and the actual value at that time which exceeds the cost of purchasing the option in the first place   let me say that again the option 's price will have been set based on an expert 's opinion of what the stock is likely to do in that time if they think that it 's really likely to be up $ 10 per share when the option comes due really unlikely for a $ 20 stock they will try to charge you almost $ 10 per share to purchase the option at the current price almost because you 're giving them a guaranteed profit now and assuming all the risk if they 're less sure it will go up that much you 'll pay less for the option but again you 're giving them hard money now and betting that you can predict the probabilities better than they can unless you have information that the experts do n't have in which case you 're probably committing insider trading this is a very hard bet to win and it can be extremely misleading since the price during the option period may cross back and forth over the enough that you 'll make a profit line many times until you actually commit to exercising the option or not that 's all imaginary money which may vanish the next minute unless you are willing and able to invest pro level resources in this you 'd probably get better odds in atlantic city and definitely get better odds in las vegas if you do n't see the sucker at the poker table he 's sitting in your seat and betting against the guy who designed and is running the game is usually not a good idea

every company has stocks    for the stocks to be traded via some stock exchange the companies must follow the eligibility criteria and guidelines once done these are then listed on the stock exchange and can be traded the advantage amongst others of listing is liquidity and stocks can easily be bought and sold   some small companies or closely held companies may not want to list on stock exchange and hence are not traded this does not mean they ca n't be bought and sold they can be outside of the market however the deals are complex and every deal has to be worked out during the course of time a stock that is traded on a stock exchange would either fail to meet the criteria or voluntarily choose not to be traded and follow the delisting process either by stock exchange or by company after this the stocks are no longer traded on the exchange

ethically you and your landlord should always report both income and expense as there technically exists a service and a rent so it is subject to taxation on the other hand it can be considered an exchange of a simple favour and if it does n't involve a money exchange or any profits i am assuming that you are not selling what you or your landlord produce on the market no value can be calculated thus no taxation can be applied this changes though if a contract is involved as a legal value can be estimated caution these subjects can vary on an extreme level of of what can and can not be claimed as income and expense which can vary per country state province and even per judge as well as the nature and sector of the work also if you intend to formalize this relationship the type of contract and reporting forms do vary per state as well so it might be best to confirm it with a local legal advisor to avoid unfortunate surprises

account statements and the account information provided by your personal finance software should be coming from the same source namely your bank 's internal accounting records so in theory one is just as good as the other that being said an account statement is a snapshot of your account on the date the statement was created while with your personal finance application is dynamically generated upon request usually once a day or upon login   so what are the implications of this your account statement will not show transactions that may have taken place during that period but were n't posted until after the period ended common with credit card transactions and checks instead they 'd appear on the next statement because electronic account are more frequent and not limited to a specific time period those transactions will show up shortly after they are posted so it is far easier to keep track of your accounts electronically every personal finance software i 've ever used supports manual entries so what i like to do is on a daily basis i manually enter any transaction which was n't posted automatically this usually only takes a few minutes each evening then when the transaction eventually shows up it 's usually reconciled with my manually entered one automatically   aside from finding infrequent bank errors this has the benefit of keeping me aware of how much i 'm spending and how much i have left i 've also caught a number of cashier errors this way noticing i was double charged for an item while entering the receipt total and its the best defense against fraud and identity theft i can think of if you 're looking at your accounts on a daily basis you 're far more likely to notice an unusual transaction than any monitoring service

reducing supply does n't cause demand   it may shift the equilibrium price or supply can fall even faster than demand   certain goods are pretty inelastic such as food people will still pay for it even if the price goes up because the alternative is starving to death   in that case you have a point that cost of production puts a price floor there     for completely elastic goods such as bitcoin which have no intrinsic use or demand beyond people that think it is a speculative investment it 's a totally different situation   why is it that i find in any discussion about bitcoin the pro bitcoin side has not even a high school level understanding of basic economics

i think we should re think about paying taxes if they do n't have to pay income tax it is just one way to minimize the revenue and maximize their expense as you know profit or loss = revenue expense if they want to reduce their income tax they have to do this we ca n't say anything about the income tax that must pay they maybe have some rights to encourage their business by being decreased some kinds of taxes it 's very normal if you have some knowledge about tax and accounting audits you will have a clearly point about it i 'm not native speaker i might not understand your tax rules but they have all general standards all over the world if i use wrongly grammar or misunderstanding pls forgive me thank you

on the one hand it 's a great idea to open a roth ira now once you 've got the cash to contribute it 's a tax designation sounds like it would fit your meager earnings this year the main reason to open one now rather than later is that some types of withdrawls require the account be aged 5 years but you can also withdraw the amount you 've contributed tax free any time student loans right now are pricey so if you 're carrying a balance at say 6.8 percent fixed you should pay that down asap beyond that i 'd keep the rest liquid for now having that kind of liquid cash is extremely reassuring and many of the biggest returns on investment are going to be in your personal life more fuel efficient vehicles energy efficient appliances computer backups chest and bulk meat purchases etc   one example i see every six months is car insurance i can pay for six months in full or i can pay a smaller monthly bill plus a small fee that fee is well above current market rates you see this everywhere people searching for lower minimum payments rather than lower total costs save your money up and be the smart buyer it 's too damn expensive to be broke

the policy you quoted suggests you deposit 6 minimum that $ 6,000 will cost you $ 4,500 due to the tax effect yet after the match you 'll have $ 9,000 in the account taxable on withdrawal but a great boost to the account   the question of where is less clear there must be more than the 2 choices you mention most plans have too many choices this into my focus on expenses a few years back pbs frontline aired a program titled the retirement gamble in which fund expenses were discussed with a focus on how an extra 1 in expenses will wipe out an extra 1/3 of your wealth in a 40 year period very simple to illustrate this go to a calculator and enter .99 raised to the power of 40 is the result my 401(k has an expense of .02 that 's of 1 raised to the same 40 gives in other words a cost of .8 over the full 40 years my wife and i are just retired and will have less in expenses for the rest of our lives than the average account cost for just 1 year   in your situation the knee jerk reaction is to tell you to maximize the 401(k deposit at the current 2016 $ 18,000 that might be appropriate but i 'd suggest you look at the expense of the s&p index sometime called large cap fund but see the prospectus and if it 's costing much more than i 'd go with an ira roth if you ca n't deduct the traditional ira much of the value of the 401(k beyond the match is the tax differential i.e. depositing while in the 25 bracket but withdrawing the funds at retirement hopefully at 15 it does n't take long for the extra expense and the holy cow my 401(k just turned decades of dividends and long term cap gains into ordinary income effect to take over understand this now not 30 years hence   last to answer your question how much i often recommend what may seem a cliche continue to live like a student half the country lives on $ 54 k or less there 's certainly a wide gray area but in general a person starting out will choose one of 2 paths living just at or even above his means or living way below and saving say 30 40 off the top even 30 does n't hit the extreme saver level if you do this you 'll find that if when you get married buy a house have kids etc you 'll still be able to save a reasonable percent of your income toward retirement   in response to your comment what counts as retirement savings there 's a concept used as part of the budgeting process known as the envelope system for those who have an income where there 's little discretionary money left over each month the method of putting money aside into small buckets is a great idea in your case say you take me up on the 30 40 challenge 15 of it goes to a hard and fast retirement account the rest to savings according to the general order of emergency fund 6 12 months expenses to cover a job loss another fund for random expenses such as new transmission i 've never needed one but i hear they are expensive and then the bucket towards house down payment keep in mind i have no idea where you live or what a reasonable house would cost regardless a 20 25 downpayment on even a $ 250 k house is $ that will take some time to save up if the housing in your area is more bump it accordingly   if the savings starts to grow beyond any short term needs it gets invested towards the long term and is treated as retirement money there is no such thing as saving too much when i turned 50 and was let go from a 30 year job i was n't unhappy that i saved too much and could call it quits that day had i been saving just right i 'd have been 10 years shy of my target

comparing index funds to long term investments in individual companies a counterintuitive study by jeremy siegel addressed a similar question would you be better off sticking with the original 500 stocks in the s&p 500 or like an index fund changing your investments as the index is changed the study long term returns on the original s&p 500 companies siegel found that the original 500 including spinoffs mergers etc would do slightly better than a changing index this is likely because the original 500 companies take on a value rather than growth aspect as the decades pass and value stocks outperform growth stocks index funds main strength may be in the behavior change they induce in some investors to the extent that investors genuinely set and forget their index fund investments they far outperform the average investor who mis times the market the average investor enters and leaves the market at the worst times underperforming by a few percentage points each year on average this buying high and selling low timing behavior damages long term returns paying active management fees e.g. 1 per year makes returns worse returns compound on themselves a great benefit to the investor fees also compound to the benefit of someone other than the investor paying 1 annually to a financial advisor may further dent long term returns but robert shiller notes that advisors can dissuade investors from market timing for clients who will always follow advice the 1 advisory fee is worth it

disclaimer i am not an attorney and i have not 100 researched the law take any advise from an online forum with a grain of salt please consult an attorney tax specialist or the irs directly for any concrete answers afaik there is n't anything that would prevent you from starting a business simply owing back taxes should n't make a difference on how you make money whether that is working for yourself or someone else all the irs is concerned about at this point is that you still owe them when going through the process of forming an llc a couple of years back i do n't recall any personal tax information being brought up except when we were discussing possible loan options regarding loan options one important issue you may come into is if the irs has filed a lien against you a federal tax lien is the government ’s legal claim against your property when you neglect or fail to pay a tax debt the lien protects the government ’s interest in all your property including real estate personal property and financial assets a lien will exist on your credit report for 7 years after it is released the irs releases your lien within 30 days after you have paid your tax debt with a lien it will be very difficult to get a loan or other financing for your small business if this ends up being the case you can try to get a discharge or subordination on specific property that would allow lenders a claim on your property ahead of the irs otherwise you may find yourself relying solely on what money you currently have a big point is the irs 's threshold on filing a lien is $ 10,000 the fresh start initiative increased the irs notice of federal tax lien filing threshold from $ 5,000 to $ 10,000 however notices of federal tax liens may still be filed on amounts less than $ 10,000 when circumstances warrant since you currently owe over the past 3 years it is possible that adding another year in back taxes will cause the irs to file a lien if they have not yet already done so so it may be something to keep an eye on if you do plan on taking out a loan for your business

i 'm guessing since i do n't know the term but it sounds like you 're asking about the technique whereby a loan is used to gather multiple years gift allowance into a single up front transfer for the subsequent n years the giver pays the installments on the loan for the recipient at a yearly amount small enough to avoid triggering gift tax you still have to pay income tax on the interest received even though you 're giving them the money to pay you and you must charge a certain minimum interest or more accurately if you charge less than that they tax you as if the loan was earning that minimum historically this was used by relatively wealthy folks since the cost of lawyers and filing the paperwork and bookkeeping was high enough that most folks never found out this workaround existed and few were moving enough money to make those costs worthwhile but between the great recession and the internet this has become much more widely known and there are services which will draw up standard paperwork have a lawyer sanity check it for your local laws file the official mortgage lien not actually needed unless you want the recipient to also be able to write off the interest on their taxes and provide a payments processing service if you do expect part or all of the loan to be paid by the recipient or whatever subset of those services you need   i 've done this in my case it cost me a bit under $ 1000 to set up the paperwork so i could loan a friend a sizable chunk of cash and have it clearly on record as a loan not a gift the amount in question was large enough and the interpersonal issues tricky enough that this was a good deal for us obviously run the numbers family loan   will find much more detail about how this works and what it can and ca n't do along with services specializing in these transactions note if you are actually selling something such as your share of a house this dance may or may not make sense again run the numbers and if in doubt get expert advice rather than trusting strangers on the web go not to the internet for legal advice for it shall say both mu and ni

the main factors you have to consider are could you get a better return on that money by investing it somewhere   the investment rate should basically be more than the mortgage rate if you find yourself suddenly in need of money eg loss of job do you have enough savings to ride that out   if not investing the extra money in an instant access investment even at a lower rate may make sense as it gives you future flexibility do you have any other debts that are at a higher rate   if so pay those off first as you will get more bang for your buck

i think there are two questions here a is it better to continue living with your parents while you save up for a bigger down payment on a house or to move out as soon as possible b is it better to pay off a student loan and make a smaller down payment on the house or to keep paying on the student loan and use the cash for a larger down payment on the house regarding a this is mostly a personal priorities question you do n't say if you 're paying your parents anything but even if you are it 's likely a lot less than the cost of your buying your own home it is almost certainly economically better to stay with your parents but do you like living with your parents and do they like having you around or are they pushing you to move out are you fighting with them regularly do you just like the idea of being more independent if you 'd prefer to have your own place how important is it to you is it worth the additional cost these are questions only you can answer regarding b you need to compare the cost of the student loan and the mortgage loan start with the interest rates of each for the mortgage loan if your down payment is below a certain threshold 20 last time i bought a house you have to pay for the lender 's mortgage insurance so add that in if applicable if you are paying points to get a reduced interest rate factor that in too then whichever is more expensive that 's the one that you want to make smaller if one or both are variable rate loans well you say the student loan is fixed than you have to guess what the rates might be in the future

1 what 's the point of paying a dividend if the stock price    automatically decreases do n't the shareholders just break even when the company earns cash beyond what is needed for expenses the value of the firm increases as a shareholder you own a piece of that increased value as soon as the company earns it when the dividend is paid the value of the firm decreases but you break even on the dividend transaction the benefit to you in holding the company 's shares is the continually increasing value whether paid out to you or retained be careful not to confuse the value of the firm with the stock price the stock price is ever changing in the short term driven mostly by investor emotion over the long term by far the largest effect on stock price is earnings take an extreme and simplistic example the company never grows or shrinks earnings are always the same there is no inflation and they pay everything out in dividends by the reasoning above the firm value never changes so over the long term the stock price will never change but you still get your quarterly dividends

short answer if you bought the car as opposed to leasing it there is no one to turn it in to   the reality of cars and car loans is this the value of a car tends to fall rapidly the first couple of years then more slowly after that like it might lose $ 2000 the first year $ 1000 the second $ 500 the third etc what you owe on a loan falls slowly at first because a lot of your payment is going to interest but then as time goes on you pay off the loan faster and faster so you may pay off $ 1000 the first year $ 1100 the second etc i 'm just making up numbers depends on the value of the car and the term and interest rate of the loan but that 's the general idea combining these two things means that in the first few years after you buy a car if you had a small or no down payment you might well owe more on the car than it is worth that 's just how the numbers work out if you keep the car long enough eventually you hit a point where it is worth more than you owe keep it until you 've paid off the loan and you owe $ 0 but the car is still worth something exactly how much depending on its condition and other factors if you just use the car and pay off the loan i.e. if you do n't sell the car or refinance the loan or some such then this does n't matter very much you make your loan payments and you have use of the car what difference does the book value of the car at any given moment matter to you if the idea of owing more than the car is worth bothers you in principle then in the future you could make a larger down payment or make extra payments on the loan the first couple of years to knock the principle down faster that 's about the only things you can do well you could buy with cash so you owe zero and the car is always worth more than you owe but given that you are where you are if you just keep the car and keep driving it and keep paying the loan then you are exactly where you thought you would be when you bought the car right i mean the day you bought the car you presumably were n't thinking that at some future date you could refinance at a lower rate how would you know so i think the easy answer is do n't sweat it just enjoy the car and pay your bills

were capital gains taxes not lower companies would have an incentive to minimize the portion of the value they create that as capital gains they would do this by using more debt financing since interest is deductible than equity financing this would have a destabilizing effect on the economy low capital gains taxes help encourage investment over spending this is believed to improve economic growth given these factors it is generally believed that the current capital gains tax rate is very close to the optimal rate that is a higher tax rate would not result in greater tax revenue bluntly a higher income tax rate on earned income does not really discourage people from working harder and earning more money but a higher rate on capital gains does discourage investment essentially it 's because investment is more discretionary

the gold standard did n't work because of the following process   start with 10 oz of gold deposit in bank a bank lends out 9 oz of gold certificates gold certificates deposited in bank b bank b lends out 8 oz of gold certificates etc   now at the end of all this we have a lot of gold certificates   this is called the money wiki effect   what if someone wants to take their gold certificates and buy a boat made in europe   well   if they spend 5 gold certificates on that boat then the certificates land in the european bank who requests gold to be shipped from america to pay for it     suddenly america 's bank reserves collapse and there is a very sharp credit contraction as all the banks stop lending because they are out of reserves that back their gold certificates   if the person had actual coins he was using to buy the boat only his consumption would be reduced and it would n't cause damage throughout the whole financial system   so basically wherever you have fractional reserve banking gold backed monetary systems will fail   anywhere you criticize fractional reserve banking your theory will be basically ignored because criticizing banking gets you nowhere in economics career wise   praising derivatives and all sorts of hair financial innovations will win you awards and prizes and guest appearances on cnbc though

in general no if you just have one employer and work there with the same salary for the whole year   typically an employer does tax withholding by your monthly income to the entire year and withholding the right amount so that at the end what is withheld is what you owe   it 's not a surprise to them when your income crosses a tax bracket threshold because they knew how much they were paying you and knew when you would cross into another bracket so they factored that in if you have multiple jobs or only worked for part of the year or if your income varied from month to month e.g. you got a raise there could be a discrepancy between what is withheld and what you owe because each employer only knows about what it 's paying you not what money you may have earned from other sources   even here though the discrepancy would n't be due to the tax brackets per se   you can adjust your withholdings on form w-4 if needed to tell the employer to withhold more or less than they otherwise would

in a perfect market share prices are by definition a perfect reflection of the true value of a share hence you always get $ 10 for a share that 's worth that much in reality the market is imperfect prices are somewhat of an average of all different estimates and there 's a cost of trading margin between sales and buy prices hence in a perfect market it does n't matter whether you have a stop loss order at $ 9.00 that just trades your stock worth $ 9 for cash worth the same $ 9 in an imperfect market that trade nets you less furthermore is risk a linear function of money perhaps not if you bought on margin need to lend extra and your interest rate increases with the extra credit demand

it 's not so much about time but about intent   if your intent is to move there permanently it would be when you arrive in the state for the purposes of living there i.e. not from a while before that when you went to check a place out or for an interview   i believe that most if not all states expect you to get a driver 's license from that state within of moving there something like a driver 's license or state id would be proof of your residency   these things vary greatly from state to state so you 'd have to research particular states   or find someone who 's done that already a bit of searching specifically for texas brought me to this forum thread if you he wish to establish residency here here being texas get a texas driver 's license and voter registration here government issued id with a texas address is pretty much bulletproof defense against being found to be a resident of elsewhere your battle if there is one will not be with texas but with your present home of record state and/or local government if there are income taxes associated with having been a resident there during the tax year which brings up the other question you would need to make sure that california does not have some provision that would cause you issues   this is n't so much a case of income from a company in the state as it about capital gains but it is still prudent to check

first of all it 's quite common place in gnucash and in accounting in general i believe to have accounts that represent concepts or ideas rather than actual accounts at some institution   for example my personal gnucash book has a plethora of expense accounts just made up by me to categorize my spending but all of the transactions are really just entries in my checking account as to your actual question i 'd probably do this by tracking such savings as negative expenses using an expense account and entering negative numbers   you could track grocery savings in your grocery expense account or if you want to easily analyze the savings data for example seeing savings over a certain time period you would probably want a separate grocery savings expense account edit regarding putting that money aside here 's an idea   let 's say you bought a $ 20 item that was on sale for $ 15   you could have a single transaction in gnucash that includes four splits one for each of the following actions decrease your checking account by $ 20 increase your expense account by $ 20 decrease your discount savings expense account by $ 5 and increase your savings account where you 're putting that money aside by $ 5

i 'm looking at this because i 'm just wondering what they base their criteria on   how are they splitting their operations to have multiple headquarters especially when both are in the same country it would make more sense if it was in another country although i 'm not sure how they manage their operations maybe they need a move like this etc is one more focused on global operations while the other is on local their hq is on the west coast so would they build a second hq that 's that close to their main base or move it to the east coast to spread it out i 'm just wondering why and what the reasoning is behind a move like this   the impact a move like this makes on the surrounding area is large considering the local economics and jobs etc which was outlined in the post   how will it effect traffic flows including if freight is involved now population concentration commutes etc there 's a lot of stuff to consider talent pools development of the area   i 'm not saying it should or should n't be but just because i have an idea of the surroundings my guess matching their criteria would be va its on the edge of the metro system connected to the major concentrated near engineering and computer science jobs etc off ways to the side to allow easier commutes instead of directly traffic into a city like dc and also near the airport    there are probably similar places all around if you look for it

i 'd put more money down and avoid financing i personally do n't think car debt is good debt and if you ca n't afford the car you are better off with a cheaper car also you should read up on the 0 offer before deciding to commit    here 's one article that is slightly dated but discusses some pros and cons of 0 financing my main point though is that 0 financing is not free and you need to consider the cost of that financing before making the purchase   aside from the normal loan costs of having a monthly payment possibly buying too much car by looking at monthly cost etc a 0 financing offer usually forces you to give the dealer financing company any rebates that are due to you in essence making the car cost more

no gnucash does n't specifically provide a partner cash basis report function however gnucash reports are fairly easy to write if the data was readily available in your accounts it should n't be too hard to create a cash basis report the account setup is so flexible you might actually be able to create accounts for each partner and using standard dual entry accounting always debit and credit these accounts so the actual cash basis of each partner is shown and updated with every transaction i used gnucash for many years to manage my personal finances and those of my business sole proprietorship it really for data integrity i never lost data customer management decent ui for managing multiple clients and business partners and customer invoice generation they look pretty i found the user interface ugly and cumbersome gnucash does n't integrate cleanly with banks in the us it 's possible to import data but the process is very clunky and error prone apparently you can make bank transactions right from gnucash if you live in europe another very important limitation of gnucash to be aware of only one user at a time period if this is important to you do n't use gnucash to really use gnucash effectively you probably have to be an actual accountant i studied dual entry accounting a bit while using gnucash dual entry accounting in gnucash is a pain in the butt accurately recording certain types of transactions like stock buys sells requires fiddling with complicated split transactions i agree with hire a pro

1 in most cases the difference between filing joint or married filing single is close to zero when there is a difference you 're better off filing joint   2 the way the w4 works is based on how many allowances you claim unfortunately even in the day of computers it does not allow for a simple well my deduction are $ xxx do n't tax that money each allowance is equal to one exemption same as you get for being you same as the wife gets same as each kid 3 people x $ 3800 = $ you are telling the employer to take off the top before calculating your tax she does this by using circular e and is able to calculate your tax as you request if one is in the 15 bracket one more exemption changes the tax withheld by $ 570 so if you were going to owe $ 400 in april one few exemption will have you overpay $ 170 i.e. in this 15 bracket each exemption changes annual withholding by that $ 570   for most people running the w4 numbers will get them very close and only if they are getting back or owing over $ 500 will they even think of adjusting   3 my recently published last minute tax moves offers a number of interesting ideas to address this the concept of grouping deductions in odd years is worth noting   4 i 'm not sure what this means 2 accounts each worth $ 5000 should grow at the same rate if invested the same the time it makes sense to load one person 's account first is if they have better matching you say you are not sure what percent your wife 's company matches you need to change this for both of your retirement plans you need to know every detail exact way to maximize matching expense ratios for the investments you choose any other fees etc knowledge is power and all that in what is an appropriate level of 401k fees or expenses in a typical plan i go on to preach about how fees can wipe out any tax benefit over time for any new investor my first warning is always to understand what you are getting into if you ca n't explain it to a friend you should n't be in it   edit you first need to understand what choices are within the accounts the 4 and 6 are in hindsight right these are not fixed returns you should look at the choices and more heavily fund the account with the better selection deposit to her account at least to grab the match   as far as the longer term goals see how the house purchase goes life has a way of sending you two kids and forcing you to tighten the budget you may have other ideas in three years i have no p2p lending experience by the way   last many advise that separate finances are a bad path for a couple it depends jane and i have separate check books and every paycheck just keep enough to write small checks without worry most of the money goes to the house account whatever works for you is what you should do we 've been happily married for most of the 17 years we 've been married

as far as the banker himself goes it 's a customer service issue   wf is not going to tell you about their internal discipline or ought n't anyway other than potentially to confirm that the banker does or does not still work there that 's the closest they should get to telling you about it   i 'm a very former retail manager and that 's absolutely the most i 'd ever do in a case like this and trust me even with good customer service reps you get requests to fire someone a lot sometimes valid sometimes not you did the correct thing from your end you brought the issue to their attention   despite the quota it 's hopefully not permitted to sign people up without their permission since that 's illegal and i can say that in my retail experience with these promotions with great incentive to cheat in this manner one of the main things our loss prevention department did was to monitor data to see if people were signing people up for cards or otherwise cheating the system   that could be a very bad thing from a customer service point of view and from a legal point of view what you should have done or possibly did but it 's not clear in your post is after you reported the issue asked for a re contact on a particular date in the future not after you 've looked into it but next friday i would like to get a call from you to discuss the resolution   again they 're not going to tell you the discipline but they should tell you at least that they 've investigated it and will make sure it does n't happen again or similar   it 's possible they will want more information from you at this point and this is a useful way to make sure that request does n't fall off of their plate   they should be able to at least tell you if there was a perceived issue on their end it might be something meaningless to you like he thought you said to sign up or something more descriptive like he pushed the button to send you a notice but our computer system screwed that up and made it an application   you never know these days how easy it is to screw these things up now they certainly should have fixed the issues on your end   hopefully they did whatever you needed them to do banking wise or else you withdrew your money and went somewhere else   if not follow up with that supervisor 's supervisor or go up a level or two to a regional director or equivalent   they may not be able to cancel the card for you but the other banking related things they certainly should fix   the card you probably just have to cancel and be done with as far as the misuse of personal information one thing i 'd consider doing is placing a freeze on your credit report   then this could never have happened you would have to lift it to have your report pulled to be given the card   this is not free though so consider this before doing this

the fundamental underlying difference between a bank and a ponzi scheme when a bank lends money and charges interest people can do things with that borrowed money which are worth it building factories starting businesses or just enjoying the comfort and warmth of a single family home instead of paying rent this is why fractional reserve banking is able to work people may also do things which do not necessarily turn a financial profit financing large purchases on a credit card but are worth it in terms of an expenditure they may also do stupid things financing useless purchases on a credit card and wasting their money or otherwise dispose of the money poorly the new business fails the home 's value plummets etc a ponzi scheme never really bothered to do useful things with the money social security has been mentioned part of social security 's setup involves the current population of workers paying the current population of retirees their own retirements will have to be financed by the next generation this design is not intrinsically a ponzi scheme both the population and the economy ought to remain growing for the intermediate future so there will be at least as much money and probably much more for them to pay those bills unlike a ponzi scheme the idea that it will continue to attract new money to pay out existing claims is a realistic one the real questions of its sustainability are a matter of specifics is it collecting enough money to remain functional in the future or is it outpacing the growth of the economy and the population

assuming usa it is possible to make the interest deductible if you go to the trouble of structuring and filing the loan as an actual mortgage on a primary residence intra family loan will find several firms which specialize in this it costs about $ 700 for all the paperwork and filing fees as of last time i checked so unless you 're going to pay at least three times that in interest over the life of the loan it probably is n't worth considering for an additional fee they 'll take care of the payment processing   if you 'd really rather be hands off about it i have no idea whether the paperwork fees and processing fees can be deducted from the interest as a cost of producing that income in theory that ought to be true but i am not a lawyer or accountant note one of the interesting factors here is that the irs sets a minimum interest rate on intra family loans it 's pretty low around 0.3 so in most cases you can say you gifted the difference if you 'd prefer to charge less but that does set a floor on what the irs will expect the lender to declare and pay taxes on there 's a lot more that can be said about this but since i am not an expert i 'll refer you to those who are i have no affiliation with any of this except as a customer once it seemed pretty painless but i ca n't claim to know whether they were really handling everything exactly correctly the website seemed to do a pretty good job of explaining what choices had to be made and their effects as well as discussing how these can be used to avoid excess gift taxes by spreading the gift over a number of years

that be that you have been sold the notion that antitrust laws are a failed and discredited policy by those intent on protecting private cartels republicans   republicans commonly use free market economic truths when it suits their agendas so i can see how you might be sensitive to that possibility but no    it be that the enforcement arm of the government like the sec have been weakened and captured by lobbyists in a revolving door between the private sector and the the government facilitated by democrats too   yes by design by those who make careers of screwing the rest of us through designing arguments that set us against one another    gt in capitalism unchecked greed leads to the destructive behavior of endless accumulation of resources at the expense of others   no greed is never unchecked in the free market excess profits ultimately prevent it unless the government enables it of course monopolies are a government creation they are the of violence after all so i suppose it comes naturally    gt how does this environment protect the small business or how does it benefit consumers   more competition and smaller firms that result from said competition as well as best utilization of resources is best for consumers and society as a whole it 's dynamic that 's important much more responsive to new factors than government could ever hope to be politicians are really bad at adapting to voter preferences in a timely fashion apparently

here 's another answer on the topic saving for retirement how much is enough an angle on it this question made me think of a good approach here is to focus on savings rate which you can control rather than the final number which you ca n't plus it will fluctuate with the markets and make you nervous for example focus on saving at least 10 of your income annually 15 is much safer   if you focus on the final number the way it works in the real world is that you save as much as you can but there are lots of random factors and unknowns some people end up having to work a lot longer than they hoped to others end up able to retire early others retire on time but have to spend less than they hoped but the one thing you can often control as long as you have an income and no catastrophes anyway is that you spend less than you make

i would suggest having your money auto deposited into a savings account then use cash weekly to pay for everything you purchase forget the atm card because you can burn through your whole paycheck and then run out set a certain budget say $ 200 per week just making up a number and that 's all you get withdraw $ 200 from the bank atm and then walk away no buying online because it is n't restricted no buying on a card all expenses beyond utilities comes out of that cash when you want to spend more you need to wait until your next cash paycheck if you want to spend more on whatever you end up splurging on you will need to cut back in other areas cheaper food etc as others have mentioned freeze that atm card and do n't use it at all

you ca n't really avoid inflation as the population grows the amount of money needed will grow as well because the people will grow up and go to work and earn money and someone has to create it to pay them one of the definitions of inflation is increasing amount of money increasing amount of money causes devaluation for example if instead of 1000 dollars we now have 2000 dollars in circulation because the population tripled in the last 50 years while in russia the population remained the same and they have the same 1000 rubles as they had 50 years ago 1 ruble will no longer cost 1 dollar but rather 2 i.e. prices rise this is very simplified of course and there are a lot of causes and triggers for inflation inflation when controlled and within certain limits is necessary for growth as mentioned but when uncontrolled and very high it causes a lot of damage and that 's what troubles people about inflation not its mere existence as to bringing the prices the prices do n't go down the   gallon of gas will not go back to $ 0.25 it 's just the buying power of the money goes down because of inflation you could buy a gallon of gas for 0.25 50 years ago but you had to work for 1/2 hour to earn these 0.25 now you have to pay $ 4 but if you still need to work for 1/2 hour for that then the price did n't rise effectively

your original example is a little confusing because just shorting for 1k and buying for 1k is 100 leveraged or an leverage ratio and not allowed brokerage houses would require you to invest some capital in the trade   one example might be requiring you to hold $ 100 in the brokerage   this is where the 10:1 ratio comes from thus a return of 4.5 on the bond and no movement on the short position would net you $ 45 and voila a 45 return on your $ 100 investment a 40 to 1 leverage ratio would mean that you would only have to invest $ 25 to make this trade   something that no individual investor are allowed to do but for some reason some financial firms have been able to

for a time period as short as a matter of months commercial paper or bonds about to mature are the highest returning investments as defined by benjamin graham   an investment operation is one which upon thorough analysis promises safety of principal and a satisfactory return operations not meeting these requirements are speculative there are no well known methods that can be applied to cryptocurrencies or forex for such short time periods to promise safety of principal the problem is that with $ 1,500 it will be impossible to buy any worthy credit directly and hold to maturity besides the need for liquidity eats up the return risk adjusted   the only alternative is a bond etf which has a high probability of getting crushed as interest rates continue to rise so that fails the above criteria the only alternative for investment now is a short term deposit with a bank for speculation anything goes the best strategy is to take the money and continue to build up a financial structure saving for risk adjusted and time discounted future annual cash flows   after the average unemployment cycle is funded approximately six or so years then long term investments should be accumulated internationally diversified equities

no you probably do not need to file a tax return if you received no income and if you meet a number of other criteria the below is copied and pasted slightly edited from the cra you must file a return for 2014 if any of the following situations    apply you have to pay tax for 2014 we sent you a request to file a return you and your spouse or common law partner elected to split pension    income for 2014 see lines 115 116 129 and 210 you received working income tax benefit advance payments in    2014 you disposed of capital property in 2014 for example if you sold    real estate or shares or you realized a taxable capital gain for    example if a mutual fund or trust attributed amounts to you or you    are reporting a capital gains reserve you claimed on your 2013    return you have to repay any of your old age security or employment insurance    benefits see line 235 you have not repaid all amounts withdrawn from your registered    retirement savings plan rrsp under the home plan or the    lifelong learning plan for more information go to home buyers plan    hbp or see guide lifelong learning plan llp or you have to    contribute to the canada pension plan cpp this can apply if for    2014 the total of your net self employment income and    employment income is more than $ 3,500 see line you are paying employment insurance premiums on self employment and    other eligible earnings see lines and 430 in general you will want to file a tax return even if none of the above applies you could for example claim a gst hst credit even with no income now if you receive any income at all you are going to have to pay taxes which means you are obligated to file a tax return if sufficient taxes were deducted from your paycheque you are still obligated to file a tax return however you will not have to pay penalties if you file late even if you file very late at least not until the cra sends you a request to file but be aware you wo n't likely be able to tell if you owe the cra money until you do your taxes and if you do end up owing there are substantial penalties for filing late in general i 'd strongly advise filing your tax return in almost all circumstances

it may have been the standard practice for a long time and indeed it still is the common practice for my credit union to apply all excess payment directly to the principal at the risk of sounding a little cynical i will suggest that there is a profit motive in the move to not applying excess payments to principal unless directly instructed to do so interest accrued is n't reduced until the principal is reduced so it benefits the creditor to both have the money in advance and to not apply it to the principal you should probably move forward with the expectation that all of your creditors are even if only in a passive aggressive manner

recently there has been an increase in companies charging a credit card surcharge the current law does not fix the amount so therefore company 's can set there own surcharges which means you can pay different surcharges at different places in the money magazine a couple of months ago there was an interesting article that discussed a possible cap that was going to be introduced to cut down on the fluctuations of credit card surcharges as some places are generating revenue by abusing the credit card surcharge something to keep in mind is to ensure when using a debit card you are not charged the surcharge some businesses will treat the debit card the same as a credit card

for starters like some other people have said just talk to someone in ib and get some advice on how to break in and what it 's really like i 've spoken to people in ib and learned that it 's really just not going to be for me in response to your four questions   1   get your degree at depaul and wait a few years to get your masters you do n't need an mba for ib and it 'll be a lot harder to go to a prestigious grad school without significant work experience and a solid network   1 it definitely would n't hurt for you to double major in cs but if you do you 're going to have to keep your grades up and still stay sharp in both majors you do n't want to have a 3.0 and have both it 'll kill your chances you 're going to need at least a 3.8 if you 're under that it 's gon na be a lot harder to get anywhere    1 if there are other industries you want to turn to then sure i used to be interested in ib but now i 'm leaning more towards private equity and working with reg d. clients 1031 exchanges etc    1 network if you are n't already seriously get out there and network like hell but do n't just cold call random people you really need to make meaningful connections with people and continue to stay in contact with them you can also learn a lot from wso and various ib books guides etc i have a bunch of that stuff on my google drive from a friend if you want it    and some general   do n't stress about the school you go going to a prestigious school really does help but if you work hard enough make the right connections and are good at what you do you can land a role in ib i know several people that have gone into ib from my school and i would consider us maybe a grade c state school it 's possible   i 'd also recommend looking more at a boutique and middle mark companies rather than your bulge bracket banks it 'll have less competition and could be easier to break into and like some other people are said you really need to get that junior year internship if you want to make it into ib but if you ca n't get into ib right after school do n't fret go somewhere get some experience get your certifications series 7 series 63 etc and try again   know your technicals you need to be able to walk through a dcf an lbo and all of the financial statements in an interview there are billions of guides on how to do this but you need to know this   stay on top of current events just be well versed in how the market is doing which industries are hot right now and what 's not and why   know your story believe it or not but your story and how that aligns with a companies culture is really important i have a friend that did n't make it into a certain firm solely because they just did n't think he was a good enough fit for their culture i want to make a lot of money wo n't work instead think more along the lines of i want to challenge myself   good luck man

a tax return is a document you sign and file with the government to self report your tax obligations a tax refund is the payment you receive from the government if your payments into the tax system exceeded your obligations   as others have mentioned if an extra $ 2 k in income generated $ 5 k in taxes chances are your return was prepared incorrectly the selection of an appropriate entity type for your business depends a lot on what you expect to see over the next several years in terms of income and expenses and the extent to which you want or need to pay for fringe benefits or make pretax retirement contributions from your business income there are four basic flavors of entity which are available to you sole proprietorship this is the simplest option in terms of tax reporting and paperwork required for ongoing operations your net gross minus expenses income is added to your wage income and you 'll pay tax on the total if your wage income is less than approximately $ 100 k you 'll also owe self employment tax of approximately 15 in addition to income tax on your business income if your business runs at a loss you can deduct the loss from your other income in calculating your taxable income though you wo n't be able to run at a loss indefinitely you are liable for all of the debts and obligations of the business to the extent of all of your personal assets partnership you will need at least two participants humans or entities to form a partnership individual items of income and expense are identified on a partnership tax return and each partner 's proportionate share is then reported on the individual partners tax returns general partners who actively participate in the business also must pay self employment tax on their earnings below approximately $ 100k. each general partner is responsible for all of the debts and obligations of the business to the extent of their personal assets a general partnership can be created informally or with an oral agreement although that 's not a good idea corporation business entities can be taxed as s or c corporations either way the corporation is created by filing articles of incorporation with a state government does n't have to be the state where you live and corporations are typically required to file yearly entity statements with the state where they were formed as well as all states where they do business shareholders are only liable for the debts and obligations of the corporation to the extent of their investment in the corporation an s corporation files an information only return similar to a partnership which reports items of income and expense but those items are actually taken into account on the individual tax returns of the shareholders if an s corporation runs at a loss the losses are deductible against the shareholders other income   a c corporation files a tax return more similar to an individual 's a c corporation calculates and pays its own tax at the corporate level payments from the c corporation to individuals are typically taxable as wages from a tax point of view it 's the same as having a second job or as dividends depending on how and why the payments are made if they 're in exchange for effort and work they 're probably wages if they 're payments of business profits to the business owners they 're probably dividends if a c corporation runs at a loss the loss is not deductible against the shareholders other income   fringe benefits such as health insurance for business owners are not deductible as business expenses on the business returns for s corps partnerships or sole proprietorships c corporations can deduct expenses for providing fringe benefits   llcs do n't have a predefined tax treatment the members or managers of the llc choose when the llc is formed if they would like to be taxed as a partnership an s corporation or as a c corporation if an llc is owned by a single person it can be considered a disregarded entity and treated for tax purposes as a sole proprietorship this option is not available if the llc has multiple owners   the asset protection provided by the use of an entity depends quite a bit on the source of the claim if a creditor plaintiff has a claim based on a contract signed on behalf of the entity then they likely will not be able to pierce the veil and collect the entity 's debts from the individual owners on the other hand if a creditor plaintiff has a claim based on negligence or another tort like action such as sexual harassment then it 's very likely that the involved will also be sued as individuals which takes away a lot of the effectiveness of the purported asset protection the entity based asset protection is also often unavailable even for contract claims because sophisticated creditors like banks and landlords will often insist the the business owners sign a personal guarantee putting their own assets at risk in the event that the business fails to honor its obligations   there 's no particular type of entity which will allow you to entirely avoid tax most tax planning revolves around income and expense items in the most favorable ways possible or around controlling the timing of the appearance of those items on the tax return

what sort of amount are we talking about here and what countries are you travelling to   as long as it 's not cash most countries will neither know or care how much money is in your bank account or on your credit card limit and ca n't even check if they wanted to even if they can there are very few countries where they would check without already you of a crime i think you 're worrying over nothing even if it 's cash most countries have no border control anyway and those who do uk ireland allow up to £ 10,000 or so cash without even having to declare it just open a second bank account and do n't take the card or cut the card up use online banking to transfer money in smaller chunks to your main account alternately or additionally take a credit card or two with a smaller limit enough to make sure you 're comfortably able to deal with one month plus emergency money then set up your regular bank account to pay this credit card off in full every month if i was really concerned i 'd open a second bank account and add a sensible amount of money to it enough to cover costs of my stay and avoid questions about whether i can afford my stay but not so much it would raise question then i 'd open two credit cards with a limit of perhaps $ 1000 2000 one covers the costs of living wherever i 'm going the other is for emergencies or if i and go over my amount per month set up your bank to pay these off each month and you 're sorted honestly i think you 're worrying over nothing people travel inside europe every day with millions in the bank and raise no questions you 're legally allowed to have money

that is mostly true in most situations when there are more buy orders than sell orders higher buy volume orders than sell volume orders the price will generally move upwards and vice versa when there are more sell orders than buy orders higher sell volume orders than buy volume orders the price will generally move downwards note that this does not always happen but usually it does you are also correct that for a trade to take place a buyer has to be matched with a seller or the buy volume matched with the sell volume but not all orders get executed as trades say there are 50 buy orders in the order book with a total volume of 100,000 shares and the highest buy order is currently at $ 10.00 on the other side there are only 10 sell orders in the order book with total volume of 10,000 shares and the lowest sell order is currently $ at the moment there wo n't be a trade unless a new buyer or seller enters the market to match the opposing side or an existing order gets amended upper or lower to match the opposing side with more demand than supply in the order books what will be the most likely direction that this stock moves in most likely the price will move upwards if a new buyer sees the price moving higher and then looks at the market depth they would most likely place an order closer to the lowest sell order than the current highest buy order say $ 10.01 to be first in line in case a market sell order is placed on the market as new buy orders enter the market it drives the price higher and higher until the buy orders dry up

can you wait until you retire before needing the money will you buy your first house sometime in the future if yes then favour an rrsp remember that you are rewarded by paying less tax for having the foresight and commitment to defer income taxes until your retirement when you are presumably earning less income are your household expenses higher than 28 of your gross income 35 of your net income does making your mortgage payments stress you are interest rates lower than their historical norm and an increase would cause you difficulty if yes then favour your mortgage do you need this money before your retire does your tfsa earn more interest than your mortgage costs your if yes then favour a tfsa does an alternative investment earn more than your tfsa can you handle an uptick in your mortgage interest rate if yes then favour the alternative investment and not your rrsp mortgage or tfsa

airmoney seems to deliver money either through the service or the royal mail you are given a tracking number for either so the transfer of money is nothing to worry about you can contact if you find that they never send a package or they give you a false tracking number in regards to claiming compensation if you do get shafted airmoney is owned by limited who are registered with the fca you can complain here finally in airmoney 's t&c 's section they state that if there is a shortage in any package the client must notify airmoney within 48 hours after receipt of the package in the event that the client notifies airmoney of a shortage in accordance with clause airmoney may review its footage of the package being packaged for delivery you can contact then via the details noted in section if you would like my opinion of a good travel money option revolut saves you a lot of time you can load money in your home currency and withdraw in a number of currencies money is exchanged at interbank rates alternatively a number of other prepaid choices exist for uk customers fairfx ice moneycorp travelex even and aa they all offer differing transaction fees withdrawal fees etc you can find out information about them by searching compare multi currency prepaid cards and following the link from hope this helps

emergency funds are good to keep yourself out of debt for whatever reason job loss is a big place where an emergency fund can help you out   it buys you time to find another job before hauling out the credit cards for your groceries falling behind on your mortgage and car payments etc but it can just as easily be used for major car repairs serious medical issues home repairs etc anything that needs to be done quickly and is n't a discretionary item the bigger your cash reserves the better especially now that the economy is bad

i think it 's great that you want to contribute course instructor you may want to take a look at becoming an instructor for a course like dave ramsey 's financial peace university these are commonly offered through churches and other community venues for a fee this may be a good fit if you want to focus on basic financial literacy setting up and sticking to a budget and getting their financial house in order it may not be a good fit if you do n't want to teach an existing curriculum or if you find the tenets of the course too unpalatable a significant number of the people in dave 's audience are close to or in the middle of a financial meltdown and so his advice includes controversial ideas such as avoiding credit altogether often because that 's how they got into their current mess counselor if you want to run your own show i know of several people who have built their own practice that is run along the lines of a counselor charging hourly rates and they work with couples who are having money problems building a reputation and a network of referring counselors and professionals is key here and definitely seems like it would require a full time commitment i would avoid credit counseling and the like most of these organizations are focused on restructuring credit card debt not spending time on behavioral change you do n't need a series 7 63 65 etc or even a cfa i 've previously acquired a number of these and can confirm that they are investment credentials that are intended to help you get a job and/or get more business as a broker or conventional financial planner i.e. salesperson of securities the process is necessary to protect consumers from advice that serves the investment sales force but is bad for the consumer and because you must be licensed to provide investment advice there is a class of fee only financial planners but they primarily deal with complex issues that allow them to make money and often give away basic personal finance advice for free in the form of articles podcasts etc   charity for part time or free work in my area there are also several charity organizations that help people do their taxes and provide basic budgeting and personal finance instruction but this is very localized and may vary quite a bit depending on where you live however if there are none near you you can always start one journalism if you have an interest in writing there are also people who work as journalists and write columns books or newsletters and it is much easier now to publish and build a network online either on your own through a blog or contributing to a website speaker at community events there are also many opportunities to speak to a specific community such as a church or social organization for example where i live there are local organizations for spanish speaking polish speaking elderly young professional young mother and retiree groups for example all of who might be interested in your advice on issues that specifically address their needs good luck

@littleadv has said most of what i 'd say if they had not gotten here first i 'd add this much it 's important to understand what debt collectors can and can not do because a lot of them will use intimidation and any other technique you can think of to get away with as much as you will let them i 'd start with this pdf file from the ftc and then start googling for info on your state 's regulations also it would be a very very good idea to review the documents you signed or get a copy when you took out the loan to see what sort of additional penalties etc you may have already agreed to in the event you default   the fee 's the collector is adding in could be of their own creation making them highly negotiable or it might be something you already agreed to in you little recourse but to pay them do keep in mind that in many cases debt collectors are at the very least to charge you simple interest of around 10   on a debt of your size paid off over several years that might amount to more than the $ 4 k they are adding   otoh you can pretty much expect them to try both tacking on fees and then trying to add interest if the fees are not paid    another source of assistance may be the department of education ombudsman if you need help with a defaulted student loan contact the department of education 's ombudsman at or visit its website at but first you must take steps to resolve your loan problem on your own there is a checklist of required steps on the website or the ombudsman will not assist you

i know some derivative markets work like this so maybe similar with futures   a futures contract commits two parties to a buy sell of the underlying securities but with a futures contract you also create leverage because generally the margin you post on your futures contract is not sufficient to pay for the collateral in the underlying contract the person buying the future is essentially borrowing money while the person selling the future is essentially lending money the future you enter into is generally a short term contract so a perfectly hedged lender of funds should expect to receive something that approaches the fed funds rate in the us today that would be essentially nothing

generally speaking if the acquiring company buys less than 50 of the target the acquirer would not claim any income until there was a dividend or the equity stock appreciated with a dividend the company would participate in and book earnings on the cash received without a dividend equity stock of the target should theoretically rise to reflect higher retained income and the acquirer would book an unrealized gain to gross profit i think if the acquiring company buys more than 50 of the target it is likely all revenues and would be consolidated and included in the acquiring company 's respective accounts as if it was one whole any residual stake in the target owned by a third party would be reflected in a minority interest expense on the acquiring company 's income statement

the catch is that you 're doing a form of leveraged investing in other words you 're gambling on the stock market using money that you 've borrowed while it 's not as dangerous as say getting money from a loan shark to play blackjack in vegas there is always the chance that markets can collapse and your investment 's value will drop rapidly the amount of risk really depends on what specific investments you choose and how diversified they are if you buy only canadian stocks then you 're at risk of losing a lot if something happened to our economy but if your canadian equities only amount to 3.6 of your total which is canada 's share of the world market and you 're holding stocks in many different countries then the diversification will reduce your overall risk   the reason i mention that is because many people using the smith maneuver are only buying canadian high yield dividend stocks so that they can use the dividends to accelerate the smith maneuver process use the dividends to pay down the mortgage then borrow more and invest it they prefer canadian equities because of preferential tax treatment of the dividend income in non registered accounts but if something happened to those canadian companies they stand to lose much of the investment value and suddenly they have the extra debt the amount borrowed from a heloc or from a re mortgage without enough value in the investments to offset it this could mean that they will not be able to pay off the mortgage by the time they retire

equity is the term to make things balance in a simple transaction you get $ 100 paid to you income goes up by $ 100 and the asset of whatever bank account or petty cash drawer you put it into also goes up by $ 100 equity is unchanged if for some reason you had to take some income into your books but no asset increased no debt decreased and you had no way to take an offsetting expense into your books then this would lower your equity how else to explain having earned $ 100 but having nothing to show for it

assuming you are talking about an llc in the united states there are no tax repercussions on the llc itself because llcs use pass through taxation in the u.s. meaning that the llc does not pay taxes whatever you take out of the llc in the form of distributions goes onto your personal income tax as ordinary income and you pay personal income tax on it   see this link on the subject from the web site tax treatment of an llc from the web site repayment of your loan by the llc would just be another business expense for the business itself   i guess the question would then turn on what your personal tax would be for payments received from the llc on the loan   i would guess and i emphasize guess that you would pay tax on any interest gain from the loan payments which makes the assumption you made the loan to include interest   if not in other words if you made this an interest free loan then it would be considered a wash for tax purposes and you would have no tax liability for yourself to reiterate the llc if it is a u.s entity does not pay taxes   taxation of llc income is based on whatever distributions the principals take out of it which is then claimed as taxable personal income my apologies to littleadv for not making my prior answer i deleted it more clear about my answer assuming you were speaking of a u.s chartered llc i hope this helps good luck

now to buy in full and essentially have zero savings buy in part £ 10000 deposit followed by a loan of £ 4000 or hp more of the value so you are assessing if the car is worth having with either none or only 4,000 in savings this is the most critical information you have provided    my outright opinion is to always buy a mildly used car as i hate the idea of loans and interest with the amount of money that you currently possess i believe the buy in part option is best as it reduces your interest liability but i do n't believe you should do it currently 4,000 is a rather small cash fund for if something were to go boom in the night    as for your question of interest this is completely dependent on the amount you are able to pay per period and the total interest you are willing to spend rows four and seven respectively this is your money and no one can tell you what 's best to do with it than yourself keep looking for good leasing deals or if you think you can survive financial strife with 4,000 then follow your heart depreciation fluctuates to the buyer so never assume what the car may lose in the next 2 3 years hope it all goes well my friend

you can take out the contributions to your roth tax and penalty free   that 's the good thing anything above the amount you contributed that you withdraw early will cost you ordinary income tax which is higher than capital gains tax plus a 10 percent penalty on that amount so if you have $ 15,000 in the account and $ 5,000 is gains and you withdraw $ 11,000 then you owe tax and penalty on $ 1,000   the penalty is 10 and your taxes high taxes are added to that   pretty bad deal if you kept it in a normal account and paid capital gains tax you just pay 15 or whatever on your gains and you get to offset income tax with your losses via tax loss harvesting so back to your question your idea works even better than you suggested if you only withdraw up to the amount that you contributed you pay no tax   take out any of the gains and you will be penalized more than you would if you just paid capital gains on them   leave those in until you are old enough to take them out penalty and tax free to me contributing to a roth making a bunch of gains on it and withdrawing only the contribution part whenever you want seems to make good sense

you have not specified what country you are in that radically changes everything in case you are in canada there 's a great blog that covers bankruptcy and student loans at loan fundamentally in order to discharge government backed student loans you must have ceased to be a student for at least seven years prior to filing even then though the government can object in which case you will still have to repay some or all of the loan more generally given that the collection agency appears to be operating in bad faith you 'll want to ensure that they send you written documentation of any offer they are extending you if they refuse to do this you should assume that they are n't actually offering you anything at all and you will have to pay back the full amount plus interest and penalties note that in many countries if you settle the debt that is pay anything less than the full amount plus interest and penalties this will be a black mark on your credit report in this case if you repaid the full $ 16,000 and they the extra $ 4,000 they would most likely still add a note to your credit report indicating that you did not pay the full amount that you owed and this will negatively impact your credit rating even beyond your late payments

what it means is that you can always come up with alternative where the difference between two options is stated as a gain or a loss but the effect is the same in either case   for instance if i offer to sell a t shirt for $ 10 and offer a cash discount of $ 1 you pay $ 10 if buying with a credit card or $ 9 if buying with cash   if i instead offer the shirt for $ 9 with a $ 1 surcharge for credit card use you still pay $ 10 if buying with a credit card or $ 9 if buying with cash   the financial result is the same in either case but psychologically people may perceive them differently and make different buying decisions in a tax situation it may be more complicated since exemptions would n't directly reduce your tax but only your taxable income   however you can still see that in general having to pay $ x more in tax for not doing some action e.g. not purchasing health insurance is the same as being able to pay $ x less in tax as a reward for doing the action   either way doing the action results in you paying $ x less than you would if you did n't do it the only difference is in which behavior doing it or not doing it is framed as the default option   again these may influence people 's behavior even when the net result is the same

the optimal way to pay off all cards in the least amount of time is a approach with the most money going to the account with the highest interest rate or in the event of a tie the lowest balance then when that account is paid off go to the next one there 's a bit of wiggle room if one is tax deductible but in this case there should n't be so what you should do is pay off card 2 then 1 then 3 using the scheme you have correctly identified that card 2 will be paid off in 18 months figure out what the balance will be on card 1 at that time and how long the new payment of $ will take to get it paid off then figure out how long it 'll take to pay off card 3 with $ without crunching the numbers myself i 'm guessing you 'll be debt free in about 26 months or so that card 3 will be paid off before you are done with card 1 so what you 'd do in that case is pay off card 1 using the combined total payment

a paper ee series us savings bond is what is called a zero coupon bond you buy it at a discount from the face value 50 discount for us savings bonds and it earns interest though you do n't get the interest as cash that you could invest elsewhere instead the interest earned increases the   redemption value of the bond the money that you will receive if you take the bond to your bank to cash it in before the maturity date when the bond finally matures its redemption value has increased to the full face value   the maturity date for paper ee series us savings bonds issued in may 1995 is 17 years now with zero coupon bonds in general the irs requires that the interest earned each year be reported as interest income even though you did not receive any cash income and tax is due on the interest unless it is a tax free municipal bond or the bond is held in a tax deferred investment such as an ira or 401(k plan however there is a special exemption for ee series us savings bonds in that the owner has the option of not declaring the interest each year but instead reporting all the accumulated interest as interest income in the year of redemption most people choose this option it is not capital gains as you would like to be    so if your grandfather paid $ for ee series us savings bonds in may 1995 the face value of the bonds he received was $ 22 k and assuming that your grandfather followed typical practice the bonds were worth $ 22 k in may 2012 and $ 11 k interest income needed to be declared that year   this matches up pretty well with the amount the irs told him was interest income on which he had to pay income tax though the year is off by 3   now your grandfather died in 2008 and what happened to the bonds depends on in whose the bonds were registered e.g. was your father named as the survivor on the bond or if your grandfather was the sole owner how your grandfather 's estate was handled the interest accrued till your grandfather died belonged to the estate note also that ee series bonds continue to earn interest in years 18 through 30 after they mature but at maturity the interest rate is reset by the treasury usually to the long term interest rate which has been very small over the past many years so the interest earned in 2012 2015 when your father effectively redeemed the bond is small enough that the approximately $ 11 k could be construed as covering $ k consisting of $ 11 k of interest before maturity and $ 300 interest at about 1 per annum over the three year post maturity period the $ 100 interest earned by you for the current year sounds about right too all in all it might be the case that your grandfather bought the bonds in his name your father 's name and your name were you very young in 1995 your father and you inherited the bonds in 2008 and then your father removed your grandfather 's name from the bonds in 2015 thus transferring the bonds to his name and yours in 2015 and soon thereafter removed his name transferring the bonds into your name alone as to why 2015 and not 2008 when your grandfather passed away did you turn 21 in 2015 twenty years after the bonds were bought

i do n't see how anyone could give you a hard and fast formula unless they know where to get some applicable statistics because several factors here are not a straight calculation if you do n't replace the tires but keeping driving the car what is the increased probability that you will get into an accident because of the bald tires how much will bald tires vs new tires affect the selling price of the car presumably the longer you drive the car after getting new tires the less increase this will give to the market value of the car what 's the formula for that if you keep the car what 's the probability that it will have other maintenance problems etc that said it 's almost always cheaper to keep your current car than to buy a new one even if you have maintenance problems it would have to be a huge problem to cost more than buying a new car suppose you buy a $ 25,000 car with what 's a typical new car loan these days maybe 5 years at 5 so your payments would be about $ per month if you compare spending $ 1000 for new tires versus paying $ per month on a new car loan the tires are cheaper within 3 months the principle is the same if you buy with cash to justify buying a new car you have to factor in the value of the pleasure you get from a new car the peace of mind from having something more reliable etc mostly intangibles

1 how long have you had the car   generally accounts that last more than a year are kept on your credit report for 7 years while accounts that last less than a year are only kept about 2 years iirc could someone correct me if that last number is wrong 2 who is the financing through   if it 's through a used car dealer there 's a good chance they 're not even reporting it to the credit bureaus i had this happen to me the dealer promised he 'd report the loan so it would help my credit i made my payments on time every time and nothing ever showed up   it pissed me off because another positive account on my credit report would have really helped my score   banks and brand name dealers are more likely to report the loan 3 what are your expected long term gains on the stocks you 're considering selling and will you have to pay capital gains on them when you do sell them   the cost of selling those stocks could possibly be higher than the gain from paying off the car so you 'll want to run the numbers for a couple different scenarios optimistic growth pessimistic etc and see if you come out ahead or not 4 are there prepayment penalties or costs associated with paying off the car loan early   most reputable financiers wo n't include such terms or they 'll only be in effect during the first few months of the loan but again it depends on who the loan is through in short it depends   i know people hate hearing answers like that but it 's true   hopefully though you 'll be able to sit down and look at the specifics of your situation and make an informed decision

when a stock is going to become public there 's a level of analysis required to figure out the range of ipo price that makes sense for a company that 's somewhat mature and has a sector to compare it to you can come up with a range that would be pretty close for the recent linkedin it 's tougher to price a somewhat unique company running at a loss in a market rich with cash looking for the next great deal if one gives this any thought an opening price that 's so far above the ipo price represents a failure of the underwriters to price it correctly it means the original owners just sold for far less than the market thought they were worth on day one the day of ipo the stock opens similar to how any stock would open at 9:30 there are bids and asks and a price at which supply the ask and demand bid balance for this ipo it would appear that there were enough buyers to push the price to twice the anticipated open and it 's maintained that level since   it 's possible to have a different system in which a dutch auction is used to make the shares public in theory this can work it 's just not used commonly

but how does the quantity matching happen for example if i want to buy 1000 shares at $ 100 but there is only one seller to sell 10 shares at $ 100 what happens then this depends on the type of order you 've placed if you placed a fill or kill order your order to buy or sell a certain number of shares is routed to the trading floor for immediate execution if the order can not be immediately filled it is cancelled killed automatically note that the order must be filled in its entirety partial fills are not allowed in your example your buy order would n't be filled because it could n't be matched to a sell order of the same volume this is similar to an all or none order which is an order that contains   a condition instructing the broker to fill the order completely or not at all if there is insufficient supply to meet the quantity requested by the order then it is canceled at the close of the market in this case if your order was n't matched to an order of the same volume by the time the market closes it 's cancelled if you simply placed a market limit order and in the case of the limit order part of your order was matched to another order with the right price that part of your order will be filled while the rest will remained unfilled

a long straddle using equity would be more akin to buying a triple leveraged etf and an inverse triple leveraged etf only because one side will approach zero while the other can theoretically increase to infinity in a short time span before time decay hits in the reason your analogy fails is because the delta is 1.0 on both sides of your trade at the money options a necessary requirement for a straddle have a delta of .5 there is an options strategy that uses in the money calls and puts with a delta closer to 1.0 to create an in the money strangle i 'm not sure if it is more similar to your strategy an analogous options strategy would be better than yours as it would not share the potential for a margin call

financial advisers like to ask lots of questions and get nitty gritty about investment objectives but for the most part this is not well founded in financial theory   investment objectives really boils down to one big question and an addendum   the big question is how much risk you are willing to tolerate   this determines your expected return and most characteristics of your portfolio the addendum is what assets you already have background risk   your portfolio should contain things that hedge that risk and not load up on it   if you expect to have a fixed income some extra inflation protection is warranted   if you have a lot of real estate investing your portfolio should avoid real estate   if you work for google you should avoid it in your portfolio or perhaps even short it given risk tolerance and background risk financial theory suggests that there is a single best portfolio for you which is diversified across all available assets in a market cap weighted fashion

i know an answer has been accepted but you need an emergency fund ideally enough to cover at least 3 months of after tax basic living expenses as a free 6 months would be even better this is n't a fun way to tie up your money but it is a prudent way what if you lose your job or decide you want to change your line of work what if you 're told a close family member has only months to live and you want to take significant time off unpaid what if your car breaks down and you need a new one what if your freelance business hits a dry patch for a few months what if you want to move but ca n't sell your next house quickly i 've known people who had these types of situations come up unexpectedly some were financially prepared and had the freedom to make the choices they wanted to make others did n't and now have regrets once you have a basic emergency fund in place then go for investing with the rest of the money best of luck

you 'd be mistaken to this there is any morality involved in most corporations neither positive nor negative running a business is amoral some business missions have a moral intent such as pharmaceuticals health organization etc but all have an amoral   it 's fairly simplistic the purpose of a business is to produce a profit at some point all successful well functioning businesses will work down their list of ways to produce a profit after they 've established market share a lasting brand customer loyalty finances well in the black and eventually look towards capital preservation in most bodies with a large monetary wealth capital preservation becomes a key focus in other words once you master the art of making money you then need to master the art of keeping it   thus the ability to then focus on these things to continue to just pay taxes is like running an efficient but leaky ship the more you preserve the longer you 'll be around and the more power you 'll yield to stick around    this last point is also important to keep in mind unlike you or i a company will basically last forever well at least until society collapses you or i are only here until we die and whatever wealth we have we may try to preserve for our kids or next of kin a corporation is always here the people in the corporation amp it 's owners change hands but the corporation survives frankly any business that is n't aiming to make a profit is either going to fail quickly or is by definition a non profit   here is where i would believe the government plays a balancing role to reign in the power of corporations lest they rival their own but any good corporation will handle that problem as well regulatory capture anyone   also consider that for the most wealthy among us it 's probably not about the money anymore it 's now probably about the game this is certainly where the get that manic edge on the rest of us

some thoughts 1 do you have a significant emergency fund 3 6 months of after tax living expenses if not you stand to take a significant loss if you have an unexpected need for cash that is tied up in investments what if you lose hate your job or your car breaks down what if a you want to spend some time with a relative or significant other who learns they only have a few months to live having a dedicated emergency fund is an important way to avoid downside risk 2 has a good suggestion given that if you 'd reinvested your dividends the s&p 500 has returned about 3.5 over the last 5 years you may be able to get a very nice risk free return   3 do you have access to employer matching funds such as in a 401(k at work if you get a dollar for dollar match that is a risk free pre tax 100 return and should be a high priority 4 what do you mean by medium volatility given that you are considering a 2/3 equity allocation it would not be at all out of the realm of possibility that your balance could fall by 15 or more in any given year and take several years to recover if that would you you may want to consider lowering your equity weights a high quality bond fund may be a good fit 5 personally i would avoid putting money into stocks that i did n't need back for 10 years if you only want to tie your money up for 2 5 years you are taking a significant risk that if prices fall you wo n't have time to recover before you need your money back the portfolio you described would be appropriate for someone with a long term investment horizon and significant risk tolerance which is usually the case for young people saving for retirement however if your goals are to invest for 2 5 years only your situation would be significantly different   6 you can often borrow from an investment account to purchase a primary residence but you must pay that amount back in order to avoid significant taxes and fees unless you plan to liquidate assets if you plan to buy a house saving enough to avoid pmi is a good risk free return on your money 7 in general and etf or index fund is a good idea the key being to minimize the compound effect of expenses over the long term there are many good choices a la vanguard here to choose from 8) do n't worry about buy low sell high do n't be a speculator be an investor that 's my version of anthony 's do n't be a tourist be a traveler a speculator wants to sell shares at a higher price than they were purchased at an investor wants to share in the profits of a company as a part owner if you can consistently beat the market by trying to time your transactions good for you you can move to wall street and make millions however almost no one can do this consistently and it does n't seem worth it to me to try i do n't mean to discourage you from investing just make sure you have your bases covered so that you do n't have to cash out at a bad time best of luck edit response to additional questions below 1 emergency fund i would recommend not investing in anything other than cash equivalents money market short term cds etc until you 've built up an emergency fund it makes sense to want to make the best use of your money but you also have to account for risk my concern is that if you were to experience one or more adverse life events that you could lose a lot of money or need to pay a lot in interest on credit card debt and it would be prudent to self insure against some of those risks i would also recommend against using an investment account as an emergency fund account taking money out of investment accounts is inefficient because the commissions taxes fees can easily eat up a significant portion of your returns ideally you would want to put money in and not touch it for a long time in order to take advantage of compounding returns there are also high penalties for early disbursements from retirement funds just like you need enough money in your checking account to buy food and pay the rent every month you need enough money in an emergency fund to pay for things that are a real possibility even if they are less common using a credit card or an investment account is a relatively expensive way to do this 2 invest at all i would recommend starting an emergency fund and then beginning to invest for retirement once your retirement savings are on track you can begin saving for whatever other goals you may have

also in the next sentence what is buyers commission is it referring to the share holder or potential share holder and why does the buyer get commission   the buyer does n't get a commission   the buyer pays a commission   so normally a buyer would say i want to buy a hundred shares at $ 20   the broker would then charge the buyer a commission   assuming 4 the commission would be   so the total cost to the buyer is $ and the seller receives $ 2000   the buyer paid a commission of $ 80 as the buyer 's commission    in the case of an ipo the seller often pays the commission   so the buyer might pay $ 2000 for a hundred shares which have a 7 commission   the brokering agent or agents may share pockets a commission of $ 140   total paid to the seller is $ 1860    some might argue that the buyer pays either way as the seller receives money in the transaction   that 's a reasonable outlook   a better way to say this might be that typical trades bill the buyer directly for commission while ipo purchases bill the seller   in the typical trade the buyer negotiates the commission with the broker   in an ipo the seller does with the underwriter    another issue with an ipo is that there are more parties getting commission than just one   as a general rule you still call your broker to purchase the stock   the broker still expects a commission   but the ipo underwriter also expects a commission   so the 7 commission might be split between the ipo underwriter works for the selling company and the broker works for the buyer    the broker has more work to do than normal   they have to put in the buyer 's purchase request and manage the price negotiation   in most purchases you just say something like i want to offer $ 20 a share or i want to purchase at the market price   in an ipo they may increase the price asking for $ 25 a share   and they may do that multiple times   your broker has to come back to you each time and get a new authorization at the higher price   and you still might not get the number of shares that you requested    beyond all this you may still be better off buying an ipo than waiting until the next day   sure you pay more commission but you also may be buying at a lower price   if the ipo price is $ 20 but the price climbs to $ 30 you would have been better off paying the ipo price even with the higher commission   however if the ipo price is $ 20 and the price falls to $ 19.20 you 'd be better off buying at $ 19.20 after the ipo   even though in that case you 'd pay the 4 commission on top of the $ 19.20 so about $    i think that the overall point of the passage is that the ipo underwriter makes the most money by convincing you to pay as high an ipo price as possible   and once they do that they 're out of the picture   your broker will still be your broker later   so the ipo underwriter has a lot of incentive to encourage you to participate in the ipo instead of waiting until the next day   the broker does n't care much either way   they want you to buy and sell something   the ipo or something else   they do n't care much as to what    the underwriter may the stock as that maximizes their return   if they can convince enough people to overpay they do n't care that the stock falls the day after that   all their marketing effort is to try to achieve that result   they want you to believe that your $ 20 purchase will go up to $ 30 the next day   but it might not    these numbers may not be accurate   obviously the $ 20 stock price is made up   but the 4 and 7 numbers may also be inaccurate   modern online brokers are very competitive and may charge a flat fee rather than a percentage   the book may be giving you older numbers that were correct in 1983 or whatever year   the buyer 's commission could also be lower than 4 as the seller also may be charged a commission   if each pays 2 that 's about 4 total but split between a buyer 's commission and a seller 's commission

besides what others have mentioned another thing to watch out for is the tax withholding on withdrawal if it 's a traditional ira they will probably withhold a certain percentage on non qualified withdrawals i am not sure if you can ask them not to withhold i do n't remember the percentage and it varies by state but let 's assume it is 20 that means that you only receive 80 of the withdrawal amount when you take it out however when you deposit the money to complete the rollover you need to give them 100 of the withdrawal that means assuming the 20 withholding you need to fork out cash equal to 125 of what you received in cash within 60 days that 's like several hundred percent apr and hard to meet unless you are certain of receiving a large payment within the time period and if you forget about this and you just deposit the same amount that you received 80 of the withdrawal the remainder 20 of the withdrawal will count as an early withdrawal with all the taxes and penalty so what happens to the 20 withheld that you never received but had to pay anyway well the government has it it will count as tax paid on your tax return so it will increase your refund decrease the amount you owe but that means you are out that money until tax time unless you decrease the withholding on your salary in the rest of the year to compensate if it 's a roth ira withdrawal on the contribution there is generally no withholding so you do n't have to worry about the above but there is no penalty on withdrawal of roth ira contribution anyway

several people here have highlighted the incentive agency problems that tend to naturally arise when mortgages however the market for mortgage backed securities has existed for decades and during most of that time these agency problems were held in check moreover academics knew about this problem even before the credit crisis and actually recommended the use of in order to avoid the moral hazard problems associated with securitization see 2005   so to give a compelling historical explanation for why the crisis happened when it did you need to explain what changed in the mortgage securitization market to enable these previously agency relationships to breakdown   so what changed in short the growth of the market for cdos collateralized debt obligations composed of mortgage backed securities and not the mbs market itself this market grew so rapidly in the because the ratings agencies created an opportunity for banks to take low rated mbs debt and give it a higher rating by merely it into a cdo it was ratings arbitrage through and through explanations that place the brunt of the blame on the i.e. fannie and freddie can not adequately explain why the majority of mortgage related losses during the credit crisis were concentrated in cdos of mbss and not in the vanilla mbs market   here 's what happened back in the day say pre early 2000s the agency incentive problems that naturally arise in mortgage securitization were held in check by careful institutional investors who would rigorously assess the default risk of the higher risk mbs tranches they had a deep knowledge of the mortgage business sometimes they would even go so far as manually examining the loan documentation the profile of the borrowers the quality of the collateral and so on there were a lot of buyers who were happy to purchase the aaa and aa tranches but they could afford to be because the banks who were mbss knew that without selling to the discriminating buyers of higher risk debt they would n't be able to break even    it worked a bit like a market for fine wines i do n't know much about wine but when i walk into a shop that sells fine wines i can be reasonably certain that there will be a reasonably strong relationship between price and the quality of the wine basically i get to free ride off the superior discrimination of the wine who regularly visit the shop   once the ratings agencies created the now infamous ratings arbitrage between the mbs and cdo markets the market for cdos on mbss expanded as this market grew these discriminating buyers became a proportionally smaller part of the mbs market the folks building cdos of mbss did n't know very much about the mortgage business itself instead they tended to rely on statistical default models provided by the ratings agencies that predicted the probability of mortgage default based on quantitative variables such as borrowers credit scores loan to value ratios etc    the problem is that these models used historical data that was collected back when the discriminating institutional investors kept the agency problems in the mbs market in check the growth of the cdo market spurred even more mortgage securitization which led lending standards to deteriorate because firms like countrywide knew that the cdo buyers only cared about credit scores ltv ratios etc however buyers of mbs were unable to detect these changes in default risk because the models they were using to see those changes were becoming invalidated by the growth of the cdo market itself   if you want to read more about this i 'd highly recommend 's 2011 paper in the american journal of sociology see here it 's a detailed historical account of the changes in valuation practices models used within the mbs and cdo markets and how these practices became invalidated as the cdo market grew in size   tl;dr the credit ratings created a ratings arbitrage that the banks took advantage of they are as much if not more at fault as the   for more info on the deterioration in mortgage quality in the check out    keys benjamin and 2008 did securitization lead to lax screening evidence from subprime loans   and 2008 the failure of models that predict failure distance incentives and defaults december   also the citation i mentioned above   p. 2005 the pooling and of securities a model of informed review of economic studies 35 2005

if you are calculating simple roi the answer is straightforward math   see this answer for some examples but yes with more leverage you will always see better roi on a property if you can maintain a positive cash flow   the most complete answer is to factor in your total risk that high roi of a leveraged property is far more volatile and sensitive to any unexpected expenses additionally a loss of equity in the property or an upside down mortgage will further impact your long term position to put this more simply as noted in the comments below your losses will be amplified you can not say a leveraged property will always give you a better roi because you can not predict your losses

i too am a full monthly statement balance payer and i received a balance transfer offer from my credit card company this one was quite different from many others that i have read about on this forum i could do a balance transfer for any amount up to $ x from another credit card or use the checks to pay   some other non credit card bills and i would not have to pay any interest for 12 months on the amount thus borrowed   but there would be a 2 service charge on the amount i was borrowing this amount would be billed on the next monthly statement and it would have to be paid in full by the due date of that month 's payment that is within the grace period allowed for payment of monthly statements else interest would start being charged on the unpaid part of the service charge at the usual rate of per month if i had not paid the previous month 's balance in full i would be charged interest at per month on the service charge starting from day one no free ride till the due date of the next month 's statement of course the balance carried over from last month would also be charged interest at if i had paid last month 's bill in full but there were any other charges purchases during the current month then   unless the entire amount due this month 's purchases plus service charge and that interest free for twelve months loan   balance was paid off within the grace period my purchases would be deemed unpaid and would start being charged interest in short the only way to avoid paying interest on the amount borrowed was to start with a card showing a $ 0 balance due on the previous month 's statement not make any charges on that card for a whole year and pay off that 2 service charge within the grace period it might also have required that one of that interest free loan be repaid each month but   i had stopped reading the offer at this point and filed it in the round circular file in short while @joetaxpayer 's tale of how as a pay in full user i 've used the zero rate to throw $ 20 k at the 5.25 mortgage is undoubtedly how things worked once it is not at all clear that they still work that way at least they do n't work that way for me   heck once upon a time for a period of about 3 months you could earn 1.5 interest per month from the credit card company by overpaying your credit card bill considerably their computers then just added on 1.5 interest by multiplying your credit balance by and so you got 1.5 per month interest from the credit card company the credit card agreements and the software got changed in a hurry and all credit card agreements state in the fine print that if you overpay your bill you do n't earn any interest on the overpayment

without knowing what you are trying to achieve make a bit of pocket money become financially independent invest for retirement learn trading to become a trader i 'll give you a few thoughts   the difficulty you will have trading with $ 400 600 is that brokerage will be a high proportion of your profits i 'm not sure of the us assuming us rather than au nz etc rates for online brokers but uk online brokers are the order of £ 6 10 trade having a quick read suggests that the trading is similar $ 6 with doing day trades you will be killed by the brokerage i 'm not sure what percent of profitable trades you have but if it is 50 e.g. you will need to make twice the brokerage fees value on each profitable trade before you are actually making a profit there can be an emotional effect that trips you up you will find that trading with your own real money is very different to trading with fake money read up about it this brief blog shows some personal thoughts from someone i read from time to time with a $ 10 brokerage i would suggest the following another option which i would n't recommend is to leverage your money by trading or other derivatives that allow you to trade on a margin further to that learn about trading investing plus other investment types i have written about earlier

i do n't think this is curious at all   a large part of bitcoin 's value is based on speculation currently and since it 's both a global currency and a relatively small one global changes can greatly affect it without having a huge impact on the us dollar e.g. the article mentions that much of bitcoin 's trade and therefore its value is coming from japan right now   the you 're looking for can also be deceiving when talking about currencies of dramatically different values   the us m2 money supply is worth over $ 13 trillion measuring in us dollars   the bitcoin money supply is currently worth about $ 66 billion also measuring in us dollars   if bitcoin spiked 10 and the change in value was completely with the us dollar the us dollar would fall in value by only 0.05 i.e. move $ 6.6 billion in market cap from the usd to bitcoin   that 's also greatly exaggerating the impact of changes in value of bitcoin on the us dollar since bitcoin and the usd are n't the only currency pair in existence   far from it in fact   this is why you see for example the venezuelan tank against the us dollar without feeling immensely more wealthy   people in the us also tend to price things in usd including foreign currencies because that 's what they 're used to doing as they 're most familiar with the value of a dollar from everyday experience

taking out your equity when refinancing means that you take out a new loan for the full value of your house perhaps less 20 as a down payment on the new mortgage otherwise you 'll be paying insurance pay off your old lender and keep the rest for yourself the result is much the same as using as a heloc or home equity loan or a second mortgage except it 's all rolled into a single new mortgage the advantage is that the interest rate on a first mortgage is going to be lower than on heloc or equivalent and the equity requirements may be lower e.g. a heloc may only let you borrow against the amount of equity that exceeds 25 or 30 while a new mortgage will require you only to have 20 equity   this is especially attractive to those whose homes have appreciated significantly since they bought them especially if they have a lot of high interest debt e.g. credit cards they want to pay off of course rolling credit card debt into a 30-year mortgage is n't actually paying it off but the monthly payments will be a lot lower and if you 're lucky and your home appreciates further you can pay it off fully when you sell the property and still have paid a lot less interest the downside is that you have turned unsecured debt into secured debt which puts your home at risk if you find yourself unable to pay in your case you do n't yet have even 20 equity in your home so i would n't recommend this   equity is simply the difference between the amount you still owe on your home and the amount you 'd get if you were to sell it until you do sell it this amount is tentative based on the original purchase price and perhaps an intervening appraisal that shows that the property has appreciated that is really all that it is and there 's nothing magic about it except that since you own your home you have equity in it while as a renter you would not it used to be decades ago when you needed 20 down to get a mortgage that selling was the only time you 'd be able to do anything with the equity in your home now you can take it out as described above or borrow against it thanks to various financial products it is sometimes tempting to consider equity roughly equivalent to profit but some of it is your own money contributed through the down payment your monthly principal payment and improvements you have made so cashing out is n't all profit it 's partly just you getting your own money back and there are many additional expenses involved in owning a home such as interest property taxes maintenance utilities and various fees not to mention the commissions when you buy or sell which the equity calculation does n't consider increasing equity reflects that you own a desirable property in a desirable location that you have maintained and maybe even improved it that you are financially responsible i.e. paying your mortgage taxes etc and that your financial interests are aligned with your neighbors all those things feel pretty good and they should otherwise it is just a number that the banks will sometimes let you borrow against

in general i 'd say yeah if you can pay cash pay cash if you pay cash then by definition you pay zero interest if you get a loan you 'll pay interest most people get a loan to buy a car because they do n't have the cash possible reasons not to pay cash when you could one technically you can pay cash but if you did you would have little or no reserve for emergencies like if the car costs say $ and you have $ in your bank account then technically you could afford to pay cash but you probably should n't because you do n't want to have just $ 10 left what if tomorrow something comes up two arguably you have a place to invest money that pays more than the interest on the loan like say you can get a car loan for whatever the going rate is today say 6 and you know a place to invest your money that is very safe and almost guaranteed to pay 10 it would make sense to borrow to buy the car invest the cash and then withdraw money from the investment to make the payments on the car you 'd end up 4 ahead there are a lot of catches to that strategy though the biggest is that the more the investment pays the more likely that it is risky if you thought the investment would pay 10 but it ends up paying only 4 then you will lose money by this strategy also there 's the psychological element many people say and fully intend to invest their money but then find other things they want to buy and so spend it instead if you pay cash you 're committed

simply put that 's not allowed    outside a retirement fund they simply do not provide a mechanism to pay that expense ratio separately   ergo any effort to pay that expense ratio would be classified as a new additional purchase of the fund you now must deal with   inside a retirement fund paying the expense ratio of the fund with cash would be treated as an additional contribution which may then violate contribution rules such as going over your contribution limit or contributing past age 70 1/2

nothing is guaranteed candlesticks are not crystal balls nor is any part of technical analysis candlestick patterns used correctly and in combination with other western technical indicators can increase the probability of a trade going into the derived direction but they are not a guarantee which is why you should always use stop losses with your candlestick or any trading in saying that another candlestick pattern that can provide high probability trades is the doji or a combination of in a row at a market extreme note that both patterns and work best at price extremes highs and lows and in combination with other technical indicators such as an overbought momentum indicator at a market high or an oversold momentum indicator at a market low edit an example here is a sample trade i placed on the 17th october and am currently in profit on see the chart below as it shows taking the trade on the open of the following day after a bullish pattern appeared at the bottom of a downtrend on the 16th in combination with the slow stochastic crossing over in the oversold region below 20 i would consider this a high probability trade and have placed an initial stop loss at 10 below my open price in case the trade went against me as the price moved up i moved the 10 stop loss up as a trailing stop loss my profit target is set at 25 or $ 4.00

to add to the already existing answers most of the dotcom companies used an accounting so that everything looked rosy to account for revenues what dotcom companies did was get into a barter transaction with another dotcom company by selling advertising space and stuff on each other 's website so the final outcome was each had quite a substantial amount of revenue while in reality there was n't any revenue earned this cooked up their books to look quite rosy to investors who then poured in their money without realizing they were pouring money into a black hole as someone mentioned cisco which sells networking gear and was heavily dependent on the dotcom boost so when everything went bust its stock price also crashed heavily   this was for the losers but some good ones did sail through dotcom companies which had substance took a hit in fact everybody did during the bust but more than made up for it later on when investors realized they are valuable

no   this amount of money is not appropriate for friends to go in on although you could consider buying a house with a business partner have the contracts drawn up see an attorney read up on the penalties if one of the partners does n't hold up their end from the law 's point of view also since this is a business arrangement write and sign all sorts of details regarding the penalties amongst the partners not just the law when one person does n't hold up it is n't that you do n't have good intentions or that you could n't do it just fine if no problems ever happen   the issue is that over the course of a mortgage which is at least several years something is very likely to come up   if you and your friend are n't prepared to think about all those issues and how to handle them you will lose a friend probably a house and your good credit i would n't go into business with my best friend because i want him to stay my best friend

you are discounting the cash used the discount rate for cash should be whatever you determine is your risk premium over the risk free rate not the equity growth rate if equity growth rate is above your determined required return the equity investment is wealth destroying and if it is above that then it is wealth increasing    the difficulty i see is that the scenario is all wrong what you are really after is a rent vs buy decision do i take this money and rent a place or do i buy a house in either case you could invest the remainder after paying your rent mortgage in the equity market no   so what really matters is the difference in cost between renting and buying    let   growth rate   rent = rent m = mortgage payment   i = income   ha =   home value appreciation   now the question is is renting or buying a better decision two scenarios renting first   pmt = i rent   i y =   n = time horizon in years   gain from cf left after paying rent     then discount to present day at your required rate of return to find present value   now scenario for buying this is more complicated because you are investing two different cf streams at different rates and have to calculate both and add them together   1 cf 1 the mortgage payments buy you equity in the house which appreciates hopefully but can be extremely volatile this is the cf stream scenario one does nt have when renting the rent payments poof disappear forever and you earn nothing on them 2 the income left after mortgage payment which can be invested at the market rate measured the same way as above this is extremely simplistic and does nt take into account expected maintenance property taxes and other costs intrinsic to the investment it also does nt take into account the lost down payment setting you well behind the renter    tl dr it is complicated but you determine the required rate based on the perceived risk of the investment and your particular views   and it does nt matter what expected growth rates are since any investment with an expected growth rate below your required rate is wealth destroying since you are paying for something which returns cash flows too small for its risk level if you use growth rates as discount rates then all your investments will net to zero

do not buy this car first i want to say i love bmw 's   there 's a reason why they call them ultimate driving machine and why other car manufacturers compare their new models to bmws   i own and i absolutely love it   every time you get into the car it just begs you to push and abuse it   everything from steering response to throttle to engine sound   awesome car   however 1 bmw is not known for their reliability   i 've had to do numerous things to this car and if i did n't do the work myself i like tinkering with cars it would be a pretty big money pit and actually still is   german parts are more expensive then regular cars   labor will run you if you take it for service   right now my car is on jack stands while i 'm fixing an oil leak replacing cooling system components which are known to fail and doing work with the cam timing system which uses bad seals 2 if you buy a used car which is 3 years old just remember all the items and everything that wants to break will break 3 years sooner on you   someone else already pre enjoyed your car 's maintenance free days   at things will start to go   ask me how i know   so you 'll start paying for maintenance way before your 5-year loan expires   compare this to the acura i used to have   acura aka honda had miles when i sold it and i never once got stranded with the acura 3 fuel economy is not that good and btw you have to use the most expensive gas 4 if you are really set on buying a bmw because you enjoy driving and wo n't drive like an old lady my apologies to those old ladies that drive at least the speed limit but you are not the majority then still do not by this one and check out auctions   i bought my 2003 in 2005 for when it cost over 40k new   you could probably find one with less than 20k miles on it my final advice is either a learn to at least do basic maintenance or b stick to always buying new cars which do n't have any issues in first 4 7 years then move on before you have to schedule your life around your cars on the bright side i doubt you 'll have to ever replace the exhaust and you can buy tail lights on e bay for roughly $ 60

the calculations you suggest have some issues but i think they are not necessary to answer the question it sounds like you are buying the house either way so the question really is simply whether to pay toward your house first or your loan first   in that case the answer is simple pay whichever has the highest interest rate first   make the minimum payment on the other until the first is paid off   remember this and make it your mantra for the rest of your life   if you have any debts such as credit cards that charge a rate higher than the two options you have presented do them first now be careful as you compute the interest rates   most likely you can deduct interest on your mortgage so its effective interest rate is lower it is instead of r where t is your marginal tax rate for a while the cost of mortgage insurance will make your effective mortgage rate artificially high but it sounds like you intend to get to that 20 hurdle pretty fast so my guess is that this is not a big factor congratulations on your bonus and good luck with your new home

the short answer is yes you probably can take the deduction for a home office because the space is used exclusively and you are working there for the convenience of your employer if you do n't have a desk at your employers office the long answer is that it may not be worth it to take the home office deduction as an employee you 're deduction is subject to a 2 agi floor you can only deduct a percentage of your rent or the depreciation on your home a quick and dirty example if you make $ 75k year rent a 1200 sqft 2 bedroom apartment for $ 1000/month and use one bedroom 120 sqft regularly and exclusively for your employer you can deduct 10 of the $ 12000 $ 1000 12 months assumes your situation did n't change in rent or $ 1200 however because you are an employee you are subject to the 2 agi floor so you can deduct $ salary 2 floor = so in order to deduct the first dollar you need an additional $ 300 worth of deductible expenses   depending on your situation it may or may not be worth it to take the home office deduction even if you qualify for it

alright bud i 'm sure you 're a smart and nice person who just wants people to earn as much as they possibly can at least i hope you are so let 's look at it logically    you are suggesting people that are unskilled uneducated lack the ability to negotiate in their favor and a government law must be placed to help them however the effect of a higher minimum wage means you now force that very individual to compete with more people for that same position this is because there 's not a lot of competition for a job that pays say $ because skilled people do n't apply to them the higher you set that minimum wage like the livable wage of $ 15/hr that i hear so much about the more skilled people will apply to these positions because they now pay more what makes you think an unskilled uneducated individual will be able to find employment in this competitive environment you are assuming that people earning minimum wage today will continue earning a minimum wage even if a higher minimum wage law is passed    also remember that employment goes both ways just as a potential employee has the freedom to walk away from a wage he does n't like an employer is free to not hire an employee for a given wage an employer does not hire personnel that provides value less than the wage paid because that employee now costs the employer to keep him retained so when you enforce a minimum wage which states an employer must at a minimum pay a certain wage you forcibly fire all the employees that do not merit that wage you effectively take away the 1 bargaining chip unskilled and uneducated individuals can offer which is offering to work for lower wages

in such a situation is there any reason financial or not to not pay    as many points as mortgage seller allows i can think of a few reasons not to buy points in the scenario you described if interest rates decrease you could be better off refinancing to a lower rate than buying points now if buying points reduced your down payment below 20 then the pmi would more than offset the benefit of having purchased points your situation changes and you are n't able to stay in the home as long as planned   that said current interest rates are pretty low so i 'd probably gamble on them not getting too much lower anytime soon i also assume that if you can afford as many points as they allow that you would n't have to dip below 20 down payment even with points edit others have mentioned that it 's important to note opportunity cost when calculating the benefit of purchasing points i agree you would n't want to buy points at a rate that saved you less than you could earn elsewhere personally i 've not seen a points scenario that did n't yield more benefit than market average returns but that could be due to my market or just coincidence you should definitely calculate the benefit for your scenario and shop for a good lender do n't forget that points are tax deductible in the year paid when calculating their benefit

really the question you need to ask yourself is how much risk you want to take in order to save a little on interest for 5 years rates are pretty close to a historic low and if you have good credit you should shop around a bit to get a good ideal of what a 15 or 30 year fixed loan would go for for people that are sure they will be selling a property in a few years a balloon or arm might not be a bad thing   otoh if their plans change or if you plan to stay in the property for longer e.g. 10 15 years then they have the potential to turn into a huge trap and could have the effect of forcing you to sell your house    the most likely people to fall into such a trap are those who are trying to buy more house than they can really afford and max out what they can pay using a lower rate and then later can not afford the payments if anything happens that makes the rate go up   over the last three years we 've seen a large number of foreclosures and short sales taking place are because of people who fell into just this kind of trap   i strongly advise you learn from their mistakes and do not follow in their   you need to consider what could happen in 5 years time    or if the economy takes off and/or the fed is not careful with interest rates and money supply we could see high inflation and high interest rates to go along with it    the odds of rates being any lower in 5 years time is probably pretty low   the odds of it being higher depends on who 's crystal ball you look at   i think most people would say that rates are likely to increase and the disagreement is over just how much and how soon   if you are forced to refinance in 5 years time and the rates are higher will you be able to make the payments or will you potentially be forced out of the house perhaps into something much smaller   what happens if the rates at that time are 9 and even an arm is only 6 could you make the payments or would you be forced to sell    potentially you could end up paying out more in interest than if you had just gotten a simple fixed loan myself i 'd not take the risk   for much of the last 40 years people would have sold off their children or body parts to get rates like we have today on a standard fixed loan   i 'd go for a standard fixed loan between 15 and 30 years duration   if you want to pay extra principle to get it paid off earlier in order to feel more secure or just get out from under the debt then do so personally i would n't bother not at today 's rates

what they re fishing for is whether the money was earned in the u.s.   it 's essentially an interest shelter and/or avoiding double taxation    they 're saying if you keep income you make outside the us in a bank inside the us the us thanks you for storing your foreign money here and does n't tax the interest but the nation where you earned that income might    there is no question that the airbnb income is connected with a us trade or business    so your next question is whether the fraction of interest earned from that income can be broken out or whether irs requires you to declare all the interest from that account    honestly given the amount of tax at stake it may not be worth your time researching    now since you seem to be a resident nonresident alien it seems apparent that whatever economic value you are creating to earn your salary is being performed in the united states if this is for an american company and wages paid in usd no question that 's a us trade or business but what if it 's for a swedish company running on swedish servers serving and paid in to a swedish bank which you then transfer to your us bank does it matter if your boots are on sovereign us soil   this is a complex question and some countries uk say if your boots are in our nation it is trade income in our nation others ca do not   this is probably a separate question to search or ask to be clear the fact that your days as a teacher or do not count toward residency is a separate question from whether your salary as same counts as us income

hmmm as far as i know wire transfers are still the best option if you make sure your us account accepts international wires for free like td bank does you 'll have eliminated most of the costs assuming your foreign bank does n't charge too much for wiring the funds in the first place also if your able to you could consider wiring 6 or so months at the same time i 'm not familiar with xe.com but it seems it 's not set up for transferring money so much as for trading currencies while you could probably use it to transfer funds if you 'd link both your accounts it seems a rather complicated way to go about things paypal could be an option if they 'd allow you to set up an account in each country or if you have a relative that could help out but it gets more expensive than wire transfers quickly as for getting the best exchange rate i 've given up on that a long time ago and have accepted that as the cost of living internationally

this works when you want to command and have others follow great for most businesses   if you want a workplace that generates ideas and you or your hiring staff may not be the best at picking the best i would say this is an extension of the effect   the best is a subjective judgement do nt forget

nope or at least if it were possible the company offering such a credit card would quickly go out of business credit card companies make money off of fees from the merchants the user is buying from and from the users themselves if they charged no fees to the user on cash advances and in fact gave a 3 back on cash advances then it would be possible for a user to the company would lose money until they stopped the loophole or went out of business

i never understand the mindset of infrastructure being paid for through private investment on a municipal level it makes sense that development fees can help a city pay to replace a bridge that leads to the development or put in some new parks but considering that infrastructure like rail lines and dams are the big concern i do n't really see private entities taking a big interest in them it would've really helped houston if private investment was into management while developing into a major suburban centre based on the evidence shown those private investors did n't have major concerns for improving the city 's infrastructure and just did what they had to in order to be allowed to put in their development   infrastructure belongs in the public sphere things like rail highways dams and coastal protection are in the public 's best interest what does a businessman have to gain by paying to a rail line or put in new traffic signals at an intersection

as the record date is 7th august you need to hold stocks on the 7th august closing you need not hold it till 2nd sept. the list as taken on 7th august would be processed and instructions given to bank and the dividends credited by 1st sept.   edit to clarify victor 's comment typically from the time one sells the stocks to the time it actually gets transferred has a clearing cycle most stock exchanges have 2 or 3 days cycles i.e. if i sell the stock today it is still in my name the money is still with the buyer on day 1 the positions are arrived at on day 2 the stock gets credited to the buyer and the funds gets credit to seller   as the question was specific whether to hold the stock till 7th or 22nd sept my initial answer was simple the illustration by victor is more accurate

this is somewhat unbelievable   i mean if you had a business of collecting debts would n't you want to collect said debts   rather than attempting to people with these delinquent debts into paying you have someone volunteering to pay   would you want to service that client   this would not happen in just about any other industry but such is the lunacy of debt collecting the big question is why do you need this cleared off your credit   if it is just for a credit score it probably is not as important as your more recent entries   i would just wait it out until 7 years has passed and you can then write the reporting agencies to remove it from your credit if you are attempting to buy a home or similarly large purpose and the mortgage company is insisting that you deal with this then i would do the following write the company to address the issue   this has to be certified return receipt requested   if they respond pay it and insist that it be marked as paid in full on your credit   i would do this with a money order or cashiers check   done dispute the charge with the credit reporting agencies providing the documentation of no response   this should remove the item from your credit provide this documentation to the mortgage broker   this should remove any they might have optional   sue the company in small claims court   this will take a bit of time and money but it should yield a profit   there was a post on here a few days ago about how to do this   make part of any settlement to have your name cleared of the debt it is counterproductive to fall into the trap of the pursuit of a perfect credit score   a person with a 750 often receives the same rate options as a person with 850   also your relationship with a particular lender could trump your credit score currently i am enjoying the highest credit score of my life over   do you know how i did it   i got out of debt including paying off the mortgage and i have no intentions of ever going into debt for anything   so why does it matter   it is a bit ridiculous

to answer the first part of your question yes i 've done that   i did even a bit more   i once had a job that i was n't sure i 'd keep and the economy was n't great either   in case my next employer would n't let me contribute to a 401(k from day one and because i did n't want to my retirement and be stuck with a higher tax bill i front loaded my 401(k contributions to be maxed out before the end of the year   the contribution limits were lower than $ back then as for the reduced cash flow you need of course a buffer account containing several months worth of living expenses to afford maxing out or front loading 401(k contributions   you should be paying your bills out of such buffer account and not out of each paycheck   as for the reduced cash flow i think large scale contributions can crowd out other long term saving   priorities such as saving for a house down payment and the trade off between them is a real concern   if they 're out basic and discretionary consumer expenses that 's a totally different kind of problem which you do n't seem to have which is great so about the trade off between large scale 401(k contributions and saving for the down payment   i 'd say maxing out 401(k can foster the savings culture that will eventually pay its dividends   if after several years of maxing out your 401(k you decide that saving for the house is the top priority you 'll see money flow to the money market account marked for the down payment at a substantial monthly rate thanks to that savings culture as for the increasing future earnings no   most people i 've known for a long time if they saved 20 when they made $ 20k year they continued to save 20 or more when they later made $ 100k year   people who spent the entire paycheck while making $ 50k year always say if only i got a raise to $ 60k year i 'd save a few thousand   but they eventually graduate to $ 100k year and still spend the entire paycheck   it 's all about your savings culture on the second part of your question yes roth is a great tool especially if you believe that the future tax rates will be higher to fix the long term budget deficits   so contributing to 401(k to maximize the match then max out roth as others suggested is a great advice   after you 've done that see what else you can do more 401(k saving for the house etc

the rest of the market knows when the dividends are paid out and that will be reflected naturally in the share price that 's why there is no way to consistently beat the market because the market is other human beings who 's sum of knowledge is greater than any individual everything in the stock market boils down to this in one way or another

for the record i am the original question asker and i 'm reporting back to say that the approach described in the accepted answer did not work i am adding a new answer rather than commenting on the accepted answer because of the length of explanation required i applied for an itin by filing a w-7 with all appropriate documentation including a birth certificate death certificate and recognition of birth abroad i.e. proof of u.s. citizenship the irs rejected the application saying that people who are eligible for ca n't have that placed me in an untenable situation because even though the irs said she was eligible for an ssn the social security administration said they never issue to dead people as a matter of policy   so insult was added to injury it is true that i should have applied for an ssn while she was alive in which case it would have been a simple matter i just paid the extra tax that was due because of her not counting as a dependent during the years for which i was filing the amount was not worth fighting over further or renouncing my u.s. citizenship   moral of story live in all ways as if there is no guarantee your children will be alive tomorrow because there is no such guarantee
