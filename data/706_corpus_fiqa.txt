it depends on what you paid for but usually audit support is an unrelated engagement to the return preparation if the accountant made a professional mistake you can request correction and compensation from that accountant other than that any accountant can help you with audit regardless of who prepared the return the original accountant would probably be better informed about why you reported each number on the return and how it was calculated but if you kept all the docs it can be recalculated again that 's what happens in the audit anyway

that 's true about but that 's not the problem with tv advertising the problem is   if you 've ever listened to talk radio sometimes the host gets really quiet and almost and then he lights up and begins yelling and shouting   yet during this time you do n't need to adjust your radio 's volume the sound from the radio studio has been very heavily compressed so that the quiet and loud parts are all the same volume   if you the crap out of your commercial 's sound and then normalize it to 95 of the peak of the tv show 's sound which is typically not nearly as compressed then your commercial is going to be perceived as vastly louder than the tv show even though it never exceeds 95 of the tv show 's peak volume   thus a law referencing the average volume is thought to be more effective than one that simply requires   it still seems easy to work around though just have 29 seconds of silence and 1 second of horrendously loud house waking marketing slime   what they need to do is require that neither the average nor the peak db level of the commercial may exceed the average db level of the show   there might be cute little tricks that can get around that too but at some point the ad agency has to actually talk and sell their product rather than performing mathematical on the audio just to wake everyone up

i would disagree with your analysis   to me there are two purposes for a money market mm your emergency fund should be from 3 to 6 months of expenses   think of it of an insurance policy against murphy   you may want to have some money designated for big expenses or even sinking funds   for example i keep some money in a mm for a car as both the wife daughter and i driver older vehicles   i may need to replace them if you were planning on making a larger purchase car house boat engagement ring i would put the money in a mm fund so you are not subject to the whims of the market    after that you are free to invest all your money   its likely that you should have some money outside of tax advantaged funds so if you want to start a business you will not have to do high cost withdrawals

just a word of warning most of the companies that promise to repair your credit are scams or close to them   you could just as easily do yourself what they are going to charge you for essentially they write a letter to the credit agencies disputing most or all of the bad stuff on your credit report when you do that the credit agency sends an inquiry to the company that reported the negative information requiring them to justify it if that company does n't respond within x days they remove the item from your credit report these companies depend on the fact that some companies are n't going to hit that deadline or even respond perhaps they are just too busy to hassle with providing backup documentation for a $ 20 late payment they are banking on getting a few of these cheap outs to your benefit and charging you for what amounts to sending out a bunch of form letters if you do n't mind writing a bunch of letters then you can save a lot of money and get the exact same results these companies want to pretend they have some insider knowledge or fancy lawyers that know special credit magic but they generally do n't the only option i 'd consider legitimate and not a waste of your time is a referral from the non profit national federation for credit counseling they are n't going to fix your credit but will give you advice on budgeting and repairing your credit on your own

no it does n't work like this your charitable contribution is limited to the fmv in your scenario your charitable contribution is limited by the fmv i.e. you can only deduct the worth of the stocks it would be to your advantage to sell the stocks and donate cash had your stock appreciated you may be required to either deduct the appreciation amount from the donation deduction or pay capital gains tax increasing your basis to the fmv depending on the nature of your donation in many cases you may be able to deduct the whole value of the appreciated stock without paying capital gains read the link below for more details and exceptions in this scenario it is probably more beneficial to donate the stock even if required to pay the capital gains tax instead of selling and donating cash which will always trigger the capital gains tax exceptions    however in certain situations you must reduce the fair    market value by any amount that would have been long term capital gain    if you had sold the property for its fair market value generally    this means reducing the fair market value to the property 's cost or    other basis you must do this if the property other than qualified appreciated stock is contributed to certain private foundations you choose the 50 limit instead of the special 30 limit for capital gain property discussed later the contributed property is intellectual property as defined earlier under patents and other intellectual property the contributed property is certain property as explained earlier or the contributed property is tangible personal property defined earlier that is put to an unrelated use defined later by the charity or has a claimed value of more than $ 5,000 and is sold traded or otherwise disposed of by the qualified organization during the year    in which you made the contribution and the qualified organization has    not made the required certification of exempt use such as on form    donee information return part iv see also recapture if no    exempt use later see more here

your question asked about a specific time the yield curve flattened or inverted   there are other times when the yield curve inverted or flattened   you also imply in your question that investors were flocking to long term bonds which lowered their yields   i do n't believe this is the case   i believe investors were fleeing from short term bonds causing the yields on short term bonds to rise to meet those of long term bonds the chart below shows the history of yields on us bonds over time   the areas are where the yield curve flattened or inverted   notice that after 1982 it is the short term yields that rise sharply to meet or cross the yields on longer term bonds   the yields on longer term bonds move little compared to the movement in yields on the short term bonds   thus it is investors moving out of short term bonds that cause the yield curve to or   these investors are not moving into longer term bonds since the yields on the longer term bonds do not move much at all at these times   in fact in 2006 the longer term bond market was only 25 of the total us public debt while short term bonds made up 75   it would take less money to move the yields on longer term bonds than it would on short term bonds yet the longer term yields did not move near as much as short term yields   so why are investors or banks moving out of short term bonds causing their yields to rise   i believe this happens for one of two reasons   they are moving into higher yielding investments or they need to raise cash to cover bad investments   charts and more information here

i think there 's value in charging family members friends interest if it will make them take the loan seriously   the problem is that if you 're thinking about charging interest because the person seems to be borrowing from you too it may be too late to make them take it seriously in the situation you describe if you 're concerned about the loans being paid back i think you need to have a serious conversation with the kids and make it clear you expect them to pay the loans back on whatever schedule you agreed to   if based on your knowledge of your kids you think charging interest would help motivate them to do this great   if not charging interest is unlikely to accomplish anything that the conversation itself wo n't accomplish   if you have n't previously outlined a specific schedule or set of expectations for how you want to be paid back just doing that in writing may be enough to make them realize it 's not a joke the conventional wisdom is that you should n't lend money to anyone unless you 're either a okay with never being paid back or b willing to pursue legal remedies to ensure you 're paid back   most people are n't willing to sue their own family members over small loans which means in most cases it 's not a good idea to loan money to family unless you 're okay with never being repaid whatever level of okay with makes sense for you i should note that i do n't have kids my advice here is just how i would handle it if i were considering loaning money to my brother or a close friend or the like   this means i do n't really know anything about teaching the kids about the real world but i have to say my hunch is that if your kids are 25 + and married it 's too late to radically change their views on how the real world works unless they had a very sheltered early adulthood they 've been living in the real world for too long and will have their own ideas of how it works

there are some nuances with hce definition to answer your questions it 's compensation as defined by the plan usually it 's gross comp but it can exclude things like fringe benefits overtime pay commissions bonuses etc the compensation test is also a look back test meaning that an ee is determined to be an hce in the current year if their compensation in the previous year was over the limit i 'm not sure how stock options affect this but i expect they would be counted probably have an esop plan at that point too which is a whole other can o the 5 owner test applies to the current year and also has a one year look back period if at any point even for a day an employee was more than 5 owner they are hce for that year and next yes there is a limit a company may limit the amount of hce 's to the top 20 of employees by pay like aganju said they can also disregard employees that may otherwise have been excluded under the plan using statutory exclusions example they can disregard employees under 21 years and with less than 1 year of service hahaha the irs does not like to concisely define things you can look here that 's probably as concise as you 'll get hope this helps

first and foremost you must remember that they are people something i do n't think you have trouble with but others might when dealing with increasingly desperate financial struggles it 's not uncommon to allow financial trouble to define you or for others to see you only as poor money is a human creation it 's not real like fire or water and money problems is a misnomer whatever problems they have money is only one symptom often dealing with those deeper human problems such as lack of confidence depression fear or behavioral issues is the key to correcting downstream problems like poor money management not that learning how to manage money is n't important but it does n't sound like that is the primary issue in this case westerners tend to view money trouble as distinct from other problems the answer to money troubles is often understood to be more money or smarter money earn more or spend better it helps to step back and look beyond finances what 's going in their lives how does that make them feel do they feel unimportant or valueless how 's their family life do they have good emotional support or are they running on empty trying to fill the with other things like games for example simply telling them to stop purchasing games for example without finding a better replacement just the feelings of shame and discovering the deeper elements of your friends situation is much more complicated than giving them money or paying for a financial counselor neither of which are bad things but it may make a tremendous difference not just in your friends bank account but in their lives as well my wife and i have experienced all of this first hand so i know the predicament you are in we 've even had people in tough financial situations live in our home with us in all the situations in which we 've been close enough to understand context money was n't the primary issue it 's always been something else more often than not family but not always i 've found the book when helping hurts helpful for gaining some perspective though it 's not a perfect match since it deals more with poverty on a grand scale you may still find it helpful in terms of general principles but ultimately each situation is going to be unique and no one size fits all strategy exists to solve all problems in the end building a deeper relationship is the best path toward finding a long term solution

you are confusing entirely unrelated things first the profit distribution issue with bob 's s corp which is in fact tax evasion and will probably trigger a very nasty audit generally if you 're the sole employee of your own s corp and the whole s corp income is from your own personal services as defined by the irs there 's no profit there all the net income from such a s corp is subject to se tax either through payroll or through your k-1 claiming anything else would be lying and irs is notorious for going after people doing that second the issue the reason employers classify employees as contractors is to avoid payroll taxes which the irs gets through bob 's s corp so it does n't care and providing benefits that is bob 's problem not the irs so in the scenario above the irs would n't care whose employee bob is since bob 's s corp would have to pay all the same payroll taxes the is an issue when employees are abused see examples of fedex drivers where they 're classified as contractors and are not getting any benefits spend their own money on the truck and maintenance etc the employees are the ones who sued for but in this case the irs would be interested as well since a huge chunk of payroll taxes was not paid driver 's net is after car maintenance and payments not before as it would be if he was salaried so in your scenario is not as much a concern to bob as his tax evasion scheme claiming earnings from performing personal services as profits from s corp a precedent to look at as i mentioned elsewhere would be the watson v commissioner case

people who smoke pot every day could certainly be effected at the workplace because they might start to realize how fucked up the world is and that will effect their performance on the job more than anything else   happy pot smokers are totally capable and competent workers i 've seen it plenty of time first hand and if you are going to suggest otherwise then you should bring some proof to back it up   marijuana does n't effect a person 's competency it makes them feel good that is all it does other drugs certainly effect competency alcohol for example

i think in these types of situations where your knowledge is limited concerning the workings of the firms the only thing you can do is explain why you want to be a quant discuss your love of math the challenges thrill of figuring out markets the future of trading etc quant firms are full of really smart people looking for intellectual challenges and the money is just the cherry on top while i do n't work in finance just reading about firms like renaissance staffed with ex and professors it seems reasonable to assume the above

their interest expense was $ where you see $ in key statistics any daily interest received is more than canceled out by the expense paid at the same time i understand your concern but this company is not sitting on cash as are apple google etc short term rates are well below 1 1yr looks like about .2 so strictly speaking each share might have 1 cent interest you need to concern yourself with disclaimer to other readers this has nothing to do with taxes op is asking about a specific part of the company cash flow his worst case is $ 1 per 100 shares

cat has always had plants in il hq is in grew up there several members of my family work for them and plants all over the place canada probably had other things going against it at the time they pulled out depending on the timing it 's quite likely that the exchange rate had shifted such that even without a raise the workers were effectively costing the company considerably more   articles like that seem to leave out all sorts of details for instance i only saw one point where salary was increased and it was n't anywhere near a 60 increase more like 15 which is n't entirely unheard of there 's also what looks like a one time cash payment bonus for a good year 3 4x salary is n't unheard of in executive bonus land it 's also highly variable and not guaranteed year to year the rest would be in stocks and options the trick there is that the amounts of those were probably determined when he signed his contract the reason it makes for a big raise is because the stock price has gone up though it 's down nearly 20 over the last month may kinda sucked for the stock market   you also need to look at whether the profits are higher because of higher volume and possibly more workers better margins better deployment of capital etc and when there 's talk about asking worker to pay more for their health care is it more as a raw dollar amount or more as a percentage of the health care costs as to defined benefit pensions personally i 'd rather have a 401k the problem with defined benefit pensions is that you 're tied to that company for life put in your 40 years and then retire with 80 pay or whatever it is leave after 4 or 5 and you 've pretty much got nothing with a 401k leave after 4 or 5 and you have what you 've put away + what the company matched

you could have both options exercised and assigned to you on the same day but i do n't think you could lose money on both on the same day the reason is that while exercises are immediate assignments are processed after the markets close at the end of each day see for details so you would get both assignments at the same time that night the net effect should be that you do n't own any stock someone would put you the stock then it 'd be called away and you do n't have the options anymore you should have incoming cash of $ 1500 selling the stock to the call and outgoing cash of $ 1300 buying from the put right so you would have no more options but $ 200 more cash in your account in the morning you bought at 13 and sold at 15 this options position is an agreement to buy at 13 and sell at 15 at someone else 's option the way you lose money is if one of the options is n't exercised while the other is i.e. if the stock is below 13 so nobody is going to opt to buy from you at 15 but they 'll sell to you at 13 or above 15 so nobody is going to opt to sell to you at 13 but they 'll buy from you at 15 you make money if neither is exercised you keep the premium you sold for or both are exercised you keep the gap between the two plus the premium having both exercised is surely rare since early exercise is rare to begin with and tends to happen when options are deep in the money so you 'd expect both to be exercised if both are deep in the money at some point having both be exercised on the same day ca n't be common but it 's maybe most likely just before expiration with minimal time value if the stock moves around quickly so both options are in the money at some point during the day

you must file as married for 2013 if you were married as of december 31 2013 it is true that the roth ira contribution phaseout for married filing separately is 0 $ 10k. but you can still do backdoor roth ira contribution contribute to a traditional ira then convert it to a roth ira assuming you do not have any pre tax iras this is identical to a roth ira contribution but you already made a roth ira contribution for 2013 and did not do the backdoor let 's assume that you want to turn it into a backdoor roth ira contribution and that you do n't have any pre tax iras there are two ways to do this withdraw the roth ira you contributed including earnings then do a normal backdoor roth ira contribution contribute to a traditional ira then immediately convert it to roth ira the earnings you had in the roth ira that you withdrew will be treated as normal income and taxed the conversion will not be taxable because all of the traditional ira was non deductible when you converted re characterize your original roth ira contribution as a traditional ira contribution then convert it to roth ira it will be treated as if you made a traditional ira contribution originally and then waited until now to convert the earnings in the ira up till now will be taxed on conversion so in both cases you will need to pay income tax on the earnings in the account up to now the difference between the two is in the amount of money in the ira now with the first way you can only contribute $ 5500 now with the second way you will keep the same amount of money you have in the ira now

what you 're getting at is the same as investing with leverage usually this comes in the form in a margin account which an investor uses to borrow money at a low interest rate invest the money and hopefully beat the interest rate   is this approach unwise that completely depends on how your investments perform and how high your loan 's interest rate is the higher your loan 's interest rate the more risky your investments will have to be in order to beat the interest rate if you can get a return which beats the interest rates of your loan then congratulations you have come out ahead and made a profit if you can keep it up you should make the minimum payment on your loan to maximize the amount of capital you can invest if not then it would be better to just use your extra cash to pay down the loan   are there really are investments aside from stocks and such that i can try to use to my advantage with interest rates as low as they are right now at least in the us you 'll probably be hard pressed to find a savings account or cd that will return a higher interest rate than your loan 's if you 're nervous about the risk associated with investing in stocks and bonds as is healthy then know that they come in a wide spectrum of risk it 's up to you to evaluate how much risk you 're willing to take on to achieve a higher return

here 's a good link that can answer your question how to take delivery of a futures contract the relevant part states prior to delivery day they inform customers who have open long positions that they must either close out the position or prepare to take delivery and pay the full value of the underlying contract by the same token traders with short positions are informed that they must close out their trades or prepare to deliver the underlying commodity in this case they must have the required quantity and quality of the deliverable commodity on hand    on the few occasions that a buyer accepts delivery against his futures contract he is usually not given the underlying commodity itself except in the case of financials but rather a receipt entitling him to fetch the wheat or corn from warehouses or distribution points i hope this helps good luck

how can they reduce the number of shares i hold they may have purchased them   you do n't say what stock it is so we can only speculate   let 's say that the stock is called penny   so they may have taken your 1600 penny shares and renamed them to 1600 shares   then they created a new $ 5 penny share and gave you shares of that in exchange for your 1600 shares   this suggests that your old shares were worth $ or less than a tenth of a cent each    as an example mylan did this in 2015 as part of their tax inversion moved official headquarters from the us to europe   they did not change the number of shares at that time but mylan is not a penny stock    this is the kind of thing that might happen in a bankruptcy    a reverse split where they give you one share in exchange for more than one share is also possible although you received an odd amount for a reverse split   usually those produce numbers   a number like sounds more like a market price as those can be bizarre

i would like to first point out that there is nothing special about a self managed investment portfolio as compared to one managed by someone else with some exceptions you can put together exactly the same investment portfolio yourself as a professional investor could put together for you not too at a lower cost and remember that cost is among the if not the best of how your investment portfolio will perform over time diversification is the concept of not putting all your eggs in one basket the idea here is that there are things that happen together because they have a common cause and by spreading your investments in ways such that not all of your investments have the same underlying risks you reduce your overall risk the technical term for risk is generally volatility meaning how much in this case the price of something fluctuates over a given period of time a stock that falls 30 one month and then climbs 40 the next month is more volatile than one that falls 3 the first month and climbs 4 the second month the former is riskier because if for some reason you need to sell when it is down you lose a larger portion of your original investment with the former stock than with the latter diversification thus is reducing between your investments generally but not necessarily in an attempt to reduce the risk of all investments moving in the same direction by the same amount at the same time you can diversify in various ways do you see where i am going with this a well portfolio will tend to have a mix of equity in your own country and a variety of other countries spread out over different types of equity company stock corporate bonds government bonds in different sectors of the economy in countries with differing growth patterns it may contain uncommon classes of investments such as precious metals a poorly diversified portfolio will likely be restricted to either some particular geographical area type of equity or investment focus on some particular sector of the economy such as medicine or vehicle manufacturers or so on the poorly diversified portfolio can do better in the short term if you time it just right and happen to pick exactly the right thing to buy or sell this is incredibly hard to do as you are basically working against everyone who gets paid to do that kind of work full time plus computer algorithm based trading which is programmed to look for any patterns it is virtually impossible to do for any real length of time thus the well diversified portfolio tends to do better over time

i 'm all in on hard silver a small portion is stored at my house for emergency expenditures and the vast majority is in a high security vault in canada that was actually the cheapest place i could find for long term storage and insurance which happened to be off shore it could turn out to be beneficial to be off shore though in the 1930s gold became illegal to privately own its very possible they could do the same this time although they did n't in 1979 oil is too high in volume to reasonably store gold is n't as undervalued as silver which i could spend a full day talking about but to sum it up in a few points there is less silver than there is gold gold has a premium for jewelry which will likely go down in a crash even though you will still see gains silver is the second most used commodity besides oil less people are in the know about it silver prices were actually higher than gold a few times in the past century simply measuring the dow in silver will show it 's further below the historical average compared to gold i 'll stop there but i could go on though on silver if people want real estate is still very expensive from the 2008 recession traditionally mortgages are $ 1.05 per dollar you would spend on renting the same property currently real estate is at like $ 1.25 + i believe it peaked at about $ i rent to save money which you can spend on other assets   if one 's willing to move to another state for lower taxes they definitely should employment is going to be harder to come by and they should get as much out of it as possible as they can if they do n't save enough they could end up just using their entire savings during the whole thing if they ca n't find a job in which case at the end you 'd never know they knew it was going to happen   overall i do n't think this crash is going to be like the great depression i do n't feel compelled to store food and buy a generator or anything i believe the living will be easier than it were to live in the 90s for those who are invested in assets everything is going to be on sale meanwhile their wealth will be increasing depending on how much they own it could be increasing faster than they need to spend it sounds like the life to me but with that said those without real assets especially the lower class will be unemployed and living on food stamps perhaps even the food stamps making more people leave the dollar and the economy this actually might not be a prediction and is what happening already but i do n't believe anybody in america at least will be starving in the 30s we had not mastered industry farming yet and we had the to make things worse    crime though i 'd own a gun the protesters are here already and i think we are just passing the half way point right now they will get   i do n't know enough about taxes to know the best country or place to store to combat taxes maybe someone else can chime in i 'm in canada to avoid high insurance and storage fees   and for careful selection of primary residence in the long haul i 'd rent a small apartment as small and cheap as possible in a safe neighborhood but not so much that a single grocery store or gas station going out of business could ruin it

if you have a deposit account like a checking account and a credit card at the same bank it is common for the bank to have a clause that lets them make automatic payments to the credit card i 've also seen this happen in the case of death where the deceased person had $ 2,000 in a checking account and owed some on a credit card    upon death the bank took the $ 2,000 and applied it to the credit card without asking

summary the corporation pays tax on dividends it receives and gets a tax refund at the same rate when it pays dividends out according to the corporate tax rates for 2015 are according to page 3 the federal and provincial tax rates shown in the tables apply to investment income    earned by a other than capital gains and dividends received from canadian    corporations the rates that apply to capital gains are one half of the rates shown in    the tables dividends received from canadian corporations are deductible in computing    regular part i tax but may be subject to part iv tax calculated at a rate of 33 1/3 if i understand that correctly this means that a corporation in quebec pays on investment income other than capital gains and dividends on capital gains and on dividends i 'm marking this answer as community wiki so anyone can correct these numbers if they are incorrect update according to page 22 the tax rate on taxable dividends received from certain canadian corporations is 33 1/3 further this is refunded to the corporation through the refundable dividend tax on hand mechanism at a rate of $ 1 for every $ 3 of taxable dividends paid my interpretation is as follows if the corporation receives $ 100 of dividends from another company it pays $ tax if that corporation then pays out $ 100 of dividends at a later time it receives a tax refund of $ meaning the original tax gets refunded note the first line is for the 2015 tax year while the second link is for the 2014 tax year the numbers might be a little different but the tax refund process remains the same

i think you are a little confused if you have 10.000 € in cash for a car but you decide instead to invest that money and take out a loan for the car at 2,75 interest you would have to withdraw sell € each month from your investment to make your loan payment if you made exactly 2,75 on your investment you would be left with 0 € in your investment when the loan was paid off   if your investment did better than 2,75 you would come out ahead and if your investment did worse than 2,75 you would have lost money on your decision having said all that i do n't recommend borrowing money to buy a car especially if you have that amount of cash set aside for the car   here are some of the reasons sometimes people feel better about spending large amounts of money if they can pay it off over time rather than spending it all at once   they tell themselves that they will come out ahead with their investments or they will be earning more later or some other story to make themselves feel better about overspending   if getting the loan is allowing you to spend more money on a car than you would spend if you were paying cash then you will not come out ahead by investing you would be better off to spend a smaller amount of money now i do n't know where you are in the world but where i come from you can not get a guaranteed investment that pays 2,75   so there will be risk involved if the next year is a bad one for your investment then your investment losses combined with your withdrawals for your car payments could empty your investment before the car is paid off   conversely by skipping the 2,75 loan and paying cash for your car you have essentially made a guaranteed 2,75 on this money comparatively speaking i do n't know what the going rate is for car loans where you are but often car dealers will give you a low loan rate in exchange for a higher sales price   as a result you might think that you can easily invest and beat the loan rate but it is a false comparison because you overpaid for the car

you probably have enough math to satisfy a program as an incoming student however gmat will matter a lot the and their equivalents are going to have more applicants with perfect and higher math backgrounds than they can take if you ca n't distinguish yourself with connections from well published professors who can write good letters for you then they 're probably out of reach which means almost surely that you wo n't get a job at an ivy or equivalent as they are pretty incestuous    basically if you go on the market without a top tier publication before you go out or without a huge endorsement from a big name your best outcome is to land at a school that is the same level as the one from which you receive your degree and you had better have at least 1 decent pub or or a presentation at a top conference with a good pipeline to hope for that   more likely outcome is you have a good job market paper decent pipeline maybe a few conference presentations but no pub or in which case the most likely outcome for you is a step down from the tier of school you were at so if you were at a flagship state program then you will end up in the second tier state programs the worse your portfolio on the market the farther you fall   so if your goal is a flagship state program then you need to be aiming as high as absolutely possible and the chances of getting into those programs are progressively smaller the higher you shoot the flagship state schools like ut and the ivy equivalents like harvard etc will get hundreds if not thousands of applicants ones with backgrounds in working finance or econ or worse i had two physics phd holders start in my cohort with me so you have no chance to compete with that kind of math and programming experience perfect and great recommendations it is very hard but you ca n't win if you do n't play i suppose i would wager that the average number of applications to programs sent by applicants is around 50 so why not aim a few of those applications high and see if anything sticks    computer language proficiency is a good thing to highlight but wo n't win you any big awards by the time you get out of your first year every student should have proficiency in either stata r sas and have some python perl c etc depending on what area of research you go for so you have a head start but not for long    your best shot to improve your chances are good recommendations from professors you know that are research active and big names in their sub fields and in the finance field as a whole next up would be to have an active interest in a research area and be able to discuss write about why you want to research that area do n't just think about it go look up papers that do that sort of research and see what they do and how they do it so that you will know the limitations of that sort of research when i interview a prospective student and they say i am interested in international finance research or any other sort of general field i know they have n't got a clue what they 're interested in which puts them behind again

aside from the averages mentioned by it may also be useful to group depositors into different categories based on account size and transaction history of deposits of withdrawals size of each etc then track how those numbers change on whatever time periods you need to capture analysts can use that to see what 's going on with outliers as well and assign profitability metrics for the different   it really helps to have the data structured in a way that allows analysts to ask these questions and retrieve them easily so the data discovery process will be helped or a lot by the maturity of the bank 's data warehouse as well as the tools used for data analysis

look at how much tax you paid last year including withholding and any additional amount that might have been due with the tax return look at the instructions for the w-4 form which sets how much tax you want your employer to withhold adjust the numbers on that form until the total withheld during the year is close to what you expect this year 's total to be remember though that there 's no penalty for over withholding but could be for under withholding submit the w-4 form to your employer   remember that we 're a few weeks into the year so even if you adjust withholding now there will have been several paychecks at the prior setting you can try to build that into your of how to reset the withholding or just not worry about it do the same with your state 's withholding adjustments form repeat on a yearly basis to account for raises changes in other income changes in filing status etc until it 's close enough that you 're satisfied with it then reconsider if when your financial situation changes personally i find that exercise more effort than it 's worth and have simply set my withholding at close enough i usually get some money back from the feds and owe some to the state but either is handled happily by my normal bank account balance

my understanding is that losses are first deductible against any capital gains you may have then against your regular income up to $ 3,000 per year   if you still have a loss after that the loss may be carried over to offset capital gains or income in subsequent years as you suspect a short term capital loss is deductible against short term capital gains and long term losses are deductible against long term gains   so taking the loss now might be beneficial from a tax perspective   i say might because there are a couple scenarios in which it either may not matter or actually be detrimental if you do n't have any short term capital gains this year but you have long term capital gains you would have to use the short term loss to offset the long term gain before you could apply it to ordinary income   so in that situation you lose out on the difference between the long term tax rate 15 and your ordinary income rate potentially higher if you keep the stock and sell it for a long term loss next year but you only have short term capital gains or no capital gains next year then you may use the long term loss to offset your short term gains first or your ordinary income    clear as mud the whole mess is outlined in irs publication 550 finally if you still think the stock is good but just want to take the tax loss you can sell the stock now to realize the loss then re buy it in 30 days   this is called tax loss harvesting   the 30 day delay is an irs requirement for being allowed to realize the loss

what you are doing is barter trade most countries if not all would tax this on assumed fair value there are instances where countries may relax this norm in border areas for a small amount    barter is not just for gold one can virtually do this for any goods i.e. sell garments in exchange for oil sell electronic chips in exchange for consumer goods etc quite a few business would flourish doing this and not exchange currency at all hence the need for government to tax on the assumed calculated derived fair value a word of caution at times this may not be fair at all and may actually cost more than had one done a transaction using currency

their high savings is n't why they have to export capital the issue is that domestic depositors do n't have access to the sky high interest rates over the last 2 decades in china there is definitely correlation between asset levels and debt   i miss typed in my previous post i meant to say that the amount of debt is overstated because wealth is high relative to income due to the high savings rate   ultimately there is n't a good answer yet to your question the seminal work which has received many updates in the last 6 years that first attempted to understand the disconnect between the ultra high interest rate in china and the high levels of capital exports is called growing like china by song and published in the american economic review in 2011   global debt according to the is of gdp so china is actually a little below average in terms of total debt to gdp and when you 're growing at a year it is okay to lever up a little bit    on top of all of this the chinese government is well aware of these issues and will almost certainly make some comments october 18th and over the next week about debt growth   this is all complicating the issue though when you have a huge supply of money to lend interest rates fall and companies take on more debt so in general you would expect savings and debt levels to move together

i 'm not a financial expert but saying that paying a $ 1 dividend will reduce the value of the stock by $ 1 sounds like awfully simple minded reasoning to me it appears to be based on the assumption that the price of a stock is equal to the value of the assets of a company divided by the total number of shares but that simply is n't true you do n't even need to do any in depth analysis to prove it just look at share prices over a few days you should easily be able to find stocks whose price varied wildly if say a company becomes the target of a federal investigation the share price will plummet the day the announcement is made did the company 's assets really disappear that day no what 's happened is that the company 's long term prospects are now in doubt or a company announces a promising new product the share price shoots up they may not have sold a single unit of the new product yet they have n't made a dollar but their future prospects now look improved many factors go into determining a stock price sure total assets is a factor but more important is anticipated future earning i think a very simple case could be made that if a stock never paid any dividends and if everyone knew it would never pay any dividends that stock is worthless the stock will never produce any profit to the owner so why should you be willing to pay anything for it one could say the value could go up and you could sell at a profit but on what basis would the value go up why would investors be willing to pay larger and larger amounts of money for an asset that produces zero income update i think i understand the source of the confusion now so let me add to my answer suppose that a company 's stock is selling for say $ 10 and to simplify the discussion let 's suppose that there is absolutely nothing affecting the value of that stock except an expected dividend the company plans to pay a dividend on a specific date of $ 1 per share this dividend is announced well in advance everyone knows that it will be paid and everyone is extremely that in fact the company really will pay it they wo n't run out of money or any such then in a pure market we would expect that as the date of that dividend approaches the price of the stock would rise until the day before the dividend is paid it is $ 11 then the day after the dividend is paid the price would fall back to $ 10 why because the person who owns the stock on the dividend day will get that $ 1 so if you bought the stock the day before the dividend the next day you would immediately receive $ 1 if without the dividend the stock is worth $ 10 then the day before the dividend the stock is worth $ 11 because you know that the next day you will get a $ 1 refund if you buy the stock the day after the dividend is paid you will not get the $ 1 it will go to the person who had the stock yesterday so the value of the stock falls back to the normal $ 10 so if you look at the value of a stock immediately after a dividend is paid yes it will be less than it was the day before by an amount equal to the dividend plus or minus all the other things that affect the value of a stock which in many cases would totally mask this effect but this does not mean that the dividend is worthless just the opposite the reason the stock price fell was precisely because the dividend has value but it only has value to the person who gets it it does me no good that you get a $ 1 dividend i want me to get the money so if i buy the stock after the dividend was paid i missed my chance so sure in the very short term a stock loses value after paying a dividend but this does not mean that dividends in general reduce the value of a stock just the opposite the price fell because it had gone up in anticipation of the dividend and is now returning to the normal level without the dividend the price would never have gone up in the first place imagine you had a company with negligible assets for example an accounting firm that rents office space so it does n't own a building its only tangible assets are some office supplies and the like so if the company liquidates it would be worth pretty much zero everybody knows that if liquidated the company would be worth zero further suppose that everyone somehow knows that this company will never ever again pay a dividend maybe federal regulators are shutting the company down because it 's products were declared hazardous or the company was built around one genius who just died etc what is the stock worth zero it is an investment that you know has a zero return why would anyone be willing to pay anything for it it 's no answer to say that you might buy the stock in the hope that the price of the stock will go up and you can sell at a profit even with no dividends why would anyone else pay anything for this stock well unless their stock certificates are pretty and people like to collect them or something like that otherwise you 're supposing that people would knowingly buy into a pyramid scheme of course in real life there are usually uncertainties if a company is dying some people may believe rightly or wrongly that there is still hope of it etc do n't confuse the value of the assets of a company with the value of its stock they are related of course all else being equal a company with a billion dollars in assets will have a higher market capitalization than a company with ten dollars in assets but you ca n't calculate the price of a company 's stock by adding up the value of all its assets subtracting liabilities and dividing by the number of shares that 's just not how it works long term the value of any stock is not the value of the assets but the net present value of the total future expected dividends subject to all sorts of

yes you 've got it right   the change in price is less meaningful as the instrument is further from the price of the underlying   as the delta moves less the gamma is much less gamma is to delta as acceleration is to speed   speed is movement relative to x and acceleration is rate of change in speed   delta is movement relative to s and gamma is the rate of change in delta delta changes quickly when it is around the money which is another way of saying gamma is higher   delta is the change of the option price relative to the change in stock price   if the strike price is near the market price then the odds of being in or out of the money could appear to be changing very quickly even going back and forth repeatedly gamma is the rate of change of the delta so these sudden in pricing are by definition the gamma   this is to some extent a little mundane and even obvious   but it 's a useful heuristic for analyzing prices and movement as well as for focusing analyst attention on different pricing aspects you 've got it right   if delta is constant zero speed for the change in price then gamma is zero zero acceleration

gt;it should n't have had to go to court   the plaintiff brought the case to court to end the ongoing extortion for others not because he needed to fight the claim it is obviously in the public domain and the judgement even said so but it is still cheaper for small time authors to pay the licensing fee than to defend from a false claim which is why the estate kept trying this stunt

money has to come from somewhere   it ca n't just appear   so if there is really an aunt at an agency and she is sending checks then she is writing checks from that company and stealing from that company   if that is the case then the person with whom you are in contact would be using you to launder money hide its illegal origin and when the aunt was caught you would be also if it is really being done between countries then it might be more difficult for them to find you but it is still illegal however it is also likely that your contact may be using a common scam as described by another answerer that of asking for money in return for a cashier 's check   although cashier 's checks were designed to be safer than regular checks in that they wo n't bounce if it is a fake cashier 's check it was never worth anything in the first place   when the bank tries to claim the cash from the other bank and finds it does n't exist or there is no record of that check then the effect is similar to that of a personal check bouncing the bank will want the money back if you have already given a portion of that money to your contact chances are when your find this out he will be long gone   i would not have anything further to do with this person good luck

mostly ditto to but let me add a couple of comments before i did anything i 'd find out more about what 's going on anytime someone tells me that there 's a problem with security codes or something i get cautious think about what the possibilities are here your relative is being scammed in that case helping him to transfer his money to the scammer is not the kind of help you really want to give despite your firm belief in your relative 's integrity he may have been by the dark side if he 's doing something illegal i 'd be very careful about getting involved my friends and relatives do n't ask me to commit crimes for them especially not in a way that leaves me holding the bag if things go wrong assuming that what is going on here is all legal and ethical still there is the possibility that you could be making yourself liable for taxes fees whatever at the very least i 'd want to know what those are up front as if he really has a problem with a lost password or expired account by all means help him fix that problem but become someone else 's financial intermediary has many possible pitfalls

md tech 's answer is correct let me only point out that there are easier ways to invest in the djia index without having to buy individual stocks you can buy a mutual fund or etf that will track the index and your return will be almost identical to the performance of the underlying index it 's almost identical because the fund will take a small management fee you will have to pay annual taxes on capital gains if you hold the investment in a taxable account and because the fund has to actually invest in the underlying stocks there will be small differences due to rounding and timing of the fund 's trades you also ask assuming that i calculated those numbers correctly is this gain    approximately better equal to or worse than an average investment    for that while people argue about the numbers index funds tend to do better than average depends on what you call average of course they do better than most actively managed funds too and since they have low management fees index funds are often considered to be an important part of a long term investment portfolio because they require very little activity on your part other than buying and holding

let 's break this into two parts the future value of the initial deposit and the future value of the payments + for the future value of the payments i adding those two formulas together will give you the amount of money that should be in your account at the end   remember to make the appropriate adjustments to interest rate and the number of payments   divide the interest rate by the number of periods in a year four for quarterly twelve for monthly and multiply the number of periods p by the same number   of course the monthly deposit amount will need to be in the same terms see also annuity finance theory wikipedia

the bank is asking for a p l because as a contractor you are in essence running your own business   its kind of a technicality all you need to do is look at any expenses that you paid out of pocket while working there that were job or business related write a list of those expenses such as gas materials legal expenses etc and then show your total income from that job or contract subtract the expenses and show your total profit or loss hence profit loss statement i realize that you may not have any real expenses tied to that job although i do n't know and if you do n't then simply write in your income say no expenses and show your profit pay at the bottom of your p l your done good luck with the closing

when you are investing for 40 years you will have taxable events before retirement   you 'll need to pay tax along the way which will eat away at your gains for example in your taxable account any dividends and capital gain distributions will need taxes paid each year   in your 401(k or ira these are not taxable until retirement in addition what happens if you want to change investments before retirement   in your taxable account taxes on the capital gains will be due at that time but in a retirement account you can change investments anytime you like without having to pay taxes early finally when you do pull money out of your 401(k at retirement it will be taxed at whatever your tax rate is at retirement   after you retire your income will probably be lower than when you were working so your tax rate might be less

depending on the details of your solar panel setup the monthly savings may change depending on changes in the law or utility company policy   this could change how long it will take for the solar panels to pay for themselves   so your bullet point about the payback even point is not fixed at the moment you buy the solar panels it depends on costs you will incur over many years and those costs could turn out to be different from what you originally thought at least in the us home solar installations typically work by selling excess power back to the power company   the power company can change the amount that it pays you for that power   there is also typically a minimum charge for being connected to the grid and the power company can raise that charge   this article mentions one such possible change   the power companies want to keep making money and as more people start adding solar panels the power companies may change their rate structure to make that less financially feasible you can avoid many of these issues if your solar panels are not connected to the public electricity grid and you for instance store power with your own battery   however at least in the us this is very uncommon because it is more complex and expensive

there are many reasons for buying stock for dividends   you are right in the sense that in theory a stock 's price will go down in value by the amount of the dividend as the amount of dividend was adding to the value of the company but now has been paid out to shareholder so now the company is worth less by the value of the dividend however in real life this may or may not happen sometimes the price will drop by less than the value of the dividend sometimes the price will drop by more than the dividend and other times the price will go up even though the stock has gone ex dividend we can say that if the price has dropped by exactly the amount of the dividend then there has been no change in the stockholders value if the price has dropped by more than the value of the dividend then there has been a drop to the stockholder 's value and if the price has gone up or dropped by less than the value of the dividend then there has been a increase to the stockholder 's value benefits of buying stocks with good dividends what you should n't do however is buy stocks solely due to the dividend be aware that if a company starts reducing its dividends it could be an early warning sign that the company may be heading into financial troubles that is why holding a stock that is dropping in price purely for its dividend can be a very dangerous practice

i think this gets at why some of us are becoming concerned about the volume or more importantly the portion of hft in capital markets these days you have algos trading based on technical trends which are increasingly just the behavior of other algos rinse and repeat at a certain point it just becomes a feedback loop   now i agree that there 's no reason to be scared of hft simply because its new or fast which is what i think threatens a lot of people but the problem is that the economic and social utility of markets arises from their being information aggregation engines if it gets to the point where most of the price action is driven by algos which are trading solely based on a few minutes of technical data no new information is being contributed to the price discovery process    now it may be that a certain amount of meta information can be discovered from pattern analysis of short term technical history but it seems to me this information is more limited in both quality and quantity compared to the information inputs of thoughtful humans acting on a reasoned analysis of economic and other world events

throughout the mid 00 's tv was filled with crappy reality shows like flip this house showing people spending an obscene amount of money on a dilapidated house then spending an obscene amount of money on it renovating it and then selling it for an obscene profit a month later   there were even shows where they would rip out new kitchens spend $ 100k on a new one and make $ 200,000 on the sale   the housing market was insane and was being pushed by realtors and mortgage companies to trick people into thinking an obscenely priced house was doable on their barely middle class income   buyer beware if prices are going up 20 a year do n't buy into it 4 years into the run and expect it to last forever

sovereign immunity is the state 's ultimate get out of bankruptcy free card   after all the state has a hand in defining what bankruptcy even is in their state   federal law is a framework states customize it from there    the state 's simplest tactic is to simply not pay you   and leave you scrambling to the courthouse for is that an automatic win   not really the state can plead sovereign immunity e.g. hans v. louisiana v. maine      you could try to pierce that sovereign immunity essentially you 'd be in federal court trying to force the state into bankruptcy   this would pit state authority against federal authority   the feds are just as likely to come in on the state 's side and you lose   best scenario it 's a knock down drag out all the way to the supreme court   you would have to be one heck of a creditor for the legal fees to be worth your trouble   states do n't make a habit of this because if they did no one would lend money to them and this would be rather bad for the economy all around   so business and government work really hard to avert it   but it always stands as their nuclear option   and you got ta know that when loaning money to states

if this is the initial transaction the rules of a short margin account say that if you shorted 1000 share of abc at $ 5/share your credit balance would be $ 5000 from the short plus you would have to put up yourself $ 5000 cash or $ 10,000 of marginal securities so this is not really leveraging using margin you have to put in just as much as the short generates is that what this relates to once the initial purchase has been made the minimum maintenance for a stock trading under $ 5 per share is 100 of the short market value in the margin account or $ 2.50 per share whichever is greater for stock trading at $ 5/share or greater the minimum maintenance requirement is $ 5/share or 30 of the short market value whichever is greater the minimum maintenance requirements can be tighter

banks want to be paid back and if you do n't then want to be able to sell your property for enough money to cover what you did n't pay back your credit rating will determine the interest rate you pay and this affects how much you can borrow because a higher interest rate means that you can borrow less on the same terms than you could with a lower interest rate paying 50 down will bring your payment way down of course and will improve everything about your loan debt to income ratio debt to equity but you 'll likely still be charged the higher interest rate based on your credit rating this of course is contingent on the property 's value properly

the following are my opinion based upon research analysis since this involves taxation rules suggest you consult a tax attorney for their views   a. yes you can transfer any any amount of dollars to your nre account without paying any additional taxes   b. since you have passed substantial presence test you will be categorized resident alien you need to disclose the interest earned on your nre account this amount will be with your total income in us you would have to add this interest income in your total income and calculate tax c. transferring money to parents answer is yes you need to elaborate on this further advantage of parking money in nre account is that you can repatriate money in dollars any time you want assuming you need to buy a house or further education this would be useful incase you do n't have any of those goals yes you can transfer money to your parent if they are in need of funds   d. any transfer above $ 14000 will attract gift taxes this $ 14000 is the overall limit for a tax payee incase you transfer $ 14000 for each parent then it comes to $ there are chances that irs may raise a that you are circumventing the limit by splitting the recipients   e. only when you transfer more than $ 14000 you need to report and pay the gift tax

answered why platinum is in demand like it is   but it missed some of the significant risks so i will address some of them   platinum is much more rare than gold   but not because there is less platinum than gold just that the known existing platinum are smaller and more disbursed   so if a large vein were found it could have a significant impact on the availability and thus reducing price of platinum   new mining technologies are being developed every day   one of these could make platinum from existing not platinum mines easier and more cost effective again increasing the availability and reducing the price of platinum the vast majority of platinum use today is for emissions controls   there is a lot of money being thrown into research on green energy and technologies   one of these technologies or a side effect of other research could result in much more cost effective ways to combat emissions   should that happen i would expect the price of platinum to fall through the floor and potentially never recover i do not think any of these scenarios are imminent but the risks that they present are so great it is important to consider them before investing

debits and credits are terms used in double entry bookkeeping each transaction is entered in two different places to be able to double check accuracy the total debits and total credits being equal is what makes the balance sheet balance for explaining debits and credits has a good example using eggs that i found helpful as a student   debits and credits   when a financial transaction is recorded the debits dr and credits cr need to balance in order to keep the accounts in balance   an easy rule to remember is debit the asset that increases   for example if you want to practice accounting for cooking a simple breakfast you might proceed as follows   to record breaking the eggs and putting the eggs in the pan   in this transaction an asset the egg is split into parts and some of the asset goes in the pan and some in the trash a debit dr is used to show that the assets in the pan and the trash both increase a balancing credit cr is used to show that the amount of assets whole eggs in the egg has decreased   this transaction is in balance because the total credits equal the total debits everything that is covered by the debits white and shell is also covered by the credits one whole egg

so are you only sexist once you do something about it if you looked at a black applicant and thought the word are you not racist just because you did n't say it and still hires him   and this is n't me trying to be thought police or a sjw despite a few accusations of that in this thread but if you automatically assume that a woman will behave a certain way just because she 's a woman how are you not sexist hiring her does n't change that    but again i find it odd that people state beliefs that are objectively discriminatory but shy away from admitting that they happen to be if you truly feel that men are better workers less prone to gossip and drama then do n't say i 'm not sexist but say i 'm sexist and this is why

in the united states the general policy is that the irs would consider it income when you have access to the money i work for a company that has a contract with another company near the end of the year i turn in a time card that has my hours that i worked as of that date because they do n't pay me until early january the money on the check is counted in the new year i could n't touch the money until they issued the check if they had paid me on december 31st it would have counted as the old year even if i only had a short window to have access to it before the year ended it would even count as old year money if i held on to the december check but did n't deposit it until march so it would become income when you could use it so if you could access it via a check or debit card or transfer it to the bank it is now income of course that is in the united states you would need to see what the situation is in singapore the edge cases always depend on the country

the only fair thing to do is to let each of you pay their own loans that way your brother will probably get out of debt faster and starts saving or investing assuming equal down payments while you 'll be stuck with your loan for a while longer if you want to minimize the interests you have to pay you could simply borrow money from your brother that way he 'll contribute towards your loans and you will know exactly how much you owe him your brother may lend you money interest free or you could agree on an interest rate which is lower than what you pay on your loans which will somewhat compensate your brother and still be beneficial to you it still wo n't be fair though because your brother might be able to invest his extra money with better interest rate and lending money to you would prevent that

i 'm surprised nobody else has suggested this yet before you start investing in stocks or bonds buy a house not just any house but the house you want to live in 20 years from now in a place where you want to live 20 years from now but you also have to be savvy about which part of the country or world you buy in i 'm also assuming that you are in the usa although my suggestion tends to apply equally anywhere in the world why simple as long as you own a house you wo n't ever have to pay rent you do have to pay taxes and maintenance of course you have a guaranteed return on investment and the best part is because it 's not money you earn but money you do n't have to spend it 's tax free even if the house loses value over time you still come out ahead and if you live abroad temporarily you can rent out the house and add the rent to your savings although that does make various things more complicated you only asked for options so that is mine i 'll add some caveats ok now here are the caveats

as a general rule you must choose between a mileage deduction or an actual expenses deduction   the idea is that the mileage deduction is supposed to cover all costs of using the car   exceptions include parking fees and tolls which can be deducted separately under either method   you explicitly can not deduct insurance costs if you claim a mileage deduction    separately you probably wo n't be able to deduct the deductible for your car as a casualty loss   you first subtract $ 100 from the deductible and then divide it by your adjusted gross income agi from your tax return   if your deductible is over 10 of your agi you can deduct it    note that even with a $ 1500 deductible you wo n't be able to deduct anything if you made more than $ 14,000 for the year   for most people the insurance deductible just is n't large enough relative to income to be tax deductible    source

you 'd need to test the assumptions here in effect you 're saying that in 15 years your account will have a balance 10x your income but normally you 'd expect your income to grow over the years e.g. promotions and so you 'd hope that your income in 15 years would be significantly larger than what it is now    but even in the case where your account eventually does grow to 10x your salary at that time it may still be worth continuing to contribute in effect adding a further 1 to your account is boosting the compounding return on your account by 1 after fees and risk free this additional 1 return in effect makes your retirement plan safer you either get a higher total return for the same investment mix or you can get the same total return for a slightly safer investment mix in effect you 're treating your salary as a safe annuity and each year putting 10 of the return from that into your more risky retirement account

that 's not the case where i 'm located techs are hired temp to hire on contract they are paid less than permanent employees they are n't given any of the benefits of permanent employees they are just as the article says treated like second class employees even third class at one company i worked for and they are along with we just are n't hiring right now lines and told we 'll extend your contract again and see if we are hiring at the end next time   i was laid off from a full time position because we were bought out by another company i spent 7 months unemployed i got a call for contract work and it only lasted two weeks i was paid significantly less than my previous full time job and was not offered any kind of benefits at all when that contract was up i was offered a contract at another company again i was paid significantly less than i was making before and i was along by that company for two years before another contract offered me more money with that contract i was finally getting paid what i was getting paid at my last permanent position but again i did not receive the same benefits as a full time employee that contract let me go after 18 months due to policy that they could n't string contractors along i was told that i could wait 6 months and be hired again though i then spent four months unemployed until i found my next contract which then hired me full time after 6 months i 've been full time for 2 years here now but who knows how long that 'll last i 've seen companies suddenly restructure which means they bring in   and i ca n't even blame this on me being a low level tech with no marketable skills i 've been in it professionally for just a few months shy of 20 years i 've done everything from technical support to security to software qa to system administration i 'm now in a job specializing in hardware i have a resume that could be pages long with many different skill sets and roles this is typical for nearly all of the contractors i know in this area i run into people i know all the time floating from company to company around here we 're passed around like disposable commodities but mention the word union and you 'll get replaced with the tech industry is shitty that way

i think you have already outlined for yourself most of the pros and cons of each method of giving it sounds to me like you have some desire to control how the money is spent or at least reserve the right not to give it to a child who will waste it according to your definition   if you set up an utma ugma account or just give the money directly each year as a birthday gift you are control of the money it 's a gift and is no longer yours to direct   if you set up a 529 you at least restrict the money to a particular useful purpose moreover if you retain ownership of the 529 you can take the money back albeit with a tax penalty to yourself   if you do hold a 529 in your name but for a child 's benefit there are a couple of things to consider with respect to future financial aid this is from recent experience my in laws have 529s for our children both of whom are currently in college a 529 not owned by the student or the student 's parent is not reported as an asset of the child or the parent on the free application for federal student aid fafsa however once such a 529 is used to pay college expenses the amount of those payments does get reported on the following year 's fafsa and counts as untaxed income for the purposes of figuring the expected family contribution efc untaxed income is assessed towards the efc at 50 in contrast parental assets are assessed at around 7 if i recall correctly and student assets at around 35 student owned 529s are assessed at the rate of parental assets which is an advantage if the amount you will set aside is less than the cost of one year of college you can avoid the disadvantage of the untaxed income assessment by just using the entire 529 for the final year of school since there will be no fafsa for the following year it occurs to me that there is one other way you can give to them that you did not mention and may make you more comfortable in terms of encouraging some positive behavior namely save the money in a self owned account then when they are old enough to get a job that provides a w-2 showing declared earned income you can use the savings to fund a traditional or roth ira for them up to the limit allowed each year until the money you set aside is exhausted the roth is a better long term savings vehicle but the traditional would carry bigger penalties for early withdrawal and would therefore be less tempting to draw on

you have actually asked several questions so i think what i 'll do is give you an intuition about risk neutral pricing to get you started   then i think the answer to many of your questions will become clear physical probability there is some probability of every event out there actually occurring including the price of a stock going up   that 's what we call the physical probability   it 's very intuitive but not directly useful for finding the price of something because price is not the weighted average of future outcomes    for example if you have a stock that is highly correlated with the market and has 50 chance of being worth $ 20 dollars tomorrow and a 50 chance of being worth $ 10 it 's value today is not $ 15   it will be worth less because it 's a risky stock and must earn a premium   when you are dealing with physical probabilities if you want to compute value you have to take the probability weighted average of all the prices it could have tomorrow and then add in some kind of compensation for risk which may be hard to compute risk neutral probability finance theory has shown that instead of computing values this way we can embed risk compensation into our probabilities   that is we can create a new set up probabilities by adjusting the probability of good market outcomes downward and increasing the probability of bad market outcomes   this may sound crazy because these probabilities are no longer physical but it has the desirable property that we then use this set of probabilities to price of every asset out there all of them equity options bonds savings accounts etc   we call these adjusted probabilities that risk neutral probabilities   when i say price i mean that you can multiply every outcome by its risk neutral probability and discount at the risk free rate to find its correct price     to be clear we have changed the probability of the market going up and down not our probability of a particular stock moving independent of the market   because moves that are independent of the market do not affect prices we do n't have to adjust the probabilities of them happening in order to get risk neutral probabilities anyway the best way to think of risk neutral probabilities is as a set of bogus probabilities that consistently give the correct price of every asset in the economy without having to add a risk premium if we just take the risk neutral probability weighted average of all outcomes and discount at the risk free rate we get the price   very handy if you have them risk neutral pricing we ca n't get risk neutral probabilities from research about how likely a stock is to actually go up or down   that would be the physical probability   instead we can figure out the risk neutral probabilities from prices if a stock has only two possible prices tomorrow u and d and the risk neutral probability of u is q then price = + the exponential there is just discounting by the risk free rate   this is the beginning of the equations you have mentioned   the main thing to remember is that q is not the physical probability it 's the risk neutral one   i ca n't emphasize that enough   if you have what u and d can be then there is only one unknown in that equation q. that means you can look at the stock price and solve for the risk neutral probability of the stock going up    the reason this is useful is that you can same risk neutral probability to price the associated option   in the case of the option you do n't know its price today yet but you do know how much money it will be worth if the stock moves up or down   use those values and the risk neutral probability you computed from the stock to compute the option 's price   that 's what 's going on here   to remember the same risk neutral probability measure prices everything out there   that is if you choose an asset multiply each possibly outcome by its risk neutral probability and discount at the risk free rate you get its price   in general we use prices of things we know to infer things about the risk neutral probability measure in order to get prices we do not know

you can do on both market and limit orders normal market orders will partial fill if you want more shares than are being offered or if someone pulled their order before you get there and now there are fewer shares than you placed a trade for with a limit order not at the you are shooting in the dark for a quick match most of the time it does not fill   this is a commonly used order type for arbitrage   some exchanges will not attempt to cross it for a match if its price is not at or better than the market price when the limit order is at the it is essentially a market order    fyi sometimes you have a minimum quantity to fill option so you can let the order sit on the book until it fills or you cancel

paying $ 12,000 in lump annually will mean a difference of about $ 250 in interest vs. paying $ 1,000 monthly if front load the big payment that saves over paying monthly over the year if you planned to save that money each month and pay it at the end then it would cost you more in mortgage interest so that 's how much money you would have to make with that saved money to offset the cost over the life of the loan the choice between the two equates to less than $ 5,000 if you pay monthly it 's easy to calculate that an extra $ 1,000/month would reduce the loan to 17 years 3 months that would give you a savings of at the cost of paying $ extra during those 17 years many people would suggest that you invest the money instead because the annual growth rates of the stock market are well in excess of your mortgage what you decide is up to you and how conservative your investing strategy is

this is precisely the problem   economic contraction scared people   so instead of continuing making promises they started paying off the promises they had for fear that something in the future would make it so they could n't   this resulted in increased economic contraction because it became more difficult to trade money for service because people basically valued paying off debt more than the service   the biggest issue is that neither position is wrong yet they do n't work well together   people paying off debt is fine so long as there is money for services and people paying for service is fine so long as they do n't rack up more debt than they can pay   really it 's the transitions that always get us   further these transitions are constantly repeated which is why the economic data so often displays patterns

i think you are mixing up the likelihood of making a profit with the amount of profit the likelyhood of profit will be the same because if you buy $ 100 worth of shares and the price moves up you will make a profit if you instead bought $ 1000 worth of the same shares at the same price and the price moved up you would once again make a profit in fact if you do n't include commissions and other fees and you buy and sell at the same prices you percentage profit would be the same   for example if you bought at $ 10 and sold at $ 12 you percentage gain of 20 would be the same no matter how many shares you bought not including commissions so if you bought $ 100 worth your gain would have been 20 or $ 20 and if you bought $ 1000 worth your gain would have been 20 or $ 200 however if you include commissions say $ 10 in and $ 10 out your net profit on $ 100 would have been $ 0 0 and your net profit on $ 1000 would have been $ 180 18

first please allow me to recommend that you do not try when financials do give expected results   it 's a sure path to disaster and illegality   the best route is to first check if accounts are being properly booked   if they are then there is most likely a problem with the business   anything out of bounds yet properly booked is indeed the problem now the reason why your results seem strange is because investments are being improperly booked as inventory therefore the current account is badly from the industry mean the dividing line for distinguishing between current and long term assets is one year although modern financial accounting theorists regulators have tried to that line so standards do not always adhere to that line therefore any for resale should be booked as inventory while those for as investment   it 's been some time since i 've looked at the standards closely but this used to fall under property plant equipment   generally it is a capital expenditure by the oldest definition    it is not necessary to obsess over initial bookings because inventory turnover will quickly resolve itself so a simple running or historical rate can be applied to the purchases the books will now appear more normal and better subsequent strategic decisions can now be made

so they basically tried to make their antiquated methods faster rather than improve their methods   okay   not what i would have done   and apparently they are n’t advertising their improvements well either   what i do n’t see in that document is the percentage of people making less or more in all so i ca n’t tell if large numbers of people on one side or another are skewing the average in a direction nationally or in the government itself   those numbers would give us the whole picture rather than a distorted picture   also it seems the average wage is only $ 3.00 hour higher so that ’s something   your socialist universal price tells you are definitely seeing with distorted glasses   let it go for a little bit not to change your mind but to verify you are seeing as clearly as possible   they keep the wages basically equal across the u.s. because they are a nation wide entity that has to be internally self consistent

there is no fixed formulae its more of how much you can negotiate vs how many others are willing to work at a lower cost typically in software industry the rates for part time work would be roughly in the range of 1.5 to 2 times that of the full time work for the same job with the above premise roughly the company would be willing to pay $ 100,000 for 2000 hrs of part time translating into around $ 50 per hour how much you actually get would depend on if there is someone else who can work for less say at $ 30 at hour 1 the company does not have 2000 hrs of work and hence its engaging part time worker instead of full time at lesser cost

i would add to this that while everyone is right on trading there are certain special situations you could look into that could turn a profit in a relatively short time frame one month say    a recent example is realty finance i bought in at $ prior to a spinoff sold half the spinoff company at $ within a month and the other half the reit has since paid a 50 cent dividend and gone up to mid $ as well within a total of just over 2 months this admittedly sounds like bragging which is n't i just want to give an example of a short term position resulting in a gain and i do n't know any off the top of my head except the one i did recently    this is n't trading but it is a short term position that would have turned a profit with $ 1800 i still would n't recommend it considering commissions eats a sizable portion but if you want to take short term positions you do n't need as much as you would to be a day trader    i would read seth klarman 's margin of safety the sections on spinoffs and bankruptcy they provide some useful information on some short term positions however also be aware that you should be willing to hold any short term position as a long term position if it does not immediately work out by way of example i believed would go up post spinoff but the spinoff company stay the same instead stayed the same and the spinoff went up but was undervalued so i held it for another month    just my advice as far as learning use play money but if you never are going to have enough money to really trade with hopefully my info on short term positions is helpful

it 's a problem from hell because all solutions have drawbacks unintended consequences and because they are all pretty complex to implement in practice   breaking up the big banks so that no bank is enough to bring down the economy with it is the strongest move but is riddled with problems when you start looking at it practically how do you determine the maximum size a bank should have should it be based on assets systemic importance i.e. interconnectedness with other banks how do you enforce it banks will find ways to offload assets etc into special purpose corporations to get around the laws somehow how do you compensate for the fact that size does help financial efficiency in some ways   imposing higher capital requirements is the next solution but that too is not so easy to implement with full success in practice what should be classified as a low risk asset how much capital do you require against a cdo vs a mexican government bond how often do you need to revise these standards at what point does the cost of higher capital requirements start to strangle lending and financial flows   the weaker maneuvers are things like constant government imposed stress tests orderly resolution mechanisms higher standards for internal risk management practices etc but those may not be adequate and also have their implementation problems

what you are looking for is travel insurance i have never heard of this being offered as a credit card perk but there might be something out there   you can buy this separately but only you can decide if it is worth the costs to me it would seem to only be worth it for something quite expensive like a cruise that costs thousands of dollars the more you travel the less likely it is to be worth it since at some point the cost of one canceled trip is less than the insurance paid on the rest of the trips that went through fine as a frequent i recommend that you build some flexibility into your plans especially during the winter it is not always possible but try not to need to be somewhere the day of or the day after your flight   try to book flights early in the day as they are less likely to be delayed by problems in flights before them and you have more options for flight delays due to weather and mechanical problems are not uncommon and with generally full flights it is sometimes hard to be in a reasonable amount of time   finally be nice to the gate agents and other airline   in general they are n't any happier about delays than you are flight crews want to get home too and do n't have any power over weather or mechanical delays   being rude to them will not help and will make them less likely to go out of their way to find a solution be in asking for what you want but a smile and a kind word goes a long way

gt;we were on the gold standard in name only since about 1910   there a few nuances behind the gold standard but all revolve around indebtedness and currency devaluation    the us actually started off in with a silver standard by the turn of the 18th century there was a fixed ratio of silver and gold to dollars silver was not required to back all of the currency gold was used as well    this bi metallic standard continued until gold and silver were legal tender    the us treasury was on a strict hard money standard doing business in only gold and silver until which the federal government from the banking system it was only after this move the federal government started the devaluation of silver in order to borrow from england silver came in gold came out this also largely the gold rush    then in the us started reducing the weight of silver coins in banks suspended payment in silver   but the basic weakness in a gold standard started with government wanting to manipulate value to unfairly skew debt loan situations    gt;there was not enough gold to remotely back the us currency   this is not true us currency did just fine and as governments print so too do prices go up so if there is only 50 billion currency units in and eggs cost 10 cents as they did for previous decades when the federal government prints its way to trillions that s where we end up with eggs costing 2 3 bucks that 's why your grandparents house cost 6,000 and ones today cost 600,000    gt;which is why during the great depression when people started wanting to turn their cash back in to gold there was no enough   no they turned back to gold because of the devaluation of the dollar if the dollar was falling as it is today why would you want to keep your assets in dollars gold can not be printed at whim this is one of the most important factors it forces government to be much more strict with debt if taxpayers were faced with higher taxes or devaluation to pay for the current iraq wars would it have happened no but since the government could print money at whim it served as an invisible tax    gt;and gold possession had to be outlawed    it was outlawed because as the dollar plummeted and gold was eventually made illegal the value of gold doubled and rapidly increased overnight this happened again in 1970 when nixon took us off the gold standard gold was made illegal to prevent hoarders and you make it sound like gold redemption is a bad thing when really its the government being naughty and citizens simply playing the game and by the rules set up by the government    gt;so no we were not on a gold standard   yeah i never said we were but there is a very important   reason we once were so government could nt devalue currency to rack up more debt a huge issue that has now played out to its logical conclusion maximum indebtedness mixed with massive mechanisms for manipulation   when you 're on a any fixed item standard your economy only can grow at roughly the rate you fond more of the fixed item    is that why the us did just fine between and 1913 over a hundred years the cost of many items was stable for decades nowadays we have a doubling effect with cars costing 4,000 in 1970 26,000 in 2000 45,000 in 2012 the same with houses food education medical services you name it   gt;there are many reasons for this and it is partially why for thousands of years of various gold standard there was so little economic growth once countries stopped limiting the amount of total economic growth to the amount of gold they could dig up that economies were able to grow at the sustained rate they have for the past years   wrong again this is because of productivity from technology and invention oil electricity automobiles airplanes and eventually computers infact as i said above fiat currency actually kills productivity    its hard to compare the turn of the century but we can see what happened after nixon took us off the gold standard here      as soon as the usa left the gold exchange standard   total factor productivity began to dramatically stagnate   the gold exchange standard was a free lunch for policymakers gdp growth could be achieved without any real gains in productivity or efficiency or in infrastructure but instead by just pumping money into the system   the gold exchange standard was a free lunch for businesses revenue growth could be achieved without any real gains in productivity or efficiency   gt;so besides the fact that the us has not in modern history been backed by gold despite the name there is ample evidence from hundreds of economies and thousands of years that being on a gold standard = little or no economic growth   since nixon took us off the gold standard in terms of dollar connection in anyway to gold the value of the dollar has plummeted 70 its over 95 if you go back to the early 1900s and currency debasement    there was plenty of economic growth while we were on the gold standard and to say otherwise is simply false

i 've done exactly what you are describing and it was a great move for me a few years back i had two credit cards one had a $ 6000 balance and a fairly high interest rate that i was making steady payments to including interest   the other was actually tied to a heloc home equity line of credit whose interest rate was fixed to prime which was very low at the time i think my effective rate on the card was around 3   so i pulled out one of the cash advance checks from the heloc account and paid off the $ 6000 balance then i started making my monthly payments against the balance on the heloc and paid it off a bit more quickly and with less overall money spent because i was paying way less interest another similar tactic is to find a card that does n't charge fees for balance transfers and that has a 0 interest rate for the first 12 months on transferred balances i am pretty sure they are out there open an account on that card transfer the balance to it and pay it down within 12 months and try not to use the card for anything else if you can help it

you already got good answers on why you ca n't buy a toyota from the factory but my answer is regarding to the implied second part of your question how to avoid haggling i found a good way to avoid the haggling at a car dealership can be simply to not haggle go in with a different attitude the main reason car dealers list inflated prices and then haggle is that they expect the customers to haggle it is fundamentally based on distrust on both sides treat the sales person as your advisor your business partner as somebody you trust as an expert in his field and you 'll be surprised how the experience changes of course make sure that the trust is justified sales reps have a fine line to walk of course they like to sell a car for more money but they also do not want a reputation of overcharging customers they 'd rather you recommend them to your friends and post good reviews on yelp in the end all reputable dealers effectively have a fixed price policy or close to it even those who do n't advertise it and even for used cars haggling just the process to get there and sales reps are people often people who hate the haggling part of their job as much as you do i was in the market for a new used car a few months ago in the end it was between two cars one of them a toyota both from the brand name dealer 's respective used car lots in both cases i went in knowing in advance what the car 's fair market value was and what i was willing to pay as well as details about the car mileage condition etc thanks to the internet both cars were marked significantly higher as soon as the sales rep realized that i was n't even trying to haggle the price dropped to the fair value i did n't even have to ask for it the rep even offered some extras thrown into the deal things i had n't even asked for things like towing my old car to the junk yard

shop around for a bank that offers lower no fees for this operation and move your account there   or yes change where the direct deposit is routed or move these accounts into a single bank so it 's an internal transfer rather than ach or ask the bank whether there is another way to arrange this which does n't cost you money it costs me nothing to move money within my credit union whether manually or on a scheduled basis it costs me nothing to have them send funds to another entity from my checking account specific example pay comes into my savings account on the 27th an automatic transfer moves the cost of a mortgage payment from savings to checking on the 30th an automatic payment sends that to my mortgage in another bank no fees on any of this 100 reliable

as noted above this is likely going to need several lawyers to straighten out   i am not a lawyer but i think one should be retained asap however in the meantime the authorized user should not be making any charges   continuing to do so at this point may be a criminal offense   for the protection of any other heirs this should be brought to the attention of the credit card issuer and law enforcement authorities   as it stands the account holder 's estate will be liable for the full debt and the authorized user 's estate would be untouched    of course all this could change if other heirs challenge the estate and file civil suits in which case it 's likely that both estates will be eaten up with legal fees anyway

with new cars it 's usually the other way around finance at a low apr or get cash back when you buy it outright with used cars you usually do n't know how much they have invested in the car so it 's more difficult to know how low they 're willing to go regardless i do think it 's odd that they would knock 2 k off the price if you finance with them but not if you pay cash the only reason they would do that is if they intend to make at least 2 k in interest over the life of the loan but they have no way of guaranteeing you wo n't refi therefore i suspect they are and would probably close the deal if you wrote them a check or put the cash on the table for 2 k less however if they wo n't budge and will only knock off 2 k if you finance you could finance and pay it off in full a week later just make sure they do n't have any hidden origination fees or pay off early fees

it 's not a ponzi scheme and it does create value i think you are confusing creating value and producing something the stock market does create value but not in the same way as toyota creates value by making a car the stock market does not produce anything the main way money enters the stock market is through investors investing and taking money out    the only other cash flow is in through dividends and out when businesses go public     the stock market goes up only when more people invest in it although the stock market keeps tabs on businesses the profits of businesses do not actually flow into the stock market earnings are the in flow that you are missing here business profits do flow back into the stock market through earnings and dividends think about a private company if it has $ 100,000 in profits for the year then the company keeps $ 100,000 but if that same company is publicly traded with   100,000 shares outstanding then all else being equal each of those shares went up by $ 1 when you buy stock it is claimed that you own a small portion of the company this statement has no backing as you can not exchange your stock for the company 's assets you ca n't go to an apple store and try to pay with a stock certificate but that does n't mean the certificate does n't have value using your agriculture example you would n't be able to pay with a basket of tomatoes either you would n't even be able to pay with a lump of gold we used to do that it was called the barter system   companies also do buy shares back from the market using company cash although they usually do it through clearing houses that are capable of moving blocks of 1,000 shares at a time

in the absence of a country designation where the mutual fund is registered the question can not be fully answered   for us mutual funds the per share is calculated each day after the close of the stock exchanges and all purchase and redemption requests received that day are transacted at this share price so the price of the mutual fund shares for april 2016 is not enough information you need to specify the date more accurately your calculation of what you get from the mutual fund is incorrect because in the us declared mutual fund dividends are net of the expense ratio if the declared dividend is us$ per share you get a cash payout of us$ for each share that you own the expense ratio has already been subtracted before the declared dividend is calculated   the price of the mutual fund also falls by the amount of the per share dividend assuming that the price of all the fund assets e.g. shares of stocks bonds etc does not change that day thus if you have opted to re invest your dividend in the same fund your holding has the same value as before but you own more shares of the mutual fund which have a lower price per share for exchange traded funds the rules are slightly different in other jurisdictions the rules might be different too

i understand that itm have little time value so they will have small time but why otm has a lesser theta than atm the time value represents uncertainty   that uncertainty decreases the farther away from atm you get in either direction   at the money there is roughly a 50 chance that the option expires worthless as you get deeper in the money the change that is expires worthless decreases so there is less uncertainty there is more certainty that the option will pay off   as you go deeper otm the probability that the option expires worthless increases so there is also less uncertainty at the ttm decreases the uncertainty theta decreases as well since there is less time for the option to cross the strike from either direction   similarly as volatility decreases theta decreases since low volatility stocks have a less change of crossing the strike

a is a concession stand which happens to show movies in order to lure you into range of the smell of their popcorn it has nothing to do with movie theater monopolies   as it was explained to me by my manager back when i worked in a movie theater in a small chain for every movie the studios take some percentage cut of gross ticket sales varying from movie to movie   star wars the phantom in 1999 was the first film for which the studio demanded 90 of gross ticket price continuing a long standing trend of raising the take which possibly began with the original first star wars movie   the other studios quickly followed suit and raised their take to 90 especially for the big the textbook term is oligopoly pricing and since then the percentage has ever closer to 100   i forget exactly what it was on the second matrix movie or lord of the rings return of the king both of which while i was at the theater but the number that sticks in my head is 94   obviously the studios ca n't directly capture any revenue from the sale of popcorn unlike the movie it 's not their product so every time they raise their take the theater compensates for lost revenue by raising the price of popcorn this trend has n't reversed with 3d and and all the new technologies coming down the   the only reason they 're attractive to the theaters is that the theater can charge $ 15 a ticket rather than $ 10   even on a small percentage share that 's a 50 jump in revenue and covers the not insignificant cost of the projection equipment   3d is also currently getting more butts in seats than was leading to somewhat more concessions sales going to the movies is an and an event again though that 's off as it becomes less and less of a novelty   the ticket prices are n't coming down though moral of the story like razors or printers theaters lose a ton of money to show you movies due to studio oligopoly pricing and make it up on popcorn

most banks offer a college card that has low limits so you can start building credit another good option is to get a rewards credit card and do your everyday spending on it then immediately turn around and pay it i have seen people that just overpay their credit card just to use it like a debit card all while earning credit and getting rewarded for it   i work for a bank so i see this alot

there are ways to avoid having federal income taxes withheld   in order to avoid withholding altogether you ’ll have to fall into    both of the following categories you have no tax liability this year    and you had no tax liability in the previous tax season so all of the    federal income tax you paid was given back to you generally you can    say you have no tax liability when you ’re not required to file an    income tax return or you owe zero taxes you may also be able to claim    an exemption if your earned income for the year is extremely low    $ or less if those conditions apply to you you can write exempt in line 7    keep in mind that the exemption only eliminates your federal income    taxes not your medicare or social security if your parents use an accountant to prepare their taxes i 'm sure he she would be able to give you a solid answer on how to fill it out

if you are calculating simple roi the answer is straightforward math   see this answer for some examples but yes with more leverage you will always see better roi on a property if you can maintain a positive cash flow   the most complete answer is to factor in your total risk that high roi of a leveraged property is far more volatile and sensitive to any unexpected expenses additionally a loss of equity in the property or an upside down mortgage will further impact your long term position to put this more simply as noted in the comments below your losses will be amplified you can not say a leveraged property will always give you a better roi because you can not predict your losses

see anyone who is n't heavy finance which truthfully is a good 80 of the business will be fine with the transition my issue is how to support the remaining 20 of advanced excel users to attempt to find other hopefully better ways to view and change the same data we 've had these talks several times over with the technology transformation team and the main takeaway is   most users misuse excel as a work around tool to address messy data reports so for these processes they want us to determine if the data could come out clean and could run the desired analytics on the data straight out of the source then would there be a need for excel   for some models like monte carlo etc i believe those ones are going to have exceptions but do you think it is understandable and feasible to attempt to remove all the of excel and instead work towards a better way to accomplish the same goal because i do find that a good amount of spreadsheet work is sometimes just cleaning up the report data output before the real excel magic happens

if the correction results in you owing them money you typically just need to pay them the appropriate amount i believe they charge back dated interest on the amount if it was supposed to have been paid in the past but if it 's for this year 's taxes then payment is n't due until the end of april and so interest would not apply in some circumstances they may apply fines or press charges for tax evasion but only if they have reason to believe you intentionally knowingly attempted to your tax return in order to avoid paying taxes you can challenge their decision to fine you but you are considered guilty until proven innocent obviously that 's the opposite for any criminal charges the good news is lots of people accidentally enter the wrong numbers and the cra is aware of this and rarely takes action against them other than making them pay what they owe they have ways to look for suspicious behavior and differentiate that from innocent mistakes so do n't worry you should be fine not fined

if you know the amounts that were combined $ 5,000 and $ 7,500 in your example not the original loan amounts necessarily then you can calculate a payment schedule in excel google sheets online etc using that amount and the interest rate   you can then apply your payments $ 100 to that payment schedule making sure to either accrue interest if your $ 100 did n't cover the monthly payment or pay down extra principal if your $ 100 more than covered the payment    the outstanding principal is the amount left or remaining balance a program like gnucash or quicken makes doing the payment schedule and applying payments relatively easy to handle   spreadsheets will require you to have 36 lines 3 years x 12 months of payment and detail but that should n't be too much work to be fair to your mother make sure you include any partially accrued interest on the full balance when paying it off   or even better include a full month 's interest in the pay off amount

capital surplus is used to account for that amount which a firm raises in excess of the par value nominal value of the shares common stock investopedia has a much simpler answer somebody has tried to be smart on wikipedia and have done the calculations without much explanation the portion of the surplus of a business arising from sources other than earnings   all surplus other than earned surplus usually including amounts received from sale or exchange of capital stock in excess of par or stated value profits on resale of treasury stock donations to capital by stockholders or others or increment arising from revaluation of fixed or other assets the number of shares a company wants to issue is decided and agreed with the regulators they decide the par value and then decide how much premium will be charged extra money above the par value take out any of an issue and you find all these details par value = 1   issue at which investors buy = 10 premium = 9 for a single share the capital surplus is 9 multiply it by the number of shares issued and you have the total capital surplus

since you mention bounced checks in the beginning of your piece it 's worth mentioning that bounced checks can land you in prison depending on various circumstances    in this case it 's because you 're committing a fraud namely offering someone a piece of paper and claiming it 's worth $ 500 or whatever when it 's really worthless because you do n't have the funds   simply owing a debt is not considered criminal but payment that is not actually valid is considered defrauding the person you are trying to pay this check fraud information site discusses the different penalties in each state as this is primarily covered by laws at the state level   it is never until you have repaid the check of course it is in most states a < = 1 year in jail though some states do make it a felony for larger amounts or repeat violations   these penalties are also typically at the judge 's discretion and in many cases you are only fined some states have a minimum dollar amount for it to be a criminal offense most seem to be around $ 500 or so though there is quite a lot of variability some real world examples of this include former nba player walker and former nfl player porter

you pay tax on the entire amount not just the capital gains    when cashing out such a plan you would pay the top marginal tax rate on the full amount plus another 10 in penalties   it is very likely that the additional income of the balance withdrawal will increase your top marginal rate    it is impossible to come up with a precise answer as we do n't know the following however you can take a concept away from this that is important   you will be taxed and penalized on the entire 401 k balance not just the capital gain    in the best case scenario that is you had little or no income in a given year   under current tax law you would owe about 31 of your 401 k balance in taxes   as this is such an inefficient use of money most authors recommend against it except in the case of extreme circumstances

the united states taxes nonresident aliens on two types of income first a nonresident alien who is engaged in a trade or business in the united states is taxed on income that is effectively connected with that trade or business second certain types of u.s source payments are subject to income tax withholding the determination of when a nonresident alien is engaged in a u.s. trade or business is highly fact specific and complex however keeping assets in a u.s. bank account should not be treated as a u.s. trade or business a nonresident alien 's interest income is generally subject to u.s. federal income tax withholding at a rate of 30 percent under section of the tax code interest on bank deposits however benefit from an exception under section so long as that interest is not effectively connected with a u.s. trade or business even though no tax needs to be withheld on interest on a bank deposit the bank should still report that interest each year to the irs on form the irs can then send that information to the tax authority in brazil please keep in mind that state and local tax rules are all different and whether interest on the bank deposits is subject to state or local tax will depend on which state the bank is in also the united states does tax nonresident aliens on wages paid from a u.s. company if those wages are treated as u.s source income generally wages are u.s source income if the employee provides services while physically present in the united states there are a few exceptions to this rule but they depend on the amount of wages and other factors that are specific to the employee 's situation   this is an area where you should really consult with a u.s. tax advisor before the employment starts maybe your company will pay for it

realize this is almost a year old but i just wanted to comment on something in answer above   whenever you trade always think about what the other guys is thinking sometimes we forget their is someone else on the other side of my trade that thinks essentially the exact opposite of me its a zero sum game from a market maker 's perspective their primary goal is not necessarily to make money by you being wrong it is to make money on the bid offer spread and hedging their book and potentially that being said the market maker would likely be quoting one side of the market away from top of the book if they do n't want to take exposure in that direction i.e. their bid will be lower than the highest bid available or their offer higher than the lowest offer available this is n't really going to change anything if you 're trading on an exchange but important to consider if you can only see the prices your broker dealer provides to you and they are your counterparty in the trade

is the weather he said of changes in the markets it goes up and down this and that and that ’s 80 of what you guys focus on   said financial journalists would be better off concentrating on the bad policies that are hurting average americans   he 's right it is however he 's mistaken about what would be best for financial journalists they are n't really interested in what 's best for america their jobs demand that they publish content and they believe that the easiest and best way to publish lots of content in a consistent manner is to focus on short sighted topics    anywhere you see people trying to feed the 24 hour media cycle you see this problem emerge it 's difficult to blame them they got ta feed their families afterall   we do n't need this 24/7 flood of news if every media outlet published on a weekly basis or less they could focus on more important stories and they could take more time to investigate them their audience could focus on their own lives and themselves it would be a win win but that 's not what we have   because americans are fools   does anyone remember what sort of role jp morgan had during the housing collapse however was this guy their ceo back then i 'm not forgiving any of them for that faux pas and neither should anyone else it 's difficult to take seriously criticism coming from the most crooked industry in the world at the end of the day money does n't really matter what matters is that people 's needs are met both needs for survival and recreation in their greedy thirst for the second the employees at all the major banks destroyed the lives of many people who were simply struggling to meet the first not cool

everything here is yours and can be rolled into your new plan or ira you can generally move your 403(b assets into your traditional ira or into your new employer 's plans assuming your new employer 's plan allowing incoming roll overs   you can probably roll your pension out as well actually the right person to ask about this is the company with whom you have your ira   the easiest and best way to get assets from one tax sheltered account to another is by contacting the company you want to roll into and having them take care of everything for you

they 're not just giving away money because they 're nice they 're doing what they think or hope is a good business decision even if they lost money on that particular transaction there are still positive effects such as op telling the story about how great bestbuy is which will get more people in their stores many of which wo n't be as rigorous in their price checking or will possibly buy other items once they 're in the store   you ca n't look at one sale in a vacuum to make a determination like that

i suspect that to make money it is n't enough to know the current value high currency to make money you 'd need to know guess predict bet on the future change in value will the currency value go higher in the future or will it come down again or will it stay the same everybody knows the current value so that by itself is n't enough knowledge to make money from that said if you know you 're going to need american dollars in the future if you have future expenses which need to be paid in american dollars then now might be a good time to buy those dollars

i made a throwaway for this    i work in it for the government i was tasked with finding a vendor that provided a particular kind of software my bosses expected it would take me 4 6 months to source out companies go through all the paperwork and process to work with them try to get them to understand what we need and them aid them in implementing their software on our stack    well that seemed like an enormous waste of time and ridiculously boring so instead i wrote the software on my own time over the course of 4 months built a subscription model around it and incorporated a company i 've since sold the subscription based model to a number of other government bodies and clients the government body i work for has around 250 employees and i recently sold a subscription to a peer government body with over 1500 employees    i built a free subscription tier that my current company uses so that i 'm not taking any payment from them to avoid any conflicts of interest and built the entire project on my own time and resources    the funny thing is the software product i built easily beat out all the competitors in blind tests and no one that i work for could ever imagine that i am capable of even being employed by such a company forget building the whole stack and founding the company in fact all of upper management has been impressed with the software i found and how well it has worked there has been a ton of positive feedback on it since it was launched    i 'm basically just sitting on this project that is mostly self sustaining until i can just cash out which should be quite soon    edit to the people warning me what i 'm doing is illegal a few key points     1 the public sector ca n't legally profit from anything my job is to limit cost not make a profit which leads to     2 i 'm not charging the government body i work for it 's a free implementation devoid of contract i also ensured i do all the work on my own time not company time i live somewhere where most government employees work multiple jobs so this is n't uncommon in fact my government body actually does often hire contractors who are also employed so not only did i create the service on my own time i gave it to my employer for free other companies pay of course     3 i do n't live in the us things are different where i am it is certainly not illegal and i would even argue that given this is the public sector it is even somewhat ethical my work saved my employer the tax payer a significant amount of money which is a net positive the service is of high quality and i did not break any employment agreements or laws in the process      4 i hired a lawyer to double check everything      5 i absolutely am not in any way using any proprietary information for profit i 'm not even using my contacts through work as leverage for sales everything so far has been cold calls and positive references from other clients this was a key part of the project

i think you have to go back to this without prosperity to really understand   tldr buybacks boost ceo pay and hurt the long term value of companies but i 'm not convinced that they 're the root of inequality    consider the companies in the s&amp;p 500 index that were publicly listed from 2003 through 2012 during that period those companies used 54 of their earnings a total of $ 2.4 trillion to buy back their own stock almost all through purchases on the open market dividends absorbed an additional 37 of their earnings that left very little for investments in productive capabilities or higher incomes for employees   why are such massive resources being devoted to stock repurchases corporate executives give several reasons which i will discuss later but none of them has close to the explanatory power of this simple truth stock based instruments make up the majority of their pay and in the short term buybacks drive up stock prices   trillions of dollars that could have been spent on innovation and job creation in the u.s. economy over the past three decades have instead been used to buy back shares for what is effectively stock price manipulation   most are now done on the open market and my research shows that they often come at the expense of investment in productive capabilities and consequently are n’t great for long term shareholders   research by the academic industry research network a nonprofit i and lead shows that companies that do buybacks never resell the shares at higher prices   many academics have warned that if u.s. companies do n’t start investing much more in research and manufacturing capabilities they can not expect to remain competitive in a range of advanced technology industries   specific examples   pharmaceutical drugs   in response to complaints that u.s. drug prices are at least twice those in any other country pfizer and other u.s. pharmaceutical companies have argued that the profits from these high prices enabled by a generous intellectual property regime and lax price regulation permit more r&amp;d to be done in the united states than elsewhere yet from 2003 through 2012 pfizer funneled an amount equal to 71 of its profits into buybacks and an amount equal to 75 of its profits into dividends in other words it spent more on buybacks and dividends than it earned and tapped its capital reserves to help fund them the reality is americans pay high drug prices so that major pharmaceutical companies can boost their stock prices and pad executive pay     intel executives have long lobbied the u.s. government to increase spending on research in 2005 intel ’s then ceo craig r. argued that it will take a massive coordinated u.s. research effort involving academia industry and state and federal governments to ensure that america continues to be the world leader in information technology yet from 2001 when the u.s. government launched the national initiative through 2013 intel ’s expenditures on buybacks were almost four times the total budget

i 've been a member for over 15 years and do most of my shopping there   but it is n't a myth   while some items are singles normal such as clothing many are larger bulk   the price per unit is a heck of a lot lower as a result but the price is still higher   for example ketchup is a 1.25 kg two pack while my local supermarket sells them as smaller singles   toilet paper is twice the price of a local target but you get almost 4 times as much   bacon comes as a two pack of a pound each one pack at supermarket   milk comes as two one gallon containers   fruit and vegetables come in containers that are typically twice the size of my local supermarket   bleach comes in a huge box containing 3 large containers   comes in a two pound bag local supermarket is 1 lb pound bags at their largest   halloween candy comes in huge bags the local supermarket has some that big but the vast majority are a lot smaller   bread is in two packs local supermarket is a one pack   the chicken is a single just like my local supermarket and is cheaper   costco is undoubtedly value for money but a typical family shopping list will cost more upfront and then last longer   but not everyone can afford the membership and higher initial investment

you would need to look at all aspects current rate of interest in us compare to china current exchange rate and the rate in future when you want the money back any tax regulatory implications of keeping the money in us any regulations that may hamper your access to these funds    if you are planning to stay in china and at some point in time want to get the money back in my opinion it would make more sense to do it today like you are doing rather than take the risk of exchange rate and regulations further the current low risk returns in us are near zero the inflation in us is of no concern to you on the other hand you have a decent return in china      if you know that at some point in future you would need usd either moving to us or large purchase in usd then it would make sense to keep the funds in usd

p e is a pretty poor way to value the company as it exists today   the company generates free cash flow yield of 2.5 3.3 which is n't remarkably high but it 's not nearly as bad as the earnings yield of 1.1   but let 's operate within the p e ratio for right now   the company sells $ 40 billion of stuff each year with a net margin of 2   if they increased prices on every product by 1 which really would n't be that noticeable their profit would grow 50   thus p e drops from 90 to 60     sga expenses equal ~20 of their operating costs   cut 5 of sga and you get the same 1 increase in net margin   this could come from cost cutting today or by greater economies of scale in the future while keeping prices the same     so yes it 's priced as a growth firm but it does n't necessarily need customer growth in the traditional sense to be fairly valued

taxation is only theft if you believe that you are the owner of the money the government collects as a tax   i argue that the concept of ownership only has meaning in the context of what property rights your fellow man is willing to respect   if like me you believe that taxes are a financial obligation that you must pay to participate in society then the government has every right to collect those taxes from you   i 'm sure you can imagine a set of rules by which the money actually belongs to you but if you 're the only one who wants to play by those rules those rules do n't matter a hell of a lot

fred is correct most financial advisors but not all are paid either for managing your assets or for selling you financial products but success at anything especially building wealth is all about process not products i applaud your desire to find a financial advisor to help you because this is not something that most people have the education experience or capacity to do themselves it is impossible to get the perspective you need to make the best choices start with a certified financial planner professional they have an ethical duty to do what is in your best interests ahead of their own the fiduciary standard   you might interview two or three   work with the one who is transparent about how they are paid and whose process is focused on helping you achieve your goals not following any rule of thumb or standard boilerplate   your goals are different   your financial life is different find someone who can help you follow your agenda not their own

you 're misunderstanding the concept of retirement savings ira distributions are taxed in their entirety as ordinary income if you withdraw before the retirement age additional 10 penalty is added investment income has preferential treatment long term capital gains and qualified dividends are taxed at lower rates than ordinary income however ira contributions are tax deductible i.e. you do n't pay taxes on the amounts contributed to the ira when you earned the money only when you withdraw in the mean time the money is growing tax free based on your investments anything inside the ira is tax free including dividends distributions from funds to your ira not from ira to you capital gains etc this is very powerful when taking into account the compounding effect of reinvesting your dividends sale proceeds without taking a chunk out for taxes consider you make an investment in a fund that appreciated 100 in half a year you cash out to reinvest in something less volatile to lock the gains in a regular account you pay taxes when you sell based on your brackets in the ira you reinvest all of your sale proceeds that would be ~25 35 more of the gains to reinvest and continue working for you however if you decide to withdraw you pay ordinary rate taxes on the whole amount if you would invest in a single fund for 30 years in a regular account you 'd pay 20 capital gains tax on the appreciation not the dividends in the ira if you invest in the same fund for the same period you 'll pay your ordinary income rates however the benefit of reinvesting dividends tax free the blow somewhat but that 's much harder to quantify bottom line if you want to plan for retirement plan for retirment otherwise ira is not an investment vehicle also consider roth ira conversions roth ira has the benefit of tax free distributions at retirement if your current tax bracket is at 20 for example contributing $ 5 k to roth ira instead of a traditional will cost you $ 1 k of taxes now but will save you all the taxes during the retirement for the distributions from the roth ira it may be very much worth your while especially if you can contribute directly to roth ira there are some income limitations and you can withdraw contributions but not earnings from roth ira something you can not do with a traditional ira

would they go up at all perhaps that 's not unreasonable but not proportionally    if the minimum wage goes up some workers might choose to move out from living with relatives or roommates so there would be some increase in demand but we would n't be overflowing with potential   and if rents started going up these new entrants to the housing market would likely fallback on their original housing setup with would moderate the impact    as far as gas goes while i do n't have specific numbers in front of me   i think it 's a reasonable assumption that us labor costs are a relatively small percentage of what you pay at the pump so even if those costs went up you would n't expect prices to surge

generally the paperwork realtors use is pre written and pre approved by the relevant state and real estate organizations the offers contracts etc etc a pretty straightforward and standard you can ask a realtor for a small fee to arrange the documents for you smaller than the usual 5 sellers fee they charge i would say 0.5 or a couple of hundreds of dollars flat fee would be enough for the work you can try and get these forms yourself sometimes you can buy them in the neighborhood staples or from various law firms and legal plans that sell standard docs you can get a lawyer to go over it with you for almost nothing i used the legalzoom plan for documentation review and it cost me $ 30 business plan individual is cheaper to go over several purchase contracts $ 30 is a monthly subscription but you do n't have to pay it for more than one month but these are standard so you do it once and you know how to read them all if you have a legal plan from work this may cover document review and preparation preparing a contract that is not a standard template can otherwise cost you hundreds of dollars title company will not do any paperwork for you except for the deed itself they can arrange the deed and the recording escrow and title insurance but they will not write a contract for the parties to use you have to come with the contract already in place and with escrow instructions already agreed upon some jurisdictions require using a lawyer in a real estate transaction if you 're in a jurisdiction usually on a county level that requires the transaction to go through a lawyer then the costs will be higher

my opinion including the value of depreciating property one owns in a net worth calculation is silly but could be interesting you do n't expect your tv or laptop to gain value   instead you expect them to decrease in value every year until you replace them   anything you expect to hold or increase in value art a house etc is a different story if you 'd like to really get anal about this you can track your net worth like a business would track its balance sheet   i 'm not going to go into detail but the general idea is that when you purchase an item you debit the cost from cash and add the value paid to assets so your net worth does n't change when you make a purchase    you then depreciate the value of the item under assets according to a depreciation schedule   if you plan on replacing your laptop every three years you might subtract 33 of the value every year    this could be an interesting exercise i.e. even if you make money your net worth may decrease because of all the depreciating junk you own but my hunch is that it would n't be worth the effort it requires

there are of course many possible financial emergencies they range from large medical expenses to losing your job to being sued to major home or car repairs to who knows what i suppose some people are in a position where the chances that they will face any sort of financial emergency are remote if you live in a country with national health insurance and there is near zero chance that you will have any need to go outside this system you are living with your parents and they are equipped to handle any home repairs you ride the bus or subway and do n't own a car so that 's not an issue etc etc maybe there just is n't any likely scenario where you 'd suddenly need cash i can think of all sorts of scenarios that might affect me i 'm trying to put my kids through college so if i lost my job even if unemployment benefits were adequate to live on they would n't pay for college i have terrible health insurance so big medical bills could cost me a lot i have an old car so it could break down any time and need expensive repairs or even have to be replaced i might suddenly be charged with a crime that i did n't commit and need a lawyer to defend me etc so in a very real sense everyone 's situation is different on the other hand no matter how carefully you think it out it 's always possible that you will get bitten by something that you did n't think of by definition you ca n't make a list of unforeseen problems that might affect you so no matter how safe you think you are it 's always good to have some emergency fund just in case how much is very hard to say

gt that there are more jobs today is n't a convincing argument   you yourself said that automation means there is a net loss in jobs   if that were true there would be less jobs now than in 1900   but the opposite is true   products are more efficiently reaching the consumer   this means more people are buying more things   this means producers have to hire more people or buy more raw materials   lets go with a real classic example   lets say that you and myself make sewing needles   we both do it by hand because in this example we are at the dawn of the industrial revolution making a needle at a time   now lets say i figure out a way to make a machine that makes 100 needles in the time it took me to make 1 and because less of my time is going into each needle i can sell them cheaper   i am now able to reach more stores than before to sell my sewing needles   i have to hire some more people to make deliveries because i can only do so much by myself   now i also grow to the point of having to buy another machine because my business is booming   people love my sewing needles   but i ca n't man 2 machines so i hire in another person   now i have more people making deliveries and i no longer deliver myself because i am better at making needles than delivering them   the guys supplying me with the metal to make the needles also had to hire some people to keep up with my demand   and the people mining the metal for my needles also had to hire another miner   this may sound like a made up story but this sort of thing was going on at this time     the argument that automation kills jobs has been around since before the industrial revolution   how much would your cell phone be if we were still using horse and cart to deliver goods   would your mother sister girlfriend wife yourself if you are a girl be able to have a full time job if they did not have a washing machine iron vacuum cleaner other appliances   what kind of selection in the grocery store would you have if the tractor was never used

ex date is a function of the exchange as well as the dividend consider deutsche bank ag db on the nyse on xetra for a given dividend each exchange sets the ex date for trades on that exchange   see for a description of how it works in the us other exchanges countries are similar this ex date is normally based on the dividends record date which is when you must be on the company 's books as a shareholder to receive the dividend and based on when trades for an exchange are settled the ex date is the first date for which trades on that date will not settle until after the record date this means that the ex date can be different for different exchanges if you sell your shares on an exchange before the ex date for that exchange you will not get the dividend if you sell your shares on or after the ex date for the exchange you do not get the dividend so it depends on the time zone of the exchange most stock exchanges trade t+3 but this can still come into play if there are bank holidays in different countries at different times

do n't underestimate the impact of stealing from your retirement   if your retirement account growth averages 9 you 're effectively borrowing from the account at 9 interest   look at how long it will take you to pay back the retirement account and calculate how much interest you 're paying on that money at 9    if it takes you 3 years to pay yourself back you will have lost over $ 3,000 in opportunity cost compared to $ 1,300 in interest on a 4 loan if you do n't pay yourself back because of extra expenses that come with home ownership over 35 years the opportunity cost of the 10,000 you withdrew is over $ 230,000

that 's tricky actually first as the section 1015 that you 've referred to in your other question says you take the lowest of the fair market value or the actual donor basis why is it important consider these examples so if the relative bought you a brand new car and you 're the first title holder i.e. the relative paid but the car was registered directly to you you can argue that the basis is the actual money paid in essence you got a money gift that you used to purchase the car if however the relative bought the car took the title and then drove it 5 miles to your house and signed the title over to you the irs can argue that the car basis is the fmv which is lower because it is now a used car that you got you 're the second owner that may be a significant difference just by driving off the lot the car can lose 10 15 of its value if you got a car that 's used and the donor gives it to you your basis is the fair market value unless its higher than the donor 's basis in which case you get the donor 's basis you always get the lowest basis for losses and depreciation is akin to a loss now consider the situation when your relative is a business owner and used the car for business he did n't take the depreciation but he was entitled to irs can argue that the fact that he did n't take is irrelevant and reduce the donor 's basis by the allowable depreciation that may bring your loss basis to below the fmv i suggest you take it to a tax professional licensed in your state who will check all the facts and circumstances of your situation your relative might be slapped with a gift tax as well if the car fmv is above certain amount currently the exemption is $ 14000

fortunately this can be solved by simply going to the website unfortunately the website is not very well designed so it took a while to find it however looking at the section about entering your own meter reading in it is clear that this is indeed a credit meaning they owe you money   notice how the costs break down   they estimated an energy usage cost equivalent of £ which resulted in a bill of £ credit   then the customer entered a meter reading which resulted in an actual energy usage cost equivalent of £   since it was £ higher it went from a credit to a debit of £    were £ credit to mean money was owed to they would owe a bit over £ 68 instead given the higher energy charges you can see this help page to inquire about getting a refund or simply allow this to carry over to your next bill   or consider doing a self entered meter reading if one has n't been done recently to make sure that any actual excessive usage comes out of your credit rather than being a shock at one time

in my mind when looking at a five year period you have a number of options you did n't specify where you are based which admittedly makes it harder to give you good advice if you are looking for an investment that can achieve large gains equities are impossible to ignore by investing in an index fund or other diverse asset forms such as mutual funds your risk is relatively minimal however there has historically been five year periods where you would lose your money if this was to be the case you would likely be better off waiting more than five years to buy a house which would be frustrating when markets rebound they often do it hard if you are in a major economy taking something like the top 100 of your stock market is a safe bet although admittedly you would have made terrible returns if you invested in the polish markets while they often achieve lower returns than equity investments they are generally considered safer especially government issued bonds if you were willing to sacrifice returns for safety you must always consider them   this is an interesting new addition and i ca n't comment on the state of it in the united states however in europe we have a number of platforms which do this in the uk for example you can achieve returns yoy using sites like funding circle if you invest in a diverse range of businesses you have minimal risk from and individual company not paying elsewhere in europe although not appropriate for me as everything i do is denominated in sterling you can secure 12 in places like georgia poland and estonia this is a very good rate and the platforms seem reputable and guarantee their loans however unlike funding circle they are for consumer loans the risk profile in my mind is similar to that of equities but it is hard to say whatever you do you need to do your homework and ensure that you can handle the level of risk offered by the investments you make i have n't included things like savings accounts in here as the rates are n't worth bothering with

if you 're refinancing a conforming fannie mae or freddie mac mortgage do n't go with an fha try a harp refinance which wo n't increase your mortgage insurance even if your home has lost value harp also limits the risk based pricing adjustments that can be charged so your rate should be very competitive with an fha mortgage even once you get the loan to value ratio down to 80 percent you still have mortgage insurance for several years plus the upfront costs in your case i think it 's a bad deal

if you and your parents both put up money to buy a house or anything else what share each of you owns would be a subject for negotiation and agreement between you to the best of my knowledge there is no law that says if person x pays the down payment and person y pays the monthly payments than x owns 40 and y owns 60 or any other specific numbers parents often give their children money to help with a down payment on a house or a car with the understanding that this is a gift and the child still owns 100 of the item other times they are unwilling or unable to just give the money and want some stake in exchange in the case of a house or a car there 's a title that identifies the owner and legally the owner is the person or people named on the title i 'd suggest that if you want to have split ownership like if your parents are saying that they 'll help with the down payment but they want to get that money back when you sell or some such that you come up with a written agreement saying who owns what percentage and you both sign it if there was a dispute if you never had an agreement about what share each owned and now you 're selling the house and you 're arguing over how much of the money each of you should get or your parents want you to sell the house so they can get their money back but you do n't want to sell or whatever ultimately a court would decide presumably the judge would consider how much you had each paid in but he might also consider who 's been paying property taxes how much work each has done to maintain the place etc it 's better to have a written and signed agreement something that everyone involved is satisfied with and where you all know exactly what you 're agreeing to rather than having a nasty surprise when a judge says no you 're not getting what you were assuming you were getting
