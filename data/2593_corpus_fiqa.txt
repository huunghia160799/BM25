credit unions turn a profit by lending money at a higher interest rate than their savings do just like banks do it is an amoral feat completely parallel to any moral weights you have assigned to the system if the most favorable circumstance is you receiving access to capital then you can easily achieve that with zero reservations about the system that granted it to you

credit unions require you to open an account because of their history a credit union is just that a union only instead of a union of workers collectively bargaining for better pay or worker 's comp they are lending each other money they are chartered to offer their services to members of the union rather than the public at large   for that reason credit unions historically had targeted niche memberships ie employees at a specific company or property with a specific hobby such as fishing most credit unions these days attempt to skirt the issue by claiming to serve members of a specific geographic area anyway membership is defined a owning a stake in the union which is usually termed a share by opening the account and purchasing a share you are becoming both an owner and member of the union and are eligible for their services that 's why the account is required before you can have a loan

nope   credit unions are for the customers   since the customers own them the credit union does what is best for the members   they are n't giving you money they are loaning it to you for for interest   furthermore then judged you like any other bank would high horse moment i believe the only reason you have to open an account is because the banking industry did n't want to compete and got legislation to limit the size and reach of a credit union    the credit union wants your business and they want to work for you but they are required to have these membership requirements because their lobby is n't as powerful as regular banks

you need to run awareness campaign on facebook even something like $ can have a huge impact on letting people know you exist then post frequently at least 1 daily picture of something for sale in the shop    second collect emails at the counter a simple pen and paper list works surprisingly well get a free email account and email coupons once a week in the beginning you 'll want strong offers as you are building the list do n't waste peoples time with lame or no offers come hard with a huge coupon or they will after the first email this might cost you some money but do n't think of it as selling something for a loss think of it as a marketing expense   try groupon you are desperate this is where desperate local businesses go make a smart offer limit how they can spend it i would suggest focusing it on the cold brew as that has enough margin   partner with local coffee cup cake shops pretty much any one who will have you and give them free shelf space and get them to market to their facebook ig twitter followers about your location and that they can buy stuff there also this is huge and you can capitalize your local market   finally get over the attitude of no one supports local people do n't owe your mom their business just because she 's local she has to compete on price service and selection just like anyone else even amazon so reevaluate your prices your profit margins and start talking to the customers to see what they want in the store

if you have zero activity on a card the issuing bank may decide to close that card they have some costs each month and if you are n't using the card they are n't making money off of you your inactivity is also a risk because if you lost the card and do n't realize it and it falls into the wrong hands then it can be used for fraudulent transactions in their view it might already have been if they close your account that can hurt your score your utilization number will go up and the age of your accounts could go down they want you to use their card so they make money on the transaction fees and hopefully interest payments

for an investment to appreciate in value one of two things needs to happen 1 demand for that particular item needs to increase 2 the supply of that item needs to decrease houses are good because everyone needs a place to live but there is a finite amount of land   no matter how much you invest in real estate ai n't   the trick there is to find an area that people are going to want to live in when you 're ready to sell   specific of wines and spirits are another good example because it 's literally impossible to create more of that vintage cars and most consumer goods usually do n't appreciate because they do n't last long enough   most cars are resold within three to five years after the initial purchase   this is also why jewelry is a good investment properly cared for it can last centuries without wearing out so look for something durable that has a limited supply

we 've had everything in one pot almost from day one of marriage the key ingredients to making that arrangement work is to communicate about the money and realize that you 're in it together   everything one person does affects the other separating finances the affecting one another part and makes it a little clearer perhaps but i can also see it creating a sense of entitlement this is my money   there should be a place for individual discretionary spending of course but i 'm not sure that off that money is the best way to do it it 's less likely to be viable if there 's one main in the house   in our house this is me   if we separated the finances like this it would amount to giving my wife an allowance   since she works harder at home than i do at work most of the time she keeps the house does meals and shopping raises and schools our daughter etc but just does n't get paid for it it would border on insult to her to treat the finances this way

i recently was offered $ raise i turned it down because had been looking for other jobs and the extra $ 150 per month was n't enough money to keep me from exploring other options so it would look bad to take a raise and leave a month later you never want to burn bridges 2 raises are n't given out everyday the business i work for is having financial troubles and the $ was probably the best they could do at the time if business picks up and they can afford to give me more money they wo n't do it because the record will show that i just got a raise   one good extra is that your boss will be that you just turned down a raise and you may gain a lot of respect from your superiors do n't confuse strategically turning down a raise and letting others sway your opinion because they do n't wanna cough up the cash

taxing wealth is an easy idea but i do n't think it can ever work wealth is too easily hidden transformed or taxing actual cash flows works because two parties have to declare it taxing wealth would cause huge conflicts as to how wealth is measured that said i 'm a big fan of the idea that the estate tax should be massively increased and would only involve a single evaluation per taxpayer rather than every year taxing more measurable forms of wealth like stocks would cause wealth to flow from stocks into property which would then be valued as low as possible causing a general market crash and another great depression   i 'm most curious about a tax scheme which is where taxes are levied on un improved property per wikipedia based on the belief that people should own the value they produce themselves but that the economic value derived from land including natural resources should belong equally to all members of society    so most taxes in society would be generated by those who owned property as a speculation and did n't invest in it incentives would be to make all property held privately be as economically productive as possible
# 536580
ah i got ya i partially agree with you but it 's far more complex i think that is simplifying the debate a bit too much when people go passive you are making the assumption that they are able to stay fully invested the full time period say 30 40 years until retirement when you might change the asset allocation this is not a fair assumption because many studies on behavioral finance have shown that people 90 plus are not able to sit tight through a full market cycle and often sell out during a bear market i 'm not debating you 're point that passive often outperforms due to the fees although there are many managers that do outperform but the main issue with self managing and passive investing is people usually make emotional decisions which then hurts their long term performance this would be the reason to hire an adviser assuming that people are able to stay passive the entire time and not make a single active decision is a very unfair assumption there was a good study on this referenced in forbes article below   another issue is that there are a lot active managers that really just replicate their benchmarks and do n't actually actively manage if you look at active managers who really do have huge under weights and over weights relative to their benchmarks they actually tend to outperform them look at the study below by martin he 's one of the most highly respected researchers when it comes to investment performance research and the active vs passive debate     i guess what i 'm trying to say is that for most people having an adviser and paying them a 1 fee is usually better than going it alone where they are going to a. chase heat i bet they always choose the hottest benchmark from the past few years and b. make poor emotional decisions relating their finances

i 'm not an attorney nor am i a licensed tax adviser i suggest you talk to these two types of professionals from my limited knowledge without proper documentation organization i ca n't see how the irs state will not consider this as a rent payment the mortgage responsibility is of the person signing the mortgage contract and you 're under no obligation to pay that person anything had you not lived at the property you might argue that it was a gift although i 'm not sure if it would stand but since you do live in the property it is quite obviously a rent payment putting your name on the deed may mitigate this slightly but i 'm not sure how much since you 're still not obligated to pay the mortgage however this is probably moot since it is unlikely for a bank to give a mortgage on a property to person a when it is also owned by a person b without that person b being side to the mortgage contract

the problem with your math is that your assumptions are all sorts of fucked up you have him living in a 700 sqft apartment in but paying $ 1400 in indianapolis i live here $ 1400 in indy is enough to rent a 3 bedroom house or a 3 bedroom luxury apartment downtown and a front end dev is n't going to be making 70 k in indy with 5 years experience that 's the average of salaried employees in indy web developers make more my friend 's starting job out of a no name local college here was with 5 years experience you can find a job paying a lot more than that your salary scale is automatically going to be skewed since tech pays more and a greater percentage of the population is going to be in tech in sf than indy the dude would probably be making more like 90k if he was competent and paying $ 500 a month for a 700 sqft apartment if he had some money for a down payment for $ 1400 a month he could afford the mortgage of like a 300 k house and could actually be putting that money into an investment rather than sinking that money into rent good luck buying a house in sf for less than 1m. but for sport let 's assume he does n't buy a home and is renting a small apartment so he is now paying only $ 6000 a year for housing and is making 20 k more than your estimate which after taxes is like what at least 16 k in take home money plus the 11 k he is paying less in rent than you assumed so he is actually making 27 k more than you are assuming in your math and now instead of making 20 k less a year than he would in sf he is making 7 k more again if he was smart and bought a house which is n't possible for 99 of people in sf the monetary gain is n't even close   and do n't get me started on the perks of california people from cali all seem to be under the assumption that things like nature restaurants and entertainment only exist in california

having savings only in your home currency is relatively low risk compared with other types of low diversification this is because in a simple case your future cash outflows will be in your home currency so if the gbp fluctuates in value it will theoretically still buy you the same goods at home in this way keeping your savings in the same currency as your future expenditures creates a natural hedge against currency fluctuation this gets complicated for goods imported from other countries where base price fluctuates based on a foreign currency or for situations where you expect to incur significant foreign currency expenditures retirement elsewhere etc in such cases you no longer have certainty that your future expenditures will be based on the gbp and saving money in other currencies may make more sense in many circumstances diversification of the currency of your savings may actually increase your risk not decrease it be sure you are doing this for a specific reason with a specific strategy and not just to generally spread your money around even in case of a brexit consider what would you do with a bank account full of usd if the answer is convert it back to gbp when needed in 6 months 5 years 30 etc to buy british goods then i would n't call this a way to reduce your risk instead i would call it a type of investment with its own set of risks associated

maximizing income could mean a lot of things   what you really want is to maximize wealth   does n't matter if it comes from your bond appreciating in value or as dividends in order to maximize your wealth that 's today 's wealth you need to make decisions based on the net present value of these bonds the market is fairly priced especially for a tight market like government bonds   that means if your bond falls in price it has fallen by precisely the amount necessary so that an investor would be indifferent between purchasing it now at its current price and purchasing a new bond with a higher dividend   the bonds with higher dividends will simply have a higher price so more of the money comes as dividends than as price appreciation at maturity it will sell for face value   in other words the animals are out of the barn and you have lost or made money already   changing from one bond to another will not change your wealth one way or the other the only potential effect of changing bonds will be changing the risk of your portfolio   if you buy a bond that matures later or has a lower dividend than your current bond you will be adding additional interest rate risk to your portfolio   that risk should be compensated so you will have a higher expected return as well   but regardless of your choice you will not be made wealthier or less wealthy by changing from one bond to another should you buy bonds that will earn you the most possible   sure if you are below your risk tolerance   even among default free bonds the longer the maturity and the lower the dividend the greater the effect of future changes in interest rates on your bond   that makes them riskier but also makes them earn more money on average tl;dr in terms of your wealth which is what matters it does n't matter whether you hold your bond or buy a new one

current evidence is that after you subtract their commission and the additional trading costs actively managed funds average no better than index funds maybe not as well you can afford to take more risks at your age assuming that it will be a long time before you need these funds but i would suggest that means putting a high percentage of your investments in small cap and large cap stock indexes i 'd suggest 10 in bonds maybe more just because maintaining that balance automatically encourages buy low sell high as the market cycles as you get older and closer to needing a large chunk of the money for a house or after retirement you would move progressively more of that to other categories such as bonds to help safeguard your earnings   some folks will say this an overly conservative approach on the other hand it requires almost zero effort and has netted me an average 10 return or so claims quicken over the past two decades and that average includes the dot bomb and the great recession past results are not a guarantee of future performance of course but the point is that it can work quite well enough

there 's two scenarios the loan accrues interest on the remaining balance or the total interest was computed ahead of time and your payments were averaged over x years so your payments are always the same the second scenarios is better for the bank so guess what you probably have in the first scenario i would pay it off to avoid paying interest unless there is a compelling reason to keep the cash available for something else and you do n't mind paying interest in the second case you 're going to pay interest over x years as computed when you bought the car no matter how quickly you pay it off so take your time if you pay it earlier it 's like paying interest that would not have actually accrued since you 're paying it off faster than necessary if you pay it off i 'm not sure if it would close the account your credit history might show the account as being paid which is a good thing

real estate is all local in the united states i can show you houses so high the rent on them is less than 1/3 of their value per month eg $ 1 m house renting for less than $ 3500 i can also find 3 unit buildings for say $ 200 k that rent for $ total rents i might want to live in that house but buy the to rent out you need to find what makes sense and not buy out of impulse   a house to live in and a house to invest have two different sets of criteria they may overlap but if the strict price rent were universal there would be no variation if you clarify your goal the answers will be far more valuable

the chinese corporate sector does n't really have a crazy amount of debt compared to developed countries and households even less what people are concerned about is how quickly it is rising not the actual amount and also the structure of the debt and how much of it is n't captured and reported   but to answer your question the two factors you mention are positively correlated not negatively as you postulate the more assets you have the higher the odds you are able to repay and the more debt lenders are willing to give you but debt tends to be measured relative to income not wealth and this is another reason chinese household wealth may be overstated

currency hedge means that you are somewhat protected from movements in currency as your investment is in gold not currency so this then becomes less speculative and concentrates more on your intended investment   edit the purpose of the etf is aimed for investors living in europe wanting to invest in usd gold and not be effected by movements in the eur usd the etf aims to hedge against the effects of the currency movements in the eur usd and more closely track the usd gold price the 3 charts below demonstrate this over the past 5 years     so as is demonstrated the performance of the etf closely matches the performance of the usd gold price rather than the eur gold price meaning someone in europe can invest in the fund and get the appropriate similar performance as investing directly into the usd gold without being affected by currency exchange when changing back to eur this is by no way speculative as the op suggests but is in fact serving the purpose as per the etf details

this is business as usual except that you need to keep in mind that the corporate entity is separate from the individual as such all the background checks and references should be with regards to the actual renter the corporation you should be cautious as it is not so easy to dissolve an individual well not as easy and certainly not as legal as it is to dissolve the corporation so you may end up with a tenant who does n't pay and does n't have to pay because the actual renter the corporation no longer exists so check the corporation background age credit worthiness tax returns business activity judgements against etc etc as you would do for an individual

i think you are aiming your crony capitalism shotgun in the wrong direction   oil industry subsidies dwarf those to the ev and the bailouts to the us car manufacturers was the clearest example you could imagine of picking winners and losers     far worse both the car manufacturers and oil industry represent the entrenched interests which are fighting the future changes in the industry as opposed to the other way around   the money went directly to the companies involved without a lick of good capitalist competition   now compare that to a personal ev tax credit   1 you encourage the clearly visible future of cheap electrical power and driverless evs 2 you set up the subsidy as a personal tax break to the buyer so any company is free to up their game and make better products to win part of it   3 its a much smaller amount and much more cost effective per tax dollar than giant checks to monster oil companies   once the government stops amounts of money into oil and traditional car companies then it might be time to at saving taxpayer money spent on evs

google is a poor example since it does n't pay a dividend and does n't expect to so let 's use another example with easy numbers company x has a stock price of $ 100 and it pays a quarterly dividend many companies do let 's assume x pays a dividend of $ 4 dividends are always quoted in annual terms as is dividend yield when a company says that they pay quarterly dividends it means that the company pays dividends every quarter or every 3 months   but if a company has a $ 4 dividend you will not receive $ 4 every quarter per share you will receive $ = $ 1 per share every quarter so over the course of a fiscal year or 4 quarters you 'll get $ 1 + $ 1 + $ 1 + $ 1 = $ 4 per share which is the annual dividend   the dividend yield = annual dividend stock price so in this case company x 's div yield will be $ 100 = 4 it 's important to note that this is the annual yield to get the quarterly yield you must divide by 4 it 's also important to note that the yield fluctuates based on stock price but the dividend payment stays constant unless the company states an announcement for a real world example consider intel corp. ticker intc the share price is currently $ and the dividend is $ this makes the annual yield = $ 100 = intel pays a quarterly dividend so you can expect to receive $ every quarter for every share of intel that you own hope that clears it up

some stocks do fall to zero i do n't have statistics handy but i 'd guess that a majority of all the companies ever started are now bankrupt and worth zero even if a company does not go bankrupt there is no guarantee that it 's value will increase forever even in a general overall sense you might buy a stock when it is at or near its peak and then it loses value and never it even if a stock will go back up you ca n't know for certain that it will suppose you bought a stock for $ 10 and it 's now at $ 5 if you sell you lose half your money but if you hold on it might go back up and you make a profit or it might continue going down and you lose even more perhaps your entire investment a rational person might decide to sell now and cut his losses of course i 'm sure many investors have had the experience of selling a stock at a loss and then seeing the price skyrocket but there have also been plenty of investors who decided to hold on only to lose more money just a couple of weeks ago a stock i bought for $ 1.50 was selling for $ 14 i could have sold for like 900 profit instead i decided to hold on and see if it went yet higher it 's now at $ 2.50 fortunately i only invested something like $ 800 if it goes to zero it will be annoying but not ruin me on a bigger scale if you invest in a variety of stocks and hold on to them for a long period of time the chance that you will lose money is small the stock market as a whole has consistently gone up in the long term but the chance is not zero and a key phrase is in the long term if you need the money today the fact that the market will probably go back up within a few months or a year or so may not help

this is really an extended comment on the last paragraph of 's answer when the manager of a mutual fund sells securities that the fund holds for a profit or receives dividends stock dividends bond interest etc the fund has the option of paying taxes on that money at corporate rates and distributing the rest to shareholders in the fund or passing on the entire amount categorized as dividends qualified dividends net short term capital gains and net long term capital gains to the shareholders who then pay taxes on the money that they receive at their own respective tax rates if the net gains are negative i.e. losses they are not passed on to the shareholders see the last paragraph below   a shareholder does n't have to reinvest the distribution amount into the mutual fund the option of receiving the money as cash always exists as does the option of investing the distribution into a different mutual fund in the same family e.g. invest the distributions from vanguard 's s&p 500 index fund into vanguard 's total bond index fund and/or vice versa this last can be done without needing a brokerage account but doing it across fund families will require the money to transit through a brokerage account or a personal account such cross transfers can be helpful in reducing the amounts of money being transferred in re balancing asset allocations as is recommended be done once or twice a year those investing in load funds instead of no load funds should keep in mind that several load funds waive the load for re investment of distributions but some funds do n't the sales charge for the reinvestment is pure profit for the fund if the fund was purchased directly or passed on to the brokerage if the fund was purchased through a brokerage account as ben points out a shareholder in a mutual fund must pay taxes in the appropriate categories on the distributions   from the fund even though no actual cash has been received because the entire distribution has been reinvested it is worth keeping in mind that when the mutual fund declares a distribution say $ a share the net asset value per share drops by the same amount assuming no change in the prices of the securities that the fund holds and the new shares issued are at this lower price that is there is no change in the value of the investment if you had $ 10,000 in the fund the day before the distribution was declared you still have $ 10,000 after the distribution is declared but you own more shares in the fund than you had previously in actuality the new shares appear in your account a couple of days later not immediately when the distribution is declared   in short a distribution   from a mutual fund that is re invested leads to no change in your net assets but does increase your tax liability ditto for a distribution that is taken as cash or re invested elsewhere as a final remark net capital losses inside a mutual fund are not distributed to shareholders but are retained within the fund to be written off against future capital gains see also this previous answer   or this one

almost all companies in the us have changed from formal pension programs to 401k plans and most companies that still have pension programs do n't allow new employees to   enroll in the new program only the previous participants who are vested in the pension plan will get benefits while new employees get enrolled in the 401k plan if this is the case with   your prospective employer then demanding that you be allowed to enroll in the pension plan is likely to be futile in fact the likely response may well be here is our offer take it or leave it or we are withdrawing   the offer we made especially if you are in a field where there are plenty of other people who could do the job instead of you so be sure that you understand what your worth is to the company and how much leverage you have before starting to make counter offers with regard to money that you might have vested in your current employer 's pension plan your options are to leave it there until you retire and start getting a pension generally not advisable in these times when the company might not even exist by then roll it over into an ira or into your new employer 's 401k plan this last is the only matter that concerns your prospective employer and where you might need to ask the new employer 's 401k plan might not be structured to accept rollovers if the money in your current employer 's retirement plan is in a pension plan what is paid out for rolling over might be different and smaller than what has been credited to you thus far for example my state government pension plan credited 8 interest per annum on the amounts i contributed but this was fake money because had i resigned and withdrawn the pension contributions for the purpose of rolling over into an ira or even just taking it as cash i would have received only my contributions plus only 4.5 interest per annum the 8 interest credited is available only for the purpose of the purchase of an immediate annuity upon retirement it is not something that is portable to a new plan and if i want a lump sum payout upon retirement instead of a pension in the form of an annuity it would be the 4.5 rate again

the biggest problem with this that others seem to have missed is that a corporation must have a profit motive   meaning at some point after a startup phase your company needs to turn a profit to not be considered a hobby will your employer be paying your corporation for your salary   is that the company 's business endeavor   if you run profits through the company and treat it like a true business this may be technically possible but as others have mentioned probably will cost more than any benefits you 'd receive   and at every step you 'll be throwing tons of audit flags rich dad poor dad advocates a light version of this   essentially running a business like real estate through an llc and then using that llc for business trips vacation with some justifiable business motive or capital purchases laptop etc and the like such that you 're paying with pre tax money instead of post tax but again the business needs a revenue source

would make sense that the higher liquidation cost and transaction costs are driving the share price down    higher and transaction means higher investors would require higher return driving down the share price the other possibilities i can think of off the top of my head based on looking at the firm for five minutes   1 in transaction costs did you include tax disclaimer math below done on the back of the envelope in between meetings   so nav says they are at liquidating that entire portfolio means about 22 capital gains tax rate which means after tax value is about $ add in any fees you 'd incur from trying to sell this stuff and it 's not unreasonable to assume you 'll only get about $ 55 m once all is said and done which is pretty close to the actual market cap    if you have accounted for the above consider   2 bulk of their investments seem to be in private assets which implies that they have some discretion in how they mark the value of those investments and there is the chance that the market does n't have confidence in these guys what 's their performance been like in recent years especially with a private asset portfolio i 'd be weary    if i was to invest in them i 'd want a higher return for the opaque portfolio

there is no relationship between the government appraisal and the mortgage appraisal   the loan appraisal is done by a lender to determine if the property value is in agreement with the loan amount the government appraisal is done to determine how much to charge you in taxes they use the values of residences and commercial property to get their operating budget each year they also set the rate to generate the amount of income money they need if they cut all appraisals in half they would just double the rate in some jurisdictions the government appraises every year in other places every three years some only when the property is sold in some jurisdictions the maximum increase or decrease in government appraisal is set by law but then they reset after the house is sold that being said use this time to review the appraisal from the government they may have facts wrong they may think you have a pool or more bedrooms or a garage when you do n't some jurisdictions use an automated process others do a more detailed individual process if there was a mistake ten years ago with the description it will never get caught unless you complain   check with the website for how to appeal some have windows of opportunity for an appeal

you do n't want to do that don't lie to the irs we live overseas as well and have researched this extensively you can not make $ 50k overseas and then say you only made $ 45k to put $ 5k into retirement   i have heard from some accountants and tax attorneys who interpret the law as saying that the irs considers foreign earned income as not being compensation when computing ira contribution limits regardless of whether or not you exclude it publication what is compensation scroll down a little to the what is not compensation section those professionals say that any amounts you can exclude not just ones you actually do exclude then there are others that say the can is not implied so be careful trying to use any foreign earned income to qualify for retirement contributions i have n't ran across anyone yet who has gotten caught doing it and paid the price but that does n't mean they are n't out there an alternative in certain cases there are two things you can do that we have found to have some sort of taxable income that is preferably not foreign so that you can contribute to a retirement account we do this by using capital gains from investments as income since our agi is always zero we pay no short or long term capital gains taxes as long as we keep short term capital gains lower than $ 45k   another way to contribute to a roth ira when you have no income is to do an ira rollover of course you need money in a tax deferred account to do this but this is how it works i always recommend those who have tax deferred ira 's and no agi due to the feie to roll over as much as they can every year to a roth ira that really is tax free money the only tax you 'll pay on that money is sales tax when you spend it =)

duffbeer703 covers most everything the entire point of an emergency fund is for it to be liquid   now i do understand if you feel your situation requires over 6 months of living expenses that is a lot of money to have sitting in a statement savings account under no circumstances should you take any sort of risk with an emergency fund however you could do this invest some of the assets in a six month 1 year or 2 year cd if returns were enough to be worthwhile   if you do n't need the money then fine great but if you do you can break a certificate of deposit before maturity there will be a penalty fee you might lose interest too but you 'll have access to your money no liquidity risk so maybe you could put most say 60 of your rainy day funds in truly liquid assets the remainder could be in longer term cd 's which you hopefully wo n't need because you 'll be back to non rainy day living again

both states will want to tax you your tax home is where you maintain a domicile are registered to vote etc and you will probably want to keep this as ma since you state that ma is your permanent residence and you are staying in a rented place in pa but be careful about voter registration that is one of the items that can be used to determine your state of residence   ok so if you and your spouse are ma residents   you should file jointly as residents in ma and as nonresidents in pa do the calculations on the nonresident return first and then the calculations on the resident   return typically on a nonresident tax return the calculations are effectively the following report all your income usually agi from the federal return   call this $ x. compute the pa state tax due on $ x.   note that you follow the rules for nonresidents in doing this not the calculations used by pa residents call the amount of tax you computed as $ y. what part of the total income $ x is attributable to pa sources if this amount is $ z then you owe pa $ y times z x on the resident return in ma you will likely get some credit for the taxes paid to pa and this will reduce your ma tax burden usually the maximum credit is limited to the lesser of actual tax paid to pa and what you would have had to pay ma for the same income as far as withholding is concerned your employer in pa will withhold pa taxes as if you are a pa resident but you can adjust the amount via the pa equivalent of irs form w4 so as to account for any additional   tax that might be due because you will be filing as a nonresident   else you can pay estimated taxes via the pa equivalent of irs form 1040es similarly your wife can adjust her withholding to account for the ma taxes that you will owe on the joint income or you can pay estimated taxes to ma too note that it is unlikely that your employer in pennsylvania will withhold   massachusetts taxes and send them to massachusetts for you e.g. if it is a ma and pa store but there may be special deals available if   your employer does business in both states i.e. is a ma and pa store

the entire time you 've talked about cost changing incomes matters little if the cost scales with it me thinks you do n't understand how a market works even a semi planned one if more people make more money the price of most goods goes up this is n't due to real actual demand its due to something called inflation when the amount of money in circulation increases we have inflation lets say i make 35k a year as a store clerk is my labor being undervalued compared to the income of a store clerk in the past or is the price of goods scaling faster than my income has scaled   simply adding more money does n't fix anything the price of the good or service is what matters the most while everyone having more money is good you ca n't just magically give everyone more money without the cost of goods and services rising i imagine that if everyone suddenly were at least a millionaire the price of a laptop would sky rocket the cost of the laptop in parts would n't be that much more but since most people would have disposable income beyond their needs some goods would then get more expensive once that happens the inflation of prices starts to spread until its effects are seen across the market   i do n't think the fruit of my labor is being stolen by the upper class if anything the fruit of my labor gets taken more and more by my own government and transferred to the lower classes more and more i 'm not rich not even close but i know i 've had at least 15k of my income in the last 5 years taken and distributed through taxes on my income to people that are generally unable to earn enough on their own   if these people are the upper class then i must be

so some time goes by and people start catching onto this system of credit worthiness and farmers and fishermen and so on start to realize that they can get better value for their ious by demonstrating credibility people with reputations or dubious prospects may not be able to issue money or might only be able to do so at very high interest e.g. a new farmer with no track record might have to promise me twice as many potatoes in exchange for a deer due to the risk that i might never see any potatoes at all    this obviously gets very messy fast as different and potato certificates have different values depending on whether they were issued by bob or jane and everyone has to keep track of and evaluate whose future apples are worth what    some enterprising person maybe the merchant who runs the trading post comes up with the idea to just issue one note for all the farms in town he calls a meeting with all the farmers and proposes to have the town priest keep a book of certificates and so on and the farmers will get notes just like everyone else in exchange for the crops they contribute to the pool and the merchant will keep a cut of the crops with which to hire some accountants and farm to estimate the total crop yields across town and so on    everyone agrees or at least enough farmers agree to kind of force the other ones to get on board if they want to participate meaningfully in the town economy and we now have something like a central bank issuing something like fiat currency that is currency whose value is decided by some central authority as opposed to the kind of straight up exchange certificates that can be traded for an actual apple from the issuer for example   now we have something that looks a lot like a modern monetary system the town can set up audit committees or whatever but the idea is that there is some central authority basically tasked with issuing money and regulating the supply of that money according to the estimated size of ongoing and future economic activity future crop yields    if they issue too much money we get inflation where more apple certificates are issued than apples grown and each apple note ends up being worth only three quarters of an apple come harvest time if they issue too little currency economic activity is needlessly restricted the farmers are not able to hire enough workers to maximize crop yields and so on the hunter starts hunting less because his deer meat is going bad since nobody has money to buy it and so on    at this point you may be asking why the hell go through all this complexity just to trade apples for deer and shoes is n't this more trouble than it 's worth    the answer is because this is a vastly more efficient system than pure barter i as a hunter no longer need to trade a physical deer for a bushel of apples to carry over to the shoemaker in order to get shoes you as an apple farmer can hire workers before the crop is harvested and therefore can grow more and your workers can eat year round instead of just getting a huge pile of apples at harvest time to try and trade for for whatever they will need for the rest of the year    so back to money   the thing to remember is that all throughout from the initial trade to this central banking system all of this money is it is ious except instead of being an iou that says will give one bushel of apples to the bearer of this bond in october it says anyone in town will give you anything worth one bushel of apples in trade   the money is not an actual thing that you can eat or wear or build a house with it 's an iou that is redeemable anywhere for anything from anyone it is a promise to pay equivalent value at some time in the future except the holder of the money can call on anybody at all to fulfill that they do n't have to go back to the original    this is where it starts getting interesting and where we can start to answer your question   for the sake of simplicity let 's stop calling these notes apple certificates and pretend that the village has decided to call them loddars    so now you 're still growing apples but instead of trading them for deer and shoes you trade them for loddars so far so good    once again you want some meat except harvest time has n't come yet so you do n't have any loddars to buy meat with you call me up cellphones have been invented in this newly efficient economy hey otherwiseyep any chance you could kill me a deer and i 'll give you ten loddars for it at harvest time   i say jeez i 'd love to but i really need all the cash i can get for every deer right now my kid is out growing shoes like crazy tell you what if you can write me a promise to pay twelve loddars in october i can give that to the shoe maker you about the interest rate but agree    did a lightbulb just go off you and i have once again created money*. twelve loddars now exist in the town economy that have not been printed by the central bank counting all the money trading hands in the village there are now a all the loddars that have ever been printed plus b twelve more that you have promised to produce    this is important to understand i just spent money on shoes which you spent on deer meat that has never been it 's obviously not any of the banknotes that have already been issued but it 's definitely real money because i traded it for new shoes and you traded it for a dead deer    once you and i and others start to catch on that this is possible that we can spend money that we do n't have and that has n't even been printed yet it is entirely possible for a situation to arise where the total amount of money changing hand in the village vastly exceeds the number of loddars that have actually been printed and this can happen without fraud or inflation or anything like that and can be perfectly legitimate    now what happens if another wildfire hits your orchard those twelve loddars are destroyed they are gone the shoe maker is

it 's just like any other ad the idea is n't necessarily for you to go to and get a delivered as soon as you see their tv ad when watching the goal is to put the brand in your mind   3 days later you 're at the store and on the juice and soda aisle and are thinking why get a case of pepsi when i can grab some gatorade and be a little healthier like lebron james i work out sometimes probably i need to stay better   swap out the product of your choice appropriately if that metaphor does n't fly for you you 're through google results and see a galaxy ad and you 're more likely to give them a look when you 're shopping for your next they 're not expecting you to go to the website and buy one now but based on your search history they know you 're into technology you googled best phone 2017 once your phone plan is probably ending soon you searched sprint contract your carrier sells the from that time you clicked a link reading how to avoid sprint early termination fee and you like being on the cutting edge of stuff you watched a video entitled is my iphone you 're the target market    there 's a couple million people just like you- which is why ad impressions are as important as click and are billed appropriately the guy that clicks the link is more likely to buy but you read it and are thinking about it- so on the aisle you 'll think gatorade eh why not

customers also have different needs and the more extreme the need the more likely they 're going to rate you so even if you completely fulfill a customer 's need unless it was an extreme need or they were in a predefined emotional state you 're not likely to get a review   as an example we used to actually fix things at our radio shack with and such in store a few people would give us feedback about that we were also allowed leeway on what we could take for returns receipt 30 day limit etc so if the customer came in and started telling me how our products sucked and they were calling the bbb it 's unlikely they would receive the queen bee treatment they also gave reviews yelp was n't around at the time   in short despite the fact we gave the vast majority of our customers way above par treatment the people most likely to give reviews were self entitled despite what people say about turning customers around from angry to nice this only happened with maybe 1 out of every 5 pissy customers another two would probably be shown to be attempting to scam the store in some manner and a fourth would likely have to be shown the door

okay yes that would seem to make sense so something like a local vol model    in the context of term structure modelling you can also incorporate a volatility surface into the pricing of european and even exotic options e.g. through a sabr or an sabr for exotics which i suppose means by your criteria there are actually varying degree of arbitrage free when it comes to picking a model by that i mean there are varying degrees of what your model takes as given if it takes the market price of risk as given it 's an equilibrium model if it takes the observed term structure as given it 's an arbitrage free model if it takes the volatility structure as given it 's something else   and wrote a paper called a new of the dynamic term structure models in the journal of investment management that basically coincides with what we 're saying   so yes it sounds right to me

i agree with the first the first step is to measure your spending and put it down into raw numbers once you have the raw numbers you will feel a natural inclination to improve on those numbers set yourself a daily target for cash incidental expenses it does nt have to be a crazy target just something you can achieve easily mark a tick mark next to every day on the calendar that you meet that target or spend less than the target gradually the momentum from the past few ticks will automatically compel you to want to tick off the next day   at the end of each week lower the target a little you 'll find that when you start measuring your expenditure you become more aware of how you might be wasting money all too often we just go out and buy stuff we do n't need without really thinking about it

options are an indication what a particular segment of the market those who deal a lot in options think will happen and just because people think that does n't mean it will   bearing in mind however that people writing covered calls may due so simply as part of a strategy to mitigate downside risk at the expense of limiting upside potential   the presence of more people offering up options is to a degree an indication they are thinking the price will fall or hold steady since that is in effect the bet they are making   otoh the people buying those options are making the opposite bet so who is to say which will be right   the balance between the two and how it affects the price of the options could be taken as an indication of market sentiment within the options market as to the future direction the stock is likely to take i just noticed that blackjack posted the that can be used to model all of this   to address the last part of your question does that mean it will go lower i would say this   the degree to which any of this puts actual pressure on the stock of the underlying instrument is highly debatable since many likely most people trading in a stock never look at what the options for that stock are doing but base their decision on other factors such as price history momentum fundamentals and recent news about the company   to presume that actions in the options market would put pressure on a stock price you would need to believe that a fraction of the buyers and sellers were paying attention to the options market   which might be the case for some quants but likely not for a lot of other buyers    and it could be argued even then that both groups those trading options and those trading stocks are both looking at the same information to make their predictions of the likely future for the stock and thus even if there is a correlation between what the stock price does in relation to options there is no real causality that can be established   we would in fact predict that given access to the same information both groups would by and large be taking similar parallel actions due to coming to similar conclusions regarding the future price of the stock   what is far more likely to pressure the price would be just the shear number of buyers or sellers and also especially since repeal of the uptick rule someone who is trying to actively drive down the price via a lot of shorting at progressively lower prices   something that is alleged to have been carried out by some hedge fund managers in the course of bear raids on particular companies

this is a great question i 've been an entrepreneur and small business owner for 20 + years and have started small businesses in 3 states that grew into nice income streams for me i 've lived off these businesses for 20 + years so i know it can be done first let me start by saying that the rules regulations requirements and laws for operating a business small or large legally for the most part are local laws and regulations depending on what your business does you may have some federal rules to follow but for the most part it will be your locality state county city that determines what you 'll have to do to comply and be legal also though it might be better in some cases to incorporate and even required in some circumstances you do n't always have to there are many small businesses think etc that get income from their business operations and do so as individuals of course everyone has to pay taxes so as long as you property record your income and expenses and properly file your tax returns every year you are income tax legal   i wo n't try to answer the income tax question here though as that can be a big question also though you certainly can start a business on your own without hiring lawyers or other professionals more on that below when it comes to taxes i definitely recommend you indeed plan to hire a tax professional even if it 's something like h&r block or jackson etc in some cities there might even be free tax preparation services by certain organizations that want to help the community and these are often available even to small businesses in general income taxes can be complicated and the rules are always changing i 've found that most small business owners that try to file their own taxes generally end up paying a lot more taxes than they 're required to in essence they are overpaying running a business and making a profit can be hard enough so on to of that you do n't need to be paying more than you are required to   also i am going to assume that since it sounds like it would be a business of one you that you wo n't have a payroll that is another area that can be complicated for sure ok with those generics out of the way let me tackle your questions related to starting and operating a business since you have the idea for your business pretty figured out will you have to pay any substantial amount of money to attorneys or advisors or accountants or to register with the government not necessarily since the rules for operating a business legally vary by your operating location where you will be providing the service or performing your work you can certainly research this on your own it might take a little time but it 's doable if you stick with it some resources the state of florida where i live has an excellent page at you might not be in florida but almost every state will have something similar what all do i need to do to remain on the right side of the law and the smart side of business   all of the answers above still apply to this question but here are a few more items to consider you will want to keep good records of all expenses directly related to the business if you license some content stock images for example you 'll want to document receipts these are easy usually as you know directly if you subscribe to the apple developer program which you 'll need to if you intend to sell apps in the apple app stores the subscription is an expense against your business income etc you will want to keep good records of indirect costs these are not so easy to figure out and where a good accountant will help you when this becomes significant but these are important and a lot of business owners hurt themselves by not considering these what do i mean well you need an office in order to produce your work right you might need a computer a phone internet electricity heat etc all of which allow you to create a working environment that allows you to produce your product the irs and state tax authorities all provide ways for you to quantify these and count them as legitimate business expenses no you ca n't use 100 of your electric bill since your office might be inside your home and the entire bill is not just for your business but you are certainly entitled to some part of that bill to count as a business expense again i do n't want to get too far down the income tax rabbit hole but you still need to keep track of what you spend you must keep good record of all your income this is especially important when you have money coming in from various sources a payroll gifts from friends business income from clients and/or the app stores etc do not just assume that copies of your bank deposits tell the whole story bank statements might tell you the amount and date of a deposit but you do n't really know where that money came from unless you are tracking it the good news is that the above record keeping can be quite easy with something like quicken or quickbooks or many many other such popular programs you will want to ensure you have the needed licenses not necessarily required at all for a lot of small businesses especially home based businesses depending on your business activity you might want to consider business liability insurance again this will depend on your clients and/or other business entities you 'll be dealing with some might require you to have some insurance   will be efforts even be considered a business initially until some amount of money actually starts coming in   this might be a legal accountant question as to the very specific answer from the pov of the law and taxing authorities however consider that not all businesses make any money at all for a long time and they definitely are a business for instance twitter was losing money for a long time years and no one would argue they were not a business again deferring to the attorneys cpas here for the legal answer the practical answer is that you 're performing some business activity when you start creating a product and working hard to make it happen i would consider acting as a business regardless what things do i need to do up front and what things can i defer to later especially in light of the fact that it might be several months to a couple years before any substantial income starts coming in this question 's answer could be quite long there are potentially many items you can defer   however one i can say is that you might consider deferring incorporation an individual can perform a business activity and draw income from it legally in a lot of situations for tax purposes this is sometimes referred to as schedule c income i 'm not saying incorporation is a bad thing it can shield you from a lot of issues but i am saying that it 's not necessary on day 1 for a lot of small businesses having said that this too can be easy to do on your own many companies offer services so you can incorporate for a few hundred dollars if you do incorporate as a small business of one person i would definitely consider a tax concept called an s corp to avoid paying double taxes but here too we 've gone down the tax rabbit hole again

get a lawyer to put this in contract form with everything spelled out explicitly what is fair is what the two of you agree upon my own suggestion divide the property into things which are yours his and shared then have each of you be responsible for all your costs plus half the shared costs but get all the benefits of your half that would mean that if he rents out his half all the rental income is his if you decide to live in your half all the savings of not paying rent are yours   each of you pays your half of mortgage insurance and other shared costs repairs to shared infrastructure should be done by someone both of you trust if you agree the work is needed and he does it rather than your hiring someone you owe him the appropriate percentage of the costs the two of you will need to agree on whether you owe him for that percentage of his time as well make sure you agree on some mechanism for one person offering to buy the other out or to sell their half to the other party or potentially to someone else entirely personally i would try to do that at opportunity to avoid some of the ways this can go wrong see past comments about the hazards of guaranteeing a loan this works or does n't work similarly does that address your question

i like the way you framed this question   there is no single right answer for what to do with your savings but there are some choices that are wrong in the sense that they are dominated by other choices you could make   of the choices you listed there are two that fall into that category   the ones that seem like a bad idea to me are putting it into your roth 401(k   you ca n't do this directly anyhow but you could do it indirectly by increasing your contributions and using the growth fund to cover the hole in your budget but that 's a lot of work for a relatively small gain   you would essentially be exchanging one long term investment for another long term investment   you would pay capital gains taxes on the investment when you sell it today in order to not pay taxes on its earnings when you eventually withdraw it   there is some benefit there but it 's a long way off not that large and probably not worth the effort   things that might change your mind   if your 401(k was a traditional 401(k paying tax at capital gains rate today to get a deduction at your normal income rate is likely to be a win   you 're not contributing enough to get the full company match always try to get that match if you can putting it into your emergency fund   once again you are likely to pay capital gains tax if you do this and you will be putting it into an investment that is likely to get a lower return than your current one   it is n't really necessary to incur these costs since if you encounter an emergency that you ca n't cover with your existing emergency fund you could always liquidate the growth fund then when you know you need it   now a growth fund is going to be more volatile than what you would normally want for an emergency fund but the risk is n't that bad if you think about it   say your emergency comes up and you find that the growth fund is down 20 which would be a pretty horrible run   that 's $ 600 less that you have to deal with the situation   keep in mind that you already have $ 2000 and building in your current emergency fund   is that $ 600 going to make the difference between meeting the need and not   it 's not likely   better to leave the investment where it is and keep building your emergency fund week by week   things that might change your mind your level of risk aversion if having that money in a more risky investment is keeping you up at night move it   you face significant job uncertainty if you have reason to think your job is at risk it might be a good idea to top off that emergency fund sooner rather than later your other two choices both seem like solid options under the right circumstances   if it were me i 'd leave the investment in place rather than use it to pay off the student loan   the investment is likely though of course not guaranteed to earn more than the interest rate even on the highest rate loan especially when you consider that the interest on the student loan is probably tax deductible   moreover the size of the investment is n't enough to fully repay the loan so putting it toward the loan wo n't even improve your cash flow for some time to come   however there is always a chance that the investment will perform poorly and some people prefer the guaranteed return from paying off the loan   it depends on your personal risk tolerance   the one thing i would recommend is to think of putting the money toward the loan not as a debt repayment but as a fixed income investment with a yield equal to your loan 's interest rate   if you would still consider buying it then then go ahead   if not then stick with what you 've got   in my experience people get way too emotional about debt try to take that emotion out of your decision making if you can

okay so i am going to break this answer into a couple sections okay so first things first did you get a good deal this is challenging to answer for a number of reasons first a good deal is relative to the buyers goals if you 're attempting to buy an asset that provides passive income then maybe you met your goal and got a good deal if you 're attempting to buy an asset that provides long term growth and you purchased above market i 'm speculating of course then you may have made a bad deal so how do you determine if you got a good deal does your gross rental multiplier equal that or is less than that of the average in your area the lower the better   so how do you use the to determine if you 're getting a good deal divide your purchase price by the average city or area and that will tell you what you should be getting annually in rent   you can also use the to determine if a future purchase is over or under priced just replace purchase price with asking price   alright so these are the tools you can use to decide if you made a bad business deal or not there are many ways to skin a cat so to speak these are the tools i use before i purchase a home many people are penny wise and pound foolish take your time when making large purchases it 's okay to say pass   okay next thing is this new purchase you 're looking at the number one rule when working a franchise is you do n't open a second store until you have a perfect working model to go off of if you 've never had to file a tax return for your current rental then you need to wait if you 've never read your local and state rental laws then you need to wait if you 've never had to leave an event early wake up in the middle of the night or get a text while you 're on a date from one of your tenants then you need to wait give it a year or two just learn the unknown about rental properties use your first as your test bed it 's way more cheaper then if you make a bad mistake and roll it over multiple properties   finally i will leave you with this no one on this site myself included knows everything there is to know about real estate anyone that claims they do send their ass packing this is a complex complex business there is always something to learn and if you do n't have the passion to continue learning then hand it off to someone who does there is tax law rental law city repair law contract law and this does n't even include the stuff that makes you money like knowing how to leverage low or no money down loans   please take some time and go out and learn   good luck

this is wrong   clear but wrong   a different story that has the benefit of being true follows     money is an agreed upon fiction   when say the romans invaded a territory they had to find a way to feed their army and pay their soldiers   the soldiers could just steal stuff but that was unsustainable because after awhile all economic activity would just stop   so the army paid the soldiers with coins that could then be used by the soldiers to purchase things from the natives      now the people had no reason to accept these stamped pieces of metal gold and silver are not inherently valuable it 's just an agreed upon fiction   to force acceptance rome imposed taxes that had to be paid in roman coinage   now the people had to accept the coins to accumulate enough to pay their taxes the soldiers were able to spend their pay and a more or less modern looking economy was born     coins stamped with a monetary value have always been worth more than the market price of the underlying metal except in extreme circumstances   currency has value because it can be used to pay taxes

are all bonds priced in such a way so that they all return the same amount on average after accounting for risk in other words do risk premiums only compensate for the amount investors might lose no ge might be able to issue a bond with lower yield than say a company from china with no previous records of its presence in the u.s. markets a bond price not only contains the risk of default but also encompasses the of the bond by the issuer with a specific stream of income location of main business any specific terms and conditions in the prospectus or not insurances against default etc else for the same payoff why would you take a higher risk the payoff of a higher risk not only default but term structure e.g. 5 years or 10 years coupon payments bond is more to compensate for the extra risk it entails for the bondholder the yield of a high risk bond will always be higher than a bond with lower risk if you travel back in time to 2011 2012 you would see the yields on greek bonds were in the range of 25 30 to reflect the high risk of a greek default some hedge funds made a killing by buying greek bonds during the eurozone crisis if you go through the efficient frontier theory your argument is a counter statement to it same with individual bonds or a portfolio of bonds you always want to be compensated for the risk you take the higher the risk the higher the compensation and vice versa when investors buy the bond at this price they are essentially buying a risk free bond logically yes but no it is n't and you should n't make that assumption

the answer to your question is governed by the structure of the company and your ownership or lack thereof in the business   australian business can be structured the same way u.s. ones are as a sole proprietorship partnership llc or company   if you are only on the board and have no equity you can not be affected   you must have some amount of equity in the business to have any chance of being affected if the business is a sole proprietorship then the single individual running the business is personally responsible for all debt and the inability to pay obligations would result in personal bankruptcy which would in all likelihood affect your credit score it would in the u.s. if it is a partnership then anyone holding stock in the company is likewise personally responsible for a portion of the debt and can be subject to bankruptcy and credit score implications if the business is structured as a limited liability company or a corporation a stakeholder 's personal finances are separate from the business 's and their credit score can not be affected

i suggest that you 're really asking questions surrounding three topics 1 what allocation hedges your risks but also allows for upside 2 how do you time your purchases so you 're not getting hammered by exchange rates 3 how do you know if you 're doing ok allocations your questions concerning allocation are really what if questions as points out only you can really answer those i would suggest building an excel sheet and thinking through the scenarios of at least 3 what ifs   a what if you keep your current allocations and anything in local currency gets cut in half in value could you live with that b what if you allocate more to stable economies and your economy recovers so stable items grow at 5 per year but your local investments grow 50 for the next 3 years could you live with that missed opportunity   c what if you allocate more to stable economies and they grow at 5 while sa continues a gradual slide remember that slow or flat growth in a stable currency is the same as higher returns in a declining currency i would trust your own insights as a local but i would recommend thinking more about how this plays out for your current investments   timing you bring up concerns about timing of buying expensive foreign currencies you ca n't time the market if you knew how to do this with forex trading you would n't be here   read up on dollar cost averaging for most people and most companies with international exposure it may not beat the market in the short term but it nets out positive in the long term   rebalancing for you there will be two questions to ask regularly is the allocation still correct as political and international issues play out have any returns or losses thrown your planned allocation out of   alignment   put your investment goals in writing and revisit it at least once a year to evaluate whether any adjustments would be wise to make   and of course i am not a registered financial professional especially not in sa so i obviously recommend taking what i say with a large dose of salt

by mentioning gld i presume therefore you are referring to the gold exchange traded fund that is intended to mirror the price of gold without you having to personally hold bullion or even gold certificates while how much is a distinctly personal choice there are seemingly at least three camps of people in the investment world first would be traditional bond fixed income and equity people   gold would play no direct role in their portfolio other than perhaps holding gold company shares in some other vehicle but they would not hold much gold directly secondly at the mid range would be someone like yourself that believes that is in and of itself a worthy investment and makes it a non trivial but not overriding part of their portfolio   your 5 10 range seems to fit in well here lastly and to my taste over the top are the gold gold gold investors that seem to believe it is the panacea for all market woes   i always suspect that investment gurus that are pushing this however have large positions that they are trying to run up so they can unload given all this i am not aware of any general rule about gold but anything less than 10 would seem like at least a not over concentration in the one area   once any one holding gets much beyond that you should really examine why you believe that it should represent such a large part of your holdings good luck

the reason it 's broken out is very specific this is showing you how much interest accrued during the month   it is the only place that 's shown typically each month 's minimum payment is the sum of the interest accrued during that month and some principal say m = and b is your total loan balance   that i is fixed at the amount of interest that accrued that month you always must pay off the accrued interest   it changes each month as some of the principal is reduced if you have a 3 daily interest rate you owe approximately plus a bit as the interest on the interest accrues each month or 30 or 28   since b is going down constantly as principal is paid off i is also going down the p is most commonly calculated based on an amortization table such that you have a fixed payment amount each month and pay the loan off after a certain period of time   that 's why p changes each month because it 's easier for people to have a constant monthly payment m than to have a fixed p and variable i for a variable m. as such it 's important to show you the i amount both so you can verify that the loan is being correctly charged paid and for your tax purposes

assuming no constraints on how much you can move or how frequently into and out of your offset mortgage account the question becomes one of what rate of return you expect from your long term savings emergency cash fund the rate you are getting from the offset mortgage account is known since it reduces the principal amount owing and thus reduces interest charges the return is the mortgage rate though i would not be surprised if the offset mortgage account contract has bells and reducing the effective rate saying something like 3 pounds reduction of principal for every 5 pounds you put in so as a movie character once said do you feel lucky today   if so move money from your offset mortgage account to savings and earn more   if not move money in the opposite direction a guaranteed 2 return on the offset mortgage account might be better than taking a risk on the of the stock market and even the possibility of loss in your long term savings account

the short answer zero 's answer gives some good reasons why   you will basically never be able to achieve diversification with individual stocks that is anywhere close to what you can get with mutual funds   owning individual stocks exposes you to much greater risk in that random one off events that happen to affect one of the companies you own can have a disproportionate effect on your assets   for instance some sort of scandal involving a particular company can cause its stock to tank there are only two reasons i can see to invest in individual stocks a. you have some unique opportunity to acquire stock that other people might not be able to get or get at that price   this can be the case if you work for a privately held company that allows you to buy stock or options or allows you to participate in its ipo   even then you should not go too crazy since having too much stock in the company you work for can double your pain if the company falls on hard times you may lose your job and your investment b. for fun   if you like tracking stocks and trying to beat the market you may want to test your skills at this by using a small proportion of your investable cash no more than 10   in this case you 're not so much hoping to increase your returns as to just enjoy investing more   this can also have a psychological benefit in that it allows you to blow off steam and indulge your desire to make decisions while allowing your passive investments index funds to shoulder the load of actually gaining value

when inflation is high or is rising generally interest rates will be raised to reduce people spending their money and slow down the rate of inflation as interest rates rise people will be less willing to borrow money and more willing to keep their money earning a good interest rate in the bank people will reduce their spending and invest less into alternative assets but instead put more into their bank savings when inflation is too low and the economy is starting to slow down generally interest rates will be raised to encourage more spending to restart the economy again as interest rates drop more will take their saving out of their bank accounts as is starts to earn very little in interest rate and more will be willing to borrow as it becomes cheaper to borrow people will start spending more and investing their money outside of bank savings

as a canadian resident the simple answer to your question is yes having worked as a tax auditor and as a certified financial planner you are required to file an income tax return because you have taxable employment income all the employer is doing is deducting it at source and remitting it on your behalf that does not alleviate your need to file in fact if you do n't file you will be subject to a no filing penalty the one aspect you are missing is that taxpayers may be entitled to tax credits that may result in a refund to you depending on your personal situation e.g spousal or minor dependents i hope this helps

several factors are considered in loans as significant as a home mortgage   i believe the most major factors are 1 credit report 2 income and 3 employment status if you borrow jointly all joint factors are included not just the favorable ones   some wrinkles this can cause may include credit report the second person on the loan may have poor credit or no credit   this can will hurt your rate or even prevent them from being listed on the loan at all which will also mean you ca n't include their income in addition there are future consequences that any late payments default foreclosure etc will be listed on all borrower 's reports if you both have solid work history great credit and want to jointly own the home then there should n't be any negatives   if this is not the case compare both cases fully not just rates as some agents could say you can get the same rate either way but then not tell you closing costs in one scenario are higher and pick the one that is best overall this is just information from my recollection so make sure to verify and ask plenty of questions do n't go forward on assumptions

it has got to do with the irrationality of humans   the so called long term investor is in it for the long term they are not worried about market fluctuations nor timing the market but yet they will aim to try to get a bargain when they buy in   it is contradictory in a way think about it if i buy a stock and it drops by 30 i am not worried because i am in it for the long term but i am worried about getting 1 off when i buy it   they usually tend to buy when the stock starts falling however what they do n’t realise is when a stock starts falling there is no telling when it will stop so even if they get a bargain for that day it is usually quickly wiped out a few days later instead of waiting for the price to find support and start recovering they are eager to buy what they think is a bargain i think this type of long term investing is very risky and the main reason is because the investor has no plan they just try to buy so called bargain stocks and hold them until they need the money usually in retirement but what happens if the stock price is lower when they want to retire than when they bought it i hope no long term investor was trying to retire in 2008 if they simply had a plan to indicate when they would buy and under what conditions they would sell and have a risk management plan in place then maybe they could reduce their risk somewhat and conserve their capital a good article to read on this is what 's wrong with long term investing

there are some who argue that you should lease an electric car these factors are in addition to all the normal pros and cons of leasing vs. buying the technology is still new and is advancing rapidly in 2 3 years the newer model may have significantly improved features range and efficiency as well as lower prices if you are the type of person to upgrade regularly to the latest and greatest leasing can make it a smoother transition it is hard to predict the depreciation of the vehicles this is both because of the above factors but also because these kinds of cars are newer and so the statistical models used to predict their future values are less refined the models for predicting gas car prices have been for decades ev manufacturers have in the past made some mistakes in their residual value estimations when you lease a car you get essentially an option to buy the car at the future predicted residual value if at the end of the lease the market value of the car is higher than the residual value you can purchase the car at the predetermined price making yourself some extra money if the value is lower than the residual you can return the car or renegotiate i know a relatively large number of electric vehicle owners most or all of the ones who got the vehicle new leased it the rest bought used vehicles coming off lease which can also be a good deal

another factor you may want to consider is insurance if your wife is at their house as a friend who happens to be teaching the kid to play and the kid falls off their chair and hurts them self that is rather different to your wife being brought in to the house as a contractor and an injury occurring during an activity that she was i am in a similar situation and i have a $ 5 million public liability policy which costs about $ 300 per year so if her income is likely to be less than that she may be better off helping a friend learn rather than providing tutoring services there may also be legal requirements i am required to apply for government checks every few years in order to operate a business that involves working with children

you ca n't transfer mortgages when you purchase a new property you can purchase a new property now or you can refinance your current property now and leverage yourself as far as possible while rates are low the higher rates you are worried about may not be as bad as you think with higher interest rates that may put downward pressure on housing prices or when rates do rise it may simply move from historic lows to relative lows i had a mortgage at 4.25 that i never bothered refinancing even though rates went much lower because the savings in interest paid minus my tax deduction for mortgage interest did n't amount to more than the cost of refinancing if rates go back up to 5 that will still be very affordable

best is indeed subjective you could for example get a universal life policy that pays a guaranteed interest on all monies even those in excess of what you need to pay to cover the policy most people will tell you probably correctly that using life insurance as an investment vehicle is a bad idea however   the growth of the money in a policy however is usually tax deductible and grows at a guaranteed rate here in the u.s. pays a guaranteed unless they go broke i suppose 4 per year historically however they 've been paying 6 per year that 's pretty good except a lot of your money goes into buying the policy the first few years

you are not the only one with this problem when intuit changed their pricing and services structure in 2015 a lot of people got angry facing larger fees and having to go through an annoying upgrade just to get the same functionality such as schedule d capital gains you have several options 1 forget turbo tax and just use paper forms that is what i do paper is reliable 2 use forms mode in turbo tax of course that may be even more complicated than simply filing out paper forms 3 use a different service if your income is below $ the irs has a free electronic filing service other online vendors have full taxes services for less than turbo tax 4 add the amount to ordinary income technically as long as you report the income you can not be penalized so if you add the capital gain to your ordinary income then you have paid taxes on the income even if they send you a letter you can send an answer that you added it to ordinary income and that will satisfy them of course you pay a higher rate on your $ 26 if you do that 5 if you are in the 15 or below income bracket you are exempt from capital gains and you can omit it do n't believe the nervous who say the irs will burn your house down if you do n't report $ 26 in capital gains penalties are assessed on the percentage of taxes you did not pay 0.5 penalty per month since 0.5 of $ 0 is $ 0 your penalty is $ 0 the irs knows this the irs does not send out assessment letters for $ 0 6 even if you are above the 15 bracket there is likelihood it is still a no tax situation see 5 above 7 worst case scenario you are making a million dollars per year and you omit your $ 26 capital gains from your return the irs will send you an assessment letter for about $ 10 you can then send them a separate check or money order to pay it in all honesty i have omitted documented tax items like taxable interest that the irs knows about many times and never gotten an assessment letter once i made a serious math error on my return and they sent me an assessment letter which i just paid end of story and that was for a lot more than $ 26 the technical verbiage for something like this in irs lingo is income as you can see from this official irs web page basically what they do is guess how much they think you owe and send you a bill then you pay it if you do so in time you do n't even get a 0.5 interest penalty on your $ owed or whatever it is 8) go hog wild as long as you are risking an assessment on your $ 26 why not go hog wild and just let the irs compute all your taxes for you make a copy of your income statements then mail them to the irs with a letter that says hi i am mr. my ssn is xxx xx xxxx my address is xyz i am unable to compute my taxes due to a confused state of mind i am hereby requesting a tax assessment for the 2016 tax year make sure you sign and date the letter in all probability they will compute the full assessment and send you a bill or refund

you are right that even if you do not receive a 1099-misc you still need to report all income to the irs   report the $ 40 on schedule c or schedule c ez   since your net profit was less than $ 400 you do not need to file schedule se   from the irs web site self employment income it is a common misconception that if a taxpayer does not receive a form 1099-misc or if the income is under $ 600 per payer the income is not taxable there is no minimum amount that a taxpayer may exclude from gross income all income earned through the taxpayer ’s business as an independent contractor or from informal side jobs is self employment income which is fully taxable and must be reported on form 1040 use form 1040 schedule c profit or loss from business or form 1040 schedule c ez net profit from business sole proprietorship to report income and expenses taxpayers will also need to prepare form 1040 schedule se for self employment taxes if the net profit exceeds $ 400 for a year do not report this income on form 1040 line 21 as other income independent contractors must report all income as taxable even if it is less than $ 600 even if the client does not issue a form 1099-misc the income whatever the amount is still reportable by the taxpayer

i 'm not sure how this gets entered in turbotax but this income from the company should be included in the schedule c or c ez line 1 gross receipts total along with all of your 1099-misc income from your business and any other income that your business took in you do n't need a 1099 from them and the irs does n't care at least from your perspective if you got a 1099 or not in fact they probably expect you to have some income   we do n't know why the company chose not to issue 1099 forms but luckily it is n't your concern you can fill out your tax return properly without it   note this answer assumes that you did n't have any tax withheld from your checks from this company if you did have tax withheld you 'll need to insist on a 1099 to show that

i 'll summarize here our discussion in the comments first thing to remember is that you can only deposit up to $ 6k year into the roth ira you can not seed it with some large amount unless its a rollover second thing to remember is that you can only qualify 10 k distribution for the home purchase with that in mind it seems that you 'll have to have high returns to make use of the maximum tax benefit 15 20 of the 10 k non qualified distributions will be taxed at ordinary income rates + 10 penalty so if you ca n't qualify the distribution instead of saving money on taxes you 'll end up paying twice as much as you would have without the ira also keep in mind that reporting of the distributions and justifying the qualifications might require assistance of a tax preparer which will also reduce your savings bottom line imho you 'll end up with a wash or very insignificant savings compared to the magnitude of the home purchase costs at best which renders the whole thing kindof

in the us we have social security taxes where for a full time employee the company pays half and the employee pays half   when you work as a business what we call 1099 for the form that the wages are reported on then the contractor pays the full amount of social security tax there are times when a contractor can negotiate a higher rate because the company does not have to pay that tax   however most of the time the company just prefers to negotiate the rate based on your value   if you are a 60 k year guy then that is what they will pay you   from the company 's perspective it does not matter what your tax rate is only the value you can bring to the company   if you can add about 180 k to the bottom line then they will be happy to pay you 60 k and you should be happy to get it here in the us a contractor can expect to make about 7.5 more of an equivalent employee because of the social security tax savings to the company   however not all companies are willing to provide that in compensation   some companies see the legal and administrative costs of employees as normal and the same costs with contractors as extra so they do n't perceive a cost savings   there are other things that would preclude employers from giving the bump although it is logical to do so first you will really have to feel out your employer for the attitude on the subject   then i would make a logical case if they are open to providing extra compensation in return for tax savings   if i am an employee at 60 k you would also have to pay the government   how about you pay me 75 k as a contractor instead that would be a great deal for all in the us

the value of debt is that it allows you to profit from the return of equity beyond the amount of actual net equity you own   of course this only works if the cost of borrowing is less than your return on equity   market timing matters a great deal but is n't accounted for in this view   for my answer i would like to hand wave away market timing considerations   one plausible justification is that you could default on your current home and then immediately go buy one of equal value   if you buy a new home of a lesser value due to lack of funds and then prices appreciate then you missed some opportunity cost but probably not $ 100k worth of it moving on here are some helpful assumptions i 'll make i 'll ignore performance of your portfolio after retirement and only seek to optimize f which will be your net worth upon retirement   in either case your current net worth is earning the r2 rate   we can convert this for both your current net worth and future savings using conversion formulas present to future value f = p annual to future value f = s 1 r2 adding these together is sufficient to obtain f in the case that you have no borrowing power   the case where you do not default and maintain your credit score is different due to an initial $ 100k penalty and the amortized value of borrowing power   in a completely theoretical sense you get an effective yield on all borrowed money   the future value will be the following f = a1 one step is missing however which is to convert this value the value of having a good credit score into present value to compare to value of your defaulting p of borrowing power = f = a1 now let 's put some specific values in   say that you can borrow $ 300k with your good credit history and this applies for the next 25 years after which you retire   the borrowing rate is 7 and the time value of money to you is 10   i would then calculate p of borrowing power = $ 58 k < $ 100 k this indicates that it would be more economical to default   of course some people might point out that it will be removed from your record after 7 years   if you plug 7 years instead of 25 years into the equation almost no assumptions about rates will lead to the option of keeping your house being preferable so in a nutshell the value of your credit is probably less than $ 100k in a purely mathematical sense   but there are other factors too   if you do n't have that borrowing ability maybe you would n't be able to borrow money to start the business of your dreams   if you are a rock star entrepreneur then time value of money to you could be 1,000 yield sure then maybe you could make the above numbers work to favor keeping the house   i 've also neglected ethics   as other people point out it would be like stealing from the bank

what might make more sense is to capture your losses   sell out the funds you have move into something else that is different enough that the irs wo n't consider it a wash sale and you can then use those losses to offset gains you can even carry them forward    you would still be in the market just having made a sort of sideways move   a month or two later once you are clear of wash sale rules you could shift back to your original choices   this answer presumes you are in the us or somewhere that lets you use losses to offset gains

fixed   you are confirming the amount you are going t pay over the term of the loan variable over the total difference over the life of the loan comes to around $ 1200 that is the wrong way to calculate the variable portion the variable is primarily set with a margin over a certain benchmark i.e. fed rate assuming the fed rate does n't change over or only goes lower the variable rate is the one to go if it rises then your payment will increase and the margin they take over the benchmark rate may increase so the total amount you pay might increase too   i would assume a read through the t&cs should clarify that for you is it ever a good idea to choose a variable rate loan only if you think we are in a low interest rate environment i.e. the economy is in and the feds are trying to simulate the economy by decreasing the benchmark rates and you are sure that the lender is n't going to increase his margins if the rate remains low for quite a substantial amount of time and i might assume there will be penalties for paying off a loan quicker

first i would want cash around the time i made the move   i would like enough for a 20 down payment moving expenses and enough for 6 months of mortgage payments on the existing house   this way if the house does not sell quickly you are safe   as you approach the time it comes to move you can work backwards on how much time you would need to accumulate that kind of money second this does not have to be an all or nothing kind of thing   perhaps you use some of the proceeds to beef up your retirement some to pay down the mortgage and some for savings   you could be very wrong about the market even so it is a wonderful opportunity to add to your nest egg at such a young age   my own self prefers to do things in ratios   in your case i might do 10 of the proceeds in for retirement 10 for savings and 80 for mortgage reduction   you may want to also add some charitable giving    i really like paying down the mortgage   not only is it a risk less investment it reduces your personal risk

this strategy will have long lasting effects since negative items can persist for many years making financing a home difficult the primary source of household credit it is also very risky   you can play hard but then the creditor may choose you to be the one that they make an example out of by suing you for a judgement that allows them to empty your accounts and garnish your wages if you have no record of late payments or they are old and/or few your credit score will quickly shoot up if you pay down to 10 of the balance keep the cards and maintain that balance rate this strategy will have them begging you to take on more credit with offers of lower interest rates   the less credit you take on the more they 'll throw at you and when it comes time to purchase a home more home can be bought because your interest rates will be lower

my opinion including the value of depreciating property one owns in a net worth calculation is silly but could be interesting you do n't expect your tv or laptop to gain value   instead you expect them to decrease in value every year until you replace them   anything you expect to hold or increase in value art a house etc is a different story if you 'd like to really get anal about this you can track your net worth like a business would track its balance sheet   i 'm not going to go into detail but the general idea is that when you purchase an item you debit the cost from cash and add the value paid to assets so your net worth does n't change when you make a purchase    you then depreciate the value of the item under assets according to a depreciation schedule   if you plan on replacing your laptop every three years you might subtract 33 of the value every year    this could be an interesting exercise i.e. even if you make money your net worth may decrease because of all the depreciating junk you own but my hunch is that it would n't be worth the effort it requires

mrchrister 's answer is just plain wrong your history of carrying debt or paying interest has nothing to do with your credit score the biggest factors are payment history debt to available credit ratio and length of credit history if you have active credit accounts for 5 years have 10 15k in limits on credit cards and put gas and groceries on a credit card that is paid in full each month you 'll have a top notch credit rating there is no way to tell from a credit report whether you carry a balance for pay in full anyone who gets into debt to improve a credit score is ignorant of the process if you have bad credit here 's how you improve it

one of the reasons apart from historical is that different people have different tax liabilities which the employer may not be aware of for example in the us we do n't pay taxes in source on investment income and there are many credits and deductions that we ca n't take so if i have a child and some interest income from my savings account employer 's withholding will not match my actual tax liability there are credits for children additional taxes for the interest and the actual tax brackets vary based on my marital status and filing options i chose so even the same family of two people married will pay different amounts in taxes if they chose to file separate tax returns for each than if they chose to file jointly on one tax return for anyone who 've lived anywhere else like you and me this system is ridiculously complex and inefficient but for americans that works mainly for the reason of not knowing anything better and more importantly not wanting to know

it is going to save you more money in the long run to pay at once with cash if you take out a loan you will pay interest on the balance costing you money if you pay off the balance immediately there is no difference between the options and your question becomes irrelevant   there is no credit rating benefit to placing large purchases on your cards especially since your credit is fine my advice is to pay in cash in this case mostly because it makes you feel the purchase this is what you are describing in your question this instinct helps you recognize potential problems instead of masking them with debt questions like do i need this   am i myself financially with this purchase   am i holding enough cash on hand for emergencies you may be fine in these areas but i would still argue that cash makes you a better buyer because the expense feels much more significant making you more cautious and   you are right to feel these things before dropping a large sum of money let it inform you and help you make better decisions do n't mask it or be paralyzed by it

the slips from your bank for your hsa account are for an account already established and thus the bank is willing to accept your deposits even if they arrive at the bank after the april 15 deadline as long as the postmark   is april 15 or earlier the account exists in the bank they know who you are and that the payment is received after april 15 is just due to the normal or even abnormal delays in postal delivery for the new account that you tried to establish with appropriate and timely postmark etc the credit union could not   have received the paperwork as of the close of business on april 15 except in the very unlikely circumstance that a local letter deposited in the mailbox in the morning gets delivered the same day by usps do n't extrapolate from stories of how mail was delivered in london in victorian times ergo you did not   have an hsa account in the credit union as of april 15 and they are perfectly correct in refusing to open an account with a april 15 date and put money into it for the previous tax year to answer the question asked   are they allowed to ignore the postmark date yes not only are they allowed to ignore the postmark date the irs insists that they ignore the postmark date the credit union prefers to report only the truth as of april 15 you had not established an hsa account as of april 15 to say otherwise would be making a false statement to the irs

rolling an old 401k into a new 401k is generally only for ease of management for example how many bank accounts do you really want as long as the funds are reasonably allocated i 've found it can be a useful mind game to leave it separate sometimes it 's desirable to ignore an account and let it grow and it is a nice surprise when finally adding all the account balances together in other words i keep thinking i 've got x the amount of my biggest or current 401k which affects helps my habits and desire to save when i add them all together i 'm shocked to find out i 've got y the total of all accounts personally i 've had big paperwork problems transferring an old 403b same type process as 401k even when i had an adviser helping me move it in the end it was worth moving it because i 'm having the adviser manage it i 'm actually writing this answer specifically because i recently moved a big 401k into a traditional ira a rep from the brokerage representing my previous employer kept calling me to find out how they could help i did n't brush him off i found that using an ira provided me with the opportunity to do self guided investments in funds or even individual stocks well beyond the limited selection of the old company 's 401k it was useful interesting to me to invest in low fee vehicles such as index funds ie the buffett recommendation and i 'll find some stocks as well oh and when the old company 401k has certain funds being discontinued i did n't want to notice the mandated changes years later so i 'd suggest you consider management and flexibility of the 401k or equivalent and any of your special personal circumstances goals if you end up with a few retirement accounts i suggest you use an account aggregating website to see or follow your net worth i know many who based on various concerns and their portfolio find an acceptable website to use

if you want to retire in 7 years at age 35 and only currently have 150k and you need to ask this question of how to invest your money risk free then you will not be retiring at age 35 nor buying your house   it is possible to do but not risk free in fact you will need to take quite a bit of risk but you would need to have a detailed plan about how you would go about to achieve this goal what assets you would be investing in and what risk management you would have in place if you have to ask this question all you have is a goal but no plan you probably will need to do plenty of research in the types of investment you prefer and develop a plan to take you to your destination this could take you a year or 10 years depending on how motivated you are in your goals

i would also check into whether you can keep using your credit card instead of switching to a debit card tied to your checking account   the credit card provides you protection from someone wiping your account out   most banks will help you get the money back if this happens while using a debit card   but you are out the money while the bank figures out who is wrong   in the credit cards case none of your money is actually taken from your account while you dispute the charge i also agree with the others that having all your money in one account is more difficult to keep real spending money separate from emergency fund money

my suggestion would be to keep it the value of a new car is that you get to drive it around when it 's still new and shiny and that you know its history if you maintain it in good condition both mechanically and then you can have both of those benefits for the life of the car your question the old car sale and new car purchase transactions together but that 's not correct the value of your 2010 car has no relationship to the value of any new car you might buy except incidentally through the market forces that act on each the car dealership is likely to be skilled at making you feel like your most important criteria are satisfied but they will try to construct the deal to maximize the money you pay them while making you feel like you 're the one maximizing your value also note that the dealership can not give you maximum value for your car because it costs them money to sell it and they take all the risk some of the difference between typical direct sale and trade in prices is the commission you are paying them to both sell it for you and absorb the risks in the transaction

1 i think the phrase variable annuity is a glowing red flag a corollary to that is that any strategy that uses insurance for a purpose e.g. tax avoidance other than protecting against loss rates at least a yellow flag 2 the other really obvious indicator is a return that is completely out of whack with the level of risk they are saying the investment has for example if someone promises a 10 annual return that is completely safe or very low risk run 3 if it is advertised on tv radio or all your friends are talking about it at parties stay away example investing in gold coins or the hot tech ipo 4 the whole sales pitch relies on past returns as proof that the investment will do well without any real discussion of other reasons it will continue to to well beware the gambler 's fallacy 5 finally be very wary of anyone who has some sort of great investment plan that they will teach you if you just pay $ x or go to their seminar fee based advice is fine but people selling a get rich quick vehicle typically know the real way to get rich is to get suckers to pay for their seminars

assuming you are executing your order on a registered exchange by a registered broker your order will be filled at the best bid price available   this is because brokers are legally obliged to get the best price available for example if the market is showing a bid of 49.99 and an offer of and you submit an order to offer 1000 shares at 5.00 your order will be filled at 49.99   this is assuming the existing bids are for enough shares to fill all of the 1000 shares being offered   if the share you are offering lacks the necessary liquidity to fill the order i.e. the 49.99 bid is for less than 1000 shares and the level two bids are not enough to fill the remaining shares then the order would be posted in the market as an offer to sell the balance 1000 shares filled at 49.99 and those filled at level two bids at 5.00    i 'm pretty sure that the scenario you are describing would be described as market manipulation and it would be against the law

through your question and then clarification through the comments it looks like you have a u.s. llc with at least two members   if you did not elect some other tax treatment your llc will be treated as a partnership by the irs   the partnership should file a tax return on form 1065   then each partner will get a schedule k-1 from the partnership which the partner should use to include their respective shares of the partnership income and expenses on their personal forms 1040 you can also elect to be taxed as an s corp or a c corp instead of a partnership but that requires you to file a form explicitly making such election   if you go s corp then you will file a different form for the company but the procedure is roughly the same income gets passed through to the owners via a schedule k-1   if you go c corp then the owners will pay no tax on their own form 1040 but the c corp itself will pay income tax as far as whether you should try to spend the money as business expense to avoid paying extra tax that 's highly dependent on your specific situation   i 'd think you 'd want to get tailored advice for that

it 's a form of debt issued by the united states treasury as the name implies a 10-year note is held for 10 years after which you get the face value in cash and it pays interest twice per year it 's being used in the calculator to stand for a readily available medium term nearly risk free investment as a means of discounting the value that the company gains the explanation for why the discounting is done can be found on the page you linked as a canadian you could use the yield of comparable canadian treasury securities as quoted by bank of canada which seem to have had the bottom fall out since the new year although i do n't suppose american notes would be hard for a canadian investor to come by so if you wanted to be conservative you could use the us figure as long as it 's higher

i would n't focus too much on dividends itself at the end of the day what matters is total gain because you can convert capital gain into income by selling your assets they have different tax implications but generally capital gains tend to be more tax efficient     i think the more important question is how much volatility you can tolerate since your investment horizon is short your risk tolerance is low as in if you suddenly get much lower income than you planned from your investment you 'll be in trouble you probably want assets that have low volatility    to achieve that i 'd consider the following if i were you tl;dr if i were you i 'd just hold a general investment portfolio with a lower risk profile rather than focusing on dividend generating assets

you have a lack of credit history   lending is still tight since the recession and companies are n't as willing to take a gamble on people with no history the secured credit card is the most direct route to building credit right now i do n't think you 're going to be applicable for a department store card pointless anyways and encourages wasteful spending nor the gas card gas cards are credit cards funded through a bank just like any ordinary credit card only you are limited to gas purchases at a particular retailer although gas cards department store cards and other limited usage types of credit cards have less requirements in this post financial crisis economy credit is still stringent and a no history file is too risky for banks to take on having multiple hard inquiries wo n't help either you do have a full time job that pays well so the $ 500 deposit should n't be a problem for the secured credit card after 6 months you 'll get it back anyways just remember to pay off in full every month after 6 months you 'll be upgraded to a regular credit card and you will have established credit history

answering this question is weird because it is not really precise in what you mean do you want all stocks in the us do you want a selection of stocks according to parameters   do you just want a cool looking graph however your possible misuse of the word derivative my interest your reference to   gold and silver seems to indicate that you do not know what a derivative actually is or what it would do in a portfolio   the straightforward way to see an efficient frontier is to do the following for a set of stocks in this case six randomly selected ones                rai amzn msft twx from = 2012 06 01 to = 2017 06 01      returns lt;- null   tickerlist lt;- rai amzn msft twx   for ticker in tickerlist    returns lt;-     lt;- tickerlist   returns lt;-     frontier lt;-   width = 800 height = 600   which = all       constraints =     portfolio weights         rai    amzn    msft     twx             covariance risk budgets         rai    amzn    msft     twx             target returns and risks    mean            var          the minimum variance portfolio of these six assets has a mean return is and variance is amzn does not get any weight in the portfolio   it kind of means that the other assets span it and it does not provide any additional diversification benefit    let us add two etfs that track gold and silver to the mix and see how little difference it makes     from = 2012 06 01 to = 2017 06 01     returns lt;- null   tickerlist lt;- rai amzn msft twx gld   for ticker in tickerlist    returns lt;-     lt;- tickerlist   returns lt;-    frontier lt;-     width = 800 height = 600         optimal weights   out lt;- constraints =   lt;-   lt;-   lt;-   lt;- optimal portfolio     equal weights   lt;- 8)   lt;-   lt;-   lt;- equal weights portfolio    width = 800 height = 600   =   chart ylim = c(0 2   chart ylim = c(0 2   chart main = drawdown ylim = 0   chart main = drawdown ylim = 0         adding gold changes the minimum variance mean return to and the variance stays about the same you can see how the weights change at different return and variance profiles in the picture   the takeaway is that adding gold decreases the return but does not do a lot for the risk of the portfolio   you also notice that silver does not get included in the minimum variance efficient portfolio and neither does amzn     we can also compare the optimal weights to an equally weighted portfolio and see that the latter would have performed better but had much   larger drawdowns which is because it has a higher volatility which might be undesirable     everything below here is false but illustrative   so what about the derivative part let us assume you bought an out of the money call option with a strike of 50 on msft at the beginning of the   time series and held it to the end   we need to decide on the the annualized cost of carry rate the annualized rate of interest the time to maturity is measured in years the annualized   volatility of the underlying security is by the historical volatility       lt;- months   t lt;- 60 months 5 years   vol lt;- annualized volatility     lt;- 60 1   for t in    s lt;-    lt;- = c s = s x = 50 time = t t 12 r = 0.001 b = 0.001 sigma = vol    lt;-       lt;-   lt;-     lt;-   lt;-     returns lt;-     lt;- 9     lt;-   lt;-   lt;- equal weights derivative portfolio     width = 800 height = 600   =   chart ylim = c(0 4.5   chart ylim = c(0 4.5   chart main = drawdown ylim = 0   chart main = drawdown ylim = 0        even though we have a massively profitable instrument in the derivative the portfolio analysis does not include it   because of the high volatility however if we just use equal weighting and essentially take a massive position in   the out of the money call which would not be possible in real life we get huge drawdowns and volatility but   the returns are almost two fold but nobody will sell you a five year call   others can correct any mistakes or misunderstandings in the above it hopefully gives a starting point   read more at      the album

there is no tax code i know that would grant you such a privilege and it just is n't in your examples you always sold your product and were thus able in retrospect to give a value to your work what if you do n't sell your product what if in one case your worked hour is reimbursed with one price with the next product at another i.e. difference in margin no it wo n't work like that   and by the way i think you might have got some definitions upside down what you want is a salary that your own company pays out to yourself and you can deduct from other profits but as long as you ca n't afford to pay yourself a salary and you do n't have access to investors who are willing to front you the money the time invested is your personal investment and can not be deducted anywhere though it might pay off nicely in the long run that 's the risk entrepreneurs take

you can invest another $ 5,500 in your roth ira each year so you can invest up to $ 11,000 between the two tax years additionally you can make investments for the previous year up until 15 april the following year in your case that will be close to graduation time and you may decide to max out the contribution for 2014 but wait until you are settled into a new job before setting those savings aside long term when you start your first job there will likely also be an option to invest in a 401k you can still have the advantages of a roth but you will be limited to the investments available in the plan most employers i 've seen today still offer a low cost index fund but you may have to speak up at a company meeting to pressure them to include one of those options in the plan with a 401k your limit increases to $ make sure that the index fund you invest in has the lowest possible expense ratio i use voo depending on trading fees etc you might pick something else

using your uber vs. medallion taxi driver as an example   the problem in the sharing economy is an individual working as an independent contractor takes on all the risk and diminishing rewards while the profit of the company to which the individual is contracted increases significantly    case in point with uber let 's say you decide you want to drive for you lease a prius and thus are on the hook financially for $ 350/month + $ 100/month insurance + $ 300/month gas and other car expenses and you 'll have that for three years that 's a $ 750 nut    your nut remains the same but you have very little protection to ensure that your earnings are going to continue to come in especially if you look at it long term i am most familiar with the ridesharing market here in seattle and just in the last two years the number of ridesharing drivers lyft sidecar has exceeded an estimated 3,000 sure the customer base grows but there is also a continuing influx of additional drivers competing for those fares with the medallion system there is some level of protection to ensure that the industry remains viable for those who carry a medallion i am not advocating completely for this system and realize that the the government protection gave to the taxi industry led to customer service quality issues    so back to uber as uber fights for market share both capturing from the taxi industry but also competing against lyft and people driving their own cars they lower prices in some cases these lower prices have been in the form of discounts in some cases lower fares in seattle currently the minimum fare for an ride is $ 4 it was $ 6 a year ago uber takes a 20 percent cut from drivers and also charges drivers $ 10 a week to use their service if a driver makes $ 1000 a week in fares they pull down $ 800 of that after taxes let 's call it $ 600 so over the course of a month you 're looking at $ 2400 minus your nut including phone rental let 's call it $ 1600 take home pay    these people are n't getting rich to begin with and are at a huge risk for when uber or lyft or task rabbit or whoever decides to cut their prices again these services are beyond great for the consumer but are a temporary for anyone relying on them for work the big problem here is that companies like uber are advertising heavily that you can make $ on their service enticing people to make investments in things like cars to drive with them but at the end of the day you 're an independent contractor and uber owes you nothing    i believe uber i single them out because i think lyft is a little better at this on the ignorance of potential drivers to lure them into the system

i 've done exactly what you are describing and it was a great move for me a few years back i had two credit cards one had a $ 6000 balance and a fairly high interest rate that i was making steady payments to including interest   the other was actually tied to a heloc home equity line of credit whose interest rate was fixed to prime which was very low at the time i think my effective rate on the card was around 3   so i pulled out one of the cash advance checks from the heloc account and paid off the $ 6000 balance then i started making my monthly payments against the balance on the heloc and paid it off a bit more quickly and with less overall money spent because i was paying way less interest another similar tactic is to find a card that does n't charge fees for balance transfers and that has a 0 interest rate for the first 12 months on transferred balances i am pretty sure they are out there open an account on that card transfer the balance to it and pay it down within 12 months and try not to use the card for anything else if you can help it

often if your realtor and the selling realtor know each other your realtor will discover what price the seller really wants do n't worry about how this is done there will be no evidence it occurred your realtor will then drop hints that you should aim for that price to ensure the deal goes smoothly that sounds like what your realtor is doing when he says if you want to play ball offer them $ 80k he wo n't stop you from bidding lower but he knows where you 'll end up   price is just one part of the transaction however you can offer $ 80 k to meet their price but also request that the seller make recommended repairs or credit you the cost you can request that the seller cover closing costs or transfer taxes or any other costs in short offering the seller x does n't mean you will pay x. i personally try to avoid credits because although they make your effective price lower the actual purchase price still drives things such as your loan and in many places your property taxes and other taxes i would rather reduce the price than get credits but you do what you have to do if you want the deal you can also request that certain appliances be included such as a refrigerator or a washing machine and dryer you can ask for furniture or in the backyard or anything else you liked when you saw the house in short you offer x for the house but you also get a bunch of other stuff that you need or want

what would be the consequences if they do realize their error some day    in the far future you 've informed them of the error and they 've informed you that nevertheless the points are yours and you should use them so you have a couple of issues have you made what your jurisdiction considers a reasonable effort to correct the mistake and did the customer service rep actually have the authority to make such a large goodwill gesture as letting you keep all the points the first is your legal responsibility otherwise you 're stealing and you need to know specifically for your jurisdiction whether a phone call is sufficient i ca n't tell you that maybe you should send them a letter maybe you should wait until you 've had written confirmation from them maybe you 're ok as you are you might be able to get free advice from some body that helps with consumer issues here in the uk you could ask citizen 's advice the second is beyond your ability to know for sure but it 's not dishonest to work on the basis that what the company 's proper representative tells you is true with the usual caveats that i 'm not qualified to give legal advice once told you 've been clearly told that it 's an intentional gift i do n't see any way you could be held to have done anything fraudulent if you then go about enjoying it the worst case far future problem i would expect is that someone decides the gift was never legitimately made in the first place in other words the company made two separate errors first crediting the card and then telling you the erroneous points stand in that case you might have to pay them back whatever you 've spent on the card beyond the points you 're entitled to to avoid this you 'd need to establish what constitutes a binding gift in your jurisdiction so that you can say no the point balance was not erroneous and here 's the legal reason why and pay them nothing you might also need to consider any tax implications in receiving such a large gift and of course before paying tax on it if that 's necessary you 'd probably want to bug them for confirmation in writing that it really is yours if that written confirmation is n't forthcoming then so be it they 've the gift and i doubt you 're inclined to take them to court demanding that they stand by the words of their rep use them and play stupid it 's not my duty to check their math right   that 's potentially fraud or theft if you lie you did notice and even worse they have proof you noticed since you made the call so never say you did n't notice if you had n't called them yet then you 've been given something in error and your jurisdiction will have an opinion on what your responsibilities are so if you had n't already called them i would strongly suggest that you should call them or write to them about it to give them the opportunity to correct the error or at least seek assurance that in your jurisdiction all errors in the customer 's favour are final otherwise you 're in the position of them accidentally handing you their wallet without realising and you deciding to keep it without telling them my guess is that 's unlikely to be a legally binding gift and might legally be theft or fraud on your part

unless you have an actual hardship bankruptcy or other emergency you will be better off leaving that money alone this excellent answer gives more than enough reasons why a withdrawal or loan is not recommended   i would love some advice because i need to know if i should contribute more into my 401k or less if your priority to purchase is high enough it may be worth considering stopping 401k contributions for a short time to help pile up a down payment   i also encourage you to consider that if you can not pool the money from non retirement sources then you can not afford that much house at this time this might mean looking for cheaper houses or delaying purchase for a number of years

imo would have been a solid idea 10 20 years ago but i 'm not sure how they are going to monetize it i think it 's a great value add for the mall but i ca n't see users paying each time they use it or for an allotted time i think the only way it would be successful for the company who makes operates the booths is if the mall is paying them a fee for having them in their mall but offer it as a free service for their attendees    with the number of people physically going to malls decreasing due to online retailers i do n't see this as a forward thinking idea my view is limited though i ca n't say i know shopping habits or trends in china

people often have the wrong idea about how taxes apply to their money   there 's not really any such thing as pre tax or post tax income only pre tax and post tax uses of your income   this is somewhat hidden by the fact that we pay income tax based on our income for the year but if you look a bit closer you 'll notice that come april 15th almost every dollar you get to subtract from your gross income is n't defined by where it comes from but rather where it went there are a few special cases there like qualified dividends that that 's an entirely different issue   perhaps the most clear example of this is a traditional ira that you self fund from your savings account on april 14th for the prior tax year you 're putting dollars you 've already taken home into a pre tax account after the end of the calendar tax year and yet it all works out exactly the same tax liability wise there 's certainly an opportunity cost there as if you had contributed those dollars via a weekly payroll deduction   so when you manually fund a roth ira it has no effect on your tax liability except insofar as you do n't get to deduct it from your taxable income which you would n't if you had left it in a savings account   in the year you earned that money you paid taxes on it when you take it out you wo n't

4 finally do all companies reduce their stock price when they pay a dividend are they required to there seems to be confusion behind this question   a company does not set the price for their stock so they ca n't reduce it either   in fact nobody sets the price for a stock the price you see reported is simply the last price that the stock was traded at   that trade was just one particular trade in a whole sequence of trades   the price used for the trade is simply the price which the particular buyer and particular seller agreed to for that particular trade   no agreement well then no trade   there 's no authority for the price other than the collection of all buyers and sellers so what happens when nokia declares a 55 cent dividend   when they declare there is to be a dividend they state the record date which is the date which determines who will get the dividend the owners of the shares on that date are the people who get the dividend payment   the stock exchanges need to account for the payment so that investors know who gets it and who does n't so they set the ex dividend date which is the date on which trades of the stock will first trade without the right to receive the dividend payment   ex dividend is usually about 2 days before record date   these dates are established well before they occur so all market participants can know exactly when this change in value will occur when trading on ex dividend day begins there is no authority to set a different price than the previous day 's closing price   what happens is that all knowledgeable market participants know that today nokia is trading without the payment 55 cents that buyers the previous day get   so what do they do   they take that into consideration when they make an offer to buy stock and probably end up offering a price that is about 55 cents less than they would have otherwise   similarly sellers know they will be getting that 55 cents so when they choose a price to offer their stock at it will likely be about that much less than they would have asked for otherwise

this is a very vague question and could not be fairly answered without knowing additional details some examples would be   what is the total revenue of the non profit what are the total expenses of the non profit what is the effectiveness rate to the cause of each $ 1 donated   non profit organizations and charities have grown to large scale business operations that are focused on delivering value to their determined cause   the top 5 largest charities each had total revenues over $ 3.3 billion in 2012   this included united way goodwill the y and the salvation army with the largest being the y at over $ 6.2 billion in annual revenue   all of these non profits bring in enough revenue to be in the fortune 500 the company on the list is mining corp at $ 3.2 billion in revenue   when you consider the scale of these operations i think you need to acquire an experienced ceo that has a career history of leading large and many times multi national organization   these ceos command high salaries because of their talent and expertise   i believe when they are passionate about a cause they 're willing to take a discount but you have to understand the term discount proportionately   i made a quick table below just to provide some context and show reference points of several fortune 500 companies in comparison to the y the largest non profit in total revenue   you can quickly see that a salary of $ 450,000 for an organization of this size would be a significant discount in comparison to the ceo salaries of comparably sized organization in the for profit world   when considering charitable contributions it is entirely valid to consider the ceo 's salary but also consider the potential value add   for example if that ceo generates a significantly more effective ratio of utilizing donated $ then it may justify the salary    in some scenarios it is fair to say that $ 450,000 would be a fair and adequate salary for a ceo running a large scale non profit   is this the case for every non profit   probably not   it should often be thought of as a function of total revenue and effectiveness of the $ donated      company | 2013 revenue | 2013 ceo salary | ratio | $ | $ m | .15 corp | $ | $ m | northeast utilities | $ | $ 1.7 m | technologies | $ | $ m | .17 the y | $ | $ m |

the point of short selling as a separate instrument is that you can you do it when you ca n't sell the underlying asset usually because you do n't actually own any of it and in fact believe that it will go down shorting allows you to profit from a falling price another non speculative possibility is that you do n't have the underlying asset right now and thus ca n't sell it but will get it at a certain point in the future e.g. because it 's bonds that you 've used to guarantee a loan or grain that 's still growing on your fields

i 'll answer in general terms since i 'm not familiar with the price ranges in florida the llc formation costs $ 125 state fee in addition you 'll need a registered agent registered agent could be your cpa ea bookkeeper property manager local friend or you can pay firms specializing in providing registration and agents services such as northwestern or legalzoom there are many others you 'll need to pay an annual fee of in florida if you are using someone to do the formation they 'll charge more usually the on line services are cheaper than a local cpa or attorney by $ bookkeeping will probably be charged by the hour but some charge flat fees for small accounts per hour would be probably in the range of $ you 'll have to pay taxes both in florida where the property is and on the federal level to the irs you 'll be paying them as a non resident individual your cpa ea will charge you anywhere between $ 150 to $ 500 for that if they charge more run away unless there 's some specific complication that requires extra costs you will need a itin for that your cpa ea can help you get one or you can apply yourself   be careful with all those people selling about organizing in delaware wyoming nevada like cqm in his answer organizing in a state other than where the properties are located or off shore wo n't save you a dime and not only that it will add to the costs because you 'll have to pay to the state where you organized cqm mentioned wyoming $ keep registered agent in the state of organization + $ 99 and also do all the things i 've described above about florida as a foreign out of state entity which may mean higher fees it wo n't save you any taxes as well because you pay taxes to the state from which you derive income which is florida either way remember that what you call llc in italy may be in fact a corporation as defined in the us and there 's a huge difference you should probably not put a real estate property in a corporation in the us you must get a legal advice from a florida lawyer $ consultation and a tax advice from a florida cpa ea $ consultation do not consider anything i write here as a legal or tax advice because it is not you need a professional to help you because as an italian you do n't know how things work exactly and relying on and half truths that you may find and get over the internet may end up costing you significantly in damages also talk to a reliable real estate agent and property manager before making any purchases

paypal is free for buyers taking their profit from the sellers in much the same way that credit cards take a percentage from the seller though they will also charge you interest if you do n't pay off the entire balance every month as far as i know there 's nothing that keeps a vendor from having a different price for paypal customers than cash customers but that would show up in the number displayed by paypal before you authorize the purchase so if you 're paying attention it should n't be possible to sneak it by you paypal has several modes of operation i 'm not aware of one where they hold your balance normally you either give them your credit card info or you give them information about one of your bank account(s and authorize them to do electronic funds transfer from and to that account on your behalf i 've always stuck with the credit card approach i trust paypal but i do n't trust them that far on principle if i was going to link them to an account it would be a small account i 'd create for that purpose not my main savings checking accounts hm actually i do have one account which normally floats around $ 500 it 's the one i dump accumulated pocket change into and i could use that if i ever feel a need to do so paypal does reduce the risk of credit card numbers being abused by reducing how many people you 've given the number to depending on what kinds of purchases you make that may be a security advantage it certainly does n't hurt personally i have no problem with giving my card number directly to a serious business but on ebay or sites of that sort where i 'm dealing with individuals who are complete strangers i do like the isolation that paypal provides in other words ebay is exactly the environment where i do use paypal after all that 's exactly what paypal was created for
