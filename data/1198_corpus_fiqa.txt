you are confusing entirely unrelated things first the profit distribution issue with bob 's s corp which is in fact tax evasion and will probably trigger a very nasty audit generally if you 're the sole employee of your own s corp and the whole s corp income is from your own personal services as defined by the irs there 's no profit there all the net income from such a s corp is subject to se tax either through payroll or through your k-1 claiming anything else would be lying and irs is notorious for going after people doing that second the issue the reason employers classify employees as contractors is to avoid payroll taxes which the irs gets through bob 's s corp so it does n't care and providing benefits that is bob 's problem not the irs so in the scenario above the irs would n't care whose employee bob is since bob 's s corp would have to pay all the same payroll taxes the is an issue when employees are abused see examples of fedex drivers where they 're classified as contractors and are not getting any benefits spend their own money on the truck and maintenance etc the employees are the ones who sued for but in this case the irs would be interested as well since a huge chunk of payroll taxes was not paid driver 's net is after car maintenance and payments not before as it would be if he was salaried so in your scenario is not as much a concern to bob as his tax evasion scheme claiming earnings from performing personal services as profits from s corp a precedent to look at as i mentioned elsewhere would be the watson v commissioner case

yes edmunds gets money from the dealerships in this program according to this usa today article from 2013 dealers pay edmunds a monthly fee to participate in the program   this contrasts with a similar service where dealers pay a fee for each sale and yes it is certainly possible to negotiate a lower price than the edmunds price promise quote if you enjoy haggling   the purpose of the program is not to get you the best price just the easiest buying experience    from the usa today article edmunds.com 's price promise business model is designed to take the uncertainty out of pricing speed up the buying process and also comes with the expectation that the customer will be given top notch customer service dealers who have participated find that they are able to sell their cars for $ 300 to $ 500 more than consumers who go through the more traditional price quote request process customers edmunds.com president and chief operating officer seth said are willing to pay a little more than the best possible deal if they can save time get great customer service and know they are getting a fair price

you will be able to use the subsequent 4 matching contributions as repayments toward the hbp in the same tax year you can designate it as such when you do your tax return for the year note that the first payment for hbp will be in the second year after you withdraw from your rrsp but you are free to designate any contributions before this time toward the hbp repayment one blog post indicates that if you pay more than the minimum amount in any year including pre payments prior to the first required payment future payments will be the remaining amount owing divided by the number of payment years remaining my experience with my llp repayment similar to hbp is the same

there is no equation only data that would help you come to the decision that 's right for you   assuming the 401(k is invested in a stock fund of one sort or another the choice is nearly the same as if you had $ 5 k cash to either invest or pay debt   since stock returns are not fixed but are a random distribution that somewhat resembles a bell curve median about 10 standard deviation about 14 it 's the age old question of getting a guaranteed x% paying the debt or a shot at 8 10 or so in the market this come up frequently in the decision to pre pay mortgages at 4 5 versus invest many people will take the guaranteed 4 return vs the risk that comes with the market for your decision the 401(k loan note that the loan is due if you separate from the company for whatever reason this adds an additional layer of risk and another data point to the mix for your exact numbers the savings is barely $ 50 i 'd probably not do it if the cards were 18 i 'd lean toward the loan but only if i knew i could raise the cash to pay it back to not default

a lot of investors prefer to start jumping into tools and figuring out from there but i 've always said that you should learn the theory before you go around applying it so you can understand its shortcomings   a great starting point is investopedia 's introduction to technical analysis there you can read about the idea of technical analysis how it compares to other strategies what some of the big ideas are and quite a bit about various chart patterns cup and handle flags head shoulders etc you 'll also cover ideas like moving averages and after that charting and technical analysis by fred should be your next stop the material in the book overlaps with what you 've read on investopedia but 's book is great for learning from examples and seeing the concepts applied in action the book is for new and does a good job explaining how to utilize all these charts and patterns and after finishing it you should be ready to invest on your own   if you make it this far feel free to jump into fidelity 's tools now and start applying what you 've learned you always want to make the connection between theory and practice so start   figuring out how you can use your new knowledge to generate good returns   eventually you should read the excellent reference text technical analysis of the financial markets by john murphy this book is like a murphy covers almost all the major techniques of technical analysts and helps you intuitively understand the reasoning behind them i 'd like to quote a part of a review here to show my point   what i    like about mr. murphy is his way of showing and proving a point let    me digress here to show you what i mean say you had a daughter and    wanted to show her how to figure out the area of an    well you could tell her to memorize that it is    or if you really wanted her to learn it thoroughly you    can show her how to draw a parallel line to the height then join the    ends to make a nice rectangle then to compute the area of a rectangle    just multiply the two sides one being the height the other being    half the base she will then derive this and    understand how they got the formula you see then she can    compute the area under a or a or any complex    object well mr. murphy will show us the same way and    derive for us concepts such as how a resistance line later    becomes a support line the for this is so amusing that after    one reads about it we just go wow now i understand why    this occurs murphy 's book is not about strategy or which tools to use he takes an objective approach to describing the basics about various tools and techniques and leaves it up to the reader to decide which tools to apply and when that 's why it 's pages and a great reference whenever you 're working   if you make it through and understand murphy then you 'll be golden again understand the theory first but make sure to see how it 's applied as well otherwise you 're just reading without any practical knowledge to quote richard feynman it does n't matter how beautiful your theory is it does n't matter how smart you are if it does n't agree with experiment it 's wrong   personally i think technical analysis is all bs and a waste of time and most of the top investors would agree but at the end of the day ignore everyone and stick to what works for you best of luck

you have not specified what country you are in that radically changes everything in case you are in canada there 's a great blog that covers bankruptcy and student loans at loan fundamentally in order to discharge government backed student loans you must have ceased to be a student for at least seven years prior to filing even then though the government can object in which case you will still have to repay some or all of the loan more generally given that the collection agency appears to be operating in bad faith you 'll want to ensure that they send you written documentation of any offer they are extending you if they refuse to do this you should assume that they are n't actually offering you anything at all and you will have to pay back the full amount plus interest and penalties note that in many countries if you settle the debt that is pay anything less than the full amount plus interest and penalties this will be a black mark on your credit report in this case if you repaid the full $ 16,000 and they the extra $ 4,000 they would most likely still add a note to your credit report indicating that you did not pay the full amount that you owed and this will negatively impact your credit rating even beyond your late payments

dealerships make a lot of money in the finance department   one of the thing they play upon is your emotional reaction of purchasing a new vehicle new to you in this case   they perform all sorts of shenanigans like adding selling gap insurance or extended warranties   they entice you with a promise of a lower interest rate but really what they are trying to do is back you into a payment    so if you can fiance 20,000 but the car you are buying is 16,000 then they will try to move that figure up to the 20 k mark   in your case it sounded like some borderline at the least illegal activity they used to fool you into paying more   it sounds like you regret this decision which puts you a step ahead of most   how many people brag about the extended warranty or gap insurance they got included in the sale    as mentioned in another answer the best bet is to go into the dealership with financing in place   say you were able to get a 3 loan on   the total interest would be   if you avoid the finance room you might avoid their dubious add ons that would probably cost you more then the 1600 even if you can get 0    if you are going to buy a car on time my advice would be to not fill out a credit app at the dealership   the dealership people through a fit but hold your ground   if need be get up and walk out   they wo n't let you leave one thing i must mention is that one feels very wealthy without that monthly pain in the payment for a car   you may want to try and envision yourself without a car payment and make steps to making that a reality for the rest of your life

this is an extremely simplified version and not necessarily accurate c for example has $ in cash and tier 1 capital relative to other banks yes they need to write down debt but the larger concern as opposed to bankruptcy by capital markets is equity dilution    both c and bac need to raise equity capital due and due to new leverage restrictions will dilute existing shareholders so much that they will have difficulty matching previous eps also a lot of analysts expect thy are n't marking down assets enough reducing that large tier 1 buffer pretty heavily    one of the primary reasons they issue smaller dividends relative to jpm is that dividends for systematically important institutions must be approved by the fed now dodd frank they ca n't issue a big dividend because the fed says they are n't well capitalized enough    to say they are bankrupt though shows a misunderstanding of bank balance sheets and how the frb discount window works though

gt;what softbank seemed to do was lower prices in japan and offer better service   while i admire your rose optimism i really think you ought to ask someone actually living in japan and a former softbank customer to boot what the truth is   former in the sense that i quit their service around iphone 3 g time and will never go back to them   the only reason they 're even a player in japan is because they took the iphone before the other two networks and if you wanted apple 's beast they were the only choice   they are still the only provider with the ipad and despite wanting one for a while i refuse to buy one until it 's available on another network   a few choice items from their track record   their network has consistently been the slowest of the 3 main japanese networks with the worst coverage this is partly not their fault because when they bought vodafone it was already a shitty service but they 've had a few years to sort things out now and they 're still behind the bigger networks in most areas   they ran yahoo bb japan 's largest isp famous for outrageous hard selling shitty customer service and just about the slowest broadband speeds in the country for a major provider due to massively their capacity   they also had a bizarre and stubborn preference for when everyone else was selling optical fiber   they also run yahoo japan which while pretty much the biggest website in the country yahoo is still huge here has ridiculously inflated fees for stuff like auctions and other services we have no ebay   so they 're not averse to profiteering when the opportunity presents itself   if japan is anything to go by i would n't hold your breath   combining a third rate japanese operator with a third rate us one is n't the recipe for success

recently i asked about what the company valuation is and how many    shares does my 4 represent cfo told me that there is no point to talk    about shares or stock since the company is not public is it    right no it is wrong shares and stocks exist regardless of how they can be traded once a company is formed there are stocks that belong to the owners in the proportion of the ownership they may not exist physically but they do exist on paper as an owner of 5 of the company you own 5 of the company stocks i asked if my investor portion equity will be subjected under a    vesting schedule cfo said yes that does n't make sense to me because    i bought those 4 are n't those supposed to be fully vested i agree    to my employee equity to be vested does n't make sense to me either since your money is already in their pocket but i 'm not sure if its illegal if that 's what is written in the signed contract then may be its possible to have that situation but it does n't make much sense because these shares are granted to you in return to your money not some potential future work as the 1 employee 's portion you already gave the money so why would n't they be vested best to read the contract upon which you gave them your money i really hope you have at least that and not just gave them a check

the investopedia article you linked to is a good start its key takeaway is that you should always consider risk adjusted return when evaluating your portfolio in general investors seeking a higher level of return must face a higher likelihood of taking a loss risk different types of stocks large vs small international vs us different industry sectors have different levels of historical risk and return not to mention stocks vs bonds or other financial instruments so it 's key to make an apples to apples comparison against an appropriate benchmark a benchmark will tell you how your portfolio is doing versus a comparable portfolio an index such as the s&p 500 is often used because it tells you how your portfolio is doing compared against simply passively investing in a diversified basket of securities first i would start with analyzing your portfolio to understand its asset allocation you can use a tool like the morningstar x ray to do this you may be happy with the asset allocation or this tool may inform you to adjust your portfolio to meet your long term goals the next step will be to choose a benchmark given that you are investing primarily in non us securities you may want to pick a globally diversified index such as the dow jones global index depending on the region and stock characteristics you are investing in you may want to pick a more specialized index such as the ones listed here in this wsj list with your benchmark set you can then see how your portfolio 's returns compare to the index over time irr and roi are helpful metrics in general especially for corporate finance but the comparison based approach gives you a better picture of your portfolio 's performance you can still calculate your personal irr and make sure to include factors such as tax treatment and investment expenses that may not be fully reflected by just looking at benchmarks also you can calculate the metrics listed in the investopedia article such as the sharpe ratio to give you another view on the risk adjusted return

first you should probably have a proper consultation with a licensed tax adviser ea cpa licensed in your state in fact you should have had it before you started but that ship has sailed you 're talking about start up expenses you can generally deduct up to $ 5000 in the year your business starts and the expenses in excess will be amortized over 180 months 15 years this is per the irc sec the amortization starts when your business is active i.e. you can buy the property but not actually open the restaurant you can not start the depreciation i have a couple questions about accounting should all the money i    spent be a part of capital spending or is it just a part of it if it qualifies as start up organizational expenses it should be capitalized if it is spent on capital assets then it should also be capitalized but for different reasons and differently for example costs of filing paperwork for permits is a start up expense buying a commercial oven is a capital asset purchase which should be depreciated separately as buying the tables and if it is a salary expense to your employees then it is a current expense and should n't be capitalized our company is llc if this matters   it matters to how it affects your personal tax return

ianal   in the uk you as a director would have obligations to minimise any tax liabilities under these two clauses       although i ca n't see the cps bringing any cases of criminal charge against over payment of taxes it would n't be unrealistic to have a scenario where shareholders of a failed enterprise sued a director who was negligent in tax liabilities   that said i think the starbucks strategy is breaching the intent of the law if not the letter

if you selected a mortgage that allows additional payments to be credited against the principal rather than as early payment of normal installments them yes doing so will reduce the actual cost of the loan you may have to explicitly instruct the bank to use the money this way each time if prepay is their default assumption check with your lender and/or read the terms of your mortgage to find out if this is allowed and how to do it if your mortgage does n't allow additional payments against the principal you may want to consider refinancing into a mortgage which does or into a mortgage with shorter term and higher monthly payments to obtain the same lower cost closing costs on the new mortgage run the numbers

no you will generally speaking not see a decrease in your net earnings from crossing a tax bracket this means that your highest marginal rate the top bracket you fall into only applies to the portion of your income that is in that bracket not your total income this helps ensure that your total tax burden does not increase from crossing a tax bracket be aware that you can still see measurable changes in your total taxes due if increases in income make you no longer eligible for certain deductions and/or benefits that were otherwise reducing your tax burden but this is not the same as how changes in your highest marginal rate affect your overall average tax rate note that when you see a rate table such as the one on federal income tax rates page or on wikipedia 's income tax in the united states page the rates listed are for each segment of income not for your overall income in other words the 15 rate below for 2014 filing single only applies to the portion of your income falling between the listed numbers not to income below it or above it that would be calculated under the respective rates given you can use the tax tables to gain a sense of how this works in practice the linked resource is for 2014 taxes the threshold in 2014 for the 25 rate vs 15 was $ using the linked table if you were single and made between and in gross income your tax liability before other considerations was $ if you made between and your base tax liability was $

the idea behind this move is to avoid or mitigate long term deflationary pressure and to boost the competitiveness of swiss exporters this is primarily a swiss based initiative that does not appear likely to have a major impact on the broader eurozone however some pressure will be felt by other currencies as investors look to purchase ie this is not a great scenario for other countries wanting to keep their currencies weak in terms of personal wealth if you hold swiss f then you are impacted however 1.2 is still very strong most analysts cite 1.3 as more realistic so there seems little need for a reaction of any kind at the personal level at this time although diversity as ever is good it should also be noted that changing the peg is a possibility and that the 1.3 does seem to be the more realistic level if you hold large amounts of swiss f then this might cause you to look at your forex holdings for the man in the street probably not an issue

indeed there is conservation of money   if the insurance companies have those big buildings and television commercials and ceos then that money comes from only one place the insurance premiums of customers   to say insurance is a good deal is either the benefit and cost of insurance for most indeed of all the answers here james 's is best   if you ca n't afford to lose something it is vital to insure it   ideally insurance would be a non profit operation to best cover this   such that people would as a whole lose nothing   theoretically it could even be slightly for profit by making wise investment decisions and benefiting from the future value of money by beating inflation   but they do n't see this writeup for slightly dated information on health and this wikipedia article for more direction but even if you are taking an average loss by using a profit making insurance company by taking insurance you avoid the situation where you 're crippled by a catastrophe   you are paying a fee to hedge your losses   like james said insure what you can not afford to lose   but realize you 're going into a situation where the overall net is an average loss of between 10 50 of your money on average   basically you 're playing the lottery except your net losses mostly go to fund the company and the ceos rather than nominally support education but you sounded like you understood those ideas well so    can you self insure as others noted yes there is the option of self insurance in most places   even even often when insurance is considered as required   for example in the us basically car insurance coverage is required   but generally you are legally able to self insure to cover this requirement    the cost of self insuring there is one cost to self insure time   it takes time to research the laws time to to satisfy those requirements and then time to find setup all the care providers doctors mechanics lawyers etc when is it worth it   first again you must satisfy the prerequisite you are able to financially handle the loss of the topic under consideration at a commenter 's request here is an attempt to better spell out this requirement though it does n't appear pertinent to the question asked it is indeed very important not to mistakenly assume you satisfy this requirement can you comfortably cover the level of insurance you would otherwise be taking out   $ is a common reasonable insurance level so that would be $ 200,000   basically have enough money to cover the loss of your car your possible injury expenses and most importantly the damage and medical of anyone else you hit   you would need to have that value available optimally in your accounts   alternatively you could weigh it against your assets such that if you had low accounts but a paid off $ 200,000 house you could conceivably sell your property and still be able to survive financially afterwards   however it is indeed dangerous to make this assumption as there may be additional costs and troubles in selling assets and you may fail to recognize how precious the property is to you   having at least double or triple in property you 'd be willing to part with might be a more comfortable number   again the main idea is can you afford to lose the insured value tomorrow   though you hope it would n't happen if someone came and took $ 200,000 + of yours tomorrow would you be able to adjust to it relatively easily   if the answer is yes you 've satisfied this requirement   in many states it 's easier to understand whether you can meet this requirement it instead becomes can you take out the liability bond required if you 've met that requirement then it comes down to the time you 'd lose versus the savings you 'd gain   to get a fair idea you 'll need the premium you would pay to purchase the insurance since you are likely losing 10 50 of your premiums it should be fair to make a rough estimate of value lost by using 25 for most purposes especially given that this still ignores the future value opportunity cost of your money which could often be 5 10 if invested well the value of your time   you must properly identify either    a rough estimate of how much time it will take you to research the legal requirements and meet them and then to research handle the subsequent needs that come up which the insurance would take care of in an average year   so try to balance those typical years where you would n't have a lot of work to do with a year where you 'd need to call repair mechanics or find health practitioners   perhaps aim high research calling usually takes more time than we think    is this calculation positive your estimated net annual benefit or cost from self insuring is 0.25 insurance premium per year estimated value of your hours of to self insure per year   this is a rough estimate   but if the result is quite positive and you can afford to cover the hit the insurance would otherwise cover you 're likely better off self insuring if the result is quite negative or you ca n't cover the possible costs insurance would cover you 're probably better off buying insurance finally indeed there are still a few other factors on each side to consider most often those additional pluses and minuses probably are smaller than the primary cost benefits out earlier   but if you 're rich enough to have the money you 're in a situation where you can likely sacrifice a little income to have your peace of mind   so there 's certainly a lot to consider in it   but if you 're a self starter i believe you 're right that you 'll find it 's more worthwhile to self insure if you indeed have the resources

your premise is flawed so i 'm going to say you have no clue what you 're talking about    apple is a hardware company first and foremost always has been and likely always will be so when they see the market they see software as something to give away because software sells hardware   they make their bread and butter selling computers and device not mobile me accounts or os x or upgrades    microsoft is a software company through and through when they see the market they see a world full of computers that can run their software for a fee    but that well is drying up manufacturers are leaving so what does msft do get in the hardware game themselves because hardware sells software that 's the one and only rational they were willing to drop billions upon billions of dollars into xbox and make it into an ecosystem    sony 's problem is that they grew so big they 're too big most people only see the surface consumer stuff anchored by fancy tvs or ps3 but they do so much more within b2c and    hell sony makes produces sells distributes plays stores transfers enhances media content on various levels but they 're not best of class anymore on any level and the groups do n't work hand in hand    the company is melting down the same way america is melting down weak central leadership competing ideology how can a company that makes movies sell movie players and exponential levels of complexity    throw in the multinational field sony operates in versus the much fewer countries apple and microsoft operate in and it 's a gigantic mess    i have a head for systems and big orgs but i do not envy the man that has to push that beast along

there are moral distinctions that can be drawn between gambling and investing in stocks first and i think most important in gambling you are trying to get money for nothing you put $ 100 down on the roulette wheel and you hope to get $ 200 back in investing you are not trying to get something for nothing you are buying a piece of a hopefully profit making company you are giving this company the use of your money and in exchange you get a share of the profits that is you are quite definitely giving something the use of your money for a period of time you invest $ 100 of your money and you hope to see that grow by maybe $ 5 or $ 10 a year typically you may get a sudden windfall of course you may buy a stock for $ 100 today and tomorrow it jumps to $ 200 but that 's not the normal expectation second gambling is a zero sum game if i gamble and win $ 100 then someone else had to lose $ 100 investing is not a zero sum game if i buy $ 100 worth of stock in a company and that grows to $ 200 i have in a sense won $ 100 but no one has lost $ 100 to give me that money the money is the result of the profit that the company made by selling a valuable product or service to customers when i go to the grocery store and buy a dozen eggs for $ 2 some percentage of that goes to the stockholders in the grocery store say 5 cents so did i lose 5 cents by buying those eggs no to me a dozen eggs are worth at least $ 2 or i would n't have bought them i got exactly what i paid for i did n't lose anything carrying that thought further investing in the stock market puts money into businesses it enables businesses to get started and to grow and expand assuming these are legitimate businesses they then provide useful products and services to customers gambling does not provide useful products and services to anyone except to the extent that people enjoy the process of gambling in which case you could say that it is equivalent to playing a video game or watching a movie third and these are all really related the whole goal of gambling is to take something from another person while giving him nothing in return again if i buy a dozen eggs i give the store my $ 2 or whatever amount and i get a dozen eggs in exchange i got something of value and the store got something of value we both walk away happy but in gambling my goal is that i will take your money and give you nothing in return it is certainly true that buying stocks involves risk and we sometimes use the word gamble to describe any risk but if it is a sin to take a risk then almost everything you do in life is a sin when you cross the street there is a risk that you will be hit by a car you did n't see when you drink a glass of water there is the risk that it is contaminated and will poison you when you get married there is a risk that your spouse will divorce you and break your heart etc we are all we all sin every day but we do n't sin quite that much btw i do n't think that gambling is a sin nothing in the bible says that gambling is a sin but i can comprehend the argument for it i think gambling is foolish and i do n't do it my daughter works for a casino and she has often said how seeing people lose money in the casino regularly reminds her why it is stupid to gamble like she once commented on people who stand between two slot machines feed them both coins and then pull the levers down at the same time so that she said they can lose their money twice as fast

most basic tip   do n't go to the grocery store hungry what we do to minimize food waste on sunday when my wife and i go grocery shopping we figure out what meals we are going to have for dinner that week and we only buy what we need for those meals we also try to decide in advance what we are going out for dinner for example we know we have to take the in laws out for dinner on wednesday so we do n't buy a dinner for that night as part of our weekly planning we figure out the lunches we will take to work based on our dinners   for example if we plan to make a big pot of pasta for dinner one night we know we 'll have leftovers for lunch so we wo n't buy a lunch for the following day basically we try to match our food purchasing to our food consumption during the week we generally try to cook the dinner that uses the most perishable items first   if we buy seafood that will be monday night 's dinner   the frozen pizza can wait until the end of the week my wife an i both have to deal with the occasional unexpected late night at work which can mess up our cooking plans   as a result it is not uncommon for us to be too tired to cook so we skip a dinner   it is less wasteful to do that with something frozen preserved also we try to consider cooking time vs our work schedule   we do n't pick a complex dinner for a night that we know in advance will be a long work day

i have read from lot of places that transferring funds from nro to nre is possible given correct documents are provided yes this is correct the key document 15cb establishes that you have paid taxes that were due before money is transferred from the nro account to the nre account and/or are repatriated here is what i am simply steps 3 4 more so the step 4 can be seen as new income so the source of the funds is originally from nre account however the ca feels that since my withdrawal and deposit mechanism in nro is cash i might be subject to questioning    is there any issues in doing the above the ca is right the cash withdrawal and cash deposit has broken the link between the money withdrawn and the money deposited it could easily be the case that the cash withdrawals were spent on expenses and the cash deposit is new taxable income to you this new income needs to be declared and the taxes paid if you uncle is a close relative the exact relationships that are called close relatives are defined by law the return of the money can be declared to be a gift from your uncle to you and no taxes are due from you on the money if the funds are large it is advised to have a gift deed it is not a simple matter of creating a gift deed stating that your uncle has given you a gift your uncle has to show how he acquired so many assets that he gave you some money as a gift and whether appropriate taxes were paid by him   if your uncle is not a close relative he can still gift you up to rs 50,000 per year without you having to pay any income tax on the money received but again a gift deed would be needed to account for the cash deposits in short keep speaking to your ca he will advise you on the best course of action related question transfering money from nre account in india to family member

tax rates do make a difference between whether to invest here or in ireland the rate of return would be lower in a place where you pay higher taxes as taxes are a cost the investment is going to happen sure it just depends on where that occurs    and then secondly the money that american businesses profit overseas stays overseas instead of being repatriated because the taxes are too high to justify paying them before reinvesting the money in the economy this is a problem because it means jobs for everyday americans going to another country where due to the other country is already more attractive in terms of labor costs due to our high price levels here in the us

buying pressure is when there are more buy orders than sell orders outstanding   just because someone wants to buy a stock does n't mean there 's a seller ready to fill that order   when there 's buying pressure stock prices rise   when there 's selling pressure stock prices fall there can be high volume where buying and selling are roughly equal in which case share prices would n't move much the market makers who actually fill buy and sell orders for stock will raise share prices in the face of buying pressure and lower them in the face of selling pressure   that 's because they get to keep the margin between what they bought shares from a seller for and what they can sell them to a new buyer for   here 's an explanation from about buying pressure buying pressure can basically be defined as increasingly higher demand for a particular stock 's shares this demand for shares exceeds the supply and causes the price to rise the strength or weakness of a stock determines how much buying or selling interest will be required to break support and resistance areas i hope this helps

in my opinion the fee is criminal   there are etfs available to the public that have expenses as low as .05 the index fund viiix an institution level fund available to large 401(k plans charges .02 i 'll pay a total of under 1 over the next 50 years   consider that at retirement the safe withdrawal rate has been thought to be 4 and today this is considered risky perhaps too high do you think it 's fair in any sense of the word to lose 30 of that withdrawal   another angle for you in my working years i spent most of those years at either the 25 or 28 federal bracket taxable income i should spend my retirement at 15 marginal rate on average the purpose of my 401(k was to save me and my wife 10 13 in tax from deposit to withdrawal how long does it take for an annual 1.1 excess fee to negate that 10 savings if one spends their working life paying that rate they will lose half their wealth to those managing their money   pbs aired a show in its frontline series titled the retirement gamble it offers a look at how such fees are a killer to your wealth

1 should i register for vat    if it is below the threshold amount it is purely voluntary if you register for vat you would have to charge vat and then do returns every quarter if you can take up this bit of hassle it does n't make much of a difference one thing you need to consider you get 1 discount during your first year of registering for vat if you want to save this discount for when you really need to pay vat it could be helpful 2 what benefits would registering for vat include    except for vat where you pay vat for business expenses not much 3 would i not just hold onto the monies for hmrc    you would n't hold any money for hmrc they will send you notifications if you do not file your returns and pay your vat quarterly and get everything cleared from your accountant if your accountant does n't answer properly make it clear you need proper answers else change your accountant if you do something wrong and hmrc gets after you you would be held liable your accountant can take the slip if you signed on all business documents provided by your accountant

make sure i am reading this correctly   you signed the car over to you bf he took a loan against it and gave you the money    if so you sold him the car and any use you have had of it since was at his consent   outside of a written contract saying otherwise and possibly even with one it is now his car to do with as he pleases it sucks that things are not working out in the manner you intended at the time but that is the reality of the situation

from irs publication 970 tax benefits for education note qualified tuition programs are also called 529 plans   changing the designated beneficiary there are no income tax consequences if the designated beneficiary of    an account is changed to a member of the beneficiary 's family see    members of the beneficiary 's family earlier   members of the beneficiary 's family for these purposes the beneficiary 's family includes the    beneficiary 's spouse and the following other relatives of the    beneficiary regarding ownership changes rollovers any amount distributed from a qtp is n't taxable if it is rolled over    to another qtp for the benefit of the same beneficiary or for the    benefit of a member of the beneficiary 's family including the    beneficiary 's spouse an amount is rolled over if it is paid to    another qtp within 60 days after the date of the distribution do n't report qualifying rollovers those that meet the above criteria    anywhere on form 1040 or 1040nr these are n't taxable distributions example when aaron graduated from college last year he had $ 5,000 left in his    qtp he wanted to give this money to his younger brother who was in    junior high school in order to avoid paying tax on the distribution    of the amount remaining in his account aaron contributed the same    amount to his brother 's qtp within 60 days of the distribution so it appears that as far as the irs in concerned the rollover could be done to change ownership as long as the beneficiary was in the same family it is possible that there could be a state tax issue with the change of ownership if it changed from a plan in state a to one in state b and state a treated the original contributions as a tax deduction so check the guidelines for the specific 529 plan

the actual physical act of obtaining the sequence data is n't the cause of the delay   the current estimates of 8 10 weeks for tumor genome sequencing are mainly due to the data processing     pooling data and processing power would actually be a huge advantage in this   after you have all the sequencing data you need to identify changes in the tumor and then determine what exactly they mean the really difficult part   if centers around the world pool their data and correlate it to clinical information the data set expands exponentially which helps everyone   otherwise each center will have their own data set which will probably get published eventually but there will be a huge delay before this information gets to the appropriate people where it can help   data pooling of this sort is already done in a lot of other cases newborn screening etc

your basic point is correct the savvy move is to use insurance only to cover losses that would be painful or catastrophic for you otherwise self insure in the specific example of car insurance you may be missing that it does n't only cover replacement of the car it also covers liability which is a hundreds of thousands of dollars risk the liability coverage may well be legally required it may also be required as a base layer if you want to get a separate umbrella policy up to millions in liability so you have to be very rich before this insurance stops making sense in the us at least you can certainly buy car insurance that does n't cover loss of the car or that has a high deductible and in fact if you can afford to self insure up to a high deductible on average as you say that should be a good idea same is true of most kinds of insurance a high deductible is best as long as you can afford it unless you know you 'll probably file a claim health insurance in particular is weird in many ways and one is that you often can estimate whether you 'll have claims on our auto policy the liability and uninsured coverage is about 60 of the cost while damage to the car coverage is 40 i 'm sure this varies a lot depending on the value of your cars and how much you drive and driving record etc on an aging car the coverage for the car itself should get cheaper and cheaper since the car is worth less while liability coverage would not necessarily get cheaper

why do n't they raise wages then adjust the prices for labor costs and call it a day working fast food you 're not exactly building valuable workplace skills and your life is more or less on hold they may as well pay you enough to exist there is also the question of making sure it 's relatively isolated to the area you can live off working at mcdonalds for $ 10/hr in someplace like missouri where the col is super low but as soon as you go someplace like the city that becomes starvation wages               i think companies like the leverage of starvation wages though it creates a situation where the worker does n't have anywhere to go and no time to work upward creating a perpetual cycle of working for low wages and being unable to i think companies like this because it may reduce turnover raising the wages a little more gives people room to develop skills and bounce at most of my jobs the managers openly talked about not promoting people in school because they were just gon na leave anyways which about sums up how i feel about it

without providing direct investment advice i can tell you that bond most assuredly are not recession proof   all investments have risk and each recession will impact asset classes slightly differently before getting started bonds are loans   you are loaning money   do n't ever think of them as anything but that bonds loans have two chief risks default risk and inflation risk    default risk is the most obvious risk this is when the person to whom you are loaning does not pay back   in a recession this can easily happen if the debtor is a company and the company goes bankrupt in the environment inflation risk is a more subtle risk and occurs when the fixed interest rate on your loan yields less than the inflation rate   this causes the real value of your investment to depreciate over time    the second risk is most pronounced when the bonds that you own are government bonds and the recession causes the government to be unable to pay back its debts   in these circumstances the government may print more money to pay back its creditors generating inflation

to protect yourself from an increase in interest rates get a fixed rate loan the loan terms interest rate number of payments monthly payments will be fixed for the loan of course if rate for the rest of the market drops during the period of the loan you may be able to refinance the loan but if you ca n't refinance or wo n't refinance the drop in rates for the rest of the market does n't help you if you want to be able to have your rate float you can get a variable rate loan of course it can float up or it can float down so you take that risk because of that risk adjustable rate loans start at a lower rate if the market interest rate drops far enough many people will refinance into a fixed rate loan at a lower rate than they could have gotten at the start for adjustable rate loans the lender during the application process details how the rate is determined it is pegged to be x% above some national or international interest rate that they do n't have any control over if that base rate moves then your loan rate may move they also specify how often it will adjust and the maximum it can adjust between each adjustments and over the entire life of the loan   that rate that starts initially lower than the fixed rate loan is the that many people have to pick an adjustable rate loan some do it because they believe they will payoff the loan before the rates get too high or they will see enough increase in income so they can afford the higher monthly payment if rates rise if they are wrong about these things they may find themselves in trouble the terms of the adjustable rate loan still have to follow the terms of the contract the lender ca n't change the offset or the source used to used to set interest rate

it is a legal issue for two reasons in the united states if both names were on the title both people would have had to sign the paperwork in order to transfer the title if the car was collateral for the loan then the bank would have had to be involved in the transaction the portion of the check need to repay the loan would have had to have been made out to the bank if the car was sold to a dealership then paperwork must have been forged if the car was sold to a person then it is possible that they were too naive to know what paperwork was required but it is likely still fraud you need legal advice to protect your money and your credit score they should also be able to tell you who needs to be contacted dmv the police the dealership the bank

as someone that has run a nonprofit my 2 cents first thank you for giving and for being about wanting to make things as easy as possible the best method is the one you 'll actually do if there is a chance that you will end up not donating by check because you do n't have a stamp you forget etc go ahead and do it online a donation with a fee is better than an intention without one we had one case where a potential donor decided to give but was so worried about the processing fee that they wanted to write a check we followed up 3 times on the pledge spent time following up with the pledge 's connection that wanted to see if it came through and in the end they never sent the check their pledge wound up costing us staff time and money as we tried to make their giving easy   if you are as likely to give size matters my rule of thumb is that if you are giving $ 1 up to about a hundred dollars the fee which most nonprofits can get to about 3 or 3.5 is about the same as the added staff time opening the check adding an extra to the deposit slip etc but as soon as you are giving a couple hundred dollars and especially if you are giving in the thousands it is definitely better to do it by check most banks do n't charge an extra deposit fee at the scale of most nonprofits and we probably have some run to the bank happening in the next day or two really your thank you note should be the same whether online or by check even though you 'll get the auto thank you online so that time difference should n't really play into it the donation will be appreciated either way   while i cringe a bit if i see a $ 1,500 donation come through online knowing that the check would be cheaper that is far outweighed by the that someone thought of us and made it happen

basically you either borrow money or get other people to invest in your business by buying stock or something analogous   sometimes you can get people to park money with you for example many people deposit money in a bank checking account they do n't get any interest or other profit from this they just do it because the bank is a convenient place to store their money the bank then loans some percentage of this money out and keeps the interest i do n't doubt that people have come up with more clever ways to use other people 's money borrowing money for an investment or business venture is risky because if you lose money you may be unable to pay it back on the other hand investors expect a share of the profit not just a fixed interest rate

firstly going short on a stock and worrying if the price suddenly gaps up a lot due to good news is the same as being long on a stock and worrying that the price will suddenly collapse due to bad news secondly an out of the money call option would be cheaper than an in the money call option in fact the further out of the money the cheaper the premium will be all other things being equal so a good risk management strategy would be to set your stop orders as per your trading plan and if you wish to have added protection in case of a large gap is to buy a far out of the money call option the premium should not be too expensive something you should also consider is the time until expiry for the option if your time frame for trading is days to weeks you make consider a cheaper option that expires in about a month but if you are planning on holding the position for more than a month you might need a longer expiry period on the option which will increase the premium another option to consider if your broker offers it is to use a guaranteed stop loss order you will pay a little premium for this type of order and not all brokers offer it but if it is offered you will be protected against any price gaps past your guaranteed stop loss price

you re assuming that gdp shows the amount of wealth created and is an indicator of the standard of living but it is not govt spending adds to gdp but takes away from the productive of the private sector which is the part of the economy that is making things that people want and need the govt can spend 1 trillion on building a to obama and that would increase gdp by 1 trillion but no wealth is created and the govt shift a trillion of tax revenues to the workers who built the if a company spends 1 trillion building building some new gadget then the people who spend money to buy i have something to show for it and the workers have their wages as well so now the company makes back 1.2 trillion and the consumers have their gadget ie real wealth has been created    the wealthy may be on of cash but its not just sitting under their mattress its spread out between investments and savings savings is to build up productive capabilities the money the rich have sitting in banks is being used to help other businesses grow not just collecting dust i wish it were as simple as giving every poor person 10 grand and watching the economy take off remember when bush gave everyone a 1000 tax refund it sure was fun blowing that on a ps3 i ca nt argue with that but prosperity can not be printed it must be earned through hard work and productive activity what we need is not monetary stimulus we need the govt to stop the private sector with burdensome regulations and taxes we need lower barriers to entry so we maximize competition in every industry we need the govt spending less and pushing more workers into the private sector making things that american can get some utility from its not going to be a smooth ride getting there there will be lots of lay offs in the short run as the economy but if the govt got out of the way and let the free market prosper our society would be far better off in the future

the cash is not penalty free if you take up loans from the policy to pay for retirement growth essentially stops and the interest will eat away policy value over time so instead of gaining 7 8 per year and taking withdrawals you would be taking loans and losing whatever the interest rate is   dividends are just the profits made from the company which is why its tax free its considered a return of premium you are just overpaying for the policy by its dividend rate    whole life is a great vehicle for some situations but it always comes after a 401k or other retirement savings whole life does nt even begin to make sense imo until you are making a few hundred thousand a year and need it for a business buy sell agreement or legacy money to leave children grandchildren   it does nt scale well to lower incomes

to me it sounds like you need to come up with 67 k 30 + 37 part of the time you can work in the current job part of the time you could work a lower paying part time job for a year   lets assume that you can earn 15 k for that year and you can save 5 k from your current job   i 'd try and save more but what ever you can do 67 15 5 = 47     i 'd sell the investment property   first you will have some funds to throw at this need second you expense should go down as you do n't have a payment on this property 47 26 = 21   you have 32 k in cash which is a lot for someone in your expense range   six months would be 15 k so i would use some of that cash 21 17 = 4 now you are really close   if needed i 'd use the investments to cover the last 4k or even more of the on hand cash   however could you do something to reduce that amount further like working more

as discusses tax bracket without any refers to a single jurisdiction 's marginal tax rate   in your case this is either your california 's tax bracket or your federal tax bracket not including marginal social security and medicare taxes   but if someone says combined state and federal tax bracket they probably mean the combination of your state and federal income tax brackets again lot including sales taxes business and occupational taxes social security taxes and medicare taxes   the math to combine the state and federal marginal tax rates is a bit tricky because most people can deduct either their state and local income taxes or their state and local general sales taxes when computing their income for federal income tax purposes   the federal alternative minimum tax restricts this deduction for some people for a single person earning $ 100,000 of salaries and wages in california whose state income taxes are close to their standard deduction the calculations for the combined marginal income tax rate look something like this as mentioned above this the tax bite on marginal earned income   to find the true marginal rate we need to add in social security taxes medicare taxes sales taxes and business occupation taxes   the social security and medicare taxes are sometimes called self employment taxes   this math unemployment insurance and workers compensation insurance because those taxes are typically capped well below $ 100,000 per year of income   this math also b o taxes because this question is california specific if an employer wishes to increase an employee 's pay by $ the first $ will go to the employer 's share of social security and medicare taxes   the remaining $ 1,000.00 will be subject to the combined marginal income tax rate discussed above plus will have $ go to the employee 's share of social security and medicare taxes   the employee might buy some extra things with some of their extra money and pay sales tax on them in 2016 a 9 sales tax rate was common in california 's largest cities the irs estimated that for a single person with no dependents making $ 100,000 per year who did not buy a boat rv motor vehicle or major home construction about 9 of their marginal gross income was subject to sales tax

crank out expensive shares when markets are corporations go public sell their shares for the first time in market conditions that have a lot of liquidity a lot of people buying shares and when they have to make the concessions to appease an investing public when people are greedy and looking to make money without using too much due diligence think 's ipo in 1995 or snapchat 's ipo in 2017 they also issue more shares after already being public in similar circumstances think tesla 's 1 billion dollar dilution in 2017 dilution results in the 1 share owning less of the company so in a less investing environment share prices go down in response to dilution see 's stock for an example if you can find a chart issue debt non financial companies create bonds and sell bonds why is that surprising to you cash is cash this is called corporate bonds or corporate debt you can buy apple bonds right now if you want from the same brokers that let you buy stocks mutual fund investor bernstein is making a cynical assessment of the markets which carries a lot of truth dumping shares on your mom 's 401k is a running amongst some financial professionals basically mutual fund investors are typically the least well researched or most gullible market participants to sell to influenced by brand name more than company fundamentals who will balk at the concept of reading a prospectus financial professionals and have more information than their investors and can gain extended advantages because of this just take the emotions out of it and make objective assessments

if they directly paid for your education it is possible that it would n't count as taxable income to you according to the irs depending on the amount if you receive educational assistance benefits from your employer    under an educational assistance program you can exclude up to $    of those benefits each year this means your employer should not    include those benefits with your wages tips and other compensation    shown in box 1 of your form w-2 this also means that you do not have    to include the benefits on your income tax return source however your situation is a bit trickier since they are sort of retroactively paying for your education i 'd think the answer is maybe and you should consult a tax professional since it is a gray area   update on further research i 'm going to downgrade that maybe to probably not but hopefully soon the reason i am doing so is that there is a bill in congress specifically to allow what you are asking which presumes that you currently ca n't do this   the bill is hr bill the student loan employment benefits act of 2013 sponsored by rep steve israel d it has co sponsors from both parties so that is promising for it 's passage i suppose however it appears to be still early in the legislative process if this issue is near dear to your heart maybe you should call your congressman summary of the bill from student loan employment benefits act of 2013 the internal    revenue code to exclude from the gross income of an employee amounts    paid by an employer under a student loan payment assistance program    limits the amount of such exclusion to $ 5,000 in a taxable year requires an employer student loan payment assistance program to be a    separate written plan of an employer to provide employees with student    loan payment assistance   defines student loan payment assistance as    the payment of principal or interest on any indebtedness incurred by    an employee solely to pay qualified higher education expenses which    are paid or incurred within a reasonable time before or after such    indebtedness was incurred and are attributable to education furnished    during a period in which such employee was a student eligible for    federal financial assistance

just skimming through the wikipedia article on i notice there is more to the story than simply 's ipo failed so they postponed it and did it anyways 3 points to keep in mind about ipos   1 an ipo is the mechanism for taking a private company and setting it up for shares to be owned by the public   2 the process of selling shares to the public often allows original owners and/or early investors to cash out most countries including member nations of the eu limit some transactions like pre ipo companies to accredited investors   3 selling shares to the public also can allow the company to access more funds for growth this is particularly important in a capital intensive business like an airline new costs > $ new costs > $ 105 m usd   ultimately the question of a successful ipo depends on how you define success initially there was a lot of concern that the ipo was set up with too much focus on goal 2 allowing the management owners to cash out   it looks like the first approach was not meeting good opinions in the market during 2006 a major concern was that the initial approach focused on management only cashing out its shares and no money actually going to the company to support its future   the investment bankers restructured the ipo including the issuance of more new shares so that more $ could end up in the company 's accounts not just in the accounts of the management   if anything it 's still a pretty successful ipo given that the shares were successfully listed the company collected the money it needed to invest and grow and the management still cashed out

it would be ideal if the last would change regarding anything that goes horribly wrong the whole point of setting up rules is to avoid both hypothetical and past mistakes the fact that so many coastal cities do n't have proper systems to manage the that comes into their cities is appalling and that 's just an extreme example whereas many infrastructure problems are more passive   i would n't trust a private corporation to set up a highway it may be considered economically stimulating in some ways but they will do the bare minimum in terms of quality and safety and then charge you $ 5 a trip when government gets involved in building the infrastructure it tends to be slow and inefficient from the outside but there is so much planning and preparing for that goes into it that it just ca n't be set up in a few months there may be future developments coming or it may be integrated with other systems to streamline travel or any of a plethora of reasons   i work in infrastructure so i know i have a different view compared to people that just want to have their today built so they can use it it 's really hard to see but problems and have to say we 'll be getting to that in 5 10 years just live with it in the meantime but i do n't want someone to say i 'm tired of waiting in traffic here 's a piece of land let 's put a road through there with no plan for what to do with it so many problems that we 're dealing with now are caused by fifty years ago and now it 's a hell of a lot harder to fix than it would've been to do it right in the first place

you want to have 2 4 credit cards with a credit utilization ratio below 30   if you only have 2 cards closing 1 would reduce your credit diversity and thus lower your credit score   you also want at least 2 years credit history so closing an older credit card may shorten your credit history again lowering your credit score   you want to keep around at least 1 2 older cards even if they are not the best you have 4 cards but having 2 4 cards you have 4 means you can add a 5th and then cancel one down to 4 or cancel one down to 3 and then add a 4th for little net effect   still there will be effect as you have decreased the age of your credit and you have opened new credit always a ding to your score do you have installment loans cars you mention a new mortgage so you need to wait about 3 months after the most recent credit activity to let the effects of that change settle you want both spouses to have separate credit cards and that will increase the total available to 4 8   that would allow you to increase the number of benefits available

generally default means that the company can not pay off their debts and since debt holders get paid before equity holders their equity would be effectively worthless that said companies can emerge from chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization and retain equity value but it is rare most times stocks are de listed or frozen on stock exchanges and company 's reorganization plan will cancel all existing equity shares instead focusing all of their attention on paying back as much debt as possible if the company issues new equity after reorganizing it might provide a way for holders of the original equity to exchange their shares for the new equity but it is rare and the value is usually significantly less that the value of the original equity

regarding auto insurance you have to look at the different parts in the united most states do require a level of specific coverage for all drivers that is to make sure that if you are at fault there is money available to pay the victims that payment may be for damage to their car or other property but it also covers medical costs many policies also cover you if the other driver does n't have insurance the policy that covers the loss of the vehicle is required if you have a loan or are leasing the car somebody else owns it while there is a loan so they can and do require you to pay to protect the vehicle   if there i no loan you do n't have to have that portion of a policy other parts such as towing assistance and rental cars replacement may be required by the insurance standards for your state or might be almost impossible to drop because all insurance companies include it to stay competitive with their competition   dropping the non required parts of the coverage is acceptable when you do n't have a loan some people do drop it to save money but that does mean you are self insuring if you can afford to self insure a new car great the interesting thing is that some people have more than enough assets to self the non required part of auto insurance but then they realize that they do need to up their umbrella liability insurance this is to protect them from somebody deciding that their resources make them a tempting target when they are involved in a collision

primerica 's primary value proposition is that switching from whole or universal life to term life and investing the difference is a good idea for most people however there are a number of other important factors to consider when purchasing life insurance and i would also be wary of anyone claiming that one product will be the best for you under all circumstances best insurance without getting into a much larger discussion on how to pick insurance companies or products here are a few things that concern me about primerica they have a captive sales force meaning their agents sell only primerica products this means that they are not shopping around for the best deal for you given how much prices on term life have changed in recent years i would highly recommend taking the time to get alternate quotes online or from an independent broker who will shop around for you their staff are primarily part time employees i am not saying they are incompetent or do n't care just that you are more likely to be working with someone for whom insurance is not their primary line of work if you have substantial reason to believe that you may someday need whole life their products may not suit you well primerica does not offer whole life as far as i am aware which also means that you can not convert your term life policy through them to whole life should you need to do so for example if you experience an accident are disabled or have a significant change in your health status in the future and do not have access to a group life policy you may be unable to renew your individual policy above average returns i am also highly skeptical about this claim the only possible context in which i could find this valid would be if they mean that your returns on average will be better if you invest in the stock market directly as compared to the returns you would get from the cash value portion of a life insurance product such as universal life as those types of products generally have very high fees can you clarify if this is the claim that was made or if they are promising returns above those of the general stock market if it is the latter run only a handful of superstar investors think warren buffet peter lynch and bill gross have ever consistently outperformed the stock market as a whole and typically only for a limited period of time in either case i would have the same concerns here as stated in reasons 1 and 2 above even more so than with insurance if you need investment advice i 'd recommend working with someone who is fully dedicated to that type of work such as a fee only financial planner is a good place to find one once you know how you want to invest i would again recommend shopping around for a reputable but inexpensive broker and compare their fees with primerica 's kudos on having a healthy level of skepticism and listening to your gut also remember that if you are not interested in their offer you do n't have to prove them wrong you can simply say no thank you best of luck

you only got 75 shares so your basis is the fair market value of the stock as of the grant date times the number of shares you got $ 20 75   functionally it 's the same thing as if your employer did this as such the basis in that stock is $ 1,500 $ 20 75 the other 25 shares are n't yours and were n't ever yours so they are n't part of your basis for net issuance if they were sell to cover then the end result would be pretty similar but there 'd be another transaction involved but we wo n't go there   to put it another way suppose your employer paid you a $ 2000 bonus leaving you with a $ 1500 check after tax withholding being a prudent person and not wishing to blow your bonus on luxury goods you invest that $ 1500 in a well researched investment you would n't doubt that your cost basis in that investment at $ 1500

the same day rule in the uk is a rule for matching purposes only   it says that sales on any day are matched firstly with purchases made on the same day for the purposes of any gain loss hence the phrase bed and breakfast b&b when you wish to a gain that is within the exempt amount and re establish a purchase price at a higher level   you do the sale on one day just before the market closes which gets matched with your original purchase and then you buy the shares back the next day just after the market opens   this is standard tax planning   whenever you have a paper gain and you wish to lock that gain out of being taxed you do a bed and breakfast transaction the idea being to use up your annual exemption each and every year   of course if your dealing costs are high then they may outweigh any tax saved and so it would be pointless for the purpose of an example let 's assume that the uk tax year is the same as the calendar year scenario 1 suppose i bought some shares in 2016 for a total price of suppose by the end of 2016 the holding is worth resulting in a paper gain of question   should i do a b&b transaction to make use of my annual exemption answer   well with transaction costs at 1.5 for a round trip trade suppose and stamp duty on the purchase of 0.5 your total costs for a b&b will be and your tax saved upon some future sale date assuming you are a 20 tax payer is 1,080 = the transaction costs are deductible we assume   this does not make sense scenario 2 the same as scenario 1 but the shares are worth by answer   the total transaction costs are = 1,200 and so the taxable gain of 10,000 1,200 = would result in a tax bill of = and so the transaction costs are lower than the tax to be saved a strict analysis would take into account only the present value of the tax to be saved it makes sense to the gain   we sell some day before the tax year end and re invest the very next day scenario 3 the same as scenario 1 but the shares are worth by answer   the gain of 20,000 less costs would result in a tax bill for 1,500 this is   this tax bill will be on top of the dealing costs of 1,400   but the gain is in excess of the annual exemption   the strategy is to sell just enough of the holding to crystallise a taxable gain of just the fraction is given by 50,000 = which simplifies to = = the tax saved is = versus costs of = this strategy of partial b&b is adopted because it never makes sense to pay tax early end

so your point is that you know a guy that is n't good with money and has made some not great life decisions thus all people that work low skilled jobs even at the minimum wage level are thus bad with their money and not cut out to own a house really is that your argument   correlation is not causation just because someone works a low skilled job and is bad with money life decisions and should n't own a house does not mean that working low skilled jobs are the root of those problems   gt;that being said the initial argument is as bogus as yours i have a 2 bed 1 bath apartment for rent for $ 500 right now inside loop in houston tx it 's 10 15 minutes from downtown   and rent here in the seattle area is way higher than all of that yes rent is different where you live it still does n't mean people in my area should have to live in a shack because you pay $ 500 in houston honestly that should be an incentive for companies to move to houston to reduce costs due to cost of living difference which is why companies are leaving california but if you are here in seattle or another city there should be the expectation that your workers can afford to pay rent somewhere in the area   also just curious do you pay any of your employees only the minimum wage

in general you most definitely can in some cases you must however for each state you 'll have to check whether you can choose how to depreciate many states require you to take the same depreciation as on the federal schedule including sec 179 others wo n't allow sec 179 at all specifically to pa i have n't found any current guidance but the rules from 2012 put pa in the bucket that requires you to take the same sec 179 on the state return as appears on your federal return if you elect to expense section 179 property for fit purposes you are    required to expense the property for pit purposes however pa limit for sec 179 is $ 25 k so if your federal deduction is larger you can depreciate the rest check with a pa licensed cpa or ea for a more reliable opinion since i 'm not a tax adviser just googled it

unless you have a history of over using credit i.e. you 've gotten yourself into debt trouble then i think that the banker is giving you bad advice in telling you to get your own credit limit reduced   having more credit available to you that is left unused will make your utilization ratio lower which is generally better for your credit score according to this article on creditkarma.com   the sweet spot seems to be 1 20 utilization of your total credit   but remember this is only one factor in your credit score and not even the having a long history of on time payments counts the most my own personal experience seems to bear this out   i have two major credit cards that i use   one card has a high credit limit high for me anyway and i use it for just about everything that i groceries gas durable goods services you name it   the other card has a limit that is about 1/3 of the first and i use it for a few recurring bills and occasional purchases where they do n't take the first card   i also have a couple of department store cards that i use rather infrequently typically 1 purchase every 3 months or so   at the end of each month when the respective statements post each card has a balance that is 15 or less of the credit limit on that card   i pay off the entire balance on each card each month and the cycle repeats   i have never been late on a payment and my credit history for all of these cards goes back 10 years   my credit score is nearly as high as it can go   if having unused credit were a detriment i would expect my score to be much lower so no having too much credit available is not going to hurt you unless you are not using it at all or are tempted to abuse it use too much   the key is to use common sense   have a small number of cards keep them active spend within your means so you can pay off the balance in full after the statement posts and never be late on your payments   that 's all it takes to have good credit

the u.s. requires money transfer services to be licensed under 31 usc in addition to any applicable laws at the state level   according to multiple sources online including the thread referenced by md tech 's answer okpay either can not or will not get a license so they are out i dug on this a bit more because i thought it was interesting and okpay has other issues with u.s. and other regulators related to its interaction with bitcoins which themselves are a hot potato for regulation right now and may explain the licensing problem   it seems to also be facing regulatory pressure in other countries by the way so it 's not strictly a problem they face in the u.s.   just for whatever reason the problem is greater here   some interesting summary points with mounting pressure on online money exchanges from us regulators payments processor okpay has announced that it is suspending processing for all bitcoin exchanges including industry leader gox earlier this month the us department of homeland security seized gox 's account with mobile payment processor dwolla on allegations that the account was in violation of us code 18 usc 1960 by operating an money transmitting business just where the bitcoin market falls under us law is unclear because the legality of bitcoin transactions has yet to be tried in court and law enforcement has refused to comment on ongoing investigations such as the dwolla case in march the us treasury said any firms dealing in the virtual currency would be considered money services businesses just like any other which means they must hand over transaction information to the government and work to prevent money laundering in the uk it apparently has also had trouble with banking partners quoting a okpay official regarding changing bank providers the uk bank that we used before did not make a final decision on whether to handle transactions in favour of crypto currencies or not therefore the compliance department of the bank asked us to restrict such transfers this apparently allowed them to reverse a policy in the uk okpay 's policy shift comes just months after it stipulated that gbp users check a box verifying that their funds would not be spent on cryptocurrency a feature that further users i had n't heard of this company prior to your question but having done some research i tend to think that at least the part of this quote about language attributed to a user is true okpay are quite paranoid about aml and another problem is that their support people seem to be very bad at english so their replies are often hard to understand their support are also slow sic however in my experience they are an honest company i found at least one case where rumors that the entire company were going to shut down were traced back to a poorly translated message issued by the company again i know only what i read just now about this company but it looked like there were a few red flags the problems with the us probably not being the most important   this type of service is probably part of the future but i 'm not sure that i 'd send money through it now in its current state or organization and regulation

i was recently terminated from a company that promoted its company culture as one of the of the perks there i can assure you that in many cases it is all a facade for any company claiming how amazing their culture is you can easily go to glassdoor and check out the reviews and get an idea of what the true company culture is like   at this particular company it was almost cult like in how they pushed the culture down your throats every monday was a monday and every department hold meetings after part of the was that dinner would be served every monday night catered from popular restaurants around the city most people do n't get home until 8 and most of them start 8 if you failed to show up for these 's you were an and managers often confront those that they noticed were not present    of course one of the big selling points of working at this company was the many perks they try to entice you with beer on tap on every floor free coffee and spa water tons of snacks on a weekly basis company events wellness programs etc of course they will often pay you 30 40 under the market rate for your skills in fact almost everyone i knew there have told me they took a pay cut to work for this company the company would also hold major annual corporate events namely a huge summer camp event where they will fly everyone in around from the world and spend 4 days at a weekend retreat there 's also an annual company summit where again the company flies everyone in to a location to hold a major conference all of these events however cuts into your actual vacation time as they subtract it away from your accrued vacation these events are mandatory for all employees to attend   underneath the facade of culture the management was extremely toxic if you did not drink the you were almost assuredly on your way out as this is an at will company i would often see people let go for the most stupid reasons if any were even given including myself anybody who concerns or had different ideas going against someone in charge were soon to be performance managed out of the company   i highly encourage anyone looking for a job to check out the prospective company 's glassdoor page it is a great resource and will truly give you an idea about what kind of ride you 'll be in for

this chart concerns an option contract not a stock the method of analysis is to assume that the price of an option contract is normally distributed around some mean which is presumably the current price of the underlying asset as the date of expiration of the contract gets closer the variation around the mean in the possible end price for the contract will decrease undoubtedly the publisher has measured typical deviations from the mean as a function of time until expiration from historical data based on this data the program that computes the probability has the following inputs 1 the mean current asset price 2 the time until expiration 3 the expected standard deviation based on 2 with this information the probability distribution that you see is generated the green this is a normal or gaussian distribution for a normal distribution the probability of a particular event is equal to the area under the curve to the right of the value line in the example above the value chosen is this area can be computed with the formula   this formula is called the probability density for x where x is the value in the example above t is the reciprocal of the variance which can be computed from the standard deviation mu is the mean the main assumption such a calculation makes is that the price of the asset will not change between now and the time of expiration obviously that is not true in most cases because the prices of stocks and bonds constantly fluctuate a secondary assumption is that the distribution of the option price around the mean will a normal or gaussian distribution this is obviously a crude assumption and common sense would suggest it is not the most accurate distribution in fact various studies have shown that the distribution is actually a more accurate model for the distribution of option contract prices

linking the card is primarily to give you and paypal a fall back option for funding your spending if your bank account does n't have sufficient funds to process the charge   if the bank account has sufficient funds it will work fine in many cases without a credit card if you have both linked bank and a credit card paypal will transfer funds immediately as paypal knows it has an option for getting the funds if the bank has insufficient funds   however if you have no credit card linked or remove your only card if you remove your only card and have a confirmed bank account you ’ll no longer be able to make instant bank payments instead they ’ll be sent as which take 3 to 4 working days to process this may not matter in many cases but it may delay things some   there may also be services who require immediate payment and wo n't support paypal if it 's not immediate there may also be some functional limitations   the one i see is primarily that some services that are geo location specific spotify for one example use the credit card to verify that you are in a particular location in spotify 's case for licensing purposes   they do n't seem to accept paypal unless it 's linked to a credit or debit card even if it 's verified via a bank account   i 'm not sure if this is common with other services but it 's something to consider

there is some element of truth to what your realtor said   the seller takes the house off the market after the offer is accepted but the contract is contingent upon among other things buyer securing the financing a lower down payment can mean a higher chance of failing that the buyer might be going through fha va or other programs that have additional restrictions if the buyer fails to secure a financing that 's weeks and months lost to the seller in a seller 's market this can be an important factor in how your bid is perceived by the seller sometimes it even helps to disclose your credit score for the same reason of course for your situation you will have to assess whether this is the case certainly do not let your realtor push you around to do things you are not comfortable with edit   a higher down payment also helps in the situation where the house appraisal does not fare well   as @dilip sarwate has pointed out the particular area you are interested in is probably a seller 's market thus giving sellers more leverage in picking bids all else equal if you are the seller with multiple offers coming in at similar price level would you pick the one with 20 down or 5 down while it is true that realtors have their own motives to push through a deal as quickly as possible the sellers can also be in the same boat one less mortgage payment is not trivial to many it 's a complicated issue as every party involved have different interests again do your own due diligence be educated and make informed decisions

i 'm in the us so there may be with uk taxes that i 'm not familiar with but here 's how i 've always treated stock i get as compensation    suppose the vested shares are worth x.   if i had x in cash would i buy my company 's stock as an investment   usually the answer is no not because i think the stock will tank but because there 's better things i can do with that cash pay off debt unfortunately   therefore i sell the shares and use the cash for something else you have stock options so suppose the stock value is x but you can buy it for y.   you can either therefore the math is the same if you had x in cash would you buy your company 's stock as an investment   if so then option 2 is best because you can get x in stock for a lower cost option 3 might be better if the gain on the stock will be taxed higher but they 're pretty much equivalent if there 's no chance that the stock will drop below y if not then option 4 is best since you will likely get more than x y from selling the options that by exercising them and selling the stock since options have time value if option 4 is not a possibility then option 1 is best you pocket x y as income and invest it however you see fit

you should n't be picking stocks in the first place from new york magazine tweeted by new evidence for that reality comes from goldman sachs via bloomberg news the investment bank analyzed the holdings of funds with $ 2.1 trillion in equity positions it found first of all that all those sophisticated investors would have been better off stashing their money in basic hands off index funds or mutual funds last year both of them had higher average returns than hedge funds did the average hedge fund returned 3 percent last year versus 14 percent for the standard poor ’s 500   mutual funds do worse than index funds tangentially related to the question of whether wall street types deserve their compensation packages is the yearly phenomenon in which actively managed mutual funds underperform the market between 2004 and 2008 of domestic funds did worse than the s&p composite 1500 in 2008 underperformed in other words if you had a fund manager and his employees bringing their skill and knowledge to bear on your portfolio you probably lost money as compared to the market as a whole that 's not to say you lost money in all cases just in most the math is really simple on this one stock picking is fun but and brings you competing with wall with math ph ds and twenty thousand dollars a year bloomberg terminals what do you know about apple 's new iphone that they do n't you should compare your emotional reaction to losing 40 in two days to your reaction to gaining 40 in two days   then compare both of those to losing 6 and gaining 6 respectively picking stocks is not financially wise period

i was wondering how do we calculate the total capital of a company which items should i look for in the financial statements total capital usually refers to the sum of long term debt and total shareholder equity both of these items can be found on the company 's balance sheet this is one of the calculations that 's traditionally used when determining a company 's return on capital   i 'll use the balance sheet from gilead sciences 2012 10-k form as an example net long term debt was $ and total stockholder equity was $ which should give a grand total of $ for total capital i know you can do the math but i always find an example helpful if it uses realistic numbers   you may sometimes hear the term total capital referring to total capital stock or total capital assets in which case it may be referring to physical capital i.e. assets like inventory etc instead of financial capital leverage and how do i calculate notes payable is the same as accounts payable as the word payable suggests both are liabilities however i 've always been taught that accounts payable are debts a business owes to its suppliers while notes payable are debts a business owes to banks and other institutions with which it has signed a formal agreement and which use formal debt instruments e.g. a loan contract this definition seems to match various articles i found online   on a balance sheet you can usually determine notes payable by combining the short term debt of the company with the current portion of the long term debt these pieces comprise the debt that is due within the fiscal year in the balance sheet for gilead sciences i would only include the $ categorized as current portion of long term debt and other obligations net term since the other current liabilities do n't look like they would involve formal debt contracts   since the notes payable section of 's balance sheet does n't seem that diverse and therefore might not make the best example i 'll include the most recent balance sheet monsanto as monsanto 's balance sheet lists a term called short term debt including current portion of long term debt with a value of $ 36 million this looks like almost the exact definition of notes payable 1 note that this financial statement is called a statement of consolidated financial position on monsanto 's

this is kind of halfway between the stuff i was talking about and halfway to the stuff i do n't want to get into but it raises some very legitimate and relevant points that are kind of separate from the gold standard debate    the big question taking the banks out of it is a two fold one that goes something like this    is it possible to have a modern economy without credit markets and   is it possible to have functional credit markets without some sort of fractional reserve currency   for example let 's say toyota decides to design a new car before they can sell a single unit someone in africa or somewhere has to dig up the minerals to make it someone has to design it tools have to be re worked all that kind of stuff building one car of a new design might cost a billion dollars or wiki    obviously it 's not realistic for toyota to expect the first customer to pay that much they amortize the design and tooling costs over the expected production run or whatever moreover we might say that only companies that have amassed a billion dollars in physical gold from previous sales should be able to do that kind of thing   but there is a relevant question of whether this makes any kind of sense should toyota have to literally ship or of physical gold through middlemen and suppliers to the miner in africa down to the actual guy who digs up the aluminum or whatever in order to make this transaction happen    how would that work without some sort of intermediary promises    i 'm imagining a scenario where toyota sends an armored truck full of gold out to go find half a ton of aluminum the drivers can not rely on any promises or fractional reserve they must only trade the physical gold in their truck for actual aluminum or expenses along the way    this starts to sanity in a modern economy you have to rely on the promises of middle men and suppliers and contractors and so on and the instant you have promises you have fractional reserves because people are getting paid and money is changing hands that has n't been minted yet    it 's not just the of your local supermarket having to trade a bag full of gold for a shipment of lettuce it 's that contracts to purchase would be meaningless because the driver would have had to give a smaller bag of gold to the supplier who gave a smaller bag of gold to the grower and so on moreover the supermarket would have to just wait to see what entrepreneurial driver shows up and what they have    the supermarket obviously can not order a hundred heads of lettuce per week with a promise to pay not unless we also give the supplier permission to order a hundred heads of lettuce a week from the grower and the grower permission to order seed and hire workers sufficient to grow a hundred heads of lettuce a week and the workers permission to set up car payments to get to work and the seed supplier to so on and so on   that sequence of promises is facto a fractional reserve system with or without a central bank people are promising to deliver gold cash whatever that they do n't currently have moreover it is entirely possible in a gold denominated currency for everyone to keep those promises since the gold like any currency just keeps changing hands and cycling through the economy    your example of gold certificates is exactly equivalent to privately arranged contracts promises to produce a certain amount of gold on completion it 's promises all the way down unless we insist on instant cash transactions e.g. literally handing an employee a dollar 's worth of gold every five minutes or whatever if the employee is counting on the good faith of the employer to settle up at the end of the day or week then we have a fractional reserve system whether or not    when you buy an iphone or a laptop someone had to dig up the stuff to make it out of the ground when you buy a cheeseburger someone had to grow wheat and someone else had to raise and kill a cow it 's not a reasonable proposition that they should wait for you to show up with a bag of gold before doing those things in this day and age    we trade in promises and ious sometimes that sometimes but it 's remarkable how well it does work most of the time and how much better it works than the times and places where people had to trade physical goods for physical goods    this is not an argument against a gold backed currency

i assume your employer does standard withholding   then what you need to do is figure what bracket that puts you in after you 've done all your normal deductions   let 's say it 's 25   then multiply your freelance income after business expenses and that 's your estimated tax approximately   unless the income causes you to jump a bracket to that you have to add approximately 12 13 social security medicare for income between the $ 90 k and $ 118,500   filling out form will give you a better estimate but there is a safe harbor provision in that if what you pay in estimated tax and withholding this year is at least as much as you owed last year there 's no penalty   i 've always done mine this way dividing last year 's tax by 4 since my income is quite variable and i 've never been able to make sense of the worksheets on the 1040-es

of course i know nothing about real estate or owning a home i would love to hear people 's thoughts on why this would or would not be a good idea are there any costs i am neglecting i want the house to be primarily an investment is there any reason that it would be a poor investment   i live and work in a college town but not your college town you like many students convinced to buy are missing a great many costs there are benefits of course there 's a healthy supply of renters and you get to live right next to campus but the stuff next to campus tends to be the oldest and therefore most repair prone property around which is where the bad neighborhood vibe comes from a lot of the value of your property would be riding on government policy could involve drastic cuts to their size in the near future and student loan reform could backfire and become even less available even city politics comes into play when property developers lobby city council to your neighborhood for apartments you could end up either surrounded with cheaper units or possibly eminent i 've seen both happen in my college town if you refuse to sell you could find yourself facing an oddly high number of rental inspections for example so on to the general advice firstly real estate in general does n't reliably increase in value at best it tends to track inflation most of the flipping and such you saw over the past decade was a prolonged bubble which is slowly and reliably tanking    beyond that property taxes insurance pmi and repairs need to be factored in as well as income tax from your renters and if you leave the home and continue to rent it out it 's not a owner occupied property anymore which is part of the agreement you sign and determines your interest rate there 's also risks if one of your buddies loses their job wrecks their car or loses financial aid you may find yourself having to eat the loss or evict a good friend or if they themselves just for an example alcohol poisoning it could land on your homeowners insurance or maybe the plumbing breaks and you 're out an expensive repair finally there are significant costs to transacting in real estate you can expect to pay like 5 6 percent of the price of the home to the agents and various fees to inspections it will be exceedingly difficult to recoup the cost of that transaction before you graduate you 'll also be anchored into managing this asset when you could be pursuing career opportunities elsewhere in the nation take a quick look at three houses you would consider buying and see how long they 've been on the market that 's months of your life dealing with this house in a bad neighborhood

students 1 to pay off all student loans is n't inflationary it would be deflationary   no if you have to print money out of thin air and letting it circulate in the economy then you are expanding the money supply inflation it would have to contract the money supply to be deflation even if the money is being spent on student loan payments it is still circulating in the economy provided the recipients of the loans banks or government depending use it later   debt was created out of thin air sure but debt is not money so it has nothing to do with inflation or deflation it can be paid back over long periods of time in the case of student loans 35 years the government could pay students back over the course of 50 years to reduce the debt burden for them but it would hardly be getting the same amount back in tax revenue the government gives someone $ 1,000 and they spend it all you might generate a couple hundred dollars in taxes over the course of the year if that money keeps changing hands   this solution is not feasible those in occupy need to come up with something more realistic

while i ca n't say how it is in the philippines my wife the insurance broker leads me to believe that individual insurance is more expensive than group coverages in the us almost always   so much so that people will go to great to form any sort of business just to insure themselves if however it is cheaper ca n't you simply opt out of your employer 's plan   if you can opt out will your employer give you any of the money they are n't paying for your insurance if you ca n't opt out or if you paycheck does n't grow i ca n't see why you would want additional coverage especially at such a young age   should you lose your job in the near future and you worry about go get the insurance then edit one big advantage is if you get personal insurance you might need to get an exam to qualify and it is likely the younger you are the better you will qualify but again you already have insurance that covers you so i would advise keeping the group policy is probably better

unfortunately the tax system in the u.s. is probably more complicated than it looks to you right now first you need to understand that there will be taxes withheld from your paycheck but the amount that they withhold is simply a guess   you might pay too much or too little tax during the year   after the year is over you 'll send in a tax return form that calculates the correct tax amount   if you have paid too little over the year you 'll have to send in the rest but if you 've paid too much you 'll get a refund   there are complicated formulas on how much tax the employer withholds from your paycheck but in general if you do n't have extra income elsewhere that you need to pay tax on you 'll probably be close to breaking even at tax time when you get your paycheck the first thing that will be taken off is fica also called social security medicare or the payroll tax   this is a fixed 7.65 that is taken off the gross salary   it is not refundable and is not affected by any allowances or deductions and does not come in to play at all on your tax return form there are optional employee benefits that you might need to pay a portion of if you are going to take advantage of them such as health insurance or retirement savings   some of these deductions are paid with before tax money and some are paid with after tax money the employer will calculate how much money they are supposed to withhold for federal and state taxes yes california has an income tax and the rest is yours at tax time the employer will give you a form w-2 which shows you the amount of your gross income after all the before tax deductions are taken out which is what you use to calculate your tax   the form also shows you how much tax you have paid during the year form 1040 is the tax return that you use to calculate your correct tax for the year   you start with the gross income amount from the w-2 and the first thing you do is add in any income that you did n't get a w-2 for such as interest or investment income and subtract any deductions that you might have that are not taxable but were not paid through your paycheck such as moving expenses student loan interest tuition etc   the result is called your adjusted gross income next you take off the deductions not covered in the above section property tax home mortgage interest charitable giving etc   you can either take the standard deduction $ 6,300 if you are single or if you have more deductions in this category than that you can itemize your deductions and declare the correct amount after that you subtract more for exemptions   you can claim yourself as an exemption unless you are considered a dependent of someone else and they are claiming you as a dependent   if you claim yourself you take off another $ 4,000 from your income what you are left with is your taxable income for the year   this is the amount you would use to calculate your tax based on the bracket table you found california has an income tax and just like the federal tax some state taxes will be deducted from your paycheck and you 'll need to fill out a state tax return form after the year is over to calculate the correct state tax and either request a refund or pay the remainder of the tax   i do n't have any experience with the california income tax but there are details on the rates on this page from the state of california

a lot of loans are taken out on a fixed rate basis so the rate is part of the contract and is therefore covered by contract law if the loan is taken out on a variable basis then in principle the rate can rise within the terms of the contract   if a particular lender tries to raise its rates out of line with the market then its customers will seek alternative cheaper loans and pay off their expensive loan if they can if rates rise sharply in general due to unusual economic circumstances then those with variable rate loans can find themselves in severe trouble   for example the base rate in the uk and therefore variable mortgage rates closely tied to it spiked sharply in the late 80s which caused severe stress to a lot of borrowers and undoubtedly pushed some into financial difficulties

i listened to about 15 minutes of the video but then i read your other link which gives a much better summary this guy is an idiot just consider this statement if everyone was taxed at 100 it would n't be enough to balance the federal budget this is true to some extent it would n't be enough to balance the federal budget in one year experts often cite things like debt to gdp to show that a country 's debt is ballooning but they do n't mention this obvious fact we do n't have to pay off our debts in a single year nobody does debt to gdp is a ratio and not the end all be all wrote a paper about how countries with high debt to gdp tend to have slower economic growth but they do n't mention that this occurs at every stage of debt growth see debt delusion by dr. robert shiller for a great article on this subject the daily article goes over most of the points i would make but let me generalize a little always be wary of doomsday and free advice this guy talks about correctly calling fannie and freddie even if he 's right why is he mentioning it if he 's such a good accountant and financial expert surely he could 've seen the tech bubble before the housing bubble right it took a lot of analysis to figure out that cdo 's were junk anybody with the ability to read a balance sheet could see that many tech companies were overvalued every now and then you get one hit wonders they might never be right again but they have the credentials if these people were really that good they would n't be selling investment newsletters they 'd be applying their strategies and getting rich buffett has been getting rich for over 50 years and he 's not publishing newsletters with secret genius strategies he 's made it pretty clear what his philosophy is and anyone who follows it patiently will make money 's argument only makes sense if you agree with the assumptions the us will implode if nobody accepts our money nobody will accept our money if we 're no longer the reserve currency or hyperinflation occurs or something like that people have been predicting doom after every bubble but that does n't make it true some of his points like the fact that we have too much debt are valid and i predict that the world will go into a period of deleveraging now nonetheless the whole we will implode story is a scary picture but it 's just that a picture

i think you are having trouble understanding what liquid means liquidity refers to how easily an asset can be converted to cash more liquid = more easily converted to cash less liquid less so any kind of exit load is going to make an asset less liquid due to the penalties associated with making the sale so the whole point of liquid funds is to give people the option of selling quickly if they need to since an exit load is meant to discourage this behavior liquid funds tend not to have one the point is n't what the financial institution gets it 's about offering a service to clients with a particular investment need

banks worry that the large gift might be a loan that is ultimately expected to be repaid if so that affects the cash flow of the recipient and makes it more difficult to make the mortgage payments to the bank   in some cases of course it is an informal loan dad advances a large $ x to son to use as a but does not charge interest and the expectation is that the money will be returned in smaller chunks as and when the son can afford to repay dad    in some cases dad truly means it as a gift but son feels an obligation to repay the money if not explicitly then by paying for the first few months of dad 's nursing home stay etc   so banks like to have an explicit document such as a copy of a letter from dad saying that this money is a gift and some assurance that this is on the up and up    if the amount is larger than the maximum gift that can be given each year without having to file a gift tax return then some assurance that a gift tax return will be filed is helpful mentioning this in the letter is good it indicates that there are no secret or secret agreements to the effect that this is in fact a loan with or without regular repayments

a market maker is someone that is contractually bound by the exchange to provide both bid and ask prices for a given volume e.g. 5000 shares a single market maker usually covers many stocks and a single stock is usually covered by many market makers the nyse has specialists that are market makers that also performed a few other roles in the management of trading for a stock and usually a single issue on the nyse is covered by only one market maker   market makers are often middlemen between brokers ignoring stuff like dark pools and the fact that brokers will often trade stocks internally among their own clients before going to the exchange   historically the market makers gave up buy sell discretion in exchange for being the go to guys for anyone wanting to trade in that stock when you told your broker to buy a stock for you he did n't hook you up with another retail investor he went to the market maker market makers would also sometimes find investors willing to step in when more liquidity was needed for a security they were like other floor traders they hung out on the exchange floors and interacted with traders to buy and sell stocks traders came to them when they wanted to buy one of the specialist 's issues there was no public order book just ticker tape and a quote it was up to the market maker to maintain that order book   since they are effectively forbidden from being one sided traders in a security their profit comes from the bid ask spread being the counter party to almost every trade they 'd make profit from always selling above where they were buying except when the price moved quickly the downside to this arrangement the spread goes to the market maker is just stating that the profit implicit in the spread gets consumed by the market maker with the switch to ecns the role of the market maker has changed for example forex trading firms tend to act as market makers to their customers on ecns the invisible anonymous guy at the other end of most trades is often a market maker still performing his traditional role yet brokers can interact directly with each other now rather than relying on the market maker 's book with modern online investing and public order books retail investors might even be trading directly with each other market makers are still out there in part they perform a service sold by an exchange to the companies that choose to be listed on that exchange that service has changed to helping volatility during normal high volatility periods such as at open and close

i actually just did that with my chase freedom card they rotate categories every 3 months and from april june it was 5 back at grocery stores   so i bought a ton of gas cards and got my 5 back   next i figured out i would be clever and buy a ton of store gift cards grocery gift cards right at the end of the quarter then use those in the future to purchase gas cards   well i just tried that a couple days ago and discovered the store refuses to sell a gift card if you 're paying with a gift card   so now i 'm stuck with $ 1,000 in grocery cards until i use them in actual grocery purchases haha one of the things about this grocery store is they partner with a gas station on their rewards program   they offer 10 cents off a gallon with every $ 100 spent in store and they double it to 20 cents off a gallon if you buy $ 100 in gift cards   then on the back of the receipt is a coupon for 10 cents off per gallon which they double on   unfortunately i think i 'm one of the only people that takes this much advantage of the program   side note i actually just changed the billing cycle of my chase freedom card to end on the 24th of the month   that way i can charge a bunch of rewards in the final 6 7 days of the quarter   and if i have a $ 0 balance on the 24th my bill is n't due for 7 weeks interest free   and chase freedom has never cared if you purchase gift cards with their quarterly rewards program   i also gave them a courtesy email giving the specific store and $ $ $ amount that was going to be charged and of course they still called me with a fraud alert

the two most common scenarios are since you have more control of timing when you are the buyer compared to when you are the seller 1 is probably more common however a good real estate attorney should be able to walk you through your options should 2 come up fortunately many real estate attorneys do not charge you anything until the sale completes and you will likely get a discount if you involve them in both the sale and purchase so i would start by finding an attorney

when you are a certain age you will be able to tap into your retirement accounts or start receiving pension and social security funds in addition you may be faced with required minimum distributions from these accounts   but even before you get to those points you will generally shift the focus of new funds into the retirement account to be more conservative depending on the balances in the various accounts and the size of the pension and social security accounts you may even move invested funds from aggressive to conservative investments the proper proportion of the many different types of investments and revenue streams is open to much debate during retirement you will be pulling money out of retirement accounts either to support your standard of living or to meet the required minimum distributions what to sell will be based on either the tax implications or the required distributions that will still maintain the asset allocation you desire    if your distributions are driven by the law you will be selling enough to meet a specific required $ figure you will either spend that money or move it into a low interest savings account or a non retirement investment account if trying to meet your standard of living expectations you will be selling funds that allow you to keep your desired asset allocation but still have enough to live on again you will be trying to meet a specific $ figure   of course you may decide at anytime in retirement to rebalance based on changes to your lifestyle family obligations or winning the lottery

i do n't know much about how student loans work so there might be some caveats e.g. does the interest rate stay constant do you get a discount if you pay off early etc ignoring those caveats the interest on you student loan looks quite small depends a bit where you are in the world but it seems very likely that you can get more interest than that on a 100 guaranteed investment form e.g. term bank deposits so it seems a no brainer to not pay back you student loan and invest the money securely for a higher interest rate instead similar situation when you think about taking the money as a down payment for a house more factors come into play here

gt;well put and honestly seemingly unavoidable   yes there is an aspect of it that i think is the equivalent to ocean there are winds and waves of fortune which are often mistaken as entirely due to merit when in fact the merit may have been only a minor factor   gt;as i see it re is a crap investment for the foreseeable future as oversupply and are not absorbed people have to live so rentals will be key but they have already quite a bit    i 'd agree   i 've looked into and decided to pass on the whole buy up a bunch of homes amp rent them out line   there was definitely an opportunity with foreclosure distressed sale properties in the area but after and seeking advice from several experienced landlords i have concluded that it is not the risk free passive income mechanism that a lot of think it is and there is substantial risk effort involved both in the form of capital investment repairs maintenance requiring both time amp money as well as the probability of an interrupted revenue steam bad renters are difficult expensive to deal with as well as other costs significantly increased property taxes especially on rentals etc   the truly big gains to my understanding anyway of being a landlord are the windfall cash out phase where having had renters paying the mortgage interest you get the benefit of the capital gain on the sale of the property but due to what i think and sincerely believe based on the of boomer die off i am fairly certain that said payoff will not be anywhere near as large in the coming decades as it has been in the past if the payoff even exists at all and is n't a net loss especially in light of the work effort investment involved   will likely trade sideways for awhile before likely tanking as the forced willing withdrawals start happening from the boomers so keeping it in stocks does n't sound overly positive unless a fairly aggressive put strategy is enforced    depends on what you mean by stocks the overall market is one thing specific stocks can be quite a different story while it is an extreme example note the dramatic difference between aapl vs the dow during the past = = = = nasdaq etc   basically the whole idea of passive mindless set it and forget it gains from investments being the path to wealth has to go bye bye it was never really real to begin with unless you timed the market just right and the vast majority of the gains were nominal anyway   gt;for me personally and selfishly i have 20 years minimum for retirement so i 'm fine the market trending sideways or down it means that i 'm getting more bang for my dca buck and 20 + years from now i will be well positioned when the market eventually cycles back up    i guess i take the long term historical view that the very concept of some guaranteed retirement was simply an a lucky generation or two got away with it by accident in the timing of their birth something they really had no input into   instead i think one will always need to be working in some manner or another actively overseeing ones investments and remaining agile in response   and of course there is risk involved in that as if there is really any reason we should expect there not to be anyone who thinks that way imo is simply ignorant of the vast scope of human history   the best i think one can do is to truly diversify and that does not mean mutual funds to separate your eggs into various baskets holding some major part in solid as solid as can be form even with the possibility of zero return and/or some loss i.e. owning primary housing clear of debt some pm 's in physical form etc having other assets in what are fairly solid bets based on demographic trends company quality etc and then some things several small bets that are long shots but potentially high return things where just one win can not only offset a dozen non performers losers but gain you a substantial real profit   basically i think one has to use their mind and available information which must be actively sought out and seriously analyzed considered and then even with all of that realize that there is a certain crap shoot aspect to everything and that big winners are just as often either scam artists who often get their think enron or who are just lucky shits who were in the right place at the right time were dealt the right cards and subsequently made the right bets due to wiki and other biases we just do n't often hear about the ones who hit 4 out of 5 of those things and who might have still been winners but just not large prominent enough to gain fame amp recognition much less the 3 out of 5 whose gains were minimal or a wash

i used to be in research department for big financial data company    tell your son that there are three factors most people think that net sales vs. expectations is the only factor   it might not even be the biggest   it is simply how much money did company make   note that this is not how many units they sold   for most companies they will have adjustable pricing and incentives in their sector   for example let 's talk about a new company selling superman kid 's bikes with a cape the flips out when you hit a certain speed   the company has it in walmart at one price target at another toys r us even cheaper amazon making more profit there and other stores   they are doing ok come dec. 1 but holiday season being half way over they slash price from $ 100 to $ 80 because they have tons of inventory   what are looking at her is how much money did they make   note that marketing advertising legal setting up contracts are a bit fixed in my opinion consumer sentiment is the 1 thing for a company that sells a product   incredible consumer sentiment is like millions of dollars in free advertising   so let 's say dec. 15th comes and the reviews on the superman bike are through the roof   every loves it no major defects   company ca n't even supply the retailers now because after slashing the price it became a great buy   a common investor might be pissed that some dummy at the company slashed the prices so they could have had a much better profit margin but at the same time it would n't have led to an of sales and consumer sentiment and the last area is product sell off   this does n't apply to all product but most   some products will only have a technology shelf life some will actually go bad or out of fashion and even selling superman bikes you want to get those to the store because the product is so big   so ignoring making a profit can a company sell off inventory at or around cost   if they ca n't even if they made a profit their risk factor goes up so let 's get back to superman bikes   this is the only product company abc has   they had expected holiday sales at 100 million and profits at 40 million   they ended up at 120 million and 44 million    let 's say their stock was $ 20 before any information was gathered by the public remember for most companies info is gathered daily now so this is rather simplistic   so you might expect that the stock would rise to maybe $ 24 to which if you were an investor is a great profit however this company has a cult consumer following who are waiting for the captain america bike shoots discs and the bike turns green when you go fast   let 's say consumer sentiment and projections base off that put next holiday sales at $ 250 million   so maybe the company is worth $ 40 a share now   but consumer sentiment is funny because not only does it effect future projections but it also effects perceived present value of company which may have the stock trading at $ 60 a share think earnings and companies like google   having a company people feel proud owning or thinking is cool is also a indicator or share worth i gave you a really good example of a very successful company selling superman bikes there are just as many companies that have the opposite happening   imagine missing sales goals by a few million with bad consumer feedback and all of a sudden your company goes from $ 20 to $ 5 a share

he was sure upset from his point of view the government is the end all for everyone i just ca n't agree with his implied supposition that the government is totally responsible for burger kings success and therefore they should be ashamed that they do n't want to pay more in taxes there has got to be a compromise on corporate taxes that would prevent such moves in the future although mr. would probably prefer a state run burger king with the courtesy and efficiency of our beloved tsa or irs

if they own the old house outright they can mortgage it to you in many jurisdictions this you of the obligation to chase for payment and of any worry that you wo n't get paid because a transfer of ownership to the new owner can not be registered until any charge against a property ie a mortgage has been discharged the cost of to your friends of setting up the mortgage will be less than the interest they are offering you and you will both have peace of mind even if the sale of the old house falls through you will still be its mortgagee and still assured of repayment on any future sale or even inheritance complications arise if the first property is mortgaged although second mortgages are possible and rank behind first mortgages in priority of repayment the first mortgagee generally has a veto on the creation of second mortgages

you should check if your card issuer provides a bill pay service i have a capitalone card and i know they do n't but wells fargo may i do n't know however for that to work your biller must accept credit cards as payments at least that 's the restriction i have with such a feature on my card that means that if the company does n't accept credit cards directly they 're likely not to participate in the credit cards bill pay system as well some credit cards are actually mailing these balance transfer checks quite frequently trying to you into taking advantage of your available credit unless you really do n't have any other choice you should n't but if that 's the only way you have of paying go for it that not be treated as a cash advance but rather as balance transfer you can call the customer service and have them a check mailed to you you may want to consider talking to your bank and checking if they can give you a line of credit that would be similar to the credit card i.e. revolving credit line from your credit report score perspective but may have lower interest rates

i wrote retirement savings ratio some time ago and 15 seemed the sweet spot the 15 is 10 saved and 5 match in my mind the reason i link is to show a spreadsheet that shares my approach to the analysis   you list a huge number of things to think about all great i 'm near duff 's view although i shoot for 20x final   income so 4 of that is an 80 replacement there 's nothing magic about 80 if social security exists it actually drops the required 80 from you to the 60 or so duff lists so we align   the problems with my sheet no one gets exact 3 raises for 43 years so one can go in and change that maybe higher early on then slow it down returns are 8 every year so one must go to the sheet or their own plan and reassess how they are doing each year disclosure we are now at our income with a goal of 25 to replace 100 so we need a cumulative 80 growth as in s&p at 2500 or the years of deposits to get there i am nearing 50   let me pick one of your questions your expenses go down at retirement stay the same or go up this is the $ 64 k question the 80 is an average guess the general assumption is in this range if we downsized right after the kid goes to college we could retire on far less so to wrap up online calculators and spreadsheets only go so far your questions are dead on a planner should ask every one of these questions before assuming any ratio   edit on re read i am blown away by the list of questions you have here it 's great and it shows how there 's risk no matter what

the question you should be asking yourself is this why am i putting money into a 401(k for many people the answer is to grow a large nest egg and save for future retirement expenses investors are balancing risk and potential reward so the asset categories you 're putting your 401(k contribution towards will be a reflection on how much risk you 're willing to take per a us news world report article ultimately investors would do well to remember one of the key tenants    of investing diversify the narrower you are with your investments    the greater your risk says vanguard 's diversification    does n't ensure against a loss but it does help lessen a significant    loss generally investing in your employer 's stock in your 401(k is considered very risk in fact one forbes recommends not putting any money into company stock finra notes simply stated if you put too many eggs in one basket you can expose yourself to significant risk in financial terms you are under diversified you have too much of    your holdings tied to a single investment your company 's stock    investing heavily in company stock may seem like a good thing when    your company and its stock are doing well but many companies    experience fluctuations in both operational performance and stock    price not only do you expose yourself to the risk that the stock    market as a whole could but you take on a lot of company    risk the risk that an individual firm your company will falter or    fail in simpler terms if you invest a large portion of your 401(k funds into company stock if your company runs into trouble you could lose both your job and your retirement investments for the other investment assets vehicles you should review a few things personally i prefer to keep my portfolio simple and just pick just a few options based on my own risk tolerance from your fund examples without knowing specifics about your financial situation and risk tolerance i would have created a portfolio that looks like this when i was in my 20 's i avoided the bond and income money market funds because the growth potential is too low for my investing horizon like some of the other answers have noted the target date funds invest in other funds and add some additional fee overhead which i 'm trying to avoid by investing primarily in index funds again your risk tolerance and personal preference might result in a completely different portfolio mix

for all stocks expected dividends are a part of the price it is traded for consider that originally the whole idea of stocks was to participate in the earnings of the company = get dividends the day the dividend is paid that expectation is of course removed and thereby the stock value reduced by just the amount of dividend paid you will see that behavior for all stocks everywhere the dividend in your example is just high relative to the stock price but that is a company decision they can decide whatever amount they want as a dividend in other words the day before dividend payments investors value the stock at $ plus an expected dividend payment of 12 $ which adds to 26 $ the day after the dividend payment investors still value the stock at $ plus no more dividend payment = 0 $ nothing changed really in the valuation

when it comes down to it long term investments pay better than short term ones   if nothing else there 's less administration and less financial risk for the provider   that 's why 2 3 or 5 year savings accounts pay better than instant access ones higher risk investments pay more interest or dividends than low risk ones   they have to or nobody would invest in them so by locking yourself out of any long term and/or risky investments you 're stuck with a choice of low interest short term ones there are plenty of investment funds that you can sell at short notice if you want to   but they are volatile and if you cash out at the wrong time you can get back less than you invested   the way you lower risk is either to invest in a fund that covers a broad range of investments or invest in several different funds

as always with investments it depends on your risk adversity i do n't want to repeat the content of hundreds of recommendations here so just the nutshell for qualified investments the more risk you are willing to take the more returns you 'll get the upper end is the mutual funds and share market where you have long term expectations of 8 10 and corresponding risks of maybe + 50 per year the lower end is a cd where you can expect little to no interest corresponding to little to no risk investing in shares funds is not better than investing in cds it is different not everybody likes financial roller and some people mainly consider the high risk which gives them sleepless nights while others just consider the expected high long term gains as all that counts find out what your personal risk adversity is and then pick accordingly

the irs defines income quite specifically on the topic what is taxable and nontaxable income they note you can receive income in the form of money property or services this section discusses many kinds of income that are taxable or nontaxable it includes discussions on employee wages and fringe benefits and income from bartering partnerships s corporations and royalties   bartering or giving someone wages or similar in something other than currency or some other specifically defined things like fringe benefits is taxed at fair market value bartering bartering is an exchange of property or services you must include in your income at the time received the fair market value of property or services you receive in bartering for additional information refer to tax topic 420 bartering income and barter exchanges bartering is more specifically covered in topic 420 bartering income you must include in gross income in the year of receipt the fair market value of goods or services received from bartering generally you report this income on form 1040 schedule c pdf profit or loss from business sole proprietorship or form 1040 schedule c ez pdf net profit from business sole proprietorship if you failed to report this income correct your return by filing a form 1040x pdf amended u.s. individual income tax return refer to topic for information on filing an amended return more details about income in general beyond the above articles is available in publication 525 taxable and nontaxable income   it goes into great detail about different kinds of income in your example you 'd have to calculate the fair market value of an avocado and then determine how much cash equivalent you were paid in   the irs would n't necessarily tell you what that value was you 'd calculate it based on something you feel you could justify to them afterwards   the way i 'd do it would be to write down the price of at each pay period and apply a dollar cost averaging type method to determine the total pay 's fair value    while the avocado example is of course largely absurd the advent of bitcoins has made this much more relevant   publication 525 has this to say about virtual currency virtual currency    if your employer gives you virtual currency such as bitcoin as payment for your services you must include the fair market value of the currency in your income the fair market value of virtual currency such as bitcoin paid as wages is subject to federal income tax withholding federal insurance contribution act fica tax and federal unemployment tax act futa tax and must be reported on form w-2 wage and tax statement gold would be fundamentally similar although i am not sure it 's legal to pay someone in gold assuming it were though its fair market value would be again the definition of income   similarly if you 're paid in another country 's currency the us dollar equivalent of that is what you 'll pay taxes on at the fair market value of that currency in us dollars

i am not aware of any place that the tax forms ask how many people live in your house they ask how many you have and not everyone who lives in your house is your dependant there are very specific rules about that if your girlfriend is being claimed as a dependent on her parents tax return then she can not also be claimed on anyone else 's return and there 's no need to investigate further to claim someone as a dependent they have to meet a number of conditions i am not a lawyer see irs publication 17 but the gist of it is that they must a either be a relative there 's a list of what sorts of relatives qualify or live with you all year b living with you must not violate local law c must make less than $ 4000 per year and d you must provide over half of their support your girlfriend may meet the live with you all year or maybe not but the real is likely to be d unless your parents are paying her tuition they almost certainly do n't meet this test

in other words to a first order approximation the s&p 500 is always at an all time high i 'm going to run with this observation a bit the crash of 87 was remarkable it was a drop of 1/3 in a short time yet when one looked at the year the dow was up nearly 5 with dividends included a one year rip van would have up thinking it an year   i actually recall a conversation i had on aug 25th 1987 i was discussing the market with a colleague over lunch and while i did n't call the top that day i remarked that it did n't matter much that 5 10 years later just staying in the market would have been the right thing     compare this 87 95 chart to the longer term chart shows in his chart this is all but a blip in my chart you can see it took about 3 1/2 years to be in the black as the market then shot up from there a dollar cost would not have bought at that short term high well not more than a tiny bit   the best i can do to conclude is to say i 'd never just buy in all at once you buy in over time x% of your income each month and if you have a chunk to invest smooth it out over a few years

why does the article which refers to the 2006 2008 boom as a age use the same time period as a basis for labor participation calculation should they not use a more wise approach and make the basis around 2005 or 2004 and then calculate the amount of labor participating in order to account for the false high of 2007 maybe i missed something in my education but if a specific time counts as an anomaly then it should not be the base calculation when deriving a hypothesis about that time period for example wage growth between 2005 and 2007 increased x% but between 2007 and 2009 decreased so we are really in for it now it should be the base period of 2005 shows a growth of x% to 2007 and from 2005 to 2009 shows a growth of only one tenth x%    of course this would make for much less sensationalist journalism and may not sell as many news stories as a sensationalist story would

that 's true about but that 's not the problem with tv advertising the problem is   if you 've ever listened to talk radio sometimes the host gets really quiet and almost and then he lights up and begins yelling and shouting   yet during this time you do n't need to adjust your radio 's volume the sound from the radio studio has been very heavily compressed so that the quiet and loud parts are all the same volume   if you the crap out of your commercial 's sound and then normalize it to 95 of the peak of the tv show 's sound which is typically not nearly as compressed then your commercial is going to be perceived as vastly louder than the tv show even though it never exceeds 95 of the tv show 's peak volume   thus a law referencing the average volume is thought to be more effective than one that simply requires   it still seems easy to work around though just have 29 seconds of silence and 1 second of horrendously loud house waking marketing slime   what they need to do is require that neither the average nor the peak db level of the commercial may exceed the average db level of the show   there might be cute little tricks that can get around that too but at some point the ad agency has to actually talk and sell their product rather than performing mathematical on the audio just to wake everyone up

your mother can give you $ 14k and your wife $ 14k every year without creating a gift tax filing requirement anything in excess of that and she will have to file form 709 with her tax return but she will not have gift tax liability on her end unless her lifetime gift tax exemption currently $ 5.49 m has been exhausted as the recipients of the gift you have no tax liability or reporting requirement so the easiest method would be for her to write you and your wife each checks for $ 14k since it 's almost the end of the year she could give you the extra $ 2k next year if needed that smaller amount would not likely need to season for loan approval since you mentioned only your mother i assumed it 's just her but if your mother is married both her and her spouse could each give you and your wife   $ 14k without creating a filing requirement so up to $ 56k in gifts from one couple to another or $ from one party to a couple it does n't have to be a spouse that 's just the typical scenario

i would say a lot of the answers here are n't quite right the main issue here is that banking is a highly industry there are few key players the uk for example has only 5 major banks operating under a variety of brands it 's all the same companies underneath and the market is very very hard to enter owing to the immense regulatory burden because the landscape is so narrow and it 's possible to keep close tabs on all   your competitors there 's no incentive to spend money on shiny new things to keep up with the competition the industry is purely reactive   if nobody else has an awesome feature filled online portal there 's no need for any one bank to make one   if everybody is reactive and nobody proactive then it 's a short logical deduction that improvements happen at a pace also take into account that when you 've got this toxic bare minimum form of competition the question for these people soon turns to what can we get away with which results in things like subpar online portals with as much information as you like delivered on paper for a hefty charge and price fixed administrative fees   furthermore your transaction history is super valuable information   there are one or two highly profitable companies who international transaction data and whose sole job in life is to restrict access to that information to the highest bidders   your transaction history is an asset in a multibillion dollar per year industry and as such it is not surprising that banks do n't want to give it out for free

it is likely a scam   in fact the whole mystery shopping job may be a scam   there is a page about cashier 's check scams as well as a us government page which specifically mentions mystery shopping as a scam angle as for how the scam works from the site i just linked however cashier ’s checks lately have become an attractive vehicle for fraud when used for payments to consumers although the amount of a cashier ’s check quickly becomes available for withdrawal by the consumer after the consumer deposits the check these funds do not belong to the consumer if the check proves to be fraudulent it may take weeks to discover that a cashier ’s check is fraudulent in the meantime the consumer may have irrevocably wired the funds to a scam artist or otherwise used the funds only to find out later when the fraud is detected that the consumer owes the bank the full amount of the cashier ’s check that had been deposited it is somewhat unusual in that from what you say there has been no attempt thus far to get money back   however your sister in law may have received that info separately or received it as part of her mystery shopping job but did n't mention it to you with regard to this check   typically the scam involves telling the recipient to transfer money to a third party e.g. by buying goods as a mystery shopper or via wire transfer to reimburse someone associated with a sham operation   by the time the cashier 's check is revealed as fraudulent the victim has already transferred away his her own real money it 's probably worth taking the check to your or her bank and asking them about it   they may have more info   also banks usually want to know about scams like this because in the long run they accumulate data on them and share that with law enforcement and can eventually catch some of the scammers edit just to help anyone who may be reading this later   the letter you added confirms it is absolutely a scam   my boss was once contacted via a scam operation very similar to this   the huge red flag in addition to others already mentioned is that you are being given a check for over $ 2000 of which only $ 25 is purportedly for actual mystery shopping and $ is payment for you the mystery shopper   the whole rest of the $ 2000 + amount is for you to wire to another mystery secret shopper in order for them to complete their assignment   they are giving you $ 2000 to give to someone else who is supposedly another one of their own employees contractors   ask yourself what sane business would conduct their operations in this way   if you work at a law office or a hamburger stand or a school or anything you like does your boss ever say here is your paycheck for $ 5000   i know you only earned $ 1000 but i 'm just going to give you the whole $ 5000 and you 're supposed to use $ 4000 of it to pay your coworker joe his wages   no   there is no reason to do that except that the other mystery shopper is actually the scammer

interest is calculated daily doing the math between 6 17 and 7 25 are 38 days 38 = interest per day between 7 25 and 8 17 are 23 days 23 = interest per day the minimal difference is because the principal has already gone down a little bit so you should expect x number of days for the next interest number coming up slowly decreasing as the remaining principal debt decreases note that this is equivalent of an annual interest rate of over 20 which is beyond acceptable in the current economy this is ridiculously high i recommend trying to get a refinancing with another provider you should be able to get it for a third of that

given your clarifying comment that you 're asking about the length of stay rather than airbnb in particular i 'd say there is a decent chance there will be tax differences   the difference is unlikely to be in income tax but many cities have local ordinances that impose transaction taxes on short stays   for instance the town where i live has a transient occupancy tax for any paid stay of less than 31 days unfortunately because these taxes are often levied by individual cities it 's hard to know whether one applies in your case   one town may impose no tax while the town right next to it does impose a tax   you 'll have to look at what your local laws are   this could be easy if your town has a nice comprehensive website about local laws if not you may have to do some deeper research in any case you should definitely look into it since there could be if there is a tax and the city finds out you 're not paying it   as airbnb has grown in popularity many municipalities have begun to crack down on airbnb renters who try to make money without paying taxes like a regular motel as well as conforming to other laws e.g. running a business in a neighborhood residential

how do we define worth to stock traders and some investors it has value either as a transaction or as a piece in an asset allocation strategy is is likely to generate long term revenues and profits that reflect the historical relationship between those factors and stock price performance unlikely   it might be a good short term play for the nimble investor but the real test of worth will be after the initial hype dies down it is what happens to the stock 90 days after it goes public that matters for the long term forgetting contributions to society knowledge and culture the markets will at that point make their determination about value

title insurance protects you from losing rights to your property in case of a court decision let 's look at an example i recently found in local newspapers one old woman sold her apartment to person a. the deed was by a notary public who verified that indeed in was that old woman putting her signature on the deed then person a sold the apartment to person b etc then after several deals some unfortunate buyer bought that apartment the deal looked so he 's got a mortgage to pay for the apartment later it turned out that the old lady died three months before she sold the apartment and the notary public was corrupt old lady 's heirs filed a lawsuit and the deal was void so the ultimate buyer lost all rights to the apartment although he purchased it legally this is the case when title insurance kicks in you need one if there 's a chance for a deal to be deemed void

you 're not being over taxed the withholding is just aggressive   employer 's do n't know your whole tax situation all they can go on is the amount they pay you minus deductions then extrapolate that to an annual number and withhold according to your w4 you could ratchet up your w4 exemptions and this will help your current withholding   when you do your taxes next april this will all shake out and you will likely receive a large refund    it 's also worth noting that your federal withholding given the numbers above is just about 19 not 27 which does match the federal tax table if your annual income was $ 72,000 as your semi monthly paycheck indicates   that should be closer to 14 at an annual income of $ 36,000   the medicare related taxes are flat amounts   so really you 're talking about an approximately 5 discrepancy on the $ 18,000 you 'll earn during this internship or about $ 900 if you feel like you 're being welcome to paying taxes

consider the following scenario at a small business as a business owner i have 10k in the bank at the moment i have a one time expense of 4k that will not directly impact the growth of my business i can choose to pay the 4k out of the 10 in the bank and then put the rest towards business growth assuming a 10 annual return on capital at the end of this transaction i am left with $ now if instead i chose to pay the 4k with a business credit card i have that only carries a 7.9 interest rate what would happen is that i incur a 4k balance that i have to pay off in a year and put 10k towards my business now this is a simplified case that does not take into account the effective interest on the card and the minimum monthly payments that being said what happens in the end of the year is that i owe $ to my credit card but i now have 11k   in the bank due to business growth that leaves me with $ after a year 's worth of operations which is better than my original $ this is a small scale scenario though but the basic idea is that if you can put the money towards growth that is better than the interest you are paying to the card you win the risks of course include missing a payment and incurring a penalty not being able to grow your money at the rate you thought and so on hope this explains things a bit

this is somewhat of a non answer but i 'm not sure you 'll ever find a satisfying answer to this question because the premises on which the question is based on are flawed   money itself does not exist physically at least not in the same sense that a product you buy does it simply does not make sense to say that you physically own money you can build a product out of but you can not build a money out of if you could then you could print your own money actually you can try to print your own money but nobody would knowingly accept it and thus is it functionally to real money the paper has no intrinsic value its value is derived from the fact that other people perceive it as valuable and nowhere else ergo paper money is no different than electronic money it is for this reason that if i were you i would be okay with online forex trading

401k contributions are exempt from employee and employer fica withholding   the employer withholding is approximately 7 of the gross   the closer the employer match ratio is to 7 the closer it is to paying for itself   example assuming an employee is match maximizing and in very round numbers 100,000 per year   a 50 match schedule is about $ 350 cheaper per employee than a 100 match schedule default non participant the employee will see about 7000 deducted for fica and the employer will pay 7000 to fica if they do n't participate    first case the match is 100 to a 5 cap the employee will deduct 5000 and have withheld for fica   the employer will pay to fica   the total employer cost of withholding and match is    second case if the match is 50 to a 5 cap the employee will deduct 10000 and have 6300 withheld for fica   the employer will pay 6300 to fica   the total employer cost of withholding and match is

let me give you some advice from someone who has experience at both ends had student loan issues myself and parents ran financial aid department at local university quick story of my student loan   i graduated in debt and could not pay at first due to having kids way too early   i deferred   schools will have rules for   there are also federal guidelines lets not get specific on this though since these change every year it seems    so basically there is an initial deferment period in which any student can request for the repayments to be deferred and it is granted   then there is an extended deferment   here someone has to ok it   this is really rather arbitrary and up to the school lender   my school decided to not extend mine after i filled out a of paperwork and showed that even without paying i had basically $ 200 a month for the family to live off past housing fixed expenses eventually they had to cave because i had no money so they gave me an extended deferment   after the 5 years i started paying   since my school had a very complex way to pay i decided to give them 6 months at a time   you would think they would love that right   on the check it was clearly stated what months i was paying for to show that i was not prepaying the loan off well i was in collections 4 months later   their billing messed up set me up for prepayment   they then played dumb and acted like i did n't but i had a picture of the check and their bank 's stamp on the back they could n't get my loan out of collections even though they messed up   this is probably some lower level employee trying to cover their mistake   so this office tells creditors to leave me alone but i also cannot pay my loan because the credit collection agency has slapped a 5k fee on the 7k loan   so my loan spent 5 years kid you not like this   it was interest free since the employee stopped the loan processing point being is that if you do n't pay the lender will either put your loan into deferment automatically or go after you   most not all schools will opt for deferment which i believe is 2 years at most places   then after that you have the optional deferment   so if you keep not paying they might throw you into that bucket    however if you stop paying and you never communicate with them the chances of you getting the optional deferment are almost none unless school does n't know where you live   basically if you do n't respond to their mail emails you get swept into their credit collection process   so just filling out the deferment stuff when you get it even if they deny it could buy you up to 10 years kid you not    now once you go into the collection process anything is game   as long as you do n't need a home car loan you can play this game   what the collection agency does depends on size of loan and the rules   if you are at a major university the rules are usually more lax but if you are at the smaller schools especially the advertised trade online schools boom better watch out   wages will be garnished very soon   expect to go to court might have to hire an attorney because some corrupt lenders start on fees think of the 5k mine on me    so the moral of the story is you will pay it off   if you act nice fill out paperwork talk to school and so on you can probably push this off quite a few years   but you are still paying and you will pay interest on everything   so factor in that to the equation   i had a 2.3 loan but they are much higher now    defaulting is n't always a bad thing   if you do n't have the money then you do n't have it   and using credit cards to help is not the thing to do   but you need to try to work with the school so you do n't incur penalties fees and so that your job does n't have creditors calling them    my story ended year 4 that my loan was in collection   a higher up was reviewing my case and called me   told her the story and emailed her a picture of their cashed check   she was completely embarrassed when she was trying to work out a plan for me and i am like how about i come down tomorrow with the 7k   but even though lender admitted fault this took 20 + calls to agencies to clear up my credit so i could buy a house    so your goal should be

in 2001 argentina defaulted on it 's debt and started negotiating a haircut with it 's debtors as a result a lot of the debtors sold the bonds they had a fire sale prices thinking better get some back than nothing   one of the guys that bought those cheap bonds was paul singer aka mr. vulture hedge fund i 'll speculate here saying that mr. singer saw that the bond conditions gave him a way to force argentina to pay the full value of the bonds notwithstanding it 's default or negotiated haircut argentina did negotiate a haircut with about 97 of it 's bond holders this meant that although they would lose out on some of the money they would still get some back and argentina could work its way back to its feet eventually    mr. singer and friends were the 3 that did not accept the haircut and took the country to court to get 100 of the bond value back   now the plot i do n't understand if mr. singer knew this or not but the bonds also had a condition that said that no bond holder would be worst off than the highest bond deal argentina offered anyone which basically means if they pay mr. singer 100 they have to pay everybody else 100 now it was well established that argentina could not pay 100 and is not able to pay 100 of the debt hence the 2001 default    meanwhile argentina was paying out the hair cut bonds but holding out on mr. singer and friends as they still did n't agree to pay 100 the courts ruled that they could not do this and had to pay everybody since argentina can not pay everybody 100 it is defaulting on the debt

because the us energy information administration at the time was run by the bush administration which loved fossil fuels but hated renewables so they predicted that coal and oil demand would soar while renewables would stall   they also predicted that overall energy demand would rise so we must dig more coal yet it actually fell due to efficiency improvements   one suspects they knew all their forecasts were complete crap

if there are no limit orders on the opposite side of the book when your market order gets its turn for execution it should be rejected by the market   a market order should generally not sit on the book like your question suggests waiting for another order to arrive   thus the situation that you describe should not happen in an ordinary market that is operating in an orderly fashion this is not to say that your order can not sit for a while in a queue if there is heavy volume orders will be executed in order so your your market order may have to wait for orders entered ahead of it to be processed   but once its turn comes up that 's it there are some related points to consider i should caution that my answer is biased a bit to us stock markets whereas you asked about currency markets   i believe the same basic principles apply but i 'd be swayed by someone with evidence to the contrary   i 'd also note that currency tends to be more liquid than stock so i think it 's less likely that this situation would come up   maybe possible for a weak currency or a currency that experiences a sudden crisis of some sort

the problem above is actually a pretty good list of the concerns around life insurance   while there is no correct answer to the question as posed this will vary among different there is a simpler way to think about insurance in general that may make finding what is right answer for you easier buying life insurance like almost all insurance is on average a money losing purchase   this is simply because the companies selling would n't offer it if they could n't expect to make money on it   think about buying insurance a warranty on a new cell phone maybe if you are particularly prone to damaging cell phones it can be in your favor but for most of the people that buy it will lose money on average people of course still buy insurance anyway to protect themselves from unlikely but very bad consequences   the big reason to make this trade off is if the loss will have big lasting consequences   to stay with our cell phone example having to replace a cell phone at least for me would be annoying but not a catastrophic event   for myself the protection is not worth the warranty cost but that is not true for everyone life insurance is a pretty extreme case of this but i find the best question to ask is if you you and your spouse were to die will your dependents lives become so much worse that you really dislike the idea of not being insured for some working seniors they already have enough saved to bridge their kids spouse to adulthood old age that insurance makes no sense   for some their children husband wife would be destitute and insurance is an obvious choice and an easy price to pay even if it is very high   the example you suggest seems on the border and good questions to ask are thinking about those questions may help you understand if the protection offers is worth the cost

yes they 're often a beneficial choice because it means you are earning the interest on the money instead of the government you wo n't necessarily pay taxes on it you have many options once you reach the point of wanting to do something with the money many people accumulate the wealth and then pass it down to subsequent generations without paying tax which is perfectly legal if done right others make donations to charity   those are just a couple examples but the point is that you accumulated the wealth over a long period of time and bought yourself time to decide what to do with it edit no if the investor decides to cash the money out all at once at the end it would not be equivalent assuming you had $ 1,000 to put in an account and could get a 5 return on your money and you were in the 25 tax rate the tax free account ends up with more in the end mostly by virtue of the compounding being tax free

i would n't worry about it probably would n't be best time for withdrawal aspect too much   with a bit of planning and organization you could cash out investments held in one country and have them reinvested in another one in a matter of days if not less your time out of the market   if the markets are cheap when you sell the chances are you 'll be able to buy in again at much the same price   there 's a small chance you miss out on the markets upwards but you might just as easily miss out on a fall and come out ahead   old saying time in the market is more important than market timing tax it 's hard to discuss without mentioning specific countries   e.g if you were resident in the uk you 'd probably want to invest within an isa tax free wrapper gains are tax free and there 's no penalty for withdrawing when you leave   no idea what equivalents there are around europe interestingly there seems to be some recognition by the eu that this sort of thing is an issue for an increasingly mobile workforce was recently some news of plans for a pan european pension savings vehicle

yes it applies to control groups   if i remember correctly common ownership rules are used to determine applicable large employer status but if the time comes to owe a penalty only the actual entity missing the mark will owe a penalty not the entire control group this is an excerpt from section the section that lays out employer requirements and penalties 16 employer the term employer means the person that is the employer of an employee under the common law standard see for purposes of determining whether an employer is an applicable large employer all persons treated as a single employer under section c m or o are treated as a single employer thus all employees of a controlled group of entities under section or c an affiliated service group under section or an entity in an arrangement described under section are taken into account in determining whether the members of the controlled group or affiliated service group together are an applicable large employer for purposes of determining applicable large employer status the term employer also includes a predecessor employer see paragraph of this section and a successor employer link to the federal register

actually i was listening pretty closely and heard very very few people speaking about the budget   they were typically often by republican    you make a good point about shills   unfortunately the vast majority of so called deficit hawks are the shills you are talking about   also lets not redirect the focus   the article is about the budget not obama war protesters or anything else

i 'm not 100 familiar with the index they 're using to measure hedge fund performance but based on the name alone comparing market returns to market neutral hedge fund returns seems a bit disingenuous   that does n't mean the article is wrong and they have a point about the of data but still

it takes a long time to bring these sort of cases to trial because of their complexity and the large sums of money that companies have to delay the process it takes political will to go after these types of crimes from the politics to building a case it just seems to me that five years is a very short time frame    i do n't know how or why it was set at five years but due to what we know now it might   be a better idea to extend the statue if the pros outweigh the cons

you can buy a new toyota from a non dealer but not from toyota directly as they have no retail distribution capability there is no need to buy directly from toyota if you want to get a new car without going through a dealer in many cases people buy new cars but have to sell them immediately for one reason or another

i will disagree with some of the other answers here   in my view the most important dimension of the situation is not your friend 's potential loss but the potential losses of the people he may convince by using his position as youth group leader etc to draw more them into the scam exactly how to handle this depends on many factors that are n't mentioned in your question and probably rightly so as this aspect of the situation moves beyond personal finance   for instance if your friend is a of the community who is widely trusted and you are not there may be little you can do since people will believe him and not you   if you have some influence over the groups he is trying to recruit you can attempt to provide a to his recruitment activities again how to do this depends on other factors such as how he is recruiting them   if he is just privately contacting individuals and inviting them to these meetings you may have to just keep your eyes for anyone who seems tempted and try to dissuade them before they suffer the brainwashing   if he actually tries to do some sort of public recruitment e.g. holding a meeting himself you could try to inject doubt by e.g. attending and asking probing questions to expose the dangers   if you think the danger is widespread you could consider taking some more public action like writing a column in a local paper about this organization of course another major factor is how much you think people stand to lose by this   however in your question you indicated that your friend has invested multiple month or years of income   if he intends to pressure others to invest similar amounts this sounds to me like enough danger to warrant some preventive action   few people can afford to lose months or years of income and sadly those most vulnerable to a scammer 's song are often those who can least afford it   it does n't sound like a situation where you 'd have to devote your life to the cause of stopping it but if i knew that dozens of people in my community stood to lose years of income i 'd want to make at least a small effort to stop them rather than just keep my mouth shut in doing this you may lose your friendship   however you stated that your goal is to resolve the situation in a way that is best with lowest loss of money for everybody   if you really take this utilitarian view it is likely that you may have to give up on the friendship to prevent other people from losing more money

the dividend tax credit is not applicable to foreign dividend income so you would be taxed fully on every dollar of that income when you sell a stock there will be a capital gain or capital loss depending on if it gained or lost value after accounting for the adjusted cost base you only pay income tax on half of the amount earned through capital gains and if you have losses you can use them to offset other investments that had capital gains or carry forward to offset gains in the future   the dividends from us stocks are subject to a 15 withholding tax that gets paid to the irs automatically when the dividends are issued if the stocks are held in an rrsp they are exempt from the withholding tax if held in a non registered account you can be reimbursed for the tax by claiming the foreign tax credit that you linked to if held in a tfsa or resp the withholding tax can not be recovered also if you are not directly holding the stocks and instead buy a mutual fund or etf that directly holds the stocks then the rrsp exemption no longer applies but the foreign tax credit is still for a non registered account if the mutual fund or etf does not directly hold stocks and instead holds one or more etfs there is no way to recover the withholding tax in any type of account

gt;the financial press is full of articles about the massive flow of investors to treasuries   wow yeah i mean if you read about it or saw it on the news then it must be true   but of course if that were really true then it would bring about the question why the f would the fed have bought 61 of us treasuries in headline fed debt

i tend to disagree i think amazon will find that as soon as it tries to raise prices to make a profit that people will type walmart instead of amazon see how easy that was   services are a good business too but the competition there is also vicious   further the has to be paid eventually sure amazon has great cash flow now but the assets they are acquiring are going to depreciate and need constant maintenance replacement they 're building an extremely capital intensive business and all that profit free growth is going to look more and more expensive as time goes by imo   people can argue all day it 's kinda pointless you 've probably made a lot in amazon i 've made a lot in apple i prefer apple because it 's also huge and turns a ridiculous profit if i have to pick a company i 'll pick the undervalued one with huge profits and huge cash flow that 's a good

interesting question    how is social security funded the social security system works by using current payroll taxes as funding to pay benefits to retirees   historically there was always more money coming in then what was being paid out in benefits   this changed at the beginning of march 2010 when social security started paying out more than it was taking in this article estimates the exact date to be around march 3 or march 4 the chart below has the approximate date highlighted with the red circle   due to the baby boomer generation it is estimated that social security will now be perpetually in the red unless changes are made   the recent reduction in payroll taxes will not help social security solvency   what was done with all the extra money social security collected over the last three decades the social security trust fund sstf was required to purchase special issue us government bonds with the excess funds   the sstf was essentially purchasing us government debt with the excess funds   this allowed congress to spend the excess funds   the special issue funds are different then normal us treasuries in that the sstf can redeem special issue bonds at face value at any time even before maturity   the sstf is currently holding $ 2.5 trillion of these special issue bonds as assets   what next hell if i know   the sstf was a major purchaser of us debt over the last few decades to the tune of $ 2.5 trillion   that changed in 2010   the sstf is no longer purchasing us debt at the same time the us government is issuing record amounts of debt   the sstf could begin redeeming its bonds to meet payment obligations   when it the bonds the us treasury must cough up the funds   where is it the us government going to get the money especially when it is currently borrowing money at record levels i read many articles that say that we do n't have to count sstf bond holdings as debt since we owe it to ourselves   that always makes me chuckle   the us government owes the sstf $ 2.5 trillion   i 'm not the us government so do n't count me in the we part of we owe it to ourselves   i 'm also fairly certain i will never see a dime of social security so do n't count me in the ourselves portion either charts were obtained from here

i think what the person meant to say is that gold is not a one stop solution there 's nothing wrong with having gold in an otherwise diversified portfolio but you need to be aware about the potential downsides the problem with gold is that its value nowadays depends mainly on investor confidence or the lack of it actual demand for gold can not explain the rise in value gold had after the crisis if people are afraid the world and currencies with it will go to hell the gold price will go up why because if currencies seize to exist gold will still be accepted it can replace currencies what many people tend to forget let 's consider the extreme example and currencies really cease to exist and all hell breaks lose what good are gold bars at the bank or even at home for that matter you 'll be better off with gold coins to use in barter and to pay off but that 's not about investing anymore that 's

no i did not get upset or went overboard sorry if you got that impression   i am discussing this topic with you   to summarize the future is battery because no battery today and in the near future can be used for a very long drive   you will pay only for the electricity you consumed from the battery you will pay more per kw than you pay for kw consumed at home because you have to pay for additional costs and profits by tesla   you will not pay for the battery because you do n't own the battery it 's exchanged every time   if you want and you mostly do short drives you can buy a car with a fixed set of batteries costing a lot of money but you will not have to pay the fees for kw you charge into it at your home

the best way to invest in college for your kid is to buy an investment property and rent it out you might think i am really crazy to ask you to you to buy a real estate property when everyone is running from real estate   go where others are running away from it look where others are not looking find out the need for a decent rental property in your city or county and start following the real estate market to understand the real activities including the rental market i would say follow it for 6 months before jumping in with any investment   and manage your property with good tenants until your kid is ready to go to college by the time your kid is ready for college the property would have been paid off by the rents and you can sell the property to send your kid to college
