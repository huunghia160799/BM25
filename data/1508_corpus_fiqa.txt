the short float ratio and percent change are all calculated based on the short interest the total number of shares shorted   the short interest data for nasdaq and nyse stocks is published every two weeks shows the exact dates for when short interest is published for nasdaq stocks and also says the following finra member firms are required to report their short positions as of settlement on 1 the 15th of each month or the preceding business day if the 15th is not a business day and 2 as of settlement on the last business day of the month the reports must be filed by the second business day after the reporting settlement date finra compiles the short interest data and provides it for publication on the 8th business day after the reporting settlement date the nyse also shows the exact dates for when short interest is published for nyse stocks and those dates are exactly the same as for nasdaq stocks since the short interest is only updated once every 2 weeks there is no way to see real time updating of the short float and percent change   that information only gets updated once every 2 weeks after each publication of the short interest

long term capital gains are taxed at 15 this year so the most you stand to save is $ 150 i would n't sell anything at a loss just to offset that unless you planned on selling anyways   a few reasons the long term capital gains rate will go up to 20 next year so your losses will be worth more next year than this year short term capital gains rates will go up next year as well so again better off saving your losses for next year you must use capital losses to offset capital gains if you have them but if you do n't have any capital gains you can use capital losses to offset ordinary income up to a limit $ 3,000 a year iirc   so if you just bite the bullet and pay the 15 on your gains this year you could use your losses to offset your likely higher rate ordinary income next year fyi complete chart for capital gains tax rates is here i also posted another answer about capital gains to this question a while back that might be useful

in my opinion the risk is about the lost opportunity cost you can find a lot of articles about it on the net in big shortcut opportunity cost takes place each time you have to choose between two or more options and the tradeoff effect have its price it is defined as value of best alternative solution quite good definition from wikipedia is as follows in theory the opportunity cost of a choice is the value of the best alternative forgone in a situation in which a choice needs to be made between several mutually exclusive alternatives given limited resources assuming the best choice is made it is the cost incurred by not enjoying the benefit that would be had by taking the second best choice available note that opportunity cost is not the sum of the available alternatives when those alternatives are in turn mutually exclusive to each other it is the value of the next best use   as you think this situation often happens in financial world where investors always seek best from their point of view way to invest capital

in my opinion you 're in a precious metals bubble when rising prices are driven by the people 's desire the own the commodity without a reason other than the market is going up usually bubble markets are fueled by lots of debt imo this is n't a bubble i do n't think that silver and gold values are shooting up like a rocket due to some of speculation   in my opinion citizens are losing faith in the government and in the value of money itself if you have money to save most banks pay less than 1 the government claims that inflation is the inflation rate on a us series i savings bond was in november 2010 yet most people are noticing in price in things that dominate their budget fuel healthcare local taxes and food i bought a pound of store brand butter for $ yesterday that was $ 0.99 4 5 years ago   people are seeing precious metals as a way to hedge against that they 're rational about it trying to protect assets is different than speculation i think the question to ask is is the us dollar 's value a bubble

as to where the interest comes from the same place it comes from in other kinds of savings accounts the bank takes the money you deposit and invests it elsewhere traditionally by lending it out to others hence the concept of a savings and loan bank they make a profit as long as the interest they give for borrowing from you plus the cost of administering the savings accounts and loans is less than the interest they charge for lending to others no they do n't have to pay you interest but if they did n't you 'd be likely to deposit your funds at another bank which did their ideal goal is to pay as little as possible without losing depositors while charging as much as possible without losing borrowers yeah i know typo corrected why do they get higher interest rate than they pay you mostly because your deposits and interest are essentially guaranteed whereas the folks they 're lending to may be late paying or default on those loans as with any kind of investment higher return requires more work and/or higher risk plus larger reserves so you can afford to ride out any losses that do occur

a balance transfer is paying one debt instrument with another   while this is typically seen in credit card offers it is n't necessarily confined to credit cards obviously the only reason to do this is refinancing debt to a lower interest rate   you need to watch for loads on the incoming money there may be an upwards of 5 fee   this calculation is materially different than your apr   monthly interest charges can be estimated by taking your apr divided by 12 times your balance   so a 15 apr will have a rough monthly interest charge of 1.25   the 5 balance transfer fee is 4x your normal interest charge   that fee is added to your balance and now you pay interest on the whole amount   you need to ensure the new rate is low enough to actually benefit you after the incoming fee

4.7 is a pretty low rate especially if you are deducting that from your taxes   if you reduce the number by your marginal tax rate to get the real cost of the money you end up with a number that is n't far off from inflation and also represents a pretty low yield in terms of paying off the loan early   e.g.   if your marginal tax rate is 28 then the net you are paying in interest after the tax deduction is 4.7 = while i 'm all for paying off loans with higher rates since it 's in effect the same as making that much risk free on the money it does n't make a lot of sense when you are down at 3.4 unless there is a strong security factor which really makes a difference to some folks to be had that really helps you sleep at night   to be realistic for some folks close to retirement there can be a lot to be said for the security of not having to worry about house payments although you do n't seem to be in that situation yet   as others have said first make sure you have enough liquid emergency money in something like a money market account or a ladder of short term cd 's   if you are sure that the sprouts will be going to college then there 's a lot to be said for kicking a decent amount into a 529 coverdell esa educational savings account uniform gift to minors account or some combination of those   i 'm not sure if any of those plans can be used for a kid that has not been born yet however   i 'd recommend as a good starting point to get more information on your various options    as with retirement savings money put in earlier has a lot more power over the final balance due to compounding interest so there 's a lot to be said for starting early although depending on what it takes to qualify for the plans there could be such a thing as too early there 's nothing wrong with managed mutual funds as long as the fund objective and investing style is in alignment with your objectives and risk tolerance the fund is giving you a good return relative to the market as a whole you are not paying high fees or load charges you are not losing a lot to taxes   i would always look at the return after expenses when comparing to other options and if the money is not in a tax deferred account also look at what sort of tax burden you will be faced with   a fund that trades a lot will generate more short term gains which means more taxes than compared to a more passive fund   anything lost to taxes is money lost to you so needs to come out of the total return when you calculate that   sometimes such funds are better off as a choice inside an ira or 401 k and you can instead use more tax efficient vehicles for money where you have to pay the taxes every year on the gains the reason a lot of folks like index funds better is that given your described age it 's not appropriate now but in the long run as you get closer to retirement you may want to start looking at building up some investments that are geared more towards generating income such as bonds or depending on taxes where you live municipal bonds   in any case the more money you can set aside for retirement now both inside and outside of tax deferred accounts the sooner you will get to the point of the critical mass you need to retire at that point you can work because you want to not because you have to

while the vanguard paper is good it does n't do a very good job of explaining precisely why each level of stocks or bonds was optimal if you 'd like to read a transparent and quantitative explanation of when and why a a glide path is optimal i 'd suggest the following paper   full disclosure i 'm the author   the answer is that the optimal risk level for any given holding period depends upon a combination of   using these two factors you construct a risk averse decision model which chooses the risk level with the best expected average outcome where it looks only at the median and lower percentile outcomes this produces an average which is specifically robust to downside risk the result will look something like this    the exact results will depend on the expected risk and return of the portfolio and the degree of risk aversion specified   the result is specifically valid for the case where you liquidate all of the portfolio at a specific point in time for retirement the glide path needs to be extended to take into account the fact that the portfolio will be liquidated gradually over time and dynamically take into account the longevity risk of the individual   i ca n't say precisely why vanguard 's path is how it is

you can get no load annuities through some no load financial companies like vanguard so to start with i 'd see how what she is being offered compares with something that comes free of a sales load i 'd also question that fixed rate seems pretty impossible to me which makes me think there is some catch or gotcha that we are not seeing that either brings down that rate or makes it delusional they are kidding themselves or deceptive in some way   in any case it 's setting off my too good to be true alarm at full volume along with the shark attack alarm as well i would strongly suspect the advisor is advising the product that makes the most money for him not what is in your mother 's best interest   a fixed annuity is an insurance product not a security because the insurance company must credit the annuity holder ’s account with the specified interest rate for the contractually stipulated time period regardless of market fluctuations in actual interest rates it is the insurance company that bears the investment risk which it does by investing the annuity holder ’s purchase proceeds in fixed income instruments that the company hopes will provide sufficient return to fulfill its contractual representations to the holder   this is why there is no prospectus it 's not a security they are not required to provide one by sec because the risk is entirely with the company obviously as pointed out in the comments the company could easily go out of business especially of they sell a lot of these and ca n't find a way to get that kind of return on the invested money   now ask yourself if i was the insurance company would i be comfortable guaranteeing that level of return over that much time if i intend to make a profit from it pay sales and stay in business    in terms of will they stay in business i 'd have a hard look at their ratings and go compare where that is on the total range for am best they are lowest secure rating next thing down is in the vulnerable category and standard and poors 4 places down from their best rating next thing down is marginal followed by poor    you might also want to see if you can get any idea of historical ratings is this company 's ratings falling or rising    personally for the amount of money involved i 'd want a company with much higher ratings than these guys   then maybe someone could say no risk but with those ratings   an no i do n't think so btw i 'd check over what this um sorry that 's not fair to clowns is recommending she do with her own funds as well   for example is he recommending she take something that is already tax sheltered such as an ira and investing the stuff inside that in an annuity kind of pointless to double shelter the money or lock it up for a period of time when she may be required to make withdrawals make sure you do n't see something there that is actually against what is in her best interest and is only done to make him a comission

individual product prices do not necessarily rise at inflation rates   what inflation means is that the purchasing power of one unit of currency decreases by x% in a year which is typically measured by looking at a broad spectrum of products in an economy and to all products   so for all products across an economy the aggregate price of all goods will on average be x% higher that they were this time last year   some products will be cheaper some will be more expensive but on average their prices will rise with inflation rates for the other part of your question inflation is an annualized percentage so an inflation rate of 12 means prices are 12 higher than they were a year ago so if you extrapolate that linear trend prices will rise again on average 1 in a month

here is one other consideration do n't do n't do n't sell based on insider information insider trading can land you in jail and it 's not restricted to top executives even a discussion about the current status of the acquisition talks can mean that you have insider information that you legally can not act on in many jurisdictions if you are just a regular employee the sec will likely not subject your dealings to special scrutiny especially since lots of your colleagues will likely trade your company 's shares at this point in time and if you definitely hold insider info for example if you are intimately involved with the acquisition talks you will likely have had a very serious warning about insider trading and know what you can and what you can not do nevertheless it 's better to be careful here

there are people well companies who make money doing roughly what you describe but not exactly they 're called market makers their value for x% is somewhere on the scale of 1 that is to say a scale at which almost everything is volatile but they use leverage shorting and hedging to complicate things to the point where it 's nothing like a simple as making a 1 profit every time they trade their actions tend to reduce volatility and increase liquidity the reason you ca n't do this is that you do n't have enough capital to do what market makers do and you do n't receive any advantages that the exchange might offer to official market makers in return for them contracting to always make both buy bids and sell offers at different prices hence the bid offer spread they have to be able to cover large short term losses on individual stocks but when the stock does n't move too much they do make profits from the spread the reason you ca n't just buy a lot of volatile stocks assuming i do n't make too many poor choices is that the reason the stocks are volatile is that nobody knows which ones are the good choices and which ones are the poor choices so if you buy volatile stocks then you will buy a bunch of losers so what 's your strategy for ensuring there are n't too many supposing that you 're going to hold 10 stocks with 10 of your money in each what do you do the first time all 10 of them fall the day after you bought them or maybe not all 10 but suppose 75 of your holdings give no impression that they 're going to hit your target any time soon do you just sit tight and stop trading until one of them hits your x% target in which case you start to look a little bit more like a long term investor after all or are you tempted to change your strategy as the months and years roll by if you will eventually sell things at a loss to make cash available for new trades then you can not assess your strategy as if you always make an x% gain since that is n't true if you do n't ever sell at a loss then you 'll inevitably sometimes have no cash to trade with through picking losers the big practical question then is when that state of affairs persists for how long and whether it 's in force when you want to spend the money on something other than investing so sure if you used a short term time machine to know in advance which volatile stocks are the good ones today then it would be more profitable to day trade those than it would be to invest for the long term investing on the assumption that you 'll only pick short term winners is basically the same as assuming you have that time machine there are various strategies for analysing the market and trying to find ways to more modestly do what market makers do which is to take profit from the inherent volatility of the market the simple strategy you describe is n't complete and can not be assessed since you do n't say how to decide what to buy but the selling strategy sell as soon as i 've made x% but not otherwise can certainly be improved if you 're keen you can test a give strategy for yourself using historical share price data or current share price data run an imaginary account and see how you 're doing in 12 months when using historical data you have to be realistic about how you 'd choose what stocks to buy each day or else you 're just cheating at when using current data you have to beware that there might not be a major market slump in the next 12 months in which case you wo n't know how your strategy performs under conditions that it inevitably will meet eventually if you run it for real you also have to be sure in either case to factor in the transaction costs you 'd be paying and the fact that you 're buying at the offer price and selling at the bid price you ca n't trade at the headline mid market price finally you have to consider that to do pure technical analysis as an individual you are in effect competing against a bank that 's on top of the exchange to get fastest possible access to trade it has a and a team of kids and it 's trying to find and extract the same opportunities you are this is not to say the ca n't do well but there are systematic reasons not to just assume you will so folks investing for their retirement generally prefer a low risk strategy that plays the averages and settles for taking long term trends

the equity balance is your assets stuff you own minus your liabilities debts you owe to others it represents your net worth how much money you would have when you would pay all your debts when you want anything to show up in equity you need to make use of the asset and liability sheets as long as you only manage income and expenses your equity wo n't change when you want to save money so the saved up money appears as an asset and thus your equity book it as an expense to your cash or bank asset account for more information check chapter 3 of the gnucash manual

i highly doubt this was a mistake in the event of a corporate merger buyout changes to employee 401(k plans are usually hashed out as part of the agreement the choices made in the agreement depend on numerous factors so it may be difficult to predict what happens to your plan in situations like this a quick online search reveals a few articles e.g. this one from that list the three most common consequences for retirement plans it sounds like the company that purchased your employer agreed to immediately vest employees in employer 401(k contributions as part of the purchase agreement without knowing the details of the merger buyout i ca n't say this for sure but this sounds like a plausible way to keep employees of the purchased company content   rather than roll it over does it make sense to wait for that company to be purchased in the hopes that a similar mistake occurs since this does n't sound like a mistake but rather a part of the buyout agreement i do n't think it 's something you should count on in the future it may be very likely or it could be a relatively rare occurrence that happened to be part of this purchase agreement i do n't believe the employee retirement income security act regulates what can or ca n't be done to your 401(k in a buyout except that the company is required to inform you of any changes and obviously the new 401(k plan must conform to erisa as well

personally i would hold off on buying a house until you have the credit card paid down even more or paid off completely so that it is one less bill you have to worry about and once it is paid off you free up that much more money to maintain the home likewise you also have a lot of variables right now and the resolution of those variables will affect how much you can afford in the way of a home the less surprises the better as i 'm sure you know being a home owner can be quite expensive and if something ends to be repaired then you have to pay for it out of your own pocket at least when you are renting that falls onto someone else likewise unless you are confident that the market has bottomed out by you you might find that you are underwater on the mortgage once everything is said and done if you want to start making process towards buying a home though you could check to see if any of the local banks or credit unions have some sort of savings program where you get higher interest rates in exchange for designating the savings for the down payment on a mortgage likewise you could just find a high yield savings account and start making automatic transfers into it every month

here are the top in my recent experience in highest first order child care by far the biggest potential cost is childcare whether this be a full time nursery child minder live in nanny au pair or just paying a baby sitter when parents need a night off this needs careful thought in london full time nursery school 6 months to 4 years old varies from 500 to 2000 per month and the amount you pay does not guarantee the quality of the care education if you have relatives nearby these costs can likely be reduced but you 'd really need to pay the relatives somehow meals bling holidays a new bathroom etc loss of earnings whether the mother goes on maternity leave or the father gives up his job to be a house husband the family income is going to be affected for a period of time you can plan for this by researching what government or company benefits the mother or father will get and for how long i suggest dividing this amount evenly across the whole period that the stay at home parent will be off rather than trying to calculate 2 months full pay 2 months half pay 2 month 's no pay because if you get into a pattern of high spending in the first two months what will happen for the next 4 months you also need to consider short notice time off work when anybody is poorly i suggest reserving some of your vacation time for unexpectedly have to look after the family time when children start daycare nursery the cross so you get some really nasty strains of and flu in the house which could cause the primary to be unable to do their caring without your help bigger car if you ca n't get a baby seat into your car because it does n't have the proper fittings or does n't have rear seats you 'll likely need to change your car there are plenty of cars that are bigger in terms of people space without being more expensive but it 'll cost to change insurances if you have health insurance e.g. us you 're going to have a proportional increase call your provider for details bear in mind that children have more illnesses and accidents than middle age parents so it could be a shock some parents take out life insurance to provide for their childrens financial future in case of the worst happening this can be around 50 usd per month but it all depends on the lump sum you 're insuring for equipment as a new parent you think you need an incredible amount of equipment such as changing station cot basket carry chair car seat travel cot feeding chair changing mat baby bath etc when you bring a new baby home you really only need a wipe clean changing mat and somewhere safe for baby to sleep you can buy anything else as you need it in fact it gives you more perspective to go shopping once you 've had the baby whatever you buy keep the receipt and do n't open it until you need it much easier to take back the e.g. portable baby bottle warmer if you did n't open it because baby is breast fed when they become bigger 2 months plus you 'll need a cot invest in an adjustable cot bed it 's a bit larger than a regular cot and the floor lowers as they get bigger so you only need one for the first 2.5 to 3 years food if baby will have formula there are baby milk formula calculators on the web in summary one box of quality formula is usd and this lasts around 4 days if fully formula fed once they 're onto food you need to factor in baby food options you can either make your own by side lining some of the adult meal and it then putting it into individual plastic containers this takes effort so not everyone has the energy alternatively you 're going to have to buy baby food in jars packets or boxes for 3 meals a day and there 'll be little snacks in between baby snacks are strangely expensive so recommend fruit budget for 5 usd per day until they 're eating a small portion of the family meal clothes a new baby really only needs vests all in one suits for warmth you can go mad buying cute outfits but they get limited use as a new baby grows really quickly if you 've a lot of family friends and you have a tradition of some kind of good luck party baby shower then you can find that you end up being given lots of things if you do n't know the sex of the baby ask people to get you a gift receipt if possible such that you do n't get blue clothes for a girl it may not bother you but its a pain when people say is a strange name for a boy just because your little girl has blue child your home this really does not have to cost a lot some people go mad putting soft corners on all the hard edges covering the electrical and generally the whole home it 's up to you but if there 's a room full of sharp poisonous things like a kitchen or utility room you might want to put a 15 usd baby gate on that room putting the or sharp things up high or stored away in the attic is a sensible move too

as said the way to make money is to be there when large amounts of money are changing hands and take a little for yourself they 'll never notice that 's what transaction costs are when a fund buys or sells stocks a bit of the money goes to the folks who handle the transaction when you personally buy or sell stocks a bit of the money goes to the broker in the form of a fee and no no fee brokers do n't work for free they just hide the fee by not getting you the best possible price so frequent transactions i.e. higher portfolio turnover mean that those little bits of money are going to the intermediaries more often that 's what higher transaction costs refers to the costs are higher than in a fund that buys and sells less often in short those higher transaction costs are a consequence of higher turnover nothing nefarious there

i would n't like to say either way what you should do not being an financial advisor or lawyer but i did find an interesting article on walk away from your mortgage   that you might also find helpful to frame your decision it has some interesting information on defaults it says this mortgage holders do sign a promissory note which is a promise to pay but the contract explicitly details the penalty for nonpayment surrender of the property the borrower is n’t escaping the consequences he is suffering them in some states lenders also have recourse to the assets like their car and savings accounts a study by the federal reserve bank of richmond found that defaults are lower in such states apparently because lenders threaten the borrowers with judgments against their assets but actual lawsuits are rare and given that nearly a quarter of mortgages are underwater and that 10 percent of mortgages are delinquent white of the university of arizona is surprised that more people have n’t walked he thinks the desire to avoid shame is a factor as are overblown fears of harm to credit ratings probably homeowners also labor under a delusion that their homes will quickly return to value white has argued that the government should stop default scare stories and indeed should encourage borrowers to default when it ’s in their economic interest this would correct a prevailing imbalance homeowners operate under a powerful moral constraint while lenders are trying to maximize profits more important it might get the system if lenders feared an avalanche of strategic defaults they would have an incentive to renegotiate loan terms in theory this could produce a wave of loan modifications the very goal the treasury has been pursuing to end the crisis

it is true that all else being equal you will pay a lower amount of total interest by paying down your highest interest rate debts first   however all else is not always equal   i 'm going to try to come up with some reasons why it might be better in some circumstances to pay your debts in a different order   and i 'll try to use as much math as possible   let 's say that your goal is to eliminate all of your debt as fast as possible   the faster you do this the lower the total interest that you will pay   now let 's consider the different methods that you could take to get there you could pay the highest interest first you could pay the lowest interest first or you could pay something in the middle first   no matter which path you choose the quicker you pay everything off the lower total interest you will pay   in addition to that the quicker you pay everything off the difference in total interest paid between the most optimal method and the least optimal method will be less   to put this in mathematical notation = 0 given that anything we can do to speed up the time it takes to get to debt free is to our advantage when paying large amounts of debt as fast as possible sacrifice is needed   and this means that psychology comes into play   i do n't know about you but for me the system makes everything easier   after all is what gets us to write answers here on se one way to do this is to eliminate individual debts as quickly as possible   for example let 's say that i 've got 10 debts   5 of them are for $ 1k each   3 of them are for $ 5k each 1 is a $ 20k car loan and 1 is a $ 100k mortgage   each one has a monthly payment let 's say that i 've got $ 3k sitting in the bank that i want to use to my debt reduction   i could pay all $ 3k toward one of my larger loans or i could immediately pay off 3 of my 10 loans   ignore interest for the moment and let 's say that we are going to pay off the smallest loans first   when i eliminate these three loans three of my monthly payments are also gone   now let 's say that with the money i was paying toward these eliminated debts and some other money i was able to scrape together $ 500 a month that i want to use toward debt reduction   in four months i 've eliminated the last two $ 1k debts and i 'm down to 5 debts instead of 10   achievement unlocked instead of this strategy i could have paid toward my largest interest rate   let 's say that was one of the $ 5k loans   i paid the $ 3k toward the bank to it and because i still had all the monthly payments after that i was only able to scrape together $ 400 a month extra toward debt reduction   in four months i still have 10 debts now let 's say that after these four months i have a bad month and some unexpected expenses come up   if i 've eliminated 5 of my debts my monthly payments are less and i 'll have an easier month then i would have had if i still had 10 monthly payments to deal with each time i eliminate a debt the amount extra i have each month to tackle the remaining debts gets bigger   and if your goal is eliminating debt quickly these early wins can really help motivate you on   it really feels like you are getting somewhere when your monthly bills go down   it also helps you with the debt free mindset   you start to see a future where you are n't sending payments to the banks each month   this method of paying your smaller debts first has been popularized in recent years by dave ramsey and he calls it the debt snowball method there might be other reasons why you would pick one debt over another to pay first   for example let 's say that one of your loans is with a bank that has terrible customer service   they do n't send you bills on time they process your payment late their website stinks they are a constant source of stress and you are getting sick of them   that would be a great reason to pay that debt first and never set foot in that bank again in conclusion if you have a constant amount of extra cash each month that you are going to use to reduce your debt and this will never change then yes you will save money over the long run by paying the highest interest debt first   however if you are trying to eliminate your debt as fast as possible and you are sacrificing in your budget sending every extra penny you can scrape together toward debt reduction the snowball method of knocking out the small debts first can help motivate you to continue to sacrifice toward your goal and can also ease the cash flow situation in difficult months when you find yourself with less extra to send in

for some studies on why investors make the decisions they do check out   for a more readable though less rigorous look at it also consider kahneman 's recent book thinking fast and slow which includes the two companion papers written with on prospect theory in certain segments mostly trading of the investing industry it is true that something like 90 of investors lose money but only in certain narrow segments and most folks would rightly want traders to be counted as a separate beast than an investor   in most segments it 's not true that most investors lose money but it still is true that most investors exhibit consistent biases that allow for mispricing i think that understanding the and biases approach to economics is critical both because it helps you understand why there are inefficiencies and also because it helps you understand that quantitative investing is not voodoo black magic it 's simply applying mathematics for the part and experimental observations for the descriptive part to yield a business strategy much like any other way of making money

short answer absolutely not unless you 're comfortable with putting years of your labor into a depreciating asset that will incur hefty maintenance costs over its remaining life i.e. consider your 10 k gone forever once you buy the car and then some some comments on your reasons keeping up with spoiled brats is a losing proposition and is a mindset counterproductive to financial independence i 'd encourage you to find a way to not care about how the spoiled brats live their lives it wo n't be easier when you 're older and you see your peers driving fancy cars and living fantasy lifestyles that you are tempted to emulate break the impulse to keep up and you 'll be in a much better place a used bmw may not be a piece of junk at first but once you hit 100 k miles everything will suddenly fall apart and need repair been there myself still have the car after 7 years only because very few people want to buy a high mileage german sport sedan with recurring maintenance issues see 2 it will be a good drive for a while then it will own you this is not so bad when you have a decent amount of savings but when you have nothing it 's very hard to truly enjoy the car while knowing that any problems not covered by warranty will be financially devastating are you prepared to ride the bus for 4 weeks while saving enough income from work to replace a bad clutch i had to do this and it 's not something i brag about

is there more on where dalio gets his definitions for the short term debt cycle 5 8 years or so and deleveraging and the long term debt cycle 75 100 years or his evidence that separates the two   at one point he says the difference is that in a deleveraging interest rates hit 0 and can no longer go lower but i do n't know if that works as a definition per se   there are other things that central banks do when interest rates hit 0 like buy up assets which he does mention and include in the print money category of things that can be done during a deleveraging   and one of the he cites england in the 1950s according to wikipedia was due to difficulty in transitioning out from war production and according to this excel statistics documents rates from the bank of england on historical rates it does n't say interest rates went to 0 at that time unless dalio is referring to another point in history when he cites 1950s england     his definition of a depression is when debt restructuring or defaults happen   interesting   what i learned was that there is n't really a hard and fast definition for recessions and depressions e.g. a recession is two quarters of negative growth in a row and a depression is just a bad long recession   and i do n't think i recall in the past an attempt to define what a deleveraging event of an economy is     is debt reduction and redistribution of wealth deflationary   i think it depends on how much the debt reduction or redistribution hurts the spending of the lender or wealthy versus how much it helps the spending of the borrower or the poor   both are actually similarly giving some from the haves to the have nots and especially redistribution of wealth is similar to fiscal spending which is mentioned as a valid inflationary way to try to help the economy   are deflationary methods say austerity needed to balance out the inflationary methods central bank buying assets and fiscal spending   are n't central bank interest rates quantitative easing and the government fiscal policy still the main things that move inflation or deflation   i would think that debt reduction and redistribution of wealth are good when needed but i would n't think you would do those things mainly for their supposed see above for my doubts deflationary effects     still a very interesting video and one of the best presented videos on a difficult subject

let me give you some advice from someone who has experience at both ends had student loan issues myself and parents ran financial aid department at local university quick story of my student loan   i graduated in debt and could not pay at first due to having kids way too early   i deferred   schools will have rules for   there are also federal guidelines lets not get specific on this though since these change every year it seems    so basically there is an initial deferment period in which any student can request for the repayments to be deferred and it is granted   then there is an extended deferment   here someone has to ok it   this is really rather arbitrary and up to the school lender   my school decided to not extend mine after i filled out a of paperwork and showed that even without paying i had basically $ 200 a month for the family to live off past housing fixed expenses eventually they had to cave because i had no money so they gave me an extended deferment   after the 5 years i started paying   since my school had a very complex way to pay i decided to give them 6 months at a time   you would think they would love that right   on the check it was clearly stated what months i was paying for to show that i was not prepaying the loan off well i was in collections 4 months later   their billing messed up set me up for prepayment   they then played dumb and acted like i did n't but i had a picture of the check and their bank 's stamp on the back they could n't get my loan out of collections even though they messed up   this is probably some lower level employee trying to cover their mistake   so this office tells creditors to leave me alone but i also cannot pay my loan because the credit collection agency has slapped a 5k fee on the 7k loan   so my loan spent 5 years kid you not like this   it was interest free since the employee stopped the loan processing point being is that if you do n't pay the lender will either put your loan into deferment automatically or go after you   most not all schools will opt for deferment which i believe is 2 years at most places   then after that you have the optional deferment   so if you keep not paying they might throw you into that bucket    however if you stop paying and you never communicate with them the chances of you getting the optional deferment are almost none unless school does n't know where you live   basically if you do n't respond to their mail emails you get swept into their credit collection process   so just filling out the deferment stuff when you get it even if they deny it could buy you up to 10 years kid you not    now once you go into the collection process anything is game   as long as you do n't need a home car loan you can play this game   what the collection agency does depends on size of loan and the rules   if you are at a major university the rules are usually more lax but if you are at the smaller schools especially the advertised trade online schools boom better watch out   wages will be garnished very soon   expect to go to court might have to hire an attorney because some corrupt lenders start on fees think of the 5k mine on me    so the moral of the story is you will pay it off   if you act nice fill out paperwork talk to school and so on you can probably push this off quite a few years   but you are still paying and you will pay interest on everything   so factor in that to the equation   i had a 2.3 loan but they are much higher now    defaulting is n't always a bad thing   if you do n't have the money then you do n't have it   and using credit cards to help is not the thing to do   but you need to try to work with the school so you do n't incur penalties fees and so that your job does n't have creditors calling them    my story ended year 4 that my loan was in collection   a higher up was reviewing my case and called me   told her the story and emailed her a picture of their cashed check   she was completely embarrassed when she was trying to work out a plan for me and i am like how about i come down tomorrow with the 7k   but even though lender admitted fault this took 20 + calls to agencies to clear up my credit so i could buy a house    so your goal should be

your question is a bit odd in that you are mixing long term fundamental analysis signals which are generally meant to work on longer time frames with medium term trading where these fundamental signals are mostly irrelevant   generally you would buy and hold on a fundamental signal and ride the short term fluctuations if you believe you have done good analysis if you would like to trade on the 2 6 month time scale you would need a signal that works on that sort of time scale   some people believe that technical analysis can give you those kind of signals but there are many many many different technical signals and how you would trade using them is highly dependent on which one you believe works some people do mix fundamental and technical signals but that can be very complicated   learning a good amount about technical analysis could get you started   i will note though that studies of non professionals continuously show that the more frequently people trade the more on they underperform on average in the long term when compared with people that buy and hold an aside on technical analysis michael 's comment is generally correct though not well explained   say bob found a technical signal that works and he believes that a stock that costs $ 10 dollars should be $ 11   he buys it and makes money two months later when the rest of the market figures out the right price is $ 11 and he sells at that price   this works a bunch of times and he now publishes how the signal works on stack exchange to show everyone how awesome he is   next time bob 's signal finds a different stock at $ 10 that should be $ 11 but anna just wrote a computer program that checks that signal bob published faster than he ever could   the computer program buys as much as it can in milliseconds until the price is $ 11   bob goes to buy but now it is too late the price is already $ 11 and he ca n't make any money eventually people learn to anticipate adjust for this signal and even anna 's algorithms do n't even work anymore and the hunt for new signals starts again

joetaxpayer nailed it   here 's another way to look at it generally we invest in something then might leave it there for a few years then take it out but do n't touch it in between   in that case to get the final amount we need to take the initial amount then multiply by growth in the first year then multiply by growth in the second year etc so for three years we have = = average annual growth ^ 3 so here we see that we want the average annual growth to the power three equal to the product of the annual growth rates thus geometric mean geometric mean = ^ 1/3 on the other hand consider a situation where i have three investments x y z over one year now i have after one year = + + = average annual growth now in this case if we assume = = = 1 i.e. i put equal amounts in each we see that the average annual growth rate we want in this case is the arithmetic mean arithmetic mean = + + 3 if we had unequal amounts at the beginning it would be a weighted average tl;dr

it depends on how you place your stop order and the type of stop orders available from your broker if you place a stop market order and the following day the stock opens below your stop your stock will be stopped out at or around the opening price meaning you can potentially end up with quite a large gap if you place a stop limit order say you place your stop at $ 10.00 with a limit price of $ 9.90 and if the price opens below $ 9.90 say at $ 9.50 your limit sell order of $ 9.90 will be placed onto the market but it will not be executed until the price goes back up to $ 9.90 or above the third option is to place a guaranteed stop loss and as specified you are guaranteed your stop price even if the price gaps down below your stop price you will be paying an extra fee for the guaranteed stop loss order and they are usually mainly available with cfd brokers so if you are in the usa you might be out of luck

to me the lower tax rate for capital gains is largely due to governments encouraging economic activity note that investments usually come from your normal income which is already taxed capital gains tax is essentially punishing people who take the extra effort to put their money into work if the tax rate is high it would definitely cause people to rethink about investing thus slowing the general economy down

unless your brokerage will sell you fractional shares the most obvious difference without us knowing the actual identify of the companies is that with the $ 260 one you will have 3 shares plus you will have $ 220 minus commission left over that you wanted to invest but were n't able to simply because of the mechanics of long division you could put that $ 220 into one of the cheaper stocks but now the multiple commissions will start to eat your returns my personal opinion is you should go for a low cost index mutual fund or etf and wait to pick individual stocks until you have more than $ 1000 to work with and even then probably still go with the low cost index fund

an order is your command to the broker to say sell 100 shares of aapl an executed order or partially executed order is when all or some of that command is successfully completed a transaction is an actual exchange of shares for money and there may be one or more transactions per executed order   for example the broker might perform all of the following 5 transactions in order to do what you asked on the other hand if the broker can not execute your order then 0 transactions have taken place the fee schedule you quote is saying that no matter how many transactions the broker has to perform in order to fill your order and no matter what the share prices are they 're only going to charge you $ 0.005 per share $ 0.50 in this example of 100 shares subject to certain limits however as it says at the top of the page you linked our fixed pricing for stocks etfs exchange traded products or and warrants charges a fixed amount per share or a set percent of trade value and includes all ib commissions exchange and most regulatory fees with the exception of the transaction fees which are passed through on all stock sales certain transaction fees are passed through to the client   the transaction fee you included above is the sec fee on sales   many but not all transaction fees do depend on the prices of the shares involved as a result they can not be called fixed fees for example if you sell 100 shares of aapl at $ 150 each but if you sell 100 shares of amzn at $ each so the broker will charge you the same $ 0.50 on either of those orders but the sec will charge you more for the expensive amzn shares than for the cheaper aapl shares the reason this specific sec fee mentions aggregate sales rather than trade value is because this particular sec fee applies only to the seller and not to the buyer   so they could have written aggregate trade value but they probably wanted to highlight to the reader that the fee is only charged on sells

this is very much possible and happens quite a lot in the us for example promotional offers by credit card companies where you pay no interest on the balance for a certain period are a very common thing the lender gains a new customer on such a loan and usually earns money from the spending via the merchant fees specifically for credit cards at least the pro is obviously free money the con is that this is usually for a short period of time longest i 've seen was 15 months after which if you 're not careful high interest rates will be charged in some cases interest will be charged retroactively for the whole period if you do n't pay off the balance or miss the minimum payment due

my take on this is that this reduces your liquidity risk stocks bonds and many other investment vehicles on secondary markets you may think of are highly liquid but they still require that markets are open and then an additional 3 5 business days to settle the transaction and for funds to make their way to your bank account   if you require funds immediately because of an emergency this 3 5 business days which gets longer as week ends and holidays are in the way can cause a lot of discomfort which may be worth a small loss in potential roi   think of your car breaking down or a water pipe exploding in your home and having to wait for the stock sale to process before you can make the payment admittedly you have other options such as margin loans and credit cards that can help absorb the shock in such cases but they may not be sufficient or cause you to pay interest or fees if left unpaid

i see a lot of answers with incomes that are much higher than yours here is something for your situation if you would keep your current income for the rest of your life here is approximately how things would turn out after 40 years all interest is calculated relative to the amount in your portfolio therefore lets start with 1 dollar for 40 years with your current income 15 would be dollar at 12 this would over 40 years get you almost 1 million dollar i would call a required return of more than 12 not likely the good news is that your income will likely increase and especially if this happens fast things will start to look up   the bad news is that your current salary is quite low so it basically means that you need to make some big jumps in the next few years in order to make this scenario likely if you can quickly move your salary towards ranges that are more common in the us then 15 of your income can build up to a million before you retire however if you just follow gradual growth you would need to get quite lucky to reach a million   note that even if reaching a million appears unlikely it is probably still a good idea to save

your analysis is wrong for a few reasons one the consolidated margins of nflx are being weighed on by international expansion us ebit margins were 24 in 2016 and even that is an underestimating of steady state margin profile because nflx runs a subscription model where is paid up front us marketing was 7 of us streaming revenue in 2016 so in a mature sub replacement growth profile you could easily see that coming down to 4 5 accretion that delta to the us ebit margin leaving you around 26 27 margins state international margins should be higher because in local markets netflix only wants to have 20 of the content library be local with the remainder leveraged from the us library    have n't read the bernstein report but i think you misunderstood it the point was that the analyst calculated net customer ltv and valued the company based on that times his sub estimate the value additive part of the note is the ltv calc which i have n't seen but i imagine is probably based on the above margin analysis and some churn assumptions

vanguard and probably other mutual fund brokers as well offers easy to read performance charts that show the total change in value of a $ 10 k investment over time   this includes the fair market value of the fund plus any distributions i.e. dividends paid out   on vanguard 's site they also make a point to show the impact of fees in the chart since their low fees are their big selling point some reasons why a dividend is preferable to selling shares no loss of voting power no transaction costs dividends may have better tax consequences for you than capital gains note   if your fund is underperforming the benchmark it is not due to the payment of dividends   funds do not pay their own dividends they only forward to shareholders the dividends paid out by the companies in which they invest   so the fair market value of the fund should always reflect the fair market value of the companies it holds and those companies shares are the ones that are fluctuating when they pay dividends if your fund is underperforming its benchmark then that is either because it is not tracking the benchmark closely enough or because it is charging high fees   the fact that the you 're seeing appears to be in the amount of dividends paid is a coincidence check out this example vanguard performance chart for an s&p500 index fund   notice how if you add the s&p500 index benchmark to the plot you ca n't even see the difference between the two the fund is designed to track the benchmark exactly   so when ibm or whoever pays out a dividend the index goes down in value and the fund goes down in value

well depends but on average the stock market has historically returned somewhere around 10 per year   note this can vary wildly from year to year see so it would be roughly 2.8 years to get your 30 if you happen to get the average market return for those 3 years but the chances of that happening exactly are slim to none   you could end up with + 50 or -30 over that ~3 year period of time so the calculation does n't do you that much good for that short period of time but if you are talking a span of 30 years then you could plan using that as a very rough ballpark good rule of thumb is you should n't put any money in the stock market you think you will need anytime in the next 5 years formula to figure out total gain would be   principal x 1 + rate of return ^ years

there are many considerations before deciding on the best place for your funds how liquid do you need the funds to be    if this is for an emergency fund i would keep at least some in an account that you have instant access to   what is your risk volatility tolerance would you be ok with the value dropping by as much as 30 in a year knowing that over time you 'll probably earn 8 12 on it   if not then equity funds or other stock investments are probably not the best move for you do you need the funds now or are they for long term retirement savings are you eligible to fund an ira that would defer your taxes until you withdraw the funds from the account but there are age restrictions that you must heed to avoid penalties are cds a good idea they do pay decent interest but in return for that you lock up your funds for a set period of time   all that to say that there are many facets to determining the best place for your funds   if you provide more specifics you can get a more specific answer

yes a diversified portfolio can generate greater returns than the s&p 500 by going outside it for instance small stocks on average generate higher returns than the large caps found in the s&p 500 so if you own a diversified portfolio of stocks some of which are smaller in market cap than the typical s&p 500 stock you have a chance to outperform you might also outperform by owning other asset classes than stocks such as gold real estate and timber among others at appropriate times you may also be able to get the relevant exposure by owning gold and timber stocks and reits this was a lesson that david of the yale endowment taught us

insider trading is any trading done on material non public information relating to an instrument   if my sister who works for a drugs testing company tells me that stage 3 trials of a drug look like they will fail and i trade on that information probably by shorting a company 's stock that is insider trading if an employee of that firm trades on that same stock knowing that the trials are likely to fail that is too if an employee of that company trades on the stock without knowing that information that is not insider trading if i know from an insider i met at the pub that a large orange producer has seen a fall in production due to a blight and i trade on oranges futures even though i am not directly trading in the stock it is still insider trading i mentioned that the information must be material that means that it must have the potential to move the market if i know that a firm is going to increase profits by 10 this year it is not material if analyst expectations are for a similar rise you are right that small scale insider trading such as by employees and their families is relatively unregulated and unchecked but directors and c level employees of a firm are required to publish all and any dealings that they have in the stock and several have been caught and penalized for insider trading edit details some cases many involving director and c level employees that the sec has prosecuted recently incidentally i work in financial fraud monitoring and we use an analytic based on previous days trades and today 's news i.e. when the information becomes public to identify traders who might either be indulging in or receiving orders to trade on insider information essentially this works by looking for large changes in position against an instrument that later has material information releases relevant to it one final thing to think about given that being caught will generally cause to go to prison and be banned from director level jobs and/or trading for life as well as a large life changing fine and a massive loss of reputation not many people with insider information want to risk trading on it myself included

to start with you are right there should n't be any additional fees other than the currency exchange fee i 'm not sure of the exact fee for natwest but for this was around 2.5 for big currencies like the euro however germany does n't actually use debit cards nearly as much as we do here in the uk so you will almost certainly need cash rather than taking this from a currency exchange booth what you should do in order to get the lowest fees is head straight to the atm of any bank and put your card in to make a cash withdrawal it will almost certainly ask if you want to use their exchange rate which it will show you and you will almost certainly be better turning this down and allowing natwest to do this for you dependent on the bank their currency exchange spread may be as high as 4.5 i hope this helps it certainly saved me a lot of money when i have been going abroad

what you 're looking for is expected value let 's say you invest $ 1000 in option a and later discover that you are going to lose 20   so the expected value of option a is $ 800 if option b has a 50 chance of losing 50 and a 50 of gaining 20 then your expected value is $ 650 $ 650 = $ 1000 50 50 + 50 20 $ 800 > $ 650 so you should stay with option a. in the real world you usually do n't know the exact odds and percentages so substitute in your best guesses   this may lead to suboptimal results but only if your estimations are wrong the formula itself is ideal

it 's easiest to get your payment from the pmt function in excel or google sheets   so a $ 100,000 30 year mortgage at 3 looks like this the basic calculation is pretty simple   you take the annual interest rate say 3 divided by 12 times the existing principal balance the idea is that borrowers would like to have a predictable payment   the earlier payments are proportionally more interest than principal than later payments are but that 's because there is much more principal outstanding on month 1 than on month 200

first are you sure that no interest accrues on the student loans until six months after you finish your studies my understanding is that you have to start paying back the student loans six months after leaving the university but that does n't mean no interest accrues in the meantime my concern about student loans is that life happens and when it happens in an unexpected way the powers of the student loan companies exceed pretty much everybody else 's with the possible exception of the irs if you are in a position to be able to pay cash for the tuition then i would cut back the lifestyle scrimp as much as i can and pay cash you 'll be in a much better position afterwards for starters you wo n't have a student loan payment which means you 're in a much better position financially than most of your peers and have a lot more options open plus you 're not carrying around a mortgage before you even bought a house

thanks for the feedback    the cost is $ 20,000 to 50,000 sqft    ya i am just looking for a rough idea of what a similar newer building is costing i figured what we are paying is really high as the building is extremely old and designated as a heritage site so we ca n't just knock it down beautiful building just not very efficient    the newer building is the route i think we are gon na end up going not sure what we can do with the current building as not too many options for resale we ca n't adjust the lease rates to compensate for the cost as the tenants are all seniors and it is an integrated care home a change to apartments would prove difficult as there are no kitchens in 90 of the suites   we are currently paying approximately $ 0.40 a month to heat all electric and the estimate for the new building is $ so it is a pretty huge impact in comparison if it is possible but i have n't heard of a real building actually costing that little before    thanks for the suggestion for the ir i think i am gon na get some one in after the holidays to do a inspection to see if there is any short term fixes we can do with our system

i 'm being realistic they 're dumping tens of millions of dollars into an operation that shows no real signs of earning any kind of profit in anything that approaches the short or medium term they 're making expensive cars at ferrari volumes for bmw prices in limited markets while the major automakers introduce more and more electric and hybrid cars once mercedes and ford and honda have full electric cars on the road serviced and backed by their huge network of dealerships what does tesla offer anyone toyota is happy they pumped a relatively small amount of money into tesla and have all but locked up rights to their ip should the company go bust   tesla is trying to capitalize on being first to market but they 're in a kind of catch 22 there is n't huge demand for electric cars right now which means they wo n't be able to sell the volumes they need to grow their business and return a profit as soon as the market is large enough for them to make a profit the big guys are going to catch up and run them over who 'd buy a model s when they could get an electric 5 series for the same money who 'd buy a tesla roadster if they could get an electric or 911

banks in general will keep saving rates as low as possible especially if there is a surplus of funds or alternative access for funding as in the case of the fed in the usa generally speaking why would bank pay you a high interest rate when they can not generate any income from your money usually we will expect to see a drop in the loan interest rate when their is a surplus of funds so as to encourage investment but if the market is volatile then no banks will allow easy access to money through loans the old traditional policy of lending money without proper security and no control from the central bank has created serious problems for savings account holders when some of these banks went into bankruptcy it is for this reason most countries has modified their financial act to offer more protection to account holders at the moment banks must follow rigid guidelines before a loan can be approved to a customer in my country we have seen the collapse of a few banks which sent a shock wave across the county for those that have savings held at those bank we have also seen unsecured loans having to be written off thus putting serious pressure of those banks so government stepped in a few years ago and amended the act to make it mandatory to have commercial banks follow certain strict guidelines before approving a loan

some other answers mention the ability to sell at grant this is very important if you have that ability think about your guaranteed return in my case i get a 15 discount on the lowest 6 month window price from the last two years   if you do the math the worst case return can be calculated 1 money that from the beginning of the window i make 15 for 6 months 30 annual return guaranteed 2 money at the end of the window say the last month is 15 for one month 180 annual return guaranteed in the end your average holding window for your money is about 3 months you can calculate it exactly at that rate you have a guaranteed 60 annual return you ca n't beat that anywhere with a significant upside if your company stock is increasing so if your company has an instant sell at grant option you have to be brain dead not to do it if it takes time to get your shares then you need to look at the volatility of the stock to see how big the chance of losing money is to generalize to a formula if that 's what you want = purchase window in months d = discount percentage = guaranteed return = d = one last thing if you are going to participate in espp make you that you understand how to do your taxes yourself i have n't found a tax person yet who does espp correctly including an ex irs agent so i always have to do my taxes myself to make sure they get done correctly

from the card issuer 's point of view the purpose of balance transfers is very simple a credit card company wants you to owe them more money so they will make more profit getting more interest payments from you to do that they will offer an apparently good deal to transfer the debt that you owe to other companies onto their card the deal may look good to you because it offers a low interest rate for a limited time period etc but never forget that its real purpose is to be a good deal for the card company not for you of course credit card companies target these deals at their typical customers they have to tolerate a few smart customers who actually make them no money at all by always paying off their card balance before any interest is due never using their card to draw cash from an atm which has no interest free loan period never using their card for overseas transactions that incur fees and/or poor currency exchange rates etc   your financial objective should be to make yourself one of the customers the card company does n't want but only paying off the minimum balance every month is exactly the wrong way to do that

you lease one if you are going to get an economy car if you do n't drive too much < 15 k year and you want to hang on to the car for a long time   otherwise if you are a regular driver driving a leased new quality car can be cost effective many cars now have bumper to bumper warranties that last as long as the lease say 80 k so there is rarely any extra costs apart from regular maintenance the sweet spot for most new cars is in the 5th 6th or 7th years after they are paid off but at that point you may find you have maintenance bills that are approaching an average of $ 200 $ 300 per month in which case a lease starts to look pretty good i owned a 7 year old honda accord that cost only $ 80 less per month in maintenance than the new leased vw that replaced it   have n't looked back after that into my 3rd car and 9th year of leasing

i think the primary reason it is so pricey now is that it is an inflation hedge and considering how shaky the economies and out of control the spending is in many countries right now people are running to it as a safe harbor the increased demand raises the price as it does with any asset   this brings us to the question why does gold have value the same reason anything has value there is someone out there who wants it enough to trade something else of value to get it   it is in the news so much because it is so high right now which unfortunately is going to cause a lot of people to foolishly invest in it at likely the worst possible time

for bonds bought at par the face value of the bond like buying a cd for $ 1000 the payment it makes is the same as yield you pay $ 1000 and get say $ 40 per year or 4 if you buy it for more or less than that $ 1000 say $ 900 there 's some math not for me i use a finance calculator to tell you your return taking the growth to maturity into account i.e. the extra $ 100 you get when you get the full $ 1000 back obviously for bonds you care about whether the or municipality will pay you back at all and then you care about how much you 'll make when then do in that order for stocks the picture is different as some companies give no dividend but reinvest all profits think berkshire hathaway on the other hand many people believe that the dividend is important and choose to buy stocks that start with a nice yield a $ 30 stock with a $ dividend is 3.3 yield sounds like not much but over time you expect the company to grow increase in value and increase its dividend 10 years hence you may have a $ 40 stock and the dividend has risen to $ 1.33 now it 's 4.4 of the original investment and you sit on that gain as well

if i understand your question you 're misunderstanding the buy sell spread and at least in this instance seem to be in an unfortunate situation where the spread is quite large the polish zloty gbp ideal exchange rate is around   thus when actually exchanging currency you should expect to pay a bit more than zloty to get one pound sterling and you should expect to get a bit less than zloty in exchange for one pound sterling   that 's because you 're giving the bank its cut both for operations and so that it has a reason to hold onto some zloty that it ca n't lend out   it sounds like barclay 's has a large spread buy sell   i would guess british banks do n't need all that many zloty so you have a higher spread than you would for usd or eur other currency exchange companies or banks particularly those who are in the primary business of converting money may have a smaller spread and be more willing to do it for you   also it looks like the polish banks are willing to do it at a better rate certainly they 're giving you more zloty for one pound sterling so it seems likely the other way would be better as well though since they 're a polish bank it 's certainly easier for them to give you zloty so this may be less true   barclay 's is certainly giving you a better deal on pounds for a zloty than they are zloty for a pound in terms of how far off their spread is from the ideal

you do n't have to retire but the us government and other national governments have programs that allow you to set aside money when you are young to be used when you are older   to encourage you to do this they reduce your taxes either now or when your are older they also allow your employer to match your funds in the us they have iras 401ks and social security   you are not required to stop working while tapping into these funds having a job and using these funds will impact your taxes but your are not forbidden from doing both decades ago most retirement funds come from pensions and social security most people are going to reach their senior years without a pension or with only a very small pension because they had one in one of their early jobs so go ahead gamble that you will not need to save for retirement then hope that decades later you were right about it because you ca n't go back in time and fix your choice   some never save for retirement either because they ca n't or they think they ca n't many that do n't save end up working longer than they imagined some work everyday until they die or are physically unable to work sometimes it is because they love the job but often it is because they can not afford to quit

in my experience financial advisors do not normally assist with budgeting and personal everyday finance there certainly are people who do that but you would normally only consult them when you have financial difficulties especially debt the more common find of financial advisor is mostly focussed on advising you about savings and investments a lot work for banks and investment companies they will usually advise you for free the downside being that they will only recommend their company 's products this may or may not be a bad thing depending on the company others will charge you a commission on purchases and their advice will be more neutral this question will also be interesting are all financial advisors compensated in the same way

you 're being too hard on yourself you 've managed to save quite a bit which is more than most people ever do you 're in a wonderful position actually you have savings and time you do n't mention how long you want need to continue working but i 'll assume 20 years or so you do n't have to invest it all at once like pete b says index funds just read what mr. buffett said in recent news he 'd tell his widow to invest in the s&p 500 index and not berkshire hathaway should be a decent percentage you can also pick a target fund from any of the major investment firms fees are higher than an index but it will take care of any asset allocation decisions put some in each also look at retirement accounts to take advantage of tax deferred or tax free growth but that 's another question and country specific in any case do n't even blink when the market goes down and it will go down if you 're still working earning and saving it 'll just be another opportunity to buy more at lower prices as for the house no reason you ca n't invest and save for a house invest some for the long term and set aside the rest for the house in 1 5 years if you do n't think you 'll ever really buy the house though invest the majority of it for the long term i have a feeling from the tone of your question that you tend to put off the big financial decisions so if you wo n't really buy the house just admit it to yourself now

the best answer to your question would to be what the interest rates are like in australia itself   the reserve bank sets the target cash which is the market    interest rate on overnight funds it uses this as the instrument for    monetary policy and influences the cash rate through its financial    market operations decisions regarding the cash rate target are made    by the reserve bank board and explained in a media release announcing    the decision at 2.30 pm after each board meeting prior to december    2007 media releases were issued only when the cash rate target was    changed from investopedia how rates are calculated   each central bank 's board of directors controls the monetary policy of its     country and the short term prime    interest rate that banks use to borrow from each other when the    economy is doing well interest rates are in order to curb    inflation and when times are tough cut rates to encourage lending and    inject money into the economy have a look at this from graph from i would then go to a website that allows you to compare graphically whichever interest rate you you could get the raw data and run some analysis to each his own   fyi this topic fx is incredibly complex and i hope my answer satisfies your needs otherwise talk to a quant you will need a ton of data inputs to model the entire economy of australia to try and predict what the central bank will do which is what people try and do everyday best of luck

if you mean the internal rate of return then the quarterly rate of return which would make the net present value of these cash flows to be zero is found by goal seek in excel or an equivalent compound annual rate of p.a the net present value of the cash flows is 10,000 + where r is the quarterly rate if instead you mean modified dietz return then the net gain over the period is end value start value net flow = 10,000 4,000 2,000 = the weighted average capital invested over the period is 1 x 10,000 + 2/3 x 4,000 1/3 x 2,000 = 12,000 so the modified dietz return is 12,000 = or = per quarter or an equivalent compound annual rate of = you are using an inappropriate formula because we know for a fact that the flows take place at the beginning end of the period instead you should be combining the returns for the quarters which have in fact been provided in the question to calculate this first calculate the growth factor over each quarter then   link them geometrically to get the overall growth factor subtracting 1 gives you the overall return for the period then convert the result to a quarterly rate of return growth factor in 2012 q4 is = 1.1 growth factor in 2013 q1 is = 1.05 growth factor in 2013 q2 is = 1.1 overall growth factor is 1.1 x 1.05 x 1.1 = return for the whole period is quarterly rate of return is = equivalent annual rate of return is = = = = = = = = = = i 'd recommend you to refer to wikipedia

in addition to what quid said i think your risk tolerance should depend on how likely you are to need the funds in the near future say that you have $ 100k saved up and you want to decide how to invest it then you should ask yourself the idea here is that if you invest say in stocks high risk then the value of your position could drop significantly and you 'd potentially have to wait for a long time before it recovers if you are forced to sell you could make a substantial loss if you do n't urgently need this cash however then you can feel relaxed and just wait for the market to reverse again this is viewing risk through the lens of how likely it is that you 'll have to wait a long time to get a substantial amount of your money back which itself is a function of how likely it is for a substantial downturn to occur in a certain market

is she entitled to more of the equity because she made more no   equity should be determined by how much each paid   but she is entitled to more of the equity if she paid more   and that may be what she is saying   that she contributed more to the household 's finances than you did    if you always paid the mortgage out of the joint account you could presumably go back and look at the account to find out how much each of you contributed to it   that would give you a reasonable split for the remainder of the equity after your initial investment   if you both put your entire paychecks into the joint account every time then it will be the same as the ratio of what you each made   that would also make sense for splitting up whatever remains in that account    while you 're doing that you may want to ask for more for your original $ 65,000   by my calculation if your mortgage was 3.5 that $ 65,000 saved the household more than $ 12,000 in interest that became equity instead   so you could reasonably bump your return on the initial investment up to $ while making the concession on the rest of the equity    this is just a suggestion for a framework for splitting the equity   if you can agree on a split it will almost certainly be easier than going to a mediator or court

let me start with a somewhat sarcastic statement there are probably as many things done to analyze a stock as there are people doing the analysis that said at a general level an analyst researches the historical performance of the company at a fairly detailed level operations within divisions of the company product development cycles within divisions expenses vs income trends for each division and product marketing costs customer acquisition costs etc gathers information about what the company is doing now and planning to do in the future often by a discussion with principles at the company establishes a view on related macro economic trends sector and industry trends demographic trends etc and combines it all to forecast a change in revenues margins free cash flow dividends etc over a period of time    they then apply statistics that relate those numbers to stock price in order to imply stock prices and price ranges over those same periods   finally depending on how those stock prices compare to the current stock price they 'll classify the stock as buy sell hold etc this sounds like alot of work    and it generally is if you get detailed about it which is what professionals or significant money managers are doing    however there are also lots of arm chair analysts posting their output on any number of financial sites seeking alpha motley fool etc if you 'd like to really explore the range of detail some people consider as a stock analysis   that sounds more negative than i intended it to be so let me clarify that i think some of these write ups are really quite good imo

many people assume that if the price of something is $ 10 and they have 1,000 of that thing they should expect to be able to sell them for something around $ 10,000   such an assumption may hold much of the time but it does n't always   worse the cases where it fails to hold are often those where it would be relied upon most heavily   such an assumption should thus be considered dangerous in a liquid market the quantity of a something that people would be willing to buy at something close to the market price will be large relative to the quantity that people would seek to sell in the short term   if at some moment in time one person in the market was willing to immediately buy 500 shares at $ 9.98 and another was willing to immediately buy 750 at $ someone seeking to sell 1,000 shares could immediately receive $ for them selling 500 to the first person and 500 to the second who would then be ready to buy 250 more from the first person who was willing to sell for $   such behavior would be in line with what many people 's assumptions in an illiquid market however the quantity of something that people would be willing to buy near market price could be surprisingly low   this is more often a problem in the marketplace of things like collectibles than of stocks but the same thing can happen in the stock market   if there 's one potential buyer for a stock who thinks it 's overpriced but has potential and would be worth $ 9.50 but that person only has $ 950 to spend and nobody else thinks the stock would be worth more than $ then until people sold a total of 100 shares the price would be $ 9.50 but after that the price would drop instantly to $ 0.02   there would be no of the fall   if the person with 1,000 shares was first in line he 'd get to sell 100 shares for $ 950 to the aforementioned seller but would be unable to get more than $ 18 for the remaining 900 a major danger with markets is that markets which are perceived as liquid attract people to the buying side while those which are seen as illiquid people   the danger in the latter is obvious having people flee a seemingly illiquid market will reduce its liquidity further but the former is just as bad   having people flock to a market because of its perceived liquidity will increase its liquidity but can also create a false price floor causing demand to appear much stronger than it actually is   unless real demand increases to match the false price floor the people who buy at the higher price will never be able to recoup their investment

an instant 15 profit sounds good to me so you ca n't go wrong selling as soon as you are able here are a couple other considerations tax implications when you sell the stock you have to pay taxes on the profit including that 15 discount the tax rate you pay is based on how long you wait to sell it if you wait a certain amount of time usually 2 years but it will depend on your specific tax codes before you sell you could be subject to lower tax rates on that profit see here for a more detailed description this might only apply if you 're in the us since you work for the company you may be privy to a bit more information about how the company is run and how likely it is to grow as such if you feel like the company is headed in the right direction you may want to hold on the the stock for a while   i am generally wary of being significantly invested in the company you work for if the company goes south then the stock price will obviously drop but you 'll also be at risk to be laid off as such you 're exposed much more risk than investing in other companies this is a good argument to sell the stock and take the 15 profit   i realize your question was n't really about whether to sell the stock but more for when but i felt this was relevant nonetheless

according to the book of hull american and european calls on non dividend paying stocks should have the same value american puts however should be equals to or more valuable than european puts the reason for this is the time value of money in a put you get the option to sell a stock at a given strike price if you exercise this option at t=0 you receive the strike price at t=0 and can invest it at the risk free rate lets imagine the rf rate is 10 and the strike price is this means at you would get if on the other hand you exercise the option early at you would simply receive the strike price 10 $ basically the strike price which is your payoff for a put option does n't earn interest another way to look at this is that an option is composed of two elements the insurance element and the time value of the option the insurance element is what you pay in order to have the option to buy a stock at a certain price for put options it is equals to the s 0 where k = strike price and stock price   the time value of the option can be thought of as a risk premium it 's difference between the value of the option and the insurance element if the benefits of exercising a put option early earning the risk free rate on the proceeds outweighs the time value of the put option it should be exercised early yet another way to look at this is by looking at the upper bounds of put options for a european put today 's value of the option can never be worth more than the present value of the strike price discounted at the risk free rate if this rule is n't respected there would be an arbitrage opportunity by simply investing at the risk free rate for an american put since it can be exercised at any time the maximum value it can take today is simply equals to the strike price therefore since the pv of the strike price is smaller than the strike price the american put can have a bigger value bear in mind this is for a non dividend paying stock as previously mentioned if a stock pays a dividend it might also be optimal to exercise just before these are paid

for the type of market neutrality you desire free from crash risk it 's best to hedge the shares with covered calls when implied volatility is expensive and puts when implied volatility is cheap with the nearest at the money expirations   a put only strategy can be very expensive and should only be used with the longest term options available since they can cost many tens of per year securities become almost perfectly correlated during a crash therefore market crash risk of one security is essentially equal to the market crash risk so hedging the security itself makes a position market neutral for crash risk this strategy will have intermittent opportunity cost risk in the form of slower returns during market expansion to pay for smaller losses during a crash however the expected long run return hedged this way should be greater than the underlying 's expected long run return with less volatility

dividends are normally paid in cash so do n't generally affect your portfolio aside from a slight increase to cash   you get a check for them or your broker would deposit the funds into a money market account for you   there is sometimes an option to re invest dividends see 's answer regarding dividend re investment plans as tom au described the dividends are set by the board of directors and announced   also as he indicated just before the record date a stock which pays dividends is worth slightly more reflecting the value of the dividend that will be paid to anyone holding the stock on the record date and goes down by the dividend amount immediately after that date since you 'd now have to hold the stock till the next record date to get a dividend   in general unless there 's a big change in the landscape such as in late 2008 most companies pay out about the same dividend each time and changes to this are sometimes seen by some as indicators of company health and such news can result in movement in the stock price when you look at a basic quote on a ticker symbol there is usually a line for div yeild which gives the amount of dividend paid per share and the relative yeild as a percentage of the stock price   if a company has been paying dividends this field will have values in it if a company does not pay a dividend it will be blank or say na depending on where you get the quote   this is the easiest way to see if a company pays a dividend or not   for example if you look at this quote for google you can see it pays no dividend   now in terms of telling when and how much of a dividend has been paid most financial sites have the option when viewing a stock chart to show the dividend payments   if you expand the chart to show at least a year you can see when and how much was paid in terms of dividends   for example you can see from this chart that msft pays dividends once a quarter and used to pay out 13 cents but recently changed to 16 cents    if you were to float your mouse over one of those icons it would also give the date the dividend was paid

the first question is essentially asking for specific investment advice which is off topic per the faq but i 'll take a stab at 2 and 3 2 if my 401k does n't change before i leave my job not planned in the    near future i should roll it over into my roth ira after i leave due    to these high expense ratios correct my advice is that you should roll over a 401 k into an ira the first chance you get usually when you leave the job 401 k plans are notorious for high expense ratios and why leave your money in a plan where you have a limited choice of investments anyway versus a self directed ira where you can invest in anything you want 3 should i still max contribute with these horrible expense ratios if they are providing a match yes even with the expense ratios it is hard to beat the immediate return of an employer match   if they are n't matching the answer is still probably yes for a few reasons you already are maxing out your ability to contribute to sheltered accounts so assuming you still want to sock away that money for retirement the tax benefits are still valuable and probably offset the expense ratios although you seem to be an exception it is hard for most people to be disciplined enough to put money in a retirement account after they have it in their hands versus auto deduction from paychecks

the federal reserve is not the only way that money can be printed every bank does fractional reserve banking thereby increasing the money supply every time they make a new loan there 's a number called the reserve requirement which limits how much money each bank can create lowering the reserve requirement allows banks to create more money raising it will destroy money but banks can also destroy money by calling in loans or being less willing to make new loans   so when you look at the number of banks in the us and the number of loans they all have it 's impossible to figure out exactly how much the money supply is expanding or contracting

these rates are so low because the cost of money is so low specifically two rates are near zero   the federal reserve discount rate which is the interest rate charged to commercial banks and other depository institutions on loans they receive from their regional federal reserve bank 's lending facility the discount window the effective federal funds rate which is the rate banks pay when they trade balances with each other through the federal reserve banks want to profit on the loans they make like mortgage loans to do so they try to maximize the difference between the rates they charge on mortgages and other loans revenue and the rates they pay savings account holders the federal reserve or other banks to obtain funds expenses this means that the rates they offer to pay are as close to these rates as possible as the charts shows both rates have been cut significantly since the start of the recession either through open market operations the federal funds rate or directly the discount rate the discount rate is set directly by the regional federal reserve banks every 14 days    in most cases the federal funds rate is lower than the discount rate in order to encourage banks to lend money to each other instead of borrowing it from the fed in the past however there have been rare instances where the federal funds rate has exceeded the discount rate and it 's been cheaper for banks to borrow money directly from the fed than from each other

actually the other answer is n't strictly correct   it 's an estimate giving a lower bound that gets less accurate as income increases   consider u.s. income tax is based on a progressive tax system where there are income bracket levels with increasing tax rates example given u.s. 2009 federal tax rates for an individual filing as single imagine somebody making $ 100000   assuming no other credits deductions or taxes then income tax based on the above brackets rates would be calculated as follows meaning the average tax rate for the single individual earning $ 100,000 is however a pre tax deduction from that income actually comes off at the top marginal tax rate   consider the same calculation but with taxable income reduced to $ instead i.e. simulating a pre tax $ 1000 deduction that 's a difference of $ 280 which is more than the $ savings that would have been estimated if just using the average tax rate method consequently when trying to determine how much money would be saved by a tax deduction it makes better sense to estimate using the marginal tax rate which in this case was 28   it gets a little trickier if the deduction crosses a bracket boundary   left as an exercise to the reader finally in the case of the deduction being discussed it also looks like payroll fica taxes paid by the employee social security 's 6.2 and medicare 's 1.45 would be avoided as well so add that to the marginal tax rate savings the surest way to know how much would be saved though would be to do one 's income tax return calculation without the deduction and then with and compare the numbers   tax software can make this very easy to do

based on your description of what you were given then you should not need to contact dmv dot however if you are not comfortable with that answer then contact visit the dealer you can ask them how long it normally takes and do you pick up the real plates at the dealer dmv or will they be mailed to you also call them if the temporary plates will run out in a few days to make sure everything is good to go one other note if the dealer is in one state and you live in another they can give you temporary plate for their state but may not be able to file for the real plates in your state once everything is finalized go online to dmv and make sure that the car registration is ok a few years ago the dealer gave me real plates they gave me a registration good for two years but the info sent to dmv was corrupted the vin was in the system but the description was wrong and the plates were listed as none this was only noticed when i tried to re register the car two years later in fact according to dmv the plates on the car were listed as never issued if i had ever been pulled over it would have taken hours to resolve

yeah    they actually have said that their new strategy is not to make money from breakage people who pay but do n't use it i believe they also guaranteed the $ 10 deal for a year but i 'm not at all certain so do n't quote me on that    instead they want to make money from the data and eventually convince movie theaters to cut them in on sales and/or give them discounts on tickets both of which depend on people actually using moviepass    i think those are really silly plans the movie data is highly unlikely to cover the costs of the tickets that moviepass has to buy    movie theaters like studios are stubborn bastards who have a history of sticking to their guns and refusing to budge even an inch when it comes to certain terms they also have recently demonstrated a preference for building out their own direct to consumer offerings rather than with third party offerings    i do n't see them getting a ton more traffic from mp customers and more concession sales and then deciding to give up any of their highly prized concession sales considering that most heavy theater likely have a primary theater that they go to it would probably make more sense for theaters to simply market their own offering to them in theater and wait for mp to run out of money    finally amc is the biggest chain and actively wants this $ 10/month subscription to fail amc has announced that it absolutely will not give mp any deals on ticket prices something that mp is counting on to make this sustainable maybe mp is counting on amc to eventually change its mind but i do n't think that 's a smart bet    otoh what the hell do i know i 've been wrong plenty of times before

1- wells fargo does not own our current mortgage   they have bundled it and sold it as an investment 2- they make their money from servicing the loan   even if they only get $ 50 per month to service it 3 of our monthly payment that adds up to $ per month if they have a million homes under management   that is $ 600 million per year for each million homes being serviced 3- managing the escrow gets them additional profit because they can invest it and earn 2 3   if 1,000,000 homes have an average balance of $ 2,000 in their escrow accounts they can earn up to $ 60 per year or $ annually they make $ 1,000 every time they refinance the home   this is the approximate profit after paying real closing costs   refinance those million homes and you make a cool billion in profit 5- they also want to be sure that they keep us as a customer   by lowering our payment they decrease the likelyhood that we will refinance with someone else and we are less likely to default   not that they lose if we default because they do n't own the loan they make additional profit by paying off the old loan they do n't own it remember then packaging and selling the new mortgage   since they are selling it as a security they sell for future value meaning they sell our $ 200,000 loan for a valuation of $   this means that they sell for $ 200,000 plus some fraction of the additional $ 160,000   let 's say they only want a 10 premium of the $ valuation   that means they sell our $ 200,000 loan for $   they pocket $ 36,000   if they make a million of these transactions every year that is $ 36 billion dollars in profit so wells fargo refinances one million homes every year and they make $ initial profit for selling the loan with absolutely no risk plus $ for doing the loan $ annually to service the loan very little risk since it is being paid by the owner of the loan as a service fee if they can retain the loans for their entire life keep us from refinancing with someone else they can make $ that is billion dollars in servicing fees the profit they make in a refinance is much greater than the money then can make by holding the loan for 30 years

i 'm another programmer i guess we all just like complicated things or got here via obligatory tedious but accurate point investing is not personal finance in fact it 's maybe one of the less important parts of it see this answer where to start with personal finance   obligatory warning for software developer type minds getting into investing because it 's complicated and therefore fun is a really awful idea from a financial perspective   or see behavioral finance research on how analytical professional creative type people are often terrible at investing while even tempered practical people are better the thing with investing is that inaction is better than action tried and true is better than creative and simple is better than complicated so if you 're like me and many programmers and like creative complicated action not good for the wallet you 've been warned that said stuff i read in general i hate reading too much financial information because i think it makes me take ill advised actions the actions i most need to take have to do with my career and my spending patterns so i try to focus on reading about software development for example or i answer questions on this site which at least might help someone out and i enjoy writing for basic financial news and research i prefer especially if you get the premium version the writing has more depth it 's often from qualified financial analysts and with the paid version you get data and analysis on thousands of funds and stocks instead of a small number as with motley fool newsletters i do n't follow morningstar regularly anymore instead i use it for research when i need to pick funds in a 401k or whatever another caveat on morningstar is that the star ratings on funds are dumb look at the analyst picks and the analyst instead i just flipped through my rss reader and i have 20 30 finance related blogs in there collecting posts it looks like the only one i regularly read is which is sort of random but i find david very thoughtful and interesting he 's also a conservative without being a partisan hack and posts frequently i read the weekly market comment at as well most weeks it says the market is overvalued so that 's predictable but the interesting part is the rationale and the other ideas he talks about i read a lot of software related blogs and there 's some bleed into finance especially from the vc world blogs like or or whatever anyway i spend most of my reading time on career related stuff and i think this is also the correct decision from a financial perspective if you were a doctor you 'd be better off reading about too i read finance related books fairly often i guess there are other threads listing ideas on that front i prefer books about principles rather than a of daily financial news and questionable ideas other than that i keep up with headlines just reading the paper every day including business related topics is good enough if there 's some big event in the financial markets it 'll show up in the regular paper take a class i initially learned about finance by reading a pile of books and alongside that taking the cfp course and the first cfa course both are probably equivalent to about a college semester worth of work but you can plow through them in a couple months each if you focus you can just do the class and take the exam if you like without having to go on and actually get the work experience and the certifications i did n't go on to do that this sounds like a crazy thing to do and it kind of is but i think it 's also sort of crazy to expect to be competent on a topic without taking some courses or otherwise getting pretty deep into the material if you 're a normal person and do n't have time to take finance courses you 're likely better off either keeping it super simple or else outsourcing if you can find the right advisor what exactly can a financial advisor do for me and is it worth the money   when it 's inevitably complex e.g. as you approach retirement then an advisor is best my mom is retiring soon and i found her a professional for example i like having a lot of knowledge myself because it 's just the only way i could feel comfortable so for sure i understand other people wanting to have it too but what i 'd share from the other side is that once you have it the conclusion is that you do n't have enough knowledge or time to do anything fancy anyway and that the simple answers are fine check out investing for fun is n't investing for profit many people recommend motley fool i see two on this question already the site is n't evil but the problem in my opinion is that it promotes an attitude toward and a style of investing that is n't objectively justifiable for practical reasons essentially i do n't think optimizing for making money and optimizing for having fun very well if investing is your chosen hobby rather than fishing or then motley fool can be fun with their tone and discussion forums but other people in forums are just going to make you go wrong money wise see behavioral finance research again talking to others is n't compatible with ice in your decision making also motley fool tends to make it sound like active investing is easier than it is there 's a reason the chartered financial analyst curriculum is a few reams of paper plus 4 years of work experience rather than reading blogs practical investing just buy the target date fund can be super easy but once you go beyond that it 's not i do n't really agree with the anyone can do it and it 's not work premise any more than i think that about or or computer programming after 15 years i 'm a programming expert after some courses and a lot of reading i 'm not someone who could professionally run an actively managed portfolio i think most of us need to have the fun part separate from the serious cash part maybe literally distinct accounts that you keep at separate brokerages or just do something else for fun besides investing morningstar has this problem too and and bloomberg i mean they are all interested in making you think about investing a lot more than you ought to they all have an incentive to convince you that the latest headlines make a difference when they do n't bottom line i do n't think personal finance changes very quickly the details of specific mutual funds change and there 's always some new twist in the tax code but the big picture is pretty stable i think going in depth say read the chartered financial analyst curriculum materials would teach you a lot more than reading blogs frequently the most important things to work on are income career and spending to maximize income minus spending that 's where time investment will pay off i know it 's annoying to argue the premise of the question rather than answering but i did try to mention a couple things to read somewhere in there

see my recent answer to a similar question on prepaying a mortgage versus investing in ira the issue here is similar you want to compare the relative rates of funding your retirement account versus paying down your debt if you can invest at a better rate than you are paying on your debt with similar risk then you should invest otherwise pay down your debt the big difference with your situation is that you have a variable rate loan so there 's a significant risk that the rate on it will go up if i was in your shoes i would do the following but that 's me if you 're more debt averse you may decide to prepay that fixed rate loan too

me those edi operators called edi service bureaus in the us have a unique edi map for each trading partner because as i said each trading partner sends the edi data in a completely different way   different erp systems have different mappings but there are no unlimited amount of erp systems if you can cover sap microsoft and oracle you can already trade edi messages between most of the big parties you only have to make the edi mappings once for a system and if you have process to update them it is not hard to sell it to companies that want to have edi processes   we never had to do any kind of mappings our self i guess the infra in eu is just a bit ahead of what you got in us   service bureaus charge $ $ $ per message   so does it cost to scan input data and process the invoice for us it was easy choice as it is way faster more reliable and also cheaper than having someone do all the data input into erp   invoices from suppliers are for many different types of services handled by many different departments   for all those we have automated rules freight orders are sent through a 3rd party system that matches the invoices to the freight orders they have our freight prices and can automatically approve the invoices with the tables or reject them and ask for a credit   goods invoices have the po number the shipping documents have the same po number and when a item is received with a po number it is allocated to a invoice with the same po number buyers know if the po is not full filled automatically as the inventory will not match what was ordered   hr invoices will go to hr department automatically and they just have to check if the invoice is correct postings and allocations are done by automatic rules here also   office supplies can either be bought by po number or with reference to who the invoice has to be sent for inspection inspector can change the automatic postings if there is something incorrect with the automatic posting   the system we have has been quite flexible and there has not been much of need for customization after the initial setup    of course there is still some manual postings to be done but lot less than without

normally interest only mortgages are taken incase one planning to sell off the property after a few years and purchase of the property is for investment in such a case instead of oneself with a huge emi one opts for an interest only mortgage and towards the end of the term sell off the house at profit and repay back the entire principal   i am not to sure if interest only mortgages are encouraged for properties you plan to live in although i do not know about the ing scheme normally there is no prepayment option on interest only mortgages its bank way of earning a fixed income for the contracted period and that s the reason why the interest rates are lower than a regular mortgage if you do the math you may be paying more in total interest than on a regular mortgage

do n't over think about your choices the most important thing to start now and keep adjusting and tuning your portfolio as you move along in your life each individual 's situation is unique start with something simple and straight forward like 100 your age in total stock market index fund and the remaining total bond market index fund for your 401k at least contribute so much as to get the maximum employer match its always good if you can contribute the yearly maximum in your 401k or ira once you have built up a substantial amount of assets ~ $ 50k+ then its time to think more about asset allocation and start buying into more specific investments as needed remember to keep your investment expenses low by using index funds also remember to factor in tax implications on your investment decisions eg buying an reit fund in a tax advantaged account like 40k is more tax efficient than buying it in a normal brokerage account

the reason that you are advised to take more risk while you are young is because the risk is often correlated to a short investment horizon young people have 40 50 years to let their savings grow if they get started early enough   if you need the money in 5 15 years near the end of your earning years there is much more risk of a dip that will not correct itself before you need the money than if you do n't need the money for 25 40 years someone whose career is on the rise the main focus for the young should be growth hedging your investments with gold might be a good strategy for someone who is worried about the volatility of other investments but i would imagine that gold will only reduce your returns compared to small cap stocks for example if you are looking for more risk you can leverage some of your money and buy call options to increase the gains with upward market moves

this is something better asking a licensed professional ea cpa licensed in the us who 's also familiar with your home country tax law and the tax treaty your home country has with the us assuming no tax treaty and adverse tax consequences at home you can have this scenario the last step is critical unless there 's a tax treaty not every country allows foreign tax credit tax treaties usually have a provision to avoid double taxation and you may end up paying both the us tax and local tax on the same money if there 's a tax treaty step 4 is most likely guaranteed step 4 may not work in some places that would not consider the penalty as tax again check it with an accountant proficient with the local law step 3 depends on your country some countries ignore foreign deferred compensation rules and consider the 401k amounts income to you when it was deposited the us treats foreign tax deferred accounts this way i believe that is also the case in india so you should check locally in this case you have probably paid taxes or were exempt on this amount when you earned it and will not pay taxes again but then you might also not be able to claim the 10 back as credit leaving it is an option although with such an amount is hardly worth it you 'll have to check how your country deals with foreign accounts of its citizens the us for example puts an enormous reporting and tax burden on these some countries forbid them altogether this also applies to step 1

the formula you are looking for is pretty complicated it 's given here you might prefer to let somebody else do the grunt work for you this page will calculate the probability for you in your case you 'd enter standard and standard oh you did n't say what you 're paying on your debt let 's say it 's 6 i.e. .06 note that this page will give you the probability that the actual number will be less than or equal to the standard score enter all that and click the magic button and the probability that the investment will produce less than 6 is or 34 the handy rule of thumb is that the probability is about 68 that the actual number will be within 1 standard deviation of the mean 95 that it will be within 2 standard deviations and that it will be within 3 which is n't exactly what you want because you do n't want within but less than but you could get that by just adding half the difference from 100 for each of the above i.e. instead of 68 95 it would be 84 98 99.9 oh i missed that in a follow up comment you say you are paying 4 on a mortgage which you are adjusting to 3 because of tax implications probability based on mean and sd you gave of getting less than 3 is 26 i did n't read the article you cite i assume the standard deviation given is for the rate of return for one year if you stretch that over many years the sd goes down as many factors tend to even out so while the probability that money in a given say mutual fund will grow by less than 3 in one year is fairly high the 25 35 we 're talking here sounds plausible to me the probability that it will grow by an average of less than 3 over a period of 10 or 15 or 20 years is much less further thought there is of course no provably true formula for what makes a reasonable risk suppose i offered you an investment that had a 99 chance of showing a $ 5,000 profit and a 1 chance of a $ loss would you take it i would n't even though the chance of a loss is small if it happened i 'd lose everything i have is it worth that risk for the modest potential profit i 'd say no of course to someone who has a billion dollars this might be a very reasonable risk if it fails oh well that could really cut in to what he can spend on lunch tomorrow

in general scholarship income that you receive that is not used for tuition or books must be included in your gross income and reported as such on your tax return   scholarship income you receive that is used for those kinds of expenses may be from your gross income   see this irs information and this related question i believe that as represented on the 1098-t this generally means that if box 5 scholarships and grants is greater than box 1 or 2 only one of which will be used on your 1098-t you received taxable scholarship income   if box 5 is less than or equal to box 1/2 you did not receive taxable scholarship income   this page draws the same conclusion however you should realize that the 1098-t is not what makes you have to pay or not pay taxes   you incur the taxes by receiving scholarship money and you may reduce your tax liability by paying tuition   the 1098-t is simply a record of payments that have already been made for instance if you received $ 10,000 in scholarship money that is actually received checks for that amount or had that amount deposited into your bank account then your income went up by $ 10,000   if you yourself paid tuition it is likely that you can exclude the amount of the tuition from your taxable income reducing the tax you owe see the irs page linked above   however if you received $ 10,000 in actual money and in addition your tuition was paid by the scholarship with money you never actually had in your own bank account then the entire $ 10,000 would be taxable   you do not give enough information in your question to be sure which of these situations is closer to your own   however you should be able to decide by looking at your bank account look at how much money you received and how much you spent on tuition   if you received more scholarship money than the tuition you paid out of pocket you owe taxes on the remainder   i emphasize that this is just a general rule of thumb and should not be taken as tax advice you should review the irs information and/or consult a tax professional to determine what part of your scholarship income is taxable in addition as this now rather old article from the new york society of cpas notes many colleges and universities prepare incorrectly and report tuition and related expenses   this means you should be careful to reconcile the 1098-t with your own financial records of what money you actually received and paid   when i was in grad school there was a good deal of hand wringing and hair pulling each year among the students as we tried to determine what relationship if any the 1098-t bore to the financial facts

in this scenario the date of income is the date on which the contract has been signed even if you received the actual money settlement later regardless of the ny special law for residency termination that is the standard rule for recognition of income during a cash not installments sale the fact that you got the actual money later does n't matter which is similar to selling stocks on a public exchange when you sell stocks through your broker on a public exchange you still recognize the income on the day of the sale not on the day of the settlement this is called the constructive receipt doctrine the irs publication 538 has this to say about the constructive receipt constructive receipt    income is constructively received when an    amount is credited to your account or made available to you without    restriction you need not have possession of it if you authorize    someone to be your agent and receive income for you you are    considered to have received it when your agent receives it income is    not constructively received if your control of its receipt is subject    to substantial restrictions or limitations once you signed the contract the money has essentially been credited to your account with the counter party and unless they 're bankrupt or otherwise insolvent you have no restrictions over it and also more specifically for your case you can not hold checks or postpone taking possession of similar    property from one tax year to another to postpone paying tax on the    income you must report the income in the year the property is    received or made available to you without restriction timing wire transfer is akin to holding and not depositing a check from this perspective so unless there was a restriction that was lifted after you moved out of new york i doubt you can claim that you could n't have received it before moving out i.e. you have in fact constructively received it

while a margin account is not required to trade options a margin account is necessary to take delivery of an exercised put the puts can be bought in a cash account so long as the cash necessary to fund the trade is available if you do choose to exercise which almost never has a positive expected value relative to selling except after the final trading time before expiration taxes notwithstanding then your shares will be put to your counterparty since options almost always trade in round lots 100 shares will have to fund the put exercise or a margin account must satisfy the difference for your situation trading out of both positions would be probably be best

the most obvious example would be a situation where a company is growth constrained but cash flow positive it may have enough cash flow to service $ 10 million of debt but it needs to build a new facility that will cost $ 20 million there is the option to raise debt and equity or just raise equity and move quicker to getting that facility up and running    there are also situations where debt is used to replace equity i.e. dividend or leveraged share redemption

i find this very hard to believe believe it   the bottom quarter of american households have negative net worth and the bottom three quarters have no more than a tiny amount saved up in an emergency 63 of americans would not be able to come up with $ 500 without going into debt   nobody can retire with 5k in the u.s. the money will be gone within a year is it possible now you begin to see why the long term stability of social security and medicare are at present hot topics in american political life without them a great many more americans would die in poverty what is the actual figure the $ 5000 figure is accurate but irrelevant that median includes people who are thirty years from retirement and people who are two days from retirement the more relevant statistics are those restricted to people at or close to retirement age and they can be found lower down in the article you cite or in numerous other studies here 's one from the gao for example the figures here are unfortunately no less terrifying now $ 104 k is a lot better than $ 5 k but it 's still not much to retire on why we believe that it is reasonable to throw out all the zeros before taking the median i do not know that seems like bad math to me update there is some discussion of this point in the comments all i 'm saying here is that this is a and possibly misleading way to characterize the situation the linked report has the actual data but let 's try to summarize it here in a more meaningful way let 's suppose that we make buckets for how dependent on ss is a retirement age household to avoid starving to death being homeless and so on maybe these buckets are not ideal and we could move them around a bit   the takeaways here are that the ratios of nothing inadequate barely adequate comfortable is about that only the top of retirement age households can fund a comfortable retirement without help illustrates just how dependent on ss american households are how do 50 of old americans survive in their old age   social security and medicare   as the cited gao report indicates social security provides most of the income for about half of households age 65 and older do most old americans rely on their children for financial support one day i met a woman at a party and we were making small talk about her kids she had a couple already and one more was on the way   i want to have lots of children to support me in my old age she said   do you support your parents i asked which frankly seemed like an entirely reasonable question   of course not i ca n't afford it i 've got a baby on the way and two more kids at home i left her to draw her own conclusions as to the viability of her retirement plan

first of all make sure you have an emergency fund   ideally this should be at least 6 months of living expenses in an easily accessible place do you have any credit card debt school debt or other debt   work towards becoming debt free especially of higher interest debt and debt on things that are only depreciating cars for example   if you have extra income consider putting it towards debt if you currently have access to a 403b you should begin investing immediately   if not look into a roth ira   the community has provided suggestions for good places to get one   with a roth ira you take post tax income money and invest it into this retirement account and when you reach retirement age you get it and all the interest as tax free income   you ca n't withdraw the principal until retirement age   you should put up to the legal limit into a retirement account if you ca n't do this at first work towards this goal after an emergency fund becoming debt free and fully funding your retirement save for goals such as a house or other things you are working towards the exact order of doing these things might vary but in general you need the emergency fund first

i think these systems of wealth re allocation is where the heart of the debate about the american economy is or should be should we have our government intervene and re allocate wealth in some way it already does to some degree although arguably in a bad way it 's much easier to avoid taxes when you can pay for the sort of expert good at avoiding that sort of thing middle poor class individuals end up paying more taxes relative to their income further exacerbating wealth inequality i think it was bill gates and probably many others that have mentioned that one of the best ways to get money to market participants is by investing in businesses who then employ people   i think the concern with the american economy and everything else dependent to it is that the mechanisms pipelines for enabling the poorly utilized are by the mechanisms pipelines for taking the money from the poor middle class and putting it in the hands of the rich loan based financial products are the biggest offenders i think if only hypothetically i would like to see what an economy would look like if loans were simply not an option or if the idea of merit qualifying a person for a loan financing were significantly more accurate

there are no particular restrictions in the uk on sending money abroad so if you can get the loan in the first place you can send the money abroad the main potential issue will be that many maybe all unsecured personal loan providers will want some indication of the purpose of the loan and you will need to be honest with them about this or it would be fraud as with all financial transactions with friends and family you should think very carefully about the risks both of not getting the money back and of the impact on your relationship can you definitely repay the loan even if your parents do n't repay you who will take the exchange rate risk will your parents repay you the gbp you borrowed or the eur you lend them depending on the rules in your parents country they will likely need to declare the source of these funds to the mortgage provider and the mortgage provider will always have first priority in getting repaid

actually the rate of change could be more or less constant but you might have a minimum price that represents your fixed costs   so you might sell a for $ 1 which is ridiculous in terms of per unit pricing to cover fixed costs and add $ for each step in size to cover variable costs cost of raw materials and packaging so a 2 lb bag would be $ 2 a 5 lb bag would be $ 3.50 a ton would be $ etc   at the end of the day you want the marginal revenue the price that you charge for each additional pound to be more than the marginal cost the price per pound it takes to produce the bag   any amount over that goes towards your fixed costs the cost you 'd incur if you sold zero product rent utilities overhead etc it 's not an exact science and there are many variables that go into pricing

the essence of your question is whether it 's worth 1000 to you to spread the payments over half a year   the longer payment plan is just a loan and buying the loan costs you more money   the question is whether you think the loan is a good price   i suspect it 's over priced the classic financial analysis would be whether you could get a better return on the loan opportunity costs   but we are talking about what are presumably not terribly big sums of money so it may make more sense to analyze this amount of money in more personalized terms   in that case remember to consider the convenience is it significantly easier to budget with the 6-month plan   watch out for other costs to the loan such as late penalties and other loan fees if you find the periodic payments convenient or you have a short horizon high yield investment then the 6-month loan might work   otherwise if you can afford it it makes more sense to buy the phone upfront

i think you should really start a limited company for this it 'll be a lot simpler to spread the income over multiple years if your business and you have completely separate identities you should also consult an accountant if only once to understand the basics of how to approach this having a limited company would also mean that if it has financial problems you do n't end up having to pay the debts yourself with a separate company you would keep any money raised within the company initially and only pay it to yourself as salary over the three years so from an income tax point of view you 'd only be taxed on it as you received it the company would also pay for project expenses directly and there would n't be any income tax to pay on them at all you would have to pay other taxes like vat but you could choose to register for vat and then you 'd be able to reclaim vat on the company 's expenses but would have to charge vat to your customers if you start making enough money currently £ you have to register for vat whether you want to or not the only slight complication might be that you could be subject to corporation tax on the surplus money in the first year because it might seem like a profit however given that you would presumably have promised something to the over a three year period it should be possible to record your promises as a liability for unearned income in the company accounts in effect you 'd be saying although there 's still £ 60,000 in the bank i have promised to spend it on the thing so it 's not profit again you should consult an accountant at least over the basics of this

there are many ways to value a business here is a simple method to get a ball park number on most businesses this business is made of two parts for the real estate for the business   i would consider this type of small business riskier than the stock market and so you should expect a higher return maybe 15 or 20 if the rental business makes $ 50k profit not revenue and that is 20 return of your investment the business is worth $ 250k if the business makes no money or if they only make money because they do n't take a salary then this is a hobby and not a business there 's no business to buy here and you are just bidding on the real estate to do with what you please the assets worth $ 600k and the business worth $ 250k would be added together for a fair sale price of $ adjust for your actual numbers and you should be able to get a ball park of what you think the business is worth if you do the math and it works out that you 'll make 1 3 on your business compare that to investing in other places if it works out that you 'll make 40 on your money that 's pretty awesome too

gt can i use venture like that in a financial context or does it refer specifically to venture capital   yes any business is a venture so to speak    gt so they would receive a smaller return yes   possibly yes   mezzanine investors are well middle investors they 're beyond seed and venture capital but before more late stage private investment that does n't necessarily mean they 're after a seed or venture capital investment it can mean that or it can simply mean the business is a little more advanced than a pure idea or pre revenue etc   let 's say a company is pre destined to get to $ 100 m in value if it can secure funding naturally later investors will have a smaller return of course private investments are generally for smaller younger companies and thus are more risky so an investor can still lose value in a private equity investment   gt is mezzanine investing particularly profitable   yes absolutely you have to understand with investments in private equity firms and individuals are often looking for a multiple of their investment i.e. if an investor invests $ 1 m they expect $ 2 m $ 3 m etc back this is not necessarily for all levels of private equity but many levels will attempt this generally the idea as far as i 'm aware is a 20 irr which means that generally the investment grows by 20 compounding yearly    gt secondly why is dilution so important further down the road is it to do with valuation   absolutely let 's think of our example earlier where you me and joe each own 33 at $ 300 total value   if suddenly another company wants to buy all of our equity for $ 600 then we 're all pretty happy each of us will get $ 200 however let 's say joe had n't come along if that other company then made an offer for $ 600 we 'd both get $ 300 for the company    there 's some other things about dilution too such as the possible loss of control but we 'll save that for later   gt finally at what point would a company aim to meet an ipo is it case specific or is there a general understanding of the best time   it 's very case specific in most cases depending on the industry the company will be relatively a bit older have both revenue and profitability and a history of operations in some cases companies like this will choose to never go ipo such as the big 4 auditing firms for one among others    there are of course exceptions many smaller are pre revenue and are traded on the market tesla is getting revenue but not profitable and it 's on the markets as well these are naturally riskier investments but at least you 've got liquidity to help a bit with that    when a private equity pe firm is looking to exit sell their stake through an ipo they will try to engineer the company to be as attractive as possible to public investors in fact many pe firms will stipulate specific terms and possibly get control of the company from the owner when they initially invest but there 's a lot that goes into it perhaps /u or /u can go into a bit more detail on pe exits as while it 's my chief interest and my career goal it 's not quite where i 'm at yet

i would go with your alternative idea get rid of the debt as fast as possible     you have $ of debt it 's a lot but with your new $ 90k salary do you think you could get rid of it all in 12 months see if you can make that happen once the debt is gone you 'll be in a position to invest as much as you want and keep all your gains you are worried about sacrificing future money in your investments but if you eliminate the debt over the next year this will be minimized just lose the debt

pricing would just be another way to describe valuation i guess if you want to get technical pricing is the act of getting somethings valuation while valuation is the estimate of somethings worth security analysis   an examination and evaluation of the various factors affecting the value of a security side note while pricing is valuation price is not price is how much the stock or security costs most commonly determined by a market add on the meaning of two words might matter depending on what context it is being used in for example if we were talking about a market where an individual actually sets a price at random without doing any type of evaluation then that provides would better highlight the differences

i do n't know the legal framework for rsus so i 'm not sure what is mandatory and what is chosen by the company issuing them i recently reviewed one companies offering and it basically looked like a flat purchase of stock on the vest date so even if i got a shares for $ 1 granted to me if it was 100 shares that vested at $ 100 on the 1st then i would owe tax on the market value on the day of vest further the company would withhold 25 of the vest for federal taxes and 10 for state taxes if i lived in a state with income tax the withholding rate was flat regardless of what my actual tax rate was capital gains on the change from the market value on the vest date was calculated as short term or long term based on the time since the vest date so if my 100 shares went up to $ 120 i would pay the $ 20 difference as short term or long term based on how long i had owned them since the vest that said i do n't know if this is universal your hr folks should be able to help answer at least some of these questions though i know their favorite response when they do n't know is that you should consult a tax professional good luck

dollars of stocks bonds and commodities add to its portfolio a luxury yacht called natita   the story behind the boat begins with a 2014 loan to a prized goldman client billionaire texas william kallop it ends with goldman suing its own client and the u.s. last month down on a west palm beach marina to the yacht which boasts a movie theater and   goldman ’s is a strange but inevitable outcome of wall street ’s latest gold rush lending to wealthy clients the loans backed by everything from to wine   these loans which are growing quickly at firms such as goldman morgan stanley and ubs group ag are an exotic spin on the most basic thing banks do lending money to people they have the added benefit of building loyalty among prized clientele   related   wall street needs you to borrow against your stock july 27 like any loans though they can go bad and leave banks holding assets that are n’t easy to value or sell goldman will likely auction natita which already has been on the market for almost two years with no takers   a goldman spokesman declined to comment on the case mr. kallop did n’t respond to requests for comment a lawyer for mr. kallop declined to comment   if you do it right it ’s a great business and clients will absolutely love you for it said bruce a partner at the boston consulting group who advises private banks on wealth management strategy but there are a lot of ways to mess up   banks pushed wealth lending in recent years against a of increasing deposits and demand for traditional loans goldman ’s private bank has its overall lending balances since 2012 to $ 29 billion morgan stanley wealth loan balances are up 420 since 2012 to $ 74 billion   the largest chunk of wealth loans are mortgages and loans backed by stock portfolios a smaller but growing segment is secured by valuables such as classic cars hedge fund stakes and even rare   wealth loans are especially profitable for banks because the revenue they generate is shared less generously with brokers than trading commissions and other fees   banks say these loans are safe because they already know the borrowers their assets and their ability to repay and unlike say credit cards these loans have collateral and often a personal guarantee as well goldman said in a february filing that the value of collateral in its wealth loans generally the loan amount   morgan stanley and deutsche bank ag have lent against the art collection of hedge fund billionaire steven a. cohen who owns works by andy warhol and according to connecticut state filings top group lp executives including founder stephen have borrowed from ubs against their stakes in the private equity funds new york filings show   goldman lent to natural gas against his wine collection according to an oklahoma filing executives the collateral was particularly liquid after mr. ’s death in 2015 the collection heavy on rare was auctioned for $ million goldman made its money back   although not as well

resources and buying a old liquor in   he spent acquiring three jets and at least eight residences including a mansion two homes in the dominican republic and a working cattle ranch in texas according to property record lawsuits and people who have worked for him   and he bought yachts at least seven of them over the past eight years   in addition to natita which he bought in 2010 and named for his mother in law mr. kallop ’s fleet includes bad girl in the dominican republic and honey a used by president john f. kennedy that he bought at ’s auction in 1998 and restored   another yacht la which was once owned by trump was destroyed in a fire   a few years ago goldman came calling the wall street firm ’s private bank manages some $ 450 billion in assets for 11,500 clients and was developed in the 1980s to help business owners like mr. kallop manage their windfall after a sale   mr. kallop became a client in 2014 he borrowed $ million from the bank to buy a foot inspired mansion just down the beach from mar a president donald trump ’s private club in palm beach county records show   in 2014 mr. kallop borrowed $ 32 million from goldman against the natita and bad girl court records show

former employees and acquaintances he put off upgrades to the boats which were showing signs of wear bad enough for a march 2016 charter group to walk off natita in a former crew member said   goldman ordered periodic valuations of the yacht after making the loan according to the crew member   mr. kallop laid off crew members and put natita up for sale in 2015 for € 59.5 million $ 67 million at that time then dropped the price to $ million last year according to court documents he sold a second palm beach house in april 2015 for $ 19 million goldman alleges he stopped paying back on the loan

unpaid services mr. kallop also owes the florida marina where natita is hundreds of thousands of dollars in fees employees said   eventually goldman filed suit in a miami federal court to seize the

there is a basis for that if you consider the power of compounding so the sooner you re invest the dividends the sooner the time will give you results through compounding there is also the case of the commissions if they are paid with a percentage of the amount invested they automatically gain more from you just my though the other answers are probably more complete

basically a 401(k can have what is called a loan but is more properly a structured withdrawal and repayment agreement this allows you to access your nest egg to pay for unforeseen expenses without having to actually cash it out and pay the 10 penalty plus taxes you can get up to half of your current savings with an absolute cap of $ 50k minus the balance of any other loan outstanding while there is a balance outstanding you must make regular scheduled payments the agreement does include an interest rate but basically that interest money goes into your account the downside of a 401(k loan is the you must pay the scheduled amount and you also have to keep the job for which you 're paying into the 401(k if you quit or are fired the balance of the loan must usually be paid in 60 days or else the financial institution will consider the unpaid balance a withdrawal and notify the irs to that effect now with a roth account it works a little differently basically contributions to any roth account ira or 401(k are post tax but that means the money 's now yours there is no penalty or additional taxes levied on any amount you cash out so a loan basically just provides structure you withdraw then pay back under structured terms but if you need a little cash for a good reason it 's usually better just to cash out some of the principal of a roth account and then be disciplined enough to pay back into it

well first off yes every year the younger generation grows up but remember that the older generation also dying off leaving the market place also what happens if the younger generation ca n't take up enough debt in order to pay for previous commitments   secondly i think you 're confusing the money supply with actual production the two are pretty much divorced from each other money does n't require a resource per se at least not since leaving the gold standard it just requires that someone is able willing to take on debt for example every time you take a loan out from the bank you are effectively creating money this is called bank credit and if you live in a country that uses fractional reserve banking then it makes up a very large part of your money supply think like up to 95 when bank 's create money they only create the principle amount ie the original loan amount and not the interest amount as well this means that someone else needs to take out a loan so that you can repay the amount in interest that you owe on your new loan this does n't normally affect you because there are lots of people taking out lots of loans all the time and money is circulating around in the economy the problem is that eventually the system gets to a stage where people ca n't really take out loans any more they just have too much debt and so you end up with a liquidity crisis like in 2008    so what i was saying is that either i 'm missing something pretty obvious and i 've got this wrong or this is exactly how it works and economists like to just ignore it for the benefits that it offers

others have already commented on the impact of anything which merchants from raising possible breaches so i wo n't dwell on that maybe we need stronger legislation maybe we do n't but it does n't change today 's answer often it works the other way around to what you might expect rather than the merchant noticing and notifying visa mc others visa mc others spot patterns of suspicious activity example 1 i do n't have any data on the relative numbers of who is being notified notifying between merchants and payment processors but at the point when your card is identified as compromised there 's no reason to suppose that an individual merchant in the traditional sense has been compromised let alone identified in fact because there 's a fast moving investigation it could even be a false alarm that led to your card getting cancelled conversely it could be a hugely complex multinational investigation which would be it 's simply not safe to assume that simply brand x has been compromised therefore everything brand x knows about you is also compromised furthermore there 's no reason to assume the merchant has even admitted to or discovered the root cause mc visa banks at the point at which they 're cancelling cards simply ca n't say at least not in a way that might backfire involving lots of lawyers because the standard of proof needed to go on record blaming someone is simply not yet met so yes it 's common that you are n't told anything for all of the above reasons and of course if you really want to find out more you may have some success with your local data protection legislation and formally make a subject access request or local equivalent to see what that brings back be sure to do it in writing to the official address of both mastercard and your bank

if you are disputing the size of the charge for specific services like you think that they overcharged for lab work you can try disputing it with the business office staff at the doctor 's office if on the other hand you just think that the overall bill is too expensive then you really only have one option you can ask if they will reduce the bill for you most hospitals and clinics i 've dealt with have programs set up for this but you usually access them by filling out paperwork demonstrating financial hardship along with supporting documents it never hurts to ask but with the services already rendered the only person with an interest in reducing the bill is you the reduction if any will probably depend on what the clinic thinks your ability to pay is compared with the cost to them of pursuing you for payment as well as the amount of funding they have for bill reduction when i worked in the financial services office of a hospital a $ 400 bill would not even have been reviewed for the balance would be too low to devote staff time to reviewing it 's frustrating and even asking in advance might not have given you accurate or any information on what the cost of the visit would be so your ability to shop around is limited unfortunately that does n't give you any additional options in this case

when you invest in an etf or mutual fund you 're not investing in stocks or bonds you 're buying shares of a company that invests in stocks or bonds this level of is what makes it so bond funds do not mature bonds inside of etfs or mutual funds do have a maturity date when they mature the fund manager uses the principal value that is returned to purchase another bond that meets the investment objectives of the fund so the fund never matures since it is always investing in more bonds when the old ones mature unit investment trusts made of bonds do have a maturity date as well since the portfolio does not change once the uit is issued as the individual bonds in the portfolio mature the principle value is returned to investors so the overall maturity date is effectively the maturity date of the last bond in the trust all of the statements quoted above are accurate in explaining why there is no guarantee of a return of principle when investing in bond funds etf or open ended mutual fund the bonds they hold do mature but are replaced within the fund as needed the investor will never see it happen unless they watch the holdings reports filed by the funds   the only way to have an assurance of the return of principle is to invest in individual bonds or in unit trusts made up of bonds

i do a lot of my own legal work even sued the irs and i always   i would not attempt to do this myself   i 'd run straight to a tax   but if i did attempt this myself my position is that i did a 401 k to ira rollover in good faith   such a rollover is perfectly common   etrade saw the paperwork and knew i was rolling over a 401 k and knew or reasonably should have known this rollover would be to an ira since rolling over to a cash account is a completely insane act which no one would ever do   i would gather and prepare to present every document that supports this notion in any way   i would then take a hard look at my documentation and see how well i can support that argument    then i would research cases in tax court to see how the courts treated situations like yours    i would not roll over the money to another ira account until i had done that    and i would move quickly   this is a hard problem and there are no pat answers   it depends a lot on the finer details   one last thing   next time you do a move like this start small   move $ 2000 over my real skill is swallowing my pride and knowing when i 'm wrong   i settle those and only fight the guaranteed winners   this is not the usual se of hire a professional   i almost never do but i would here   it 's an arcane area   also acting on a professional 's advice is a get out of jail free card regarding penalties or

i think in these types of situations where your knowledge is limited concerning the workings of the firms the only thing you can do is explain why you want to be a quant discuss your love of math the challenges thrill of figuring out markets the future of trading etc quant firms are full of really smart people looking for intellectual challenges and the money is just the cherry on top while i do n't work in finance just reading about firms like renaissance staffed with ex and professors it seems reasonable to assume the above
