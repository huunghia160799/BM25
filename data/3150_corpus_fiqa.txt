primerica 's primary value proposition is that switching from whole or universal life to term life and investing the difference is a good idea for most people however there are a number of other important factors to consider when purchasing life insurance and i would also be wary of anyone claiming that one product will be the best for you under all circumstances best insurance without getting into a much larger discussion on how to pick insurance companies or products here are a few things that concern me about primerica they have a captive sales force meaning their agents sell only primerica products this means that they are not shopping around for the best deal for you given how much prices on term life have changed in recent years i would highly recommend taking the time to get alternate quotes online or from an independent broker who will shop around for you their staff are primarily part time employees i am not saying they are incompetent or do n't care just that you are more likely to be working with someone for whom insurance is not their primary line of work if you have substantial reason to believe that you may someday need whole life their products may not suit you well primerica does not offer whole life as far as i am aware which also means that you can not convert your term life policy through them to whole life should you need to do so for example if you experience an accident are disabled or have a significant change in your health status in the future and do not have access to a group life policy you may be unable to renew your individual policy above average returns i am also highly skeptical about this claim the only possible context in which i could find this valid would be if they mean that your returns on average will be better if you invest in the stock market directly as compared to the returns you would get from the cash value portion of a life insurance product such as universal life as those types of products generally have very high fees can you clarify if this is the claim that was made or if they are promising returns above those of the general stock market if it is the latter run only a handful of superstar investors think warren buffet peter lynch and bill gross have ever consistently outperformed the stock market as a whole and typically only for a limited period of time in either case i would have the same concerns here as stated in reasons 1 and 2 above even more so than with insurance if you need investment advice i 'd recommend working with someone who is fully dedicated to that type of work such as a fee only financial planner is a good place to find one once you know how you want to invest i would again recommend shopping around for a reputable but inexpensive broker and compare their fees with primerica 's kudos on having a healthy level of skepticism and listening to your gut also remember that if you are not interested in their offer you do n't have to prove them wrong you can simply say no thank you best of luck

probably not though there are a few things to be said for understanding what you are doing here   primerica acts as an independent financial services firm and thus has various partners that specialize in various financial instruments and thus there may exist other firms that primerica does n't use that could offer better products   now how much do you want to value your time as it could take more than a few months to go through every possible insurance firm and broker to see what rate you could get for the specific insurance you want   there is also the question of what constitutes best here   is it paying the minimal premiums before getting a payout   that would be my interpretation though this requires some amazing guesswork to know when to start paying a policy to pay out so quickly that the insurance company takes a major loss on the policy similarly there are thousands of mutual funds out there and it is incredibly difficult to determine which ones would be best for your situation   how much risk do you want to take   how often do you plan to add to it   what kind of accounts are you using for these investments e.g. iras or just regular taxable accounts   do tax implications of the investments matter thus i 'd likely want to suggest you consider this question how much trust do you have that this company will work well for you in handling the duty of managing your investments and insurance needs   if you trust them then buy what they suggest   if you do n't then buy somewhere else but be careful about what kind of price are you prepared to pay to find the mythical best as those usually only become clear in hindsight when it comes to trusting a company in case there are more than a few factors i 'd likely use questions how well do they answer your questions or concerns from your perspective   do you feel that these are being treated with respect or do you get the feeling they want to say what the heck are you thinking for asking that in a kind of perspective structure of meeting do you like to have an agenda and things all planned out or are you more of the we 'll figure it out kind of person   this is about how well do they know you and set things up to suit you well tone of talk do you feel valued in having these conversations and working through various exercises with the representative   this is kind of like 1 though it would include requests they have for you employee turnover how long has this person been with primerica   do they generally lose people frequently   are you ok with your file being passed around like a hot potato   not that it necessarily will but just consider the possibility here reputation can be a factor though i 'd not really use it much as some people can find those bad apples that are n't there anymore and so it is n't an issue now   in some ways you are interviewing them as much as they are interviewing you   there are more than a few companies that want to get a piece of what you 'll invest buy and use when it comes to financial products so it may be a good idea to shop around a little

i was a primerica representative left to be on my own and then returned insurance is one matter that depends on the individual some do not need it   for example when i was an independent agent with an independent marketing organization imo oh yes multi level is everywhere do nt kid yourself i had an as well we were pushed to sell final expense burial insurance   as an ethical agent i believe this is a bad business practice   primerica does not sell unneeded insurance to old people how can you justify selling the elderly insurance to cover them for $ 10,000 at almost 100 to 150 a month i told my elderly potential clients after seeing they live on a tight budget   that they were better off purchasing a policy or funeral package than burial insurances as it would save them money in the long run primerica is right in saying they are the only ones out there catering to the working class and middle america where else can you start an individual retirement account ira with $ 25 a month   nowhere all the other insurance producers want more money they do n't want to spend their time with what they call losers   i love showing poor people how the rich get richer   poor people should know the truth

never carry a balance on a credit card there is almost always a cheaper way to borrow money the exception to that rule is when you are offered a 0 promotion on a credit card but even then watch out for cash advance fees and how payments are applied typically to promotional balances first paying interest on daily spending is a bad idea generally the only time you should pay interest is on a home loan car loan or education loan   basically that 's because those loans can either allow you to reduce an expense e.g. apartment rent taxi fair or increase your income by getting a better job you can try to make an argument about the utility of a dollar but all aside you are better off investing than borrowing under normal circumstances that said using a credit card with no annual fee can build credit for a future car or home loan the biggest advantage of a credit card is cash back if you have good credit you can get a credit card that offers at least 1 cash back on every purchase   if you do n't have good credit using a credit card with no annual fee can be a good way to build credit until you can get approved for a 2 card e.g. citi double cash additionally technically you can get close to 10 cash back by chasing sign up bonuses however that requires applying for new cards frequently and keeping track of minimum spend etc credit cards also protect you from fraud if someone uses your debit card number you can be short on cash until your bank fixes it   but if someone uses your credit card number you can simply dispute the charge when you get the bill you do n't have to worry about how to make rent after an unexpected charge side note it is a common mis that credit card issuers only make money from cardholder interest and fees card issuers make a lot of revenue from interchange fees paid by merchants every time you use your card some issuers e.g. amex make a majority of their revenue from merchants

the segment only briefly talked about the economic aspect of this    i feel a lot of this has to do with the fact that tech companies are ip heavy as supposed to capital heavy this makes them more flexible to enter new markets it is somewhat for a non tech company to go into a market in a different vertical e.g. amazon going into movie making    also i much rather the government tackle cable utilities monopoly first as that market is already anti consumer even on price tech is still pro consumer on price just anti consumer on choice

generally you have 60 days to return funds    if you 've been away money in to a roth ira and an emergency strikes you pull out contributions sufficient to tackle the emergency while leaving at least the earnings in there   you 've never paid taxes on these earnings and the earnings will continue to grow tax free    if you 've been away money in a vanilla taxable account and an emergency strikes you pull out whatever amount to tackle the emergency   you 've been paying taxes on the earnings all along but there 's no paperwork you ca n't replace the money in the roth ira outside the 60 day limit except for some specific same year rules that you should iron out with your custodian but you also have n't lost anything   either way in the event of an emergency the funds are removed from an account but in one case you have n't been paying taxes on gains if you want to go the route of a roth ira wrapper for your emergency fund you should n't be touching the funds for small events tires for your car and the like   if your goal is to juice the tax free nature of the roth ira wrapper for as long as you can then the money for retirement if you never experienced an emergency with the understanding that you may have to gut the account in an emergency that 's fine   if you expect money to routinely come in and out of the account a roth ira is a horrible vehicle

why use spreadsheets rather than writing your forms and formulas directly in a programming because you 've got better things to do than reinvent the wheel right same answer = = = = = clarification since the point apparently was n't clear using a spreadsheet means you 're writing and organizing and maintaining the formats and formulas yourself essentially you are writing your own accounting program using the spreadsheet program as your programming language nothing wrong with that it just means you 're doing work to produce something that you could have purchased instead it 's up to you to decide how the value of your time doing that work trades off against the cost of the commercial product   for many people especially as the bookkeeping becomes more complex that is n't a good investment of their time the otherwise billable time it would take them to maintain the spreadsheet is worth more than the cost of buying an off the shelf product and the product offers features that they would n't get around to adding to their own solution add to that the question of whether people find creating and tweaking spreadsheets rewarding or annoying the right tool is always the one that lets you focus on what you actually care about unless the cost is too high to justify it most folks care about getting the accounting task done a least cost least buying a solution is least effort if the real cost including time effort is also lower that 's the direction they 're going to go i maintained my own accounts and did my taxes in spreadsheets for quite some time these days the time to do so multiplied by what my time is worth would exceed the cost of buying tools and the commercial tools are more pleasant to use less prone to accidents and offer featured that i do n't need but appreciate i still use a for one small calculation rebalancing my but 's because i odd corner case the built in tool does n't handle well not that it makes any difference but being slightly off annoyed me   your milage obviously will vary use the tool that suits your needs others will do likewise

this is largely dependent on your overall investment goals gic 's provide protection of the invested capital and a guaranteed return at the end of the term however in real terms 1.4 over 18 months results in a loss of capital in real terms this is because inflation in canada is just about at or higher than 1.4 per year in other words at best you are inflation and gaining nothing in those 18 months if their typical rate is 1.2 over 12 months you are only gaining an additional 0.2 for the additional 6 months you know as well as i do 0.2 for 6 months is abysmal if you have no use for the money in the medium to long term you should look in to an index fund that is balanced and diversified and more likely to get you a higher real return over the time period of a few years look in to if you want to preserve the capital over the short term because you might need it after the 18 months period the gic is the safer and recommended option

this depends on the particular index of course capital gains taxes occur when stock is sold for a profit this occurs less frequently in an index fund where an active manager frequently buys and sells stocks after all he wants to be active the index fund only sells stocks when the particular stock leaves the index for an index such as the s&p 500 this does not happen that often   the more specific the criteria of the index fund the more often the selling of stock and thus the need to pay capital gains taxes occurs

did you see something specific regarding a claim of money saved through of the earth hour event the maintain it is about raising awareness of climate change issues i ca n't find anything from them regarding saving money have never seen anything you could take the claims regarding drops in national level energy consumption and the decrease in use of various items devices etc etc and work out a financial savings of a sort ie add together energy not used x average kilowatt cost fuel saved through non use of vehicles x average price per etc etc and so on but it would be wild wild guesses littered with assumptions i seriously doubt you could work up a credible figure which is why i do n't think the make claims regarding money please correct me if you saw something from them that stated otherwise they tend to stick to the awareness mantra regarding your second question i think you 'll find there is some consensus that large scale downturns followed by large scale in electricity consumption is not environmentally friendly the telegraph is a good read on this to be honest the telegraph 's article is a good summary of the entire concept of earth day

i understand that itm have little time value so they will have small time but why otm has a lesser theta than atm the time value represents uncertainty   that uncertainty decreases the farther away from atm you get in either direction   at the money there is roughly a 50 chance that the option expires worthless as you get deeper in the money the change that is expires worthless decreases so there is less uncertainty there is more certainty that the option will pay off   as you go deeper otm the probability that the option expires worthless increases so there is also less uncertainty at the ttm decreases the uncertainty theta decreases as well since there is less time for the option to cross the strike from either direction   similarly as volatility decreases theta decreases since low volatility stocks have a less change of crossing the strike

no a jump in market capitalization does not equal the amount that has been invested   market cap is simply the stock price times the total number of shares this represents a theoretical value of the company i say theoretical because the company might not be able to be sold for that at all   the quoted stock price is simply what the last buyer and seller of stock agreed upon for the price of their trade they really only represent themselves other investors may decide that the stock is worth more or less than that   the stock price can move on very little volume in this case amazon had released a very good earnings report after the bell yesterday and the price jumped in after hours trading the stock price is up but that simply means that the few shares traded overnight sold for much higher than the closing price yesterday   after the market opens today and many more shares are traded we 'll get a better idea what large numbers of investors feel about the price but no matter what the price does the change in market cap does not equal the amount of new money being invested in the company market cap is the price of the most recent trades extrapolated out across all the shares

note i am making a usa assumption here keep in mind this answer does n't necessarily apply to all countries or even states in the usa   you asked two questions i 'm looking to buy a property i do not want to take a risk on this    property its sole purpose is to provide me with a place to live how    would i go about hedging against increasing interest rates to counter    the increasing mortgage costs to counter increasing interest rates obtaining a fixed interest rate on a mortgage is the answer if that 's available   as far as costs for a mortgage that depends as mortgages are tied to the value of the property home   if you want a place to live a piece of property and want to hedge against possible rising interest rates a fixed mortgage would work for these goals ideally i 'd like to not lose money on my property seeing as i will be    borrowing 95 of the property 's value so i 'd like to hedge against    interest rates and falling property prices in order to have a risk    neutral position on my property now we have a different issue   for instance if someone had opened a fixed mortgage on a home for $ 500,000 and the housing value plummeted 50 or more the person may still have a fixed interest rate protecting the person from higher rates but that does n't protect the property value   in addition to that if the person needed to move for a job that person would face a difficult choice move and sell at a loss or move and rent and face some complications renting is generally a good idea for people who 1 have not determined if they 'll be in an area for more than 5 10 years 2 want the flexibility to move if their living costs rises which may be an issue if they lose wages 3 do n't want to pay property taxes varies by state homeowner 's insurance or maintenance costs 4 enjoy regular negotiation something which renters can do before re signing a lease or looking for a new place to live   again other conditions can apply to people who favor renting such as someone might enjoy living in one room out of a house rather than a full apartment or a person who likes a change of scenes and moves from one apartment to another for a fresh perspective but these are smaller exceptions but with renting you have nothing to re sell and no financial asset so far as a property is concerned thus why some real estate agents refer to it as throwing away money which is n't necessarily true but one should be aware that the money they invest in renting does n't go into an asset that can be re sold

there are two parts to this firstly if you are also living in the property you have bought then you should not consider it to be an investment you need it to provide shelter and the market value is irrelevant unless until you decide to move of course if your move is forced at a time not of your choosing then if the market value has dropped you might lose out no one can accurately predict the housing market any more than they can predict interest rates on normal savings accounts the movement of the stock market etc   secondly if you just have a lump sum and you want to invest it safely the bank is one of the safest places to keep it it is protected underwritten by eu law assuming you are in the eu up to € 100,000 see for example here which is about the uk and brexit in particular but mentions the eu blanket protection the other things you could do with it buy property gold art works stocks and shares whatever thing you think will be least likely to lose value over time would not be protected in the same way

there 's two competing forces at work and they are at work worldwide banks can get money from several sources through inter bank borrowing and from raising capital capital can come from from selling assets stock offerings deposits etc the money the banks get from depositors is capital in the united states the federal reserve regulates the amount of capital that banks must maintain if there was no requirement for capital then there would   be zero demand for capital at an interest rate above the inter bank offering rate as capital requirements have risen banks are allowed to make less loans given a certain amount of capital that has caused an increased demand for capital from depositors as described in this federal reserve ruling effective january 1st 2014 the federal reserve is again raising capital requirements as you can see here money can be borrowed in the united states at 100 currently interest rates paid to borrowers are quite high compared to prevailing inter bank rates they could see more upward pressure given the fact that banks will be forced to maintain an increased amount of capital for a given amount of loans

in answer to your last formulation no in a perfectly efficient market different investors still have different risk tolerances or utility functions they 're maximizing expected utility not expected value   the portfolios that maximize expected utility for different risk preferences are different and thus generally have different expected values look up mean variance utility for a simple ish example   suppose you have log utility for money = and your choice is to invest all of your money in either the risk free bond or in the risky bond in the risky bond you have a positive probability of losing everything achieving utility = your expected utility after purchase of the risky bond is   +   since your expected utility is also negative infinity and you would never make this investment instead you would purchase the risk free bond   but another person might have linear utility = x and he would be indifferent between the risk free and risky bonds at the prices you mention above and might therefore purchase some in fact you probably would have bid up the price of the risk free bond so that the other investor strictly prefers the risky one so two different investors portfolios will have different expected returns in general because of their different risk preferences risk averse investors get lower expected value this should be very intuitive from portfolio theory in general stocks have higher expected returns but more variance risk tolerant people can accept more stocks and more variance risk averse people purchase less stocks and more bonds the more general question about risk premia requires an equilibrium price analysis which requires assumptions about the distribution of risk preferences among other things maybe john cochrane 's book would help with that i do n't know anything about financial economics i would think that in the setup above if you have positive quantities of these two investor types the risk free bond will become more expensive so that the risky one offers a higher expected return this is the general thing that happens in portfolio theory anyway i 'm not a financial economist or anything   here 's a standard introduction to expected utility theory

netting means to combine cash inflows and outflows e.g. debits credits payments receipts income expense by subtracting the sum of all outflows from the sum of all inflows creating one transaction    for example if you make two trades in one day with your broker one to buy a security for $ 100 and one to sell it for $ 110 rather then you sending your broker $ 100 and them sending you $ 110 the transactions are netted meaning they will send you the net amount of $ 10 $ 110 inflow $ 100 outflow in a more general sense netting of instructions it would mean to combine all instructions and only apply the net effect e.g. one step forward two steps back would combine to a net one step back   most likely it will apply to the exchange of money but it could be applied more broadly note that there does n't have to be both inflows and outflows you can also net multiple inflows or outflows into one transaction by just adding them all up but typical business usage is to reduce the number of transactions by combining inflows and outflows

edit after reading one of the comments on the original question i realized that there is a much more intuitive way to think about this if you look at it as a standard pv calculation and hold each of the cashflows constant really what 's happening is that because of inflation the discount rate is n't the full value of the interest rate really the discount rate is only the portion of the interest rate above the inflation rate hence in the standard perpetuity pv equation pv = a r r becomes the interest rate less the inflation rate which gives you pv = a i g that seems like a much better way to get to the answer than all the machinations i was originally trying original answer i think i finally figured this out the general term for this type of system in which the payments increase over time is a gradient series annuity in this specific example since the payment is increasing by a percentage each period not a constant rate this would be considered a geometric gradient series according to this link the formula for the present value of a geometric gradient series of payments is where p is the present value of this series of cashflows    is the initial payment for period 1 i.e. the amount you want to withdraw adjusted for inflation    g is the gradient or growth rate of the periodic payment in this case this is the inflation rate    i is the interest rate    n is the number of payments this is almost exactly what i was looking for in my original question the only problem is this is for a fixed amount of time i.e. n periods in order to figure out the formula for a perpetuity we need to find the limit of the right side of this equation as the number of periods n approaches infinity luckily in this equation n is already well isolated to a single term 1 + + and since we know that the interest rate i has to be greater than the inflation rate g the limit of that factor is 0 so after replacing that term with 0 our equation simplifies to the following note i do n't do this stuff for a living and honestly do n't have a fantastic finance iq it 's been a while since i 've done any calculus or even this much algebra so i may have made an error in the math

it depends where you are going to live and how you are going to pay for your new accommodation if you are moving within the uk and intend to buy another house you run into the problem that you will find it hard to get a second mortgage if you rent out the house in kent you will probably have to change the mortgage basis on it to a mortgage that allows for letting normal residential mortgages exclude that entirely which would allow you to take out a residential mortgage it depends how much equity you have in the house if most of the value of the house is mortgaged then you 'll 1 find it hard to re mortgage on a commercial mortgage 2 may find it hard to cover the costs by letting and 3 are very sensitive to house prices falling also bear in mind that for the past three months in a row house prices in the uk have mostly either stagnated or fallen so you can not guarantee any increase in value of the house in kent what i 'm saying is there is no crystal ball that will tell you what 's financially the best thing to do talk to estate agents find out how much the house would sell for how much it would rent for talk to your mortgage lender and find out if they will let you rent it out talk to other mortgage lenders and find out how much a commercial mortgage would cost do the sums find out if renting the house would cover the costs in which case you can gamble on the housing market continuing to rise do n't rely on house prices continuing to rise as they have done before certainly where i live due to the number of new houses being built and other economic issues house prices have fallen over the past few months and may well continue to fall as more and more new houses come on the market

here 's how the police currently operate   you are forced to fund them with your tax money but if they fail to protect you or your property you get nothing in return if you pay a home owner 's insurance company and you get robbed or your house burns down they fully reimburse you what exactly are we getting for our police dollars they come after the crime and then put the criminal in jail at our we lose both ways it 's pretty clear that insurance is preferable to police and that insurance companies should expand their operations to include active security personnel to patrol their insured properties and people while the government 's police force should be and give us that portion of our taxes back   i just want to get more people realizing what a con job government 's monopoly services are in terms of what we get for our money every where the government services interface with us they involve forcing us to stop in some capacity their transportation vehicles stop in the middle of the roads school buses and city buses and their solution to are pathetic in comparison to which do n't leave half the cars stopped at any given time they spend $ 4 6 trillion in wars against desert morons because the other branch of govt which was supposed to round up immigrants who their visas failed we pay for their failure we 've been forced to pay over $ 16 trillion over 50 years for welfare checks to people who are more likely stupid than intrinsically needy i.e. poor due to circumstances rather than basic stupidity $ 16,000 billion we could have had to fund on the things we want more of such as space research roads better technology

imho the best scenario where greece does not leave the euro in this scenario there is probably no risk because either the ecb will print more money or other countries will help greece in some way the average scenario where greece leaves the euro all bank accounts will be frozen and slowly turned into new drachma and your poor money after the conversion will be worth 50 k euro at best but probably much less there is also the worst scenario the bank defaults too and you will lose everything italy has a fund to protect deposits up to 100 k euro i do n't know if you have something similar in greece however a similar fund in greece would be guaranteed by greek banks and the greek government so you might not get much back regardless

i know some companies or entities have large incomes or expenses at certain times of the year and like to close their books after these large events   for example where i work   the primary seasonal income comes after summer so our fiscal year ends at the last days of october   this gives the accountants enough time to collect all the funds reconcile whatever they have to pay off whatever they have to and get working on a budget for the next year sooner than a calendar year would there also might be tax reasons   to get all of your income at the beginning of your fiscal year even if that is in the middle of the calendar year would allow a company to plan large deductible investments with more certainty   i am not to sure of the tax reasons

credit card limits are for the most part soft limits sometimes a credit card will allow you to charge a little over your limit the large amount they allowed you to go over your limit is unusual but not unheard of   it is your responsibility to keep track of how much you charge on your credit card not the bank just like with a checking account you are supposed to keep track of everything you charge so that you always know how much you have spent and can pay it off   raising your limit will not help your problem it would only make it worse you have already charged more than you can afford and they have already effectively raised your limit by $ 1200   i realize that this situation is tough but fortunately you have a learning opportunity here i recommend you resolve to stop using the credit card in this way and work toward paying off your debt to zero at that point treat your credit card as if it was a debit card and only charge what you already have in the bank to pay off right away or just use a debit card and get rid of the credit card learning to do this now will save you lots of money in interest   if you do n't learn to do this you will find yourself in even more debt in the future and it will be even harder to dig yourself out   if you need some more help on getting out of debt and learning to budget your money i recommend the book the total money makeover by dave ramsey

here 's a reality check they likely cost on the order of a few million yr which is small potatoes compared to what taibbi makes it sound like they got caught and are going to jail   since taibbi at every turn and demonstrably so i do not trust his reporting the bid were charged with dozens of bids from 1999 to 2006 know how many bids were performed in that time i challenge you to find out i bet there was more than dozens issued over that 7 year period in fact since there appear to be in new bonds issues a year and the one mentioned in the story was for 300 m if that is representative of the sizes then there are over 1,000 issued a year for 7000 or so over that period they corrupted dozens oh the humanity   feel free to correct any of these numbers as you see fit   reading the actual pdf from the charges one finds that the fraud was no where near as egregious as the taibbi story makes it out to be   cases is the indictment and here is the press release financial bid rigging article reporting on the trial with no where near the that taibbi lives for an article that actually reports facts from the case and makes no press former financial services executives convicted for roles in involving investment contracts for the proceeds of municipal bonds fbi press release not a single one of these sources that actually had something to do with the investigation trial and conviction includes anything near what taibbi writes   in fact other than taibbi 's story and those reporting on it it appears this is not all the big banks in cahoots to defraud poor bond markets but a few bad apples that got caught and are getting appropriate punishment   let me ask you how much money did they take the total market appears to be in new sales some of the charges included something like changing a instrument to a 5 instrument for an item in a 300 million dollar range if they the entire difference which is not likely since there were bid rigging which returns far less the the difference in the rigged bid that comes to 120k yr for one of dozens taibbi himself writes they may have made up to yr on that one massive if all were like that then dozens is approximately 48 yr = 4 million a year the biggest number for stolen money in any of the actual court documents i have seen ranges in the 50 100 k range    please provide better evidence from actual court documents and not taibbi style hearsay until then i provided you a reality check

unfortunately there is very little data supporting fundamental analysis or technical analysis as appropriate tools to time the market i will be so bold to say that technical analysis is meaningless on the other hand fundamental analysis has some merits for example the realization that cdos were filled with toxic mortgages can be considered a product of fundamental analysis and hence provided traders with a directional assumption to buy cdss however there is no way to tell when there is a good or bad time to buy or sell the market behaves like a random 50/50 motion there are many reasons for this and interestingly there are many fundamentally sound companies that take large dips for no reason at all depending on your goal you can either believe that this volatility will smooth over long periods and that the market has generally positive drift on the other hand i feel that the appropriate approach is to remain active you will be able to mitigate the large downswings by simply staying small and diversifying   not in the sense of traditional finance but rather looking for uncorrelated products remember volatility brings higher levels of correlation my second suggestion is to look towards products like options to provide a method of shaping your p l giving up upside by selling calls against a long equity position is a great example ground your trades with fundamental beliefs if need be but use your tools and knowledge to combat risks that may create long periods of drawdown

sure yahoo finance makes mistakes from time to time   that 's the nature of free data however i think the issue here is that yahoo is aggregating several line items into one   like maybe reporting cash equivalents plus total investment securities minus loans as cash equivalents   this aggregation is done by a computer program somewhere and may or may not be appropriate for a particular purpose and firm for this reason if you are trying to do top quality research it 's always better to go to the original sec filings if you can   then you will know for sure which items you are looking at   the only mistakes will be the ones made by the accountants at the firm in question if there 's a reason you prefer to use yahoo like if it 's easier for your code to scrape then spend a little time comparing to the sec filing to ensure you know where the numbers really come from before using it

yes you can indeed become rich by investing even small amounts over time let 's say that you begin with nothing invested and you start investing $ 100 per week suppose you choose to put your money in an s&p 500 index mutual fund the cagr compound annual growth rate of the s&p 500 over the last 35 years has been about 11 that 35 years includes at least two fairly serious crashes you may get more or less than that number in the future but let 's guess that you 'll average 9 35 years from now you would be a millionaire $ 1.2 million actually this math works out for anyone no matter who your parents are where you are from where you went to school etc yes you have a better chance of becoming wealthy the more you invest the longer you have to stay invested and the better choices you make in your investments   by starting early you will maximize your time invested which allows you the flexibility to be more conservative in your investments and to invest smaller amounts   but for those with a shorter time to invest it is still doable for most people   get your financial life under control by eliminating your debt setting a household budget and investing for the future

ponder this suppose that a reputable company or government were to come out and say hey we are going to issue some 10 year bonds at 6.4 anyone interested in buying some assume that the company or government is financially solid and there is zero chance that they will go bankrupt think those bonds would sell would you be interested in buying such a bond well i would wager that these bonds would sell like despite the fact that the long term stock market return beats it by a half percent heck vanguard 's junk bond fund is hot right now it only yields 4.9 and those are junk bonds not rock solid companies see vanguard high yield corporate bond fund every time you make an extra principal payment on your student loan you are effectively purchasing a investment with a rock solid guaranteed 6.4 return for 10 years or whatever time you have left on the loan if make no extra payments on top of that paying off a loan early builds your credit reputation improves your monthly cash flow once the loan is paid may increase your purchasing power for a house or car and if nothing else it frees you from being a slave to that debt payment every month   edit improved wording based on ross 's comment

i would be very careful with annuity products if you do n't mind sharing what are the terms for the annuity   usually i would recommend not to use retirement account to pay off debt mainly because of the penalty that comes from withdrawing prematurely but in this case first of all stop contributing to the annuity account if you 're not contractually obligated second try to convert your annuity assets to more common equity debt products thirdly try to cut back on spending to pay off debt assuming you stopped paying 2x on housing since 30k debt should n't be that hard to pay off with 100k income lastly if all of the above are impossible you can withdraw from that account to pay off your debt

from a budgeting perspective the emergency fund is a category in which you 've budgeted funds for the unexpected   these are things that were n't able to be predicted and budgeted for in advance or things that exceeded the expected costs   for example you might budget $ 150 per month for car maintenance and typically spend some of it while the rest builds up over time for unexpected repairs so you have a few hundred available for that   but this month your transmission died and you have a $ 3,000 bill you 'll then fund most of this out of your emergency fund   this does n't cover where to store that money though which leads me to my next point   emergencies are emergencies because they come without warning without you having a chance to plan the primary things you want in an emergency fund account are stability and quick access   you can structure investments to be whatever you think of as safe or stable but you do n't want to be thinking about whether it 's a good time to sell when you need the money right now   but the bigger problem is access when you need the funds on a weekend holiday anytime outside of market hours you 're not going to be able to just sell some stocks and go to an atm this is the reason why it 's recommended to have these funds in a checking or savings account usually the reason i mentioned the budgeting side first is because i wanted to point out that if you 're budgeting well most of the unexpected expenses you have should have been expected in a sense you can still plan for something without knowing when or if it will happen   so in the example of a car repair ideally you 're already budgeting for possible repairs if you own a home you 're budgeting for things that would go wrong budgeting for speeding tickets for surprise out of pocket medical costs etc these then become part of your normal budget they are n't part of the emergency fund anymore   the bright side about budgeting for something unexpected is that you know what that money is for and do you likely also know how quickly you 'll need it for example you know if you have unexpected medical costs that happen very quickly you 're not likely you need a bag of cash on a moment 's notice   so those last two points lead to the fact that your actual emergency fund the dollars that are for things you simply could not foresee will be relatively small a few thousand dollars or so in most cases if you 've got things structured like this you 'll be happy to have a few grand available at a moment 's notice   the bulk of the money you would use for other surprise expenses or things like 6 months of living expenses is represented in other specific categories and you already know the timeframe in which you need it probably enough time that it could be invested risk to taste in short by expecting the unexpected you can sidestep this issue and not worry so much about missed returns on the emergency fund

as you point out the main benefits of a pension retirement account over a traditional cash taxable account are the legal and tax benefits   most western countries establish a specific legal definition for an account which is often taxed less or not at all relative to taxable accounts and which contains some protection for the owner in case of a bankruptcy   the typical drawbacks for investing within such structures are limited investment choice limited withdrawal rights either in terms of age or rate of withdrawal and maximum contributions   the benefits are usually very clear and your decision whether or not to open a pension retirement account should depend on a careful weighing of the benefits and drawbacks as to whether you may end up with less than you started that depends on what you invest in   as with all of finance you must take more risk to get more return   although the choices inside a pension retirement account may be worded somewhat differently they are usually fundamentally no different than some of the most popular investments available for ordinary taxable accounts

lost checks happen occasionally and there are procedures in place banking business to handle the situation   first and foremost you need to note the money is legally yours so the company is obligated to work with you here   if they refuse to cancel or reissue the check at a minimum you 'll want to contact the state government and let them know about the company 's actions if small claims court is not an option   businesses are n't permitted to keep forfeited funds in most states instead they are required to turn them over to the government who would then return them to you when you ask for it   it 's rather scummy of the government bureaucrats because it puts them in the sole position to benefit from forgotten money but that 's the system we 've given ourselves since you 've moved overseas since the last time you worked with this company you might need to exercise a little patience and be willing to jump through some hoops to get this resolved   be prepared to provide them proof of who you are and be ready to pay for extra security such as certified mail fedex so that you 're both sure that the new check is delivered to you and only you last of all learn from your mistake this time and be a little more cautious proactive in keeping track of checks and depositing them in the future

as an easy and rough rule of thumb a job for $ 55,000 per year is $ 55 per hour as a contractor that 's roughly twice the hourly rate   in return the company gets the rate to vary your hours or cease your employment with less financial legal or managerial overhead than a full time employee   you have less stability less benefits perhaps need to put some time into finding another job sooner of course the ultimate though less helpful answer is whatever the market will bear

you should get a 1099-misc for the $ 5000 you got   and your broker should send you a 1099-b for the $ 5500 sale of google stock these are two totally separate things as far as the us irs is concerned 1 you made $ 5000 in wages you will pay income tax on this as well as fica and other state and local taxes 2 you will report that you paid $ 5000 for stock and sold it for $ 5500 without holding it for one year since this was short term you will pay tax on the $ 500 in income you made these numbers will go on different parts of your tax form   essentially in your case you 'll have to pay regular income tax rates on the whole $ 5500 but that 's only because short term capital gains are treated as income   there 's always the possibility that could change unlikely   it also helps to think of them separately because if you held the stock for a year you would pay different tax on that $ 500   regardless you report them in different ways on your taxes

actually the part is interesting because they actually are n't middlemen just faster buyer 's and sellers on the open market they just buy what one person is selling and sell it to someone else who is at the same time looking to buy so i guess the issue is the same time is n't the same for all parties concerned on the other hand both buyer and seller can set limits on the bounds of the price and only transact when someone meets their terms if you are willing to accept whatever the market will bear then it seems like you should be ok with getting it

there are a few different ways you can look at this   you ca n't really take money out of the economy as it ca n't leave society and the economy is the interaction of society one example kind of close to this was a multi millionaire died without an heir with millions in his bank account the bank will continue to use the funds but the money itself wo n't be spent some people saw this as a waste like value was lost but really all it does hoarding money or even burning it is change the money supply   that being said there are two approaches to looking at capitalism as a balanced ecosystem one is which focuses on demand the other is marxism which focuses on more internal mechanisms of capitalism both are concerned with inequality   with high inequality those with capital tend to have more reinvestment as a percentage of income wealth with a return on investment this will increase inequality the keynesian issue is that this will lower demand creating imbalance in the economy and long term problems to function the answer was more redistribution and higher labor wages   for marxists they believe that capitalism generates endless capital accumulation not because of a demand component but because of labor theory of value that wealth and value is not determined by the market but at exploitation of labor on this critical side you have of the of market value with high inequality you have money leaving the system in what some call waste something not socially useful and in monopoly capital talk about this in the form of things like military spending and i think advertisement but it can also relate to the generation of wealth opposed to income things that do n't hold inherent value like art becomes investment you ca n't say it is taken out of the economy but the value itself is generated by those who can purchase it though i believe this value is more an outcome of the rather than the cause   what it does contribute to however is the rise of speculation rather than consumption or productive investment accumulation will increasingly become speculative real estate is usually the primary example many people buy houses condos or land not for use but for the expectation that the value will go up when bad enough this can the market so for people who are n't investing their rent living cost increases    this likewise happens with stocks and other financial investments again it ca n't really leave the economy but it makes it more difficult for the traditional or productive and labor economy to operate

all good points you 're right about my concern though i like to think of it as that rather than fear but that 's immaterial   i get the destructive destruction   externalities exist and should be honestly assessed but then the externalities of the interventions should also be considered such as an incentive to automate or other potentially more destructive technologies as you mentioned   i do n't think it 's unreasonable to think that ill considered regulation can create a feedback loop of interventions and responses that can severely distort a market   i wish public choice theory had a little more traction than it seems to not as a solution but as a framework for analysis   i suppose my perspective on regulation meant to level the playing field should do just that focus on the field not the score   i do n't think anyone has enough understanding to be able to say what the score should be only what they prefer it to be and i think you might appreciate the fallacy of that line of thinking   that 's an interesting example indeed   i can see the motivation from the company but what 's the burden on the municipal government   have they taken it upon themselves to collect these bikes from inappropriate places or something or is it just a general quality of life issue involving bikes obstructing movement   sounds like a classic tragedy of the commons but a lot less disruptive than others i know of    i 'll share one that you can go down the rabbit hole on if that sort of thing interests you   essentially there is a bay on the coast of mexico where there is a town called   due to some hurricane damage some time ago sea grass has been growing there and it has attracted green turtles to an area that one can simply walk into and swim with the turtles   now i 'm sure i do n't need to describe the various effects of of that situation and that 's exactly what 's happening   the problem is that the first 20 meters of is part of the commons so no privatization can be used to restrict access   add the conflicting interests of tourists tour providers hotels and the various levels of government all within the context of mexican politics and you can imagine the mess its created

your employer pays the expected but estimated taxes for you so the chances are you do n't own more but that might be different if you have other sources of income that he does n't know about interest on savings or a side job or whatever also you could have deductions that reduce the taxes you owe which he again does n't know so you overpay if you do n't file you do n't get them back most tax software companies offer free usage of their tool for standard filings and you can use it to find out your tax situation and then buy the tool only when you want to file if you use one of those you can type in all your data and depending on the result decide to buy it and file right away note that if it turns out you owe taxes you must file and pay but of course you can do it manually instead of buying the tool if it turns out you get money back it is your decision to file you probably do n't care for a small amount but if you get 1000 $ back you might want to file again buying the software of doing it manually

there are a couple of reasons to diversify your assets first since we can not predict which of our investments will perform best we want to cast our net broadly enough to have something invested in what 's going to be performing well second diversification is n't intended to provide the highest returns but rather it is used to soften the effects of market volatility by the downsides and lowering the overall volatility among our assets returns are more consistent   if a model does not address future downside risk it is only telling you part of the story past performance does not guarantee you get the picture

it sounds like you are describing seller financed mortgages also sometimes called self financed where self is the seller   in essence the buyer and seller enter into a legal contract a promissory note that specifies the payment schedule interest rate etc   the nature of the agreement is similar to the kind of mortgage agreement you 'd get from the bank but no bank is involved it 's just an directly between the buyer and seller if you search for seller financed mortgage or self financed mortgage you can find a good deal more info about this kind of arrangement   here is a useful article from investopedia here is one from forbes and here is one from nolo broadly speaking the advantages and disadvantages of seller financing are two sides of the same coin by doing the agreement yourself without bank involvement you can cut out procedural red tape delays and requirements that a bank might insist on but in so doing you may expose yourself to risks that those procedures are designed to shield you from   most obviously as the seller you receive only the down payment up front not the entire purchase price as you would if the buyer got a bank loan and if the buyer does n't follow through on the agreement you 're on your own as far as starting foreclosure etc you can read up on some of the linked pages for more details about the pros and cons   in general as those pages note seller financed mortgages are relatively rare   a home is a big purchase and if you do n't know what you 're doing it 's easy to screw up in a way that could cost you a large amount of money if things go wrong

question is what do we need to do as far as the irs is concerned i    mean we 'll get the money from them and pay it back less than two    months later you 're probably worried about the gift tax since you 're a couple the maximum exclusion amount is calculated like this the reason the pg multiplier stands separate is that gift splitting does require form 709 filed even if no tax is due unless they actually write separate checks for their respective portions so the math shows that you and your wife can get at least $ 28 k from anyone without the need of gift tax to be paid or gift tax return to be filed you can get up to $ 56 k from your parents but the gift splitting may need to be documented on form 709 since you 're in fact talking about a loan you 're going to repay you 'll need to document it with a note and everything and document the repayment if interest is being paid your parents must declare it on their tax return for the year obviously in this case if the loan is properly documented repaid and the interest is declared the irs wo n't even bother claiming it was a gift even if there 's no real interest it should n't be an issue the irs might assign some deemed interest at their rates that would be considered a gift but assuming no other gift transactions between you exist for the year the amount would be miniscule and way below the $ 14 k exclusion level of course as with any tax concern you get here what you paid for for a proper advice talk to a tax adviser ea cpa licensed in your state

when you buy shares you are literally buying a share of the company   you become a part owner of it companies are not required to pay dividends in any given year   it 's up to them to decide each year how much to pay out the value of the shares goes up and down depending on how much the markets consider the company is worth   if the company is successful the price of the shares goes up   if it 's unsuccessful the price goes down   you have no control over that   if the company fails completely and goes bankrupt then the shares are worthless dilution is where the company decides to sell more shares   if they are being sold at market value then you have n't really lost anything   but if they are sold below cost perhaps as an incentive to certain staff then the value of the company per share is now less   so your shares may be worth a bit less than they were   you would get to vote at the agm on such schemes   but unless you own a significant proportion of the shares in the company your vote will probably make no difference in practice you ca n't protect yourself   buying shares is a gamble   all you can do is decide what to gamble on

it does n't make much difference in the end imagine you have $ 100 of revenue in your company you can either pay it to yourself as salary meaning that you do n't pay corporate tax on it or you can keep it in the company pay corporate tax on it then pay yourself a dividend of what is left while that dividend will be treated better than salary remember that the company already paid tax on it you paying less on what 's left does n't equate to paying less overall go ahead and run the numbers using your actual corporate tax rate and your personal income tax rate try doing your whole salary as dividends not dollar for dollar but as how much the company would have as profit to give you a dividend if it did n't spend and deduct salary money on you you are unlikely to see any difference at all the net final money in your pocket and the amount that went to the government will probably be the same if paying dividends keeps your earned income low you may find that you ca n't use rrsp or childcare deductions you are also not getting cpp credit that 's an argument for salary or at least a certain minimum amount of salary you have to deduct taxes at source on salary and send it along to the government which is an argument for dividends if you feel you could invest that money and use it well before the taxes get around to being due possibly you may discover an edge case where you move a few thousand from one marginal tax rate to another and clear a few hundred extra as a result i do n't discourage you from doing the math i just point out that the various percentages tax rates deductions etc have all been carefully chosen so that it pretty much works out the same or gives a small preference to salary we give excess money to ourselves as bonus rather than dividend having run the numbers a few times there 's no secret trick here

i am also confused by what he says the djia has not been at 900 for decades however a $ 36 dividend is 4 per unit if you get $ 9 per unit per quarter 2/3 of 4 is that is inside his 7.5 to 5.5 how much you have in dividend paying stocks vs. bonds most often is a function of your age for example i have heard the advice of subtracting your age in years from 110 and that would be the percent you hold in dividend paying stocks at age 30 you would have 80 in stocks at age 60 you would be 50 in stocks there are retirement funds that do this for you   but the bottom line all depends on your risk tolerance i have a large tolerance for risk so even though i am currently retired i only have 10 of my money in a safe investment ticker = pgf it pays 5.5 per year   the rest is in a leveraged junk bond fund that pays 15.5 per year

dan there are other choices what rate do you have on this mortgage and what is the value of the home with a bit of patience and effort you may be able to lower your rate and save some portion of that $ 100k you think you can grab   there is no factual answer here the negative will show for 7 years and only you can determine whether that 's worth it if in that time the value comes back you may very well be in a worse position looking to buy a new home that 's now well above where it is today it 's possible the current prices are on the downside if unemployment drops and consumer confidence returns you may be back to break even sooner than you think as an aside i find it curious that the trumps of this world can manipulate the system creating multiple entities filing for bankruptcy yet protecting his own assets and his wealth is applauded yet asking the question here so many attack you verbally the donald has saved himself billions through his dealings i do n't judge you for asking this question when it comes to $ 100k when trump 's net worth was negative he should have had his property taken away and been handed a

rob i 'm sorry your first visit here has been unpleasant   what you are asking for is beyond the capability of most software if you look at you find the standard deduction for married filing joint is $ in 2012 and $ in 2013 i offer this anecdote to share a deduction story the first year i did my mil 's taxes i had to explain that she did n't    have enough deductions to itemize every year since she hands me a    file full of paper medical deductions that do n't exceed    7.5 of her income in turn i give her two folders back one with the 5 or so documents i needed and the rest labeled trash fewer than 30 of filers itemize and a good portion of those that do have no question that 's the right thing to do e.g. my property tax is more than the $ 12 k so anything else i have that 's a deduction adds right to the number   it 's really just those people who are at the edge that are likely frustrated i wrote an article regarding standard deduction vs itemizing in which i describe a method of pulling in one 's deductible expenses into odd years reducing the number in even years to allow a bi annual if this is your situation you 'll find the concept interesting   you also ask about filing status think on this for a minute after pulling in our turbotax imports the data right from adp i do the same for our stock info the stock info and all schedule a deductions are n't assigned a name so any effort to split them in search of savings by using married filing separate would first require splitting these up turbotax has a what if worksheet for this function but when the marriage penalty was lifted years ago the change in status had no value items that phaseout over certain income levels are often lost to the separate filer anyway when i got married i found my real estate losses each year could not be taken they accumulated until i either sold or until our income dropped when the mrs retired   so while is respect your desire for these magic within the software i think it 's fair to say they would provide little value to most people   if this thread stays open i 'd be curious if anyone can cite an example where filing separately actually benefits the couple

october 18 2017 by john goldman sachs making too little money is not the worst of the world ’s problems but inside the investment bank ’s new york headquarters it feels like an insult   goldman is not suffering a financial crisis as it did in 2008 when it officially converted to being a bank holding company amid panic that the whole of wall street could collapse it faces something deeper an identity crisis   it used to be the role model for many rival banks even while for its single minded focus on investment banking and trading but as tuesday ’s disclosure of a 26 per cent fall in its bond trading revenues confirmed banking has changed instead of lenders such as jpmorgan chase wanting to become as glamorous as goldman it needs to be more like them   this is a telling moment albeit less dramatic than 2008 investment banking enjoyed a lucrative two decades spurred by globalisation and financial goldman ’s revenues rose from its initial public offering in 1999 to 2007 and boomed in 2009 it could do no wrong financially although it turned out to have done wrong to some of its customers   but guess what regulation works governments and central bank supervisors set out to make complex trading in bonds and derivatives the securities business in which goldman specialised more expensive and less profitable the rules now favour deposit taking and lending instead of   no one really planned the second aspect of the bank ’s difficulty the huge dose of monetary easing since the crisis has volatility and made markets more predictable hedge funds themselves under pressure no longer need to reward goldman and others for taking on financial risk   goldman ’s bond and commodities trading division from which emerged a of leaders including lloyd blankfein its chairman and chief executive tells its own story it used to occupy two floors of the new york office but has shrunk to one as wall street ’s total bond trading revenues have halved since 2009 more prices are calculated by computers than humans   when you rely heavily on one engine and that engine you are in trouble the bank ’s financial advisory and capital raising division is performing well and it has an investment management arm but it lacks a consumer powerhouse like morgan stanley ’s wealth management operation or the lending and credit card activities that drive banks such as jpmorgan   the truth for goldman is that us retail banking has become not only more reliable than investment banking but more profitable jpmorgan ’s balance sheet is three times the size of goldman ’s and its retail banking arm made a 19 per cent return on equity in the third quarter compared with goldman ’s 11 per cent   the best historical comparison for goldman ’s predicament is ironically the jpmorgan of the 1990s jpmorgan was a blue chip corporate bank but found that this business was no longer profitable enough as lending margins fell it launched an effort to return to investment banking having been separated from morgan stanley in by the glass steagall act   jpmorgan had a good stab at it compensating for the fact that goldman and others dominated wall street ’s bulge bracket by credit derivatives which later turned out badly but it could not make enough progress alone and settled for being bought by chase manhattan in 2000   both banks have struggled to keep pace with the rapid growth of the leading investment banks which are in businesses that have been far more lucrative than the lending business at the core of commercial banking the new york times noted in its account of the merger years and one financial crisis later jpmorgan has reversed this order of profitability   so goldman is now trying to do the opposite of the old jpmorgan by adding banking to investment banking jpmorgan ’s former dilemma has not gone away lending to blue chip companies is not much of a a more tempting target is the high margins that banks make on credit cards   hence marcus goldman ’s online lender named after its founder marcus goldman which offers loans to prime us consumers as an alternative to credit card debt marcus which will launch next year in the uk accounts for $ of the $ in new lending and financing planned by goldman in the next three years as it diversifies   but it is no simpler for goldman to break into main street than it was for the old jpmorgan to break back into wall street $ on a balance sheet of $ is an interesting financial experiment not a revolution it would need to inflict on consumer banking with technology what amazon did to the retail industry to rival fully jpmorgan and bank of america   we ’re a bank and we ’re committed to being a bank says one partner firmly but selling personal loans and mortgages which could be marcus ’s next target is not a job designed for masters of the universe this is goldman ’s identity crisis regulation and economics are rendering it ordinary

it depends on the type of loan   fully amortized loans have a schedule of payments do n't recalculate as you pay   if you want to make an additional payment you need to contact the lender to apply your payment toward principle and the loan   otherwise all your additional payment will do is change the amount due on your next payment or push out your next payment due date regarding interest calculation you owe interest on the principle outstanding   say you have a 10 year loan 120 months at 5 apr and a $ 1,000 payment this means you borrowed roughly $ each month the amount of interest owed reduces because there is less principle outstanding   the reason loans are amortized like this is so the borrower has a predictable known monthly amount due

it seems like you are asking two different questions one is how do i know if i can afford a house the other is how do i know what type of mortage to get the first question is fairly simple to answer there 's plenty of calculators out there that will tell you what you can afford but rule of thumb is 30 of income can goto housing now what type of mortgage to get can be much more confusing because the mortgage industry makes money off of these confusing products the best thing to do in my in situations like this is to keep it simple you need to be careful buying a house so much money is changing hands and there are so many parasites involved in the transaction i would be extremely wary of anybody who is going to tell you what mortgage to get i 've never heard of a fee only independent mortgage broker and if i found one that claimed to be i would n't believe him i would just ignore all the exotic non conforming products and just answer one simple question are you the type of person that buys an insurance policy or that likes to self insure if you like insurance get a 30 year fixed mortgage if you like to self insure get a 7 year arm the average someone owns a house is 7 years plus in 7 years time it might not adjust up and even if it does you can just accelerate your payments and pay it off quickly this is the self insurance part of it if you 're like me i 'm willing to pay an extra .5 for the 30 year so that my payment never changes and i 'm never forced to move which is extremely unlikely but i like the safety i do n't like 15 year term loans because rates are so low you can get way better returns in the stock market right now so why pay off sooner then you need to heck if i had a paid off house right now i 'd refi into a 30 year and invest the money in summary pick 30 year or arm then just shop around to find the lowest rate which is extremely easy

what you have suggested would work in spain ireland us even italy but not in greece because the last piece of the cycle of money you outlined earlier would be that greek economy would expand and the government would collect revenues   the problem is that public and private projects in greece are very expensive due to strict labor laws a good chunk of any public money would end up in bank accounts outside greece and the resultant building would be of poor quality and little use in summary the greek government would be even more debt the economy would see very little benefit no increase in tax revenue and you would end up with a useless structure   even if greece had n’t joined the euro it would either suffer from inflation or from a crisis similar to this the global economic crisis has made the situation much worse it is not the cause of the crisis at least for greece

your short term time frame makes buying used the best option but it seems you already are aware of that   look into a certified pre owned model if you are concerned about lemons you will usually get some sort of warranty   however be aware that any car can be a headache with repairs   i would not recommend a lease because basically you are still paying for the depreciation on the car plus interest generally this is the most expensive way to drive a car you may find the numbers look good for a lease but beware of the gotchas in the terms that can put you way over budget over mileage wear and tear etc   my best recommendation is to buy gently used with cash this gives you the most flexibility and best resale value if you finance a late model vehicle be aware that depreciation can leave you upside down on your loan that would put you in the position of having to shell out cash just to get rid of the car

assuming you can understand and emotionally handle the volatility a good indeed fund would be wise these are low fee funds which perform as well as our better than most managed investments and since they do n't cost as much they typically out perform most other investment vehicles the s&p 500 is traded as spdr another option is the dow jones industrial average which trades as dia average returns over the long term are 10 12 if you expect to need the money in the short term 5 8 years you have a non trivial chance of needing to pull the money out when the market is down so if that 's unacceptable to you choose something with a guarantee if you 're terrified of losing money in the short term do n't think you can handle waiting for the market to go up especially when every news is crying that the end of economic life on earth is here then consider a cd at your bank cds return much lower rates around 2 right now but do not go down in value ever however you need to lock your money into them for months to years at a time some people might tell you to buy a bond fund that 's horrible advice bond funds get lower returns and have no guarantee that you wo n't lose money on them unlike bonds as you 're new to investing i encourage you to read the intelligent investor by benjamin gramm

the best option for maximizing your money long term is to contribute to the 401(k offered by your employer if you park your inheritance in a savings account you can draw on it to augment your income while you max out your contributions to the 401(k you will get whatever the employer matches right off the bat and your gains are tax deferred in essence you will be putting your inheritance into the 401(k and forcing your employer to match at whatever rate they do so if your employer matches at 50 cents on the dollar you will turn your 50 thousand into 75 thousand

gt you 're the one arguing for a change away from the status quo here to something that not only is entirely untested but requires everyone to do it at once and everyone to think just like you do for it to work properly it 's nothing but hypotheticals yet you 're saying the burden of proof is on me to prove that your hypothetical scenarios wo n't work   i do n't have to prove anything when i 'm advocating for not being a part of your system i am in no way advocating that you be forced into mine i 'm not advocating any positive action towards you nor anyone else simply arguing against the status quo does n't place a burden of proof upon me   gt that 's not a thing you can do you ca n't prove a negative   then do n't make that claim easy as that i laid out how the market could deal with a court system and you into making unsupported claims when we get back to what does make sense we can have productive conversation it 's not productive to use baseless conjecture and unsupported claims   gt all i can do is say look around at all the free markets and populations we have now living in perfect harmony with each other and the environment oh wait they do n't exist because they do n't work in the real world   wrong it does not follow that because something does not exist that it does not work   gt any advantage is going to be used to the competition with until you have a monopoly quasi state   you have no evidence to support this why are you reverting to this nonsense   gt   it relies on the population being informed in and believing in the system enough to make a conscious effort to not buy the cheaper goods at the store with the bad business practices or potentially drive further to a different store if it 's the store doing the bad practice   no it does not this is a straw man a voluntary society does n't preclude the possibility of people buying bad food or something like that it does n't even preclude the possibility of third party assurances to prevent bad food it just does n't have a built in monopoly on assurance services that you have to use in order to buy sell   gt so you 're saying there can never be a truly free market then   no people buy and sell freely all of the time ever bought something from craigslist ebay silk road i 'd say those are pretty much free markets   gt you had little kids getting their arms ripped off by textile looms for fucks sake people working 14 hour days but it made more money than working in the fields so worth right   you 're conveniently leaving out how kids worked people all day and still starved to death as the alternative up until industrialization allowed a better quality of life it 's not like they could have just passed a fucking law and mandated a 40 hour week and instantly had prosperity it was because they did grind their way through the industrial revolution that we 're able to live lives of leisure and prosperity if you think that government action can get people out of poverty by decree then tell it to the third world countries that are still developing i 'm sure they 'd be all ears   gt because the pooling of vast resources for disaster relief is something that states do   that they do it does n't mean that it could n't happen without the state on a voluntary basis the funding for all of these programs combined is easily less than what a quarter of the government 's budget if the people who made this same objection put their money where their mouth is there would be no shortage of funding people from the left and the right alike claim that they want these things so which is it are you telling me that there are just millions and millions of people who virtue signal about humanitarian efforts   gt this is my point neither you nor i have any evidence to base this off rather than a tendency for people to be utter bastards to each other looking at history you 're that if all governments in a puff of smoke there would n't be huge conflict in the resulting power vacuum   actually i do n't think that immediately destroying governments will create the best outcomes as that usually happens violently and results in someone wanting to fill the roles performed by government instead i think that based upon history individuals are less likely to be violent when they are n't acting on behalf of governments and they can and will find alternatives to the state that will replace it over time if they are not violently stopped here are some examples   1 i would rather be entirely left alone by the state police agents and allowed to use my own private security i would not be taxed for state agents and would instead pay out of pocket this would likely lower the cost since they would be interested in preventing losses rather than busting people for parking tickets speeding tickets drug offenses civil asset forfeiture etc would you not agree that this is a superior model 2 i would rather have private large scale defense since it would not be involved in international wars of aggression i would not be taxed and would instead pay out of pocket all else equal this would be less expensive and less dangerous since resources would only be used for defense would you not agree that this is a superior model 3 i would rather have a private system of healthcare rather than a government one being free to not pay into medicare medicaid this along with eliminating certificates of need monopolization by the ama eliminating ip protections and the like would lower the cost more than nationalization would and would also allow providers to better align with my preferences would you not agree that this is a superior system   gt yeah good one there were n't any anarchists in a position to do any of that great straw man   actually the purported left wing anarchists in spain did carry out what is called the red terror i put that in quotes because i do not agree with their methods or their ideology change must be done through the market not through violence   gt why is the burden of proof on the statists it 's the anarchists who are arguing for the change in the status quo   because appeals to tradition are not rational arguments and anarchists are not advocating for positive action against you statists are arguing that others be subject to their government if a person is trying to argue against his own he would n't have the burden of proof simply because he had been enslaved for some time   gt you 're the one making the claim that it would be a better system here with nothing to back it up   on the contrary i do have something to back it up the market responds better to consumer preferences on an individual level than governments do if you disagree with me on healthcare and want a collective system the market can put you with other like minded individuals and me with those who share my views a state can not   gt why do we have states right now   you 're conflating violence and efficiency that 's like saying if kids have such great ideas why are they still living under their parent 's rule it 's not because the ideas are bad it 's because the parents are keeping them there states do n't compete they rule with violence the notion of creating a market for violence to stop rule by violence is contradictory

if we were to observe some call price e.g. 15 and then derived implied volatilities from the bs formula depending on different strike prices but fixed maturity i.e maturity = 1 and strike goes from 80 to 140 would we then see a smile yes market prices for various strikes and a given maturity often have higher implied volatilities from the black scholes model away from at the money    it is not accounted for in the black scholes model in the fact that volatility is not a function of strike so volatility is assumed to be constant across strikes but the market does not price options that way i do n't know that a quantitative theory has ever been proven i 've always just assumed that people are willing to pay slightly more for options deep in or out of the money based on their strategy but i have no evidence to base that theory on

generally speaking granting rights to one bank account e.g. making a joint account does not extend rights to other accounts or otherwise let one joint owner create new obligations on the other owner e.g. opening a line of credit that the other owner must pay for except to the extent of the joint account   i assume there are no uk rules that would change this feature the other party can of course withdraw all the money without need for your approval   this also means that the joint account could be exposed to all the creditors of either party   if your account joint tenant has huge debts the creditors could theoretically look to the joint account for satisfaction   at least that would be an issue under us law frankly it may be simpler to get a separate account for the other person if possible and make transfers with online banking   it could also make sense to get a banking card if those are in the uk which works like a debit card and can be through various means sometimes a call sometimes online deposits sometimes in physical stores   there may be fees to getting such a card or a second account of course   the benefit is that the cardholder has no access to your account and you control recharging   such cards are widely available in the us to people who otherwise would not qualify for traditional bank accounts note also the fatca complication with adding a us person to your account   my understanding is that a number of non us banks will simply close the accounts of americans rather than deal with hassles under fatca

you 'd be moving from k of taxable income + 16.5 k of income to 65 k of taxable income worst case so the question is whether the net from the extra k of taxable income is more than the 16.5 k and since marginal tax rates in the relevant brackets are no more than 32 according to the table you posted 22 federal and 10 provincial it 's definitely a win to move jobs more precisely the marginal tax rate is 25 on the first and 32 on the rest making for total extra tax of about 9.5 k and thus net income beyond the k baseline of compared to the 16.5 k this leaves you 5.5 k up if you end up at the 70 k end you 're another 3.4 k up beyond that

one thing to keep in mind when calculating p e on an index is that the e earnings can be very close to zero   for example if you had a stock trading at $ 100 and the earnings per share was $ .01 this would result in a p e of 10,000 which would dominate the p e you calculate for the index   of course negative earnings also skew results one way to get around this would be to calculate the average price of the index and the earnings per share of the index separately and then divide the average price of the index by the average earnings per share of the index different sources calculate these numbers in different ways   some throw out negative p es or earnings per share and some do n't   some calculate the price and earnings per share separate and some do n't etc you 'll need to understand how they are calculating the number in order to compare it to of individual companies

it requires fairly large levels of capital but what about seed funding angel investments in startups this would be before venture capital gets involved so the amounts are relatively low tens of thousands vs. millions of usd but as valuations this early in the game are also low you can get a significant portion of equity in a startup that you feel is being run by good people and is in a promising market paul graham of y has a number of articles about this from both sides of the table that you can take a look at and see if this is for you it 's definitely very high risk but if you can pick successful startups before their valuation shoots up get some equity help them succeed and they eventually go public or get acquired you can stand to bring in some big returns note that this is n't a hands off investment you 'll need to build connections in the startup community and it is n't uncommon for angel investors to become involved in the day to day operations of the businesses in which they invest

if you want to invest in the stock market whether over a shorter period of 1 to 2 years or over a longer period of 10 or 20 years or longer you need to take some precautions and have a written investment plan with a risk management strategy incorporated in your plan others have said that 1 to 2 years is too short to invest in the stock market as the stock market can have a correction and fall by 50 but it does n't matter if you invest for 1 year or if you invest for 50 years the stock market can still fall by 50 just before you plan to withdraw your funds what you need to figure out is a way to get out before the market falls by 40 to 50 a simple way to do this is to use technical indicators to warn you when a market trend is starting to change and that it is time to get out of the market two simple indicators you can use on a market index are the rate of change roc indicator and the 100 week moving average ma below is a 10 year weekly chart of the s&p500 with these two indicators charted they show good times to get into the market and good times to get out   if you are using the 100 week ma you would buy in when the price crosses above the ma line and sell when the price crosses below the ma line if you are using the roc indicator you would buy in when the roc indicator crosses above the zero line and sell when the roc indicator crosses below the zero line so your investment plan could be to buy an index etf representing the s&p500 when the roc moves above zero and sell when it crosses below zero you can also place a trailing stop loss of 10 to protect you in case of a sudden fall over a couple of days you can manage your investments in as little as 10 minutes per week by checking the chart once per week and adjusting your stop loss order   if you want to progressively add to your investment each month you could check the charts and only add any new funds if both the roc is above zero and sloping upwards another option for adding new funds could be if the price is above the ma and moving further away from the ma all these rules should be incorporated into your investment plan so that you are not basing your decisions based on emotions there are many other technical analysis indicators you could also learn about to make better educated decisions about your stock market investments however what i have provided here is enough for anyone to test over different indexes and time frames and do their own paper trading on to gain some confidence before placing any real money on the table

us banks are often helpless with international checks so i would recommend to do a wire transfer instead otherwise you might end up being in the us with no money and a worthless piece of paper in your hand first set up your european account to allow wire transfers to the us if that needs any action speak to someone in the bank in person to make sure you can later initiate such a transfer remotely online after travelling set up your us account and then remote trigger a wire transfer costs are relatively small for example with you pay less than 30 $ and get the bank currency exchange ratio which is much better than the exchange ratio for paper money the wire transfer cost is partly proportional to the amount and partly constant so do n't split it in many pieces make one larger transfer

at least for liquid markets the downside of being a market maker is what we call negative selection specifically if you 're both bid and offered in a market trying to collect your spread then as the market goes up you 'll tend to sell the whole way up and vice versa so if you 're not smart about it you can end up losing a lot of money    being a good market maker then involves either being able to smarter about when to be aggressively bid and offered and when to pull back or being able to hedge them quickly before they really hurt you the first probably would require more sophisticated algorithms while the second requires good speed and execution strategies

for aggregate demand   we 've built an economy that depended on credit to fuel demand so it should be no surprise that a correction in the market slowing down demand because its not easy to get credit as much as it used to   economic growth should be built on productivity and savings not endless credit   for interest rates   companies are no longer expanding because they have already over expanded   over the past few decades companies have been with cheap rates encouraged by the fed and governments to capitalize their productivity to supply an inflated manipulated demand   if it was n't for all of this cheap rates producers would not have incorrectly over capitalized   for currency   we live in a world where many of the products we buy sell are made with imported and domestic parts   so our currency will also increase the prices of the goods we buy at walmart best buy apple stores etc   if we lived in a country society where domestic products are truly domestic made and then there would be some benefit to devalue our currency for gain of export   besides like you said i doubt other countries are just going to sit idle and watch us continue printing money to make our dollar worth less they will respond the same way   regarding supply and demand it is a circle so supply needs to also be cheap enough to encourage people to demand it   so giving money to people so they spend it is not going to fix anything   for   go

the stock markets are closed on week ends and public holidays because the banks are closed the banking is a must to settle the payment obligations so you may buy and sell as much as you wish but unless money changes hands nothing has really happened    now as to why banking itself is closed on week ends and public holidays well a different question keeping the system 24 hrs up and running does not actually push volumes but definately push expenses for brokers banks etc there definately is some to buyers and sellers

a subsidy is a payment made by a group usually the state to individuals or corporations in order to shift the balance if the rational economic decision for the individual would be detrimental to the group as a whole otherwise for example if there are different quality kinds of crops that can be planted for example a gm that brings in high yields but can only be processed to high corn syrup or a naturally bred corn that brings lower yields but tastes well enough for direct consumption then if demand for both exceeds supply the economic choice for the individual farmer is to plant the former if the claims that contribute to obesity are founded then it is in the public interest to produce less of it and more alternative foods given that a market rather than a planned economy is desired this can not be achieved by decree but rather money is used as an incentive in the long term this investment may very well pay off through reduced health care costs so it is a rational economic decision from the state 's point of view in a world where all actors make decisions that are fully in their self interest in principle subsidies would not be needed as consumers would demand healthy rather than cheap foods and market mechanisms would provide these

unfortunately when you deal with options you are going to have to accept some exposure to your greeks so in your example you could just buy back month atm calls although delta is going to be pretty static across your portfolio at least for say the first year depending on and other third order greeks which will keep your in check you 're still exposed to vega which will ultimately skew across the board    such are the caveats of options in order to obtain leverage you will need to take a less passive outlook but not by much

essentially what you 're describing is a leveraged investment   as others noted the question is how confident you can be that a the returns on the investment will exceed what you 're paying in interest and b that if you lose the bet you 'll still be able to pay off the loan without severely yourself   i did essentially this when i bought my house taking out a larger loan than necessary and leaving more money in my investments which had been returning more than the mortgage 's interest rate i then got lucky during the recession and was able to refinance down to under 4 which i am very certain my investment will beat i actually considered the term of the loan for that reason or borrowing a bit more but decided not to double down on the bet that was my own risk comfort threshold know exactly what your risks are including secondary effects of these risks run the numbers to see what the likely return is decide whether you like the odds enough to go for it

there are a few major risks to doing something like that first you should never invest money you ca n't afford to lose an emergency fund is money you ca n't afford to lose by definition you may need to have quick access to that money if you determine that you need for example $ 3000 in emergency savings that means that you need to have at least $ 3000 at all times if you lose $ 500 then you now only have $ 2500 in emergency savings imagine what could 've happened if you had invested your emergency savings during the 2008 crash for example you could easily have been in a position where you lost both your job and a good portion of your emergency savings at the same time which is a terrible position to be in if the car breaks down you ca n't really say now 's a bad time wait until the stock market bounces back second with brokerage accounts there may be a delay before you can actually access the money or transfer it to an account that you can actually withdraw cash from or write checks against but some of this depends on the exact arrangement you have with your bank this can be a problem if you 're in a situation where you need immediate access to the money if your furnace breaks in the middle of winter you probably do n't want to wait a few days for the sale and transfer to go through before you can have it fixed third you can be forced to sell the investments at an unfavorable price because you 're not sure when you 're going to need it you 'd also likely incur trading fees and/or early withdrawal penalties when you tried to withdraw the money think about it this way if you buy a bond that matures in 5 years you 're effectively betting that you wo n't have an emergency for the next 5 years if you do you 'll have to either sell the bond or if you 're allowed to get the money back early you 'll likely forfeit a good amount of the interest you earned in the process which kind of kills the point of buying the bond in the first place edit as pointed out in the comments you may also have to pay taxes on the profits if you sell at a favorable price in the u.s. at least capital gains on stuff held for less than a year is taxed at your ordinary income tax rate and stuff held longer than a year is taxed at the long term capital gains tax rate so if you hold the investment for less than a year you 're opening yourself up to the risks of short term stock fluctuations as well as potential tax penalties so if you put your emergency fund in stocks you 're essentially betting that you wo n't have an emergency that year which by definition you ca n't know the purpose of an emergency fund is just that to be an emergency fund its purpose is n't really to make money

when you buy a put on a stock you buy the right to sell the stock at fixed price f that his usually different from the market price m. you paid a price p for the put   your potential profit going forward is represented by the difference you get to collect between your fixed price f and that market price m plus the price you paid for the put or this assumes that p is fixed but the smaller m gets the larger the term and therefore the higher your potential profit from owning the put so when m tanks the put goes higher   the $ put is already in the money if it were settled today the value would be $ or $ 19 this minus the cost of the put itself represents your profit the $ 365 put is out of the money the stock has to fall $ 11 more before the put is exercised but if the stock went down 8 points today that is less than the $ 19 difference at the start of the day because there is time between now and october there is a chance for the stock to go down further thereby going into the money the current value of the put is represented by this chance obviously the chances of the stock going down $ 11 more from today is greater than the chance of it going down $ 19 more on the other hand the closer it gets to the expiration date the less an out of the money put is worth it 's a race between the stock 's fall and the time to expiration

depending on the details of your solar panel setup the monthly savings may change depending on changes in the law or utility company policy   this could change how long it will take for the solar panels to pay for themselves   so your bullet point about the payback even point is not fixed at the moment you buy the solar panels it depends on costs you will incur over many years and those costs could turn out to be different from what you originally thought at least in the us home solar installations typically work by selling excess power back to the power company   the power company can change the amount that it pays you for that power   there is also typically a minimum charge for being connected to the grid and the power company can raise that charge   this article mentions one such possible change   the power companies want to keep making money and as more people start adding solar panels the power companies may change their rate structure to make that less financially feasible you can avoid many of these issues if your solar panels are not connected to the public electricity grid and you for instance store power with your own battery   however at least in the us this is very uncommon because it is more complex and expensive

you have a loan you can probably assume you 're going to have to repay that loan every dollar and every dollar that 's outstanding on that loan costs you interest so assuming you 're not hit by any pre payment penalty any dollar that you pay down on your house right now saves you a compounded a year where r is your mortgage rate it does n't really matter whether you 're planning to sell it in a few years or not if you pay $ n you 'll save the interest + $ n taken from the sale price and sent to the bank when you sell the house and move though you might get a tax deduction on the interest if you have a better place to park your money and earn a decent rate of return it would be worth it to do that instead of paying down the mortgage if you had another loan with higher interest rates that 's probably a better loan to pay off if you can spend some of all of it on something that 's actually genuinely worth of its purchase price a year plus whatever the wear and tear takes away from its value if anything then spend it on that instead that 'd be a better investment for instance investments in the stock market may offer better returns however that 's risky observe that you ca n't lose money paying down your mortgage and that safety is usually relatively expensive these days so it 's not a bad deal but if you 're talking about using it for long term retirement savings that are tax advantaged to boot that 's another matter if you already have ample emergency funds and were just planning on putting the money into a savings account to rot at taxable interest it 's definitely worth it to pay down your balance now unless you 're about to sell so the savings are slight and it 's a real inconvenience

at the most basic level of financing a business you are trying to acquire capital as cheaply as you can to invest in your projects   the measure for how expensive your capital is to acquire is weighted average cost of capital     the formula for wacc   equity ratio cost of equity + debt ratio cost of debt 1 tax rate this is also your discount rate when you 're making a dcf model   debt tends to be cheaper than equity when you do n't already have any and is also advantaged by tax rates since you do n't pay taxes on interest   in the real world banks and lenders will ratchet up rates the more debt you acquire or shut you out once you 've taken on too much and your debt service coverage is too low for them   in a classroom though most teachers are too lazy to make a formula for borrowing and will just state a rate for borrowing so you can load up on debt so long as you do n't fall below being able to service your debt cash flow to make your debt payments   this will ultimately juice the returns on equity   realistically you would find lenders would let you have ~20 equity in the business and debt without raising your teacher 's   if you have n't taken accounting yet be careful about the difference between cash and revenue in your analyses   revenue is recognition for work done not cash in hand   you can have all the revenue in the world but if no one 's paid you for it yet you ca n't pay anyone

in addition to the issues discussed in 's answer i think you need to consider your medium term saving needs and existing savings in particular do you have a sufficient rainy day fund a fund you will spend if things go wrong for example if you are dependent on a vehicle that is not covered by a guarantee or service plan you should have enough money saved for a couple of major repairs depending on how secure your job is whether it carries sick leave and long term disability and how easy or difficult it would be to find another job in the event e.g. of your employer going bankrupt due to a downturn in your industry you should have months to years of minimal living expenses in your rainy day fund if you do n't have those things covered you should urgently save as much as you can until they are covered if you do then the next savings priority is to put money by for retirement of course if all goes well the rainy day fund will ultimately get folded into retirement but it needs to exist now in a form you can access quickly

while there is no age limit bear in mind that saving money makes sense only if it does n't delay your paying off expensive debt if you have credit cards or expensive loans you would be best placed to focus on paying them down before saving a lot if you save and keep debt you 'll effectively lose money as the interest on your debt will usually be higher than you can earn on savings having said that it 's worth saving a small amount anyway to have as an emergency fund as you pay off your debt start saving the money you no longer have to pay out and it will soon pay dividends

to add to mrchrister 's answer   canada also has a consumer price index cpi used to measure inflation that is distinct and separate from that maintained by the united states there are differences in inflation between the u.s. and canada because our currencies are different and there may be different items in the basket of goods that constitutes the index you can find current information on the canadian cpi at statistics canada here latest release from the consumer price index also the bank of canada our central bank maintains a free online inflation calculator   the boc 's inflation calculator is handy because you can enter a dollar amount for a past date and it will figure out what that would be in today 's dollars   for instance $ 100 in 1970 dollars had the same purchasing power under the cpi as $ in 2009 dollars and you 're right if you get a salary increase that is less than the rate of inflation then in theory you have lost purchasing power   so anybody really looking for a raise ought to make an effort to get more than the increase in cpi   of course some employers are counting on you not knowing that because any increase that 's less than cpi is effectively a salary decrease which could mean more profit for them if they are able to increase their prices revenues at inflation or better finally consider that salary wage increases also contribute to inflation   perhaps you 've heard of the wage price inflation spiral   if you have n't there 's more on that here and here

i do n't think this can be explained in too simple a manner but i 'll try to keep it simple organized and concise we need to start with a basic understanding of inflation inflation is the devaluing of currency in this context over time it is used to explain that a $ 1 today is worth more than a $ 1 tomorrow inflation is explained by straight forward supply = demand economics the value of currency is set at the point where supply m1 in currency speak = demand actual spending increasing the supply of currency without increasing the demand will create a surplus of currency and in turn weaken the currency as there is more than is needed inflation now that we understand what inflation is we can understand how it is created the us central bank has set a target of around 2 for inflation annually meaning they aim to introduce 2 of m1 into the economy per year this is where the answer gets complicated m1 currency has a far reaching effect on secondary m2 + credit currency that can increase or decrease inflation just as much as m1 can for example if you were given $ 100 m1 in new money from the fed you would then deposit that $ 100 in the bank the bank would then store 10 the reserve ratio in the fed and lend out $ 90 m2 to me on via a personal loan i would then take that loan and buy a new car the car dealer will deposit the $ 90 from my car loan into the bank who would then deposit 10 with the fed and his bank would lend out $ 81 and the cycle will repeat any change to the amount of liquid currency be it m1 or m2 + can cause inflation to increase or decrease so if a nation decides to reduce its us dollar reserves that can inject new currency into the market although the currency has already been printed it was n't in the market the currency markets aim to profit on currency imbalances and in reality momentary inflation deflation between currencies

the point here is actually about banks or is in reference to banks they expect you know how a savings account at a bank works but not mutual funds and so are trying to an erroneous notion that you might have that the will insure your investment in the fund   banks work by taking in deposits and lending that money out via mortgages the mortgages can last up to 30 years but the deposits are on demand which means you can pull your money out at any time   see the problem they 're maintaining a fiction that that money is there safe and sound in the bank vault ready to be returned whenever you want it when in fact it 's been loaned out and ca n't be called back quickly either they know only a little bit of that money will be demanded by depositors at any given time so they keep a percentage called a reserve to satisfy that er demand   the rest again is loaned out gone   and usually that works out just fine except sometimes it does n't when people get scared they might not get their money back and they all go to the bank at the same time to demand their on demand deposits back this is called a run on the bank and when that happens the bank fails 'cause it ai n't got the money   what 's failing in fact is the fiction that your money is there whenever you want it and that 's really bad because when that happens to you at your bank your friends the customers of other banks start worrying about their money and run on their banks which fail which cause more people to worry and try to get their cash out lather rinse repeat until the whole economy crashes see the great depression   so various governments introduced deposit insurance where the government will step in with the cash so when you panic and pull all your money out of the bank you can go home happy cash in hand and do n't freak all your friends out therefore the fear that your money might not really be there is and it does n't spread like a mental everyone can comfortably go back to believing the fiction and the economy goes back to chugging along   meanwhile with mutual funds etfs everyone understands the money you put in them is invested and not sitting in a gigantic vault and so there 's no need for government insurance to maintain the fiction   and that 's the point they 're trying to make   poorly i might add where their wording is concerned

a mutual fund has several classes of shares that are charged different fees some shares are sold through brokers and carry a sales charge called load that compensates the broker in lieu of a fee that the broker would charge the client for the service   vanguard does not have sales charge on its funds and you do n't need to go through a broker to buy its shares you can buy directly from them   admiral shares of vanguard funds are charged lower annual expenses than regular shares yes all mutual funds charge expenses for fund that reduce the return that you get and vanguard has some of the lowest expense ratios but admiral shares are available only for large investments typically $ 50 k or so   if you have invested in a vanguard mutual fund your shares can be set to automatically convert to admiral shares when the investment reaches the right level a mutual fund manager can buy and sell stocks to achieve the objectives of the fund so what you are invested in as a share holder in a mutual fund will typically be unknown to you on a day to day basis   on the other hand exchange traded funds etfs are fixed baskets of stocks and you can buy shares in the etf   these shares are bought and sold through a broker so you pay a transaction fee each time but expenses are lower since there is no manager to buy and sell stocks the basket is fixed many etfs follow specific market indexes e.g. s&p 500   another difference between etfs and mutual funds is that you can buy and sell etfs at any time of the day just as if you could if you held stocks with mutual funds any buy and sell requests   made during the day are processed at the end of the day and the value of the shares that you buy or sell is determined by the closing price of the stocks held by the mutual fund   with etfs you are getting the intra day price at the time the buy or sell order is executed by your broker

it 's important to remember that upward trending things spend the vast majority of their time at all time highs intelligent well meaning people have been regularly saying the dow jones has been too expensive since about 2010 often because it was now at all time highs    sitting on the sidelines can end up just as expensive if not more so than avoiding big drops if you are worried about a large down swing straight after investing just drip it in over a period you feel comfortable with no one can really answer this better than that without more info on your risk tolerance and exactly what you want to invest in   worth noting that buying anything other than transaction free funds when split into small transactions also adds a lot more fees entry and exit in a uk isa for example split these over 12 months say and it will cost you £ 240 straight out of the gate 2 fund purchases per month for 12 months each and another £ 240 to exit before any holding fees from the isa platform that 's over 1 of your capital gone just to your stockbroker employing this strategy   both the products you mention are also quite high cost in ongoing charges so unless you have very high convictions about the management quality will also probably lag cheaper investment types over the long run as well due to the dire performance of virtually all higher cost active management over time

i was in a similar situation and my method was this since i already had a fidelity 401k account it was pretty easy to open a individual account through the website   from there you can just put the money into a general market mutual fund or exchange traded fund i prefer low expense ratio funds like passive indexed funds since studies show that there is n't much benefit to actively traded funds   so i just put my money into the popular low fee fund spy which tracks to the s&p 500   i   plan on leaving the money there for at least a year if not several years so i can pay the lower capital gains tax rate on any gains and avoid paying the commissions too many times in your situation you might want to consider using the extra cash to max out you and your wife 's 401k this year since you are n't already taking full advantage of that often people recommend saving 10 or 15 of gross income throughout their career for retirement so you 're on the low side and maybe have a small bit of catch up to do finally you could also start a 529 education saving plan to save for kid 's future college cost

ok fair enough but you did say a large part of their barrier to entry is government in relation to general industry in defense of your earlier statement that monopolies can rarely exist without one or two things government support or limited geographic area   my contention is that regulation can present a barrier to entry but this is not nearly as large a barrier as size and barriers due to size is the primary reason for monopolies or oligopolies in recent times   if you do n't want to use the aircraft industry as an example let 's use amazon itself amazon is cleaning everyone 's clocks whatever you try and sell if it is available on amazon a smaller player will not be able to compete with them except on the edges their market share continues to increase they own 43 of all us online retail   why does n't someone just start up and compete with them why are n't there 10 12 different competitors to amazon   now clearly amazon got a head start they were among the first to shift into the non specialized internet retail market pets.com only sold pet food whereas amazon now sells everything there is no arguing that they do things very well and have advanced the area of online sales   but they are now without competition and will not have significant competition unless they badly and even then they may not have competition see ebay which now sucks but still has no real competition   when i look at changing sectors in my general geographic area i see massive up sizing coupled with a lack of new entries into the sector i 'll give a few examples   auto dealers i had a relative who owned a dealership in the 70s just one he did ok from it now most of the dealerships are owned by people who own somewhere between 5 and 15 different dealerships    gas stations i had a relative who owned a gas station again just one there were lots of these guys around now most of the gas stations are owned by 2 or 3 conglomerates who own many dozens of stations   banks yes regulation is in play here but there used to be dozens of different banks in my region now there are maybe 2 regional banks and 3 national banks gone are the days when there was one bank that had 2 3 branches even credit unions are consolidating   hardware stores we are down to home depot lowe 's and a regional chain that has 20 30 stores no independent guys   grocery stores my region has exactly two full service grocery store chains plus maybe 2 discount chains when i was a kid there were 10 different regional chains in the area    not the best example but video stores there used to be 10 12 different mom and pop stores which consolidated into two blockbuster hollywood video which got crushed by netflix smart tvs have allowed for there to be more players in the on demand world but the level of skill needed to enter this area can not be more different between the initial mom and pop video store and the world of online content delivery   the list goes on and on consolidation is the name of the game and when a market the average person can no longer enter it as it further the above average person can no longer enter it and when it gets to a certain point no one can enter it that has harmed the economy because people have stopped playing the game because they know they ca n't win they ca n't compete with the big boys   now i do n't know what to do about this but my observation is that this has accelerated in the past 30 years i think that technology has accelerated it but i also think that tax code and lack of anti trust enforcement has also accelerated it i would put my bet on tax code as the 1 culprit tax code has made it attractive for people to try and earn tens of millions of dollars per year there is truth to the conservative claim that if the tax rates are too high people will not work as hard that 's not necessarily a bad thing though markets are driven by demand and at any point in time they have a finite demand a total size if there is $ 15 million worth of demand for hardware in a region that demand can either be satisfied by one massive global corporation or by 15 $ 100k small businesses or by 30 $ 50k small businesses    there can be an advantage to one massive global corporation cheaper prices higher quality but there can also be a downside which is eventually higher prices less innovation and even lower quality plus the downside of the elimination of opportunity for the 30 people who would serve that demand if the massive corporation did not exist opportunities which turned over every so often due to businesses closing due to retirement or even incompetence    i do not think that tax code innovation though because people innovate for passion not for money steve jobs and steve wozniak founded apple when the top tax rate was 70 they did it because they wanted to make computers not because they wanted to make money i think that a high tax rate would stifle the relentless pursuit of more dollars by using existing dollars to consolidate sectors

tax is often calculated per item   especially in the days of the internet some items are taxable and some are n't depending on the item and your nexus   i would recommend calculating and storing tax with each item to account for these subtle differences edit not sure why this was downvoted if you do n't believe me you can always check with amazon i think they know what they 're talking about final update now if someone goes to your site and buys something from your business in california and the shipping address for the product is nevada then taxes do not have to be collected   if they have a billing address in california and a shipping address in nevada and the goods are shipping to nevada you do not have to declare tax if you have a mixture of tangible computer mouse keyboard and intangible assets warranty in a cart and the shipping address is in california you charge tax on the tangible assets but not on the intangible assets yes you can charge tax on the whole order   yes for most businesses that 's good enough but i 'm not trying to provide the good enough solution i 'm simply telling you how very large businesses run and operate   as i 've mentioned i 've done several tax using software called google if you 've not heard of it and have done those for companies like the bbc and owned and operated by bill gates take it or leave it but the correct way to charge taxes especially given the complex tax laws of the us and internationally is to charge per item   if you just need the good enough approach feel free to calculate it by total some additional reading another possible federal limitation on internet taxation is the united states supreme court case corp. v. north dakota 504 u.s. which held that under the dormant commerce clause goods purchased through mail order can not be subject to a state ’s sales tax unless the vendor has a substantial nexus with the state the tax   in 1997 the federal government decided to limit taxation of internet activity for a period of time the internet tax freedom act prohibits taxes on internet access which is defined as a service that allows users access to content information email or other services offered over the internet and may include access to proprietary content information and other services as part of a package offered to customers the act has exceptions for taxes levied before the statute was written and for sales taxes on online purchases of physical goods

what is being described in 's answer though helpful is perhaps more similar to a financial spread bet exactly like a the provider of a spread bet takes the other side of the bet and is counter party to your trade a cfd is also a bet between two parties now if the cfd provider uses a market maker model then this is exactly the same as with a spread bet and the provider is the counter party however if the provider uses a direct market access model then the counter party to your contract is another cfd trader and the provider is just acting as an intermediary to bring you together basically doing the job of both a brokerage and an exchange a cfd entered into through a direct market access provider is in many ways similar to a futures contract critically though the contract is traded over the counter and not on any centralized and regulated exchange this is the reason that cfds are not permitted in the us the providers are not authorized as exchanges whichever model your cfd provider uses it is best to think of the contract as a bet on the future price movements of the underlying stock or commodity in much the same way as with any other derivative instrument such as futures forwards swaps or options finally note that because you do n't actually own the underlying stock just as has highlighted you wo n't be entitled to any of the additional benefits that can come with ownership of a stock such as dividend payments or the right to attend shareholder meetings response to question so if i understand correctly the money gained through a direct market access model comes from other investors in the same cfd who happened to have invested in the wrong direction the asset was presumed to take what happens then if no one is betting in the opposite direction of my investment your understanding is correct if literally nobody is betting in the opposite direction to you then you will not be able to trade this is true for any derivative market if suddenly every single buyer were to remove their bids from the s&p futures then no seller would be able to sell this is a very extreme scenario as the s&p futures market is incredibly liquid loads of buyers and sellers at all times   however if something like this does happen the flash crash of 2010 for example then the centralized futures exchanges such as the cme have safeguards in place the market become locked limit so that it can only fall so far there may be no buyers below the lock limit price but the market can not fall through it cfd providers are not obliged to provide such safeguards which is why regulators in the us do n't permit them to operate it may be the case that if you 're trying to buy a cfd for a thinly traded and ill liquid stock there will be no seller available one possibility is that the provider will offer a hybrid model and in the absence of an independent counter party they will take the opposite side of your bet and then offset their risk by taking an opposing position in the underlying stock

dividend yields can also reflect important information about the company 's status for example a company that has never lowered or stopped paying dividends is a strong company because it has the cash earnings power to maintain its dividend regardless of the market ideally a company should pay dividends for at least 10 years for an investor to consider the company as a consistent payer furthermore when a company pays dividend it generally means that it has more cash than it can profitably reinvest in the business so companies that pay dividends tend to be older but more stable an important exception is reit 's and their ilk to avoid taxation these types of funds must distribute 90 of their earnings to their shareholders so they pay very high dividends just look at stocks like or to get an idea the issue here however is two fold so a high dividend can be great if it has been paid consistently or risky if the company is new or has a short payment history and dividends can also tell us about what the company 's status is   lastly taxation on dividend income is higher than taxation on capital gains but by reinvesting dividends you can avoid this tax and lower your potential capital gain amount thus limiting taxes   is an excellent paper on dividend yields and investing

gt bernie was n't even accountable to his own donors that 's why they 're suing him    haha silly boy lame joke but donors are suing the dnc not bernie     gt;the only solution is for the government to stop inserting itself between people and healthcare only then with direct pricing lower barriers to entry private charity and consumer choice can we lower costs cartels only exist because of state mandated regulation patent law and government mandated healthcare    you have been sold the freedom pill by corporations that want their ayn rand in the republican party to do exactly what you are proposing how will consumer choice improve if you let health insurance companies set their own rules how will you lower barriers to entry when behemoths like aetna and co. can come in and swallow up competitors whole where are the private charities that help poor black kids in forgotten areas unless you think they are sub human and do n't deserve any help how can we keep corporations accountable when we let their cartels monopolies and oligopolies do what they please with our lives you live in a fantasy world where all of a sudden insurance will swoop in and create more affordable choices for all you are deluded if you think this is how the real world works      cartels exist because if you do n't put up barriers to profit seekers they will seek to accumulate more and more and they will seek to consolidate more and more power and market share government officials are simply a commodity they have to buy or else consumers communities might actually organize and have a voice against their quest for without that representative public servant they could give three shits about anybody but their shareholders it is the wet dream of assholes like trump and his tea party ayn rand sociopaths

there is no accounting reason that it should be different there are likely psychological reasons that it should be however assuming that you live in a western country with good banking regulation you likely have deposit insurance or a similar scheme   here in canada we are covered up to $ 100,000 in a single account with various limitations   at least my rainy day account plus savings is nowhere near that so i 'm good to go that said however having a large lump of money in an account you regularly use may tempt you more than you can stand   that ipad car home improvement etc might be too easy to buy knowing you have relatively easy access to that money so it really becomes a self discipline question good luck

i 'd split whatever cash flow you have between saving money and paying down the 20 loan the fact that you are carrying an unrealized loss is n't really too relevant unless you have plans to walk away from the loan or go bankrupt it does n't really matter until you sell you 're either going to repay now or later

you do n't specify which country you are in so my answers are more from a best practice view than a legal view i do n't intend on using it for personal use but i mean it 's just as possible this is a dangerous proposition you should n't co mingle business expenses with personal expenses   if there is a chance this will happen then stop make it so that it wo n't happen the big danger is in being able to have between what you are doing for the business and what you are doing for yourself   if you are using this as a staging account for investments etc are those investments for yourself   or for the business   is tax treatment on capital gains and/or dividends the same for personal and business in your jurisdiction   if you buy a widget is the widget an expense against business income   or is it an out of pocket expense for personal consumption   the former reduces your taxable income the latter does not i do n't see the benefit of a real business account because those have features specific to maybe corporations llc and etc nothing beneficial to a sole proprietor who has no reports employees the real benefit is that there is a clear between business income expenses and personal income expenses this account can also accept money and hold it from business transactions sales and possibly transfer some to the personal account if there 's no need for reinvesting said amount percentage what you are looking for is a commonly called a current account because it is used for current expenses   if you are moving money out of the account to your personal account that speaks to paying yourself which has other implications as well the safest cleanest way to do this is to while this may sound like overkill it is the only way to guarantee that income expenses are allocated to the correct entity i.e. you or your business from a canadian standpoint

this answer comes from my interpretation of publication 590 2011 individual retirement arrangements iras and particularly what are qualified distributions section please consult the sources yourself or with the help of a qualified professional before doing anything first note that due to the rollover loophole you can take out the money and repay it within 60 days missing the deadline would mean paying the taxes on the withdrawal in addition to a 10 penalty as per joetaxpayer 's notes below this applies to the earnings on the account only the contributions themselves can be withdrawn without penalties thanks joe   second you might qualify to withdraw 10k for a qualified first home house purchase qualified in this case would mean first time home purchase by yourself your spouse your child parent or made within 120 days of withdrawal see first home in the above document finally nothing is mentioned about the withdrawal affecting your yearly contribution cap any new money coming into the account is new money counted towards the contribution cap except for the 60 day loophole   to answer your question then you can make up the money only under the first scenario 60 day loophole qualified withdrawals allow you to avoid the penalties but as far as i can tell do not affect the contribution cap there are a few other details that may depend on your age status health etc read the document carefully to see if any of those apply to you

i suggest you have a professional assist you with this audit if the issue comes into questioning it might be that it would n't there are several different options to deal with such situation and each can be attacked by the irs you 'll need to figure out the following have you paid taxes on the reimbursement most likely you have n't but if you had it simplifies the issue for you is the program qualified under the employers plan and the only reason you 're not qualified for reimbursement is that you decided to quit your job if so you might not be able to deduct it at all because you ca n't take tax benefits on something you can be reimbursed for but chose not to irs might claim that you quitting your job is choosing not to get reimbursement you would otherwise get i could n't find from my brief search any examples of what happened after such a decision you can claim it was a loan but i doubt the irs will agree the employer most likely reported it as an expense if the irs do n't contest based on what i described in 2 and you have n't paid taxes on the reimbursement 1 i 'd say what you did was reasonable and should be accepted assuming of course you otherwise qualify for all the benefits you 're asking for i would suggest getting a professional advice talk to a ea or a a cpa in your area this answer was not intended or written to be used and it can not be used by any taxpayer for the purpose of avoiding penalties that may be imposed on the taxpayer

the auction market is where investors such you and me as well as market makers buy and sell securities   the auction markets operate with the familiar bid ask pricing that you see on financial pages such as google and yahoo   the market makers are institutions that are there to provide liquidity so that investors can easily buy and sell shares at a fair price market makers need to have on hand a suitable supply of shares to meet investor demands   when market makers feel the need to either increase or decrease their supply of a particular security quickly they turn to the dealer market in order to participate in a dealer market you must be designated a market maker   as noted already market makers are dedicated to providing liquidity for the auction market in certain securities and therefore require that they have on hand a suitable supply of those securities which they support   for example if a market maker for apple shares is low on their supply of apple shares then will go the dealer market to purchase more apple shares   conversely if they are holding what they feel are too many apple shares they will go to the dealer market to sell apple shares   the dealer market does operate on a bid ask basis contrary to your stated understanding the bid ask prices quoted on the dealer market are more or less identical to those on the auction market except the quote sizes will be generally much larger this is the case because otherwise why would a market maker offer to sell shares to another market maker at a price well below what they could themselves sell them for in the auction market   and similarly with buy orders   if market makers are generally holding low quantities of a particular security this will drive up the price in both the dealer market and the auction market similarly if market makers are generally holding too much of a particular security this may drive down prices on both the auction market and the dealer market

yes you can do what you are contemplating doing and it works quite well just do n't get the university 's payroll office too by going in each june july august and september to adjust your payroll withholding do it at the end of the summer when perhaps most of your contract income for the year has already been received and you have a fairly good estimate for what your tax bill will be for the coming year do n't forget to include social security and medicare taxes both employee 's share as well as employer 's share on your contract income in estimating the tax due the nice thing about paying estimated taxes via payroll deduction is that all that tax money can be counted as having been paid in four equal and timely quarterly payments of estimated tax regardless of when the money was actually withheld from your university paycheck you could if you wanted to and had a fat salary from the university heh heh have all the tax due on your contract income withheld from just your last paycheck of the year but whether you increase the withholding in august or in december do remember to change it back after the last paycheck of the year has been received so that next year 's withholding starts out at a more pace

my theory is that the massive swell of fear from 2008 until now has made people realize that they are never safe and that debt is the killer    when private sector incomes drop loss of job less consumer demand etc we can not afford to service our debt and this leads to catastrophic default with assets being lost to creditors on the other hand if you own your assets outright a significant and long lasting drop in income can usually be sustained or at least the assets are not lost   in a time of high risk to income like now it is better to pay down debt even if it means tightening the budget a bit better to lose some business utility now than to lose it all later to creditors   thanks for the post there is some interesting info in here i also find it interesting that these world class economists are presenting these horribly ugly excel graphs

there is no rule of thumb that fits every person and every situation   however the reasons why this advice is generally applicable to most people are simple why it is good to be more aggressive when you are young the stock market has historically gone up on average over the long term   however on its way up it has ups and downs   if you wo n't need your investment returns for many years to come you can afford to put a large portion of your investment into the volatile stock market because you have plenty of time for the market to recover from temporary downturns why it is good to be more conservative when you are older over a short term period there is no certainty that the stock market will go up   when you are in retirement most people withdraw sell their investments for income   and once you reach a certain age you are required to withdraw some of your retirement savings   if the market is in a temporary downturn you would be forced to sell low losing a significant portion of your investment    exceptions of course there are exceptions to these guidelines   if you are a young person who ca n't help but watch your investments closely and gets depressed when seeing the value go down during a market downturn perhaps you should move some of your investment out of stocks   it will cost you money in the long term but may help you sleep at night if you are retired but have more saved than you could possibly need you can afford to risk more in the stock market   on average you 'll come out ahead and if a downturn happens when you need to sell it wo n't affect your overall situation much

i would n't advocate it but one reason to pay a lower interest rate is if you have $ 990 on a $ 1000 limit credit card with 6 interest and $ 5000 on a $ 15k limit card at 10 interest having $ 500 to pay in a month and putting it on the lower interest would free up a greater percentage of credit on that card and could potentially help your credit rating i believe i think having $ 1000 on 10 different credit cards w/ $ 15k limit reflects better than $ 10k on one $ 15k card regardless of interest rates personally i think that 's dumb b c having the extra credit available is an opportunity to get into trouble a lot easier

there 's nothing illegal in hiring your friends to manage your property or provide you services and it is definitely deductible there 's nothing specific to reference here this is a standard deduction for a landlord just as any i mentioned 1099 in the comments if the total is over $ 600 and your friend is not a corporation then you should issue 1099 that would provide you the necessary of the deduction of course you need to keep some documentation that shows the relation between the money paid and the services provided like a contract or invoice or receipt you can but do n't have to issue 1099 for lower amounts as well if you do n't you 'll need to keep more documents as checks documents about the agreement and the amounts etc in addition your deduction may be disallowed if your friend does n't declare this as taxable income issuing 1099 helps here since your friend will be forced to declare it otherwise it will be recorded as a mismatch by the irs and trigger an audit as to reimbursements that would go into the same bucket they 'll have to deduct their expenses from that income on their own taxes so if you give them $ 300 for the work $ 300 for the miles and $ 300 for the materials they bought you issue the 1099 for $ 900 and let them deduct the $ 600 on their own schedule c.

at every moving yard garage sale i have ever seen only cash is accepted while the use of electronic payments is growing the big problem is that it is hard to verify the exchange at the time the goods are changing hands unless you have a card reader attached to your phone you ca n't use a credit or debit card unless you can verify that they did transfer the money electronically why would you let them walk away with your stuff if you knew them you could accept a check but there are risks with the checks bouncing

it is likely a scam   in fact the whole mystery shopping job may be a scam   there is a page about cashier 's check scams as well as a us government page which specifically mentions mystery shopping as a scam angle as for how the scam works from the site i just linked however cashier ’s checks lately have become an attractive vehicle for fraud when used for payments to consumers although the amount of a cashier ’s check quickly becomes available for withdrawal by the consumer after the consumer deposits the check these funds do not belong to the consumer if the check proves to be fraudulent it may take weeks to discover that a cashier ’s check is fraudulent in the meantime the consumer may have irrevocably wired the funds to a scam artist or otherwise used the funds only to find out later when the fraud is detected that the consumer owes the bank the full amount of the cashier ’s check that had been deposited it is somewhat unusual in that from what you say there has been no attempt thus far to get money back   however your sister in law may have received that info separately or received it as part of her mystery shopping job but did n't mention it to you with regard to this check   typically the scam involves telling the recipient to transfer money to a third party e.g. by buying goods as a mystery shopper or via wire transfer to reimburse someone associated with a sham operation   by the time the cashier 's check is revealed as fraudulent the victim has already transferred away his her own real money it 's probably worth taking the check to your or her bank and asking them about it   they may have more info   also banks usually want to know about scams like this because in the long run they accumulate data on them and share that with law enforcement and can eventually catch some of the scammers edit just to help anyone who may be reading this later   the letter you added confirms it is absolutely a scam   my boss was once contacted via a scam operation very similar to this   the huge red flag in addition to others already mentioned is that you are being given a check for over $ 2000 of which only $ 25 is purportedly for actual mystery shopping and $ is payment for you the mystery shopper   the whole rest of the $ 2000 + amount is for you to wire to another mystery secret shopper in order for them to complete their assignment   they are giving you $ 2000 to give to someone else who is supposedly another one of their own employees contractors   ask yourself what sane business would conduct their operations in this way   if you work at a law office or a hamburger stand or a school or anything you like does your boss ever say here is your paycheck for $ 5000   i know you only earned $ 1000 but i 'm just going to give you the whole $ 5000 and you 're supposed to use $ 4000 of it to pay your coworker joe his wages   no   there is no reason to do that except that the other mystery shopper is actually the scammer

many web sites and articles warn against buying former rental cars    because people renting these cars often them rental cars are typically driven by people over 25 these are typically people with some financial means air travel credit card additionally rental cars are subject to frequent inspection and likely to be on tighter maintenance schedules than many owners would keep so while some people may drive a rental harder than they would their own car it 's not typical and not likely to result in some hidden damage that makes a rental less desirable all else being equal on the used car market does the fact that they sell the car mean during this time suggest that they know the car 's cost of further maintenance or other costs will be higher or is there another reason they sell at this time which has a calculated advantage to them but which is less than idea statistically for me the purchaser rental companies buy at incredible volumes as such some manufacturers have programs where they will buy back used cars from the rental company at a set price and/or time other incentives are guaranteed depreciation wherein the manufacturer will make up the difference if the used vehicle does n't sell for a set percentage of it 's purchase price after a set amount of time outside of these incentive programs rental companies also get substantial volume discounts and they typically are buying base models which hold value better than their higher trim counterparts according to kbb market analyst so the conventional wisdom about depreciation does n't really apply the timing of their sales is primarily based on their purchasing arrangements and their desire to keep an up to date fleet not on projected maintenance repair costs the best you can do with any used car purchase is to test drive get a pre purchase inspection and review whatever history is available

the old underwriting standards were 28 home debt to income ratio and 33 consumer debt to income ratio consumer debt is calculated based on minimum payments now most models are revised upwards i believe is more common today   as long as you are current on the accounts closing credit or store revolving accounts will have little or no bearing just leave them dormant there is no positive result from closing accounts that have no balance having low or no balances has no negative impact on your credit score low balances are not red flags to lenders period here 's a quote from fair it 's just not true that you can have too much available credit that by itself is never a negative with the score sometimes the things you do to get too much can be a problem such as opening a bunch of new accounts but for the most part that 's just kind of an old wives tale the major drivers of credit scoring are to improve your prospects for getting a mortgage you should be reducing your spending and focusing 60/40 on saving for a down payment and paying down that $ 15k credit card respectively having cash for a down payment is critical to your buying power as zero down loans are n't widely available in 2011 and a large downpayment will allow you to eliminate or reduce the time you are paying pmi pmi reduces your buying power and is a big waste of money

the bonus share also improves the liquidity however there is some difference in treatment lets say a company has 100 shares of $ 10 ea the total capital of the is 100 10 = 1000 assuming the company is doing well its share is now available in the market for $ 100 ea now lets say the company has made a profit of $ 1000 and this also gets factored into the price of $ 100 lets say the company decides to keep this $ 1000 kept as cash reserve and is not distributed as dividends    in a share split say 1:1 the book value of each share is now reduced to $ 5 the number of shares increase to 200 the share capital stays at 200 5 = 1000 the market value of shares come down to $ 50 ea    in a bonus share issue say 1:1 the funds $ 1000 are moved from cash reserve and transferred to share capital the book value of each share will remain same as $ 10 the number of shares increase to 200 the share capital increases to 200 10 = 2000 the market value of shares come down to $ 50 ea    so essentially from a liquidity point of view both give the same benefit as to why some companies issue bonus and not a split this is because of multiple reasons a split beyond a point can not be done ie $ 10 can be split to $ 1 ea but it does n't look good to make it $ 0.50 the other reason is there is adequate cash reserve and you want to convert this into share holders capital having a larger share holders capital improves some of the health ratios for the at times is used to play upon that one is getting something free

okay so   gt lifting the offer hit bids lift offers and i suppose that 's a albeit a somewhat simple one passive routing strategies differ from firm to firm and algo to algo what is your customer going to think if you bid up a new price level only for the stock to rally completely away from it   i mean if you have an open order for more than 10 times the amount currently offered with a limit above the offer and you have nt gotten filled on the bid what can you do but lift the offer and try to be first at the next price level up at least you would have gotten some at the price they quoted or are they fill or kill   gt bidding it up to attract sellers sounds an awful lot like spoofing just a heads up sure though if you want to tighten a spread or create new levels with aggressive passive liquidity that is a strategy the same caveats as i mentioned above apply   just to be clear aggressively adding passive liquidity is the more apt way to put it i 'm talking about when you actually want to get filled on those bids but you 're having trouble finding sellers   could you give me an example of what you might consider passive or aggressive just for scale would a mkt impact of .10 raise any how do you gauge fair value or does that matter less to you than just accumulating selling what you can for what you were asked to   gt anyway if market impact is n't an issue for the customer sure take liquidity until you 're filled do n't forget about getting good size done in the opening and closing auctions moc if you 're too passive you risk the market moving away from you and pissing off the customer if you 're too aggressive you risk moving the market too much and pissing off the customer   so then is the question more how motivated is the buyer or seller   i 'm glad you bring up the moc are there certain securities that do n't have much of a market in those auctions   trying to out how a large firm can hold a position in some of the less popular names with next to no liquidity and little in the way of dark pool auction block sales etc

what you aim to do is a great idea and it will work in your favor for a number of reasons first paying down your loan early will save you lots in interest no brainer second keeping the account open will improve your credit score by 1 increases the number of installment trade lines you have open to your positive payment history and 3 varies your credit mix if your paid your car off you will see a drop in your credit score because now you have one less trade line to address other issues as far as credit scoring it does not for your score if you have a $ 1000 car loan or a $ 100,000 car loan what matters is whether or not you pay on time and what your balance is compared to the original loan amount so the quicker you pay down the loans or mortgages the better pay them down not off as far how the extra payments will report one of two things will happen either they will report every month paid as agreed most likely or they wo nt report anything for a few years until your next payment is this wo nt hurt you but wo nt help you either someone posted they would lower the amount you paid every month on your report and thus lower your score this is not true even if they reported you paid $ month the scoring calculations do not care all they care is whether or not you 're on time and in your case you would be months ahead of though your report ca nt reflect this fact either however if you are applying for a mortgage the lower monthly payment would affect you in the sense that now you qualify for a bigger loan because now your debt to income ratio has improved people will argue to just pay it off and be debt free however being debt free does not help your credit and being that you own a home and a car you see the benefits of good credit you can have a million dollars in the bank but you will be denied a loan if you have no or bad credit   nothing wrong with living on cash i 've done it for years but good luck trying to rent a car or getting the best insurance rates and anything in life with poor credit yeah it sucks but you have to play the game i would not pay down do $ 1 though because like someone else said they may just close the account pay it down to 10 or 20 percent and you will see the most impact on your credit and invest the rest of your cash elsewhere

yes this is possible in the most liquid securities but currently it would take several days to get filled in one contract at that amount there are also position size limits set by the occ and other self regulatory organizations that attempt to prevent people from a market through the options market getting loads of contacts without effecting the price of the underlying asset exercising those contracts and suddenly owning a huge stake of the asset and nobody saw it coming although this is still very very possible so for your example of an option of $ 1.00 per contract then the position size limits would have prevented 100 million of those being opened by one person account that is realistically you would spread out your orders amongst several options strike prices and expiration dates stock indexes are some very liquid examples so for the standard poors you can open options contracts on the spy etf as well as the s&p 500 futures as well as many other s&p 500 products that only trade options and do not have the ability to be traded as the underlying shares and there is also the saying liquidity liquidity meaning that because you are making the market more liquid other large market participants will also see the liquidity and want to participate where they previously thought it was too illiquid and impossible to close a large position quickly

what what a strange and horribly wrong thesis   buybacks are economically the same as dividends they are a way of distributing profits to investors a company does this when it can not find any good investment opportunities it does not cause a lack of those opportunities this guy has it completely backwards    after the buyback the previous stockholders now have cash to find opportunities that the firm was n't itself either was n't equipped to move on or did n't know about that buyback distribution does n't just get it gets reinvested as per the previous owners desires   his example of how previously a firm had to invest since it had no way to return profits to investors is a perfect example of capital misallocation caused by taxation   this piece should be nominated for worst of the year all intro econ students should read this and learn to such claims

as other answers and comments suggest you are trying to do something odd to say the least no one wants to use a credit card to finance a checking current account because you are creating a debt on that credit card unless you are in the odd situation where the card is in credit that will immediately start accruing interest at a rate probably in excess of 10 per annum that is not a clever thing to do what you really need to do is find an account that one of you owns that has a positive balance and use an internet banking service to transfer part of that positive balance onto the debit card the other solution is not to use the debit card at all but use the credit card to complete the purchases you are trying to manage with the debit card the reason that bofa and amex customer support ca n't help you is that no one would ever do what you want to do they would either move existing money from another account or ask for a bank loan

the rate difference between your student loans and the historical yearly average growth in the s&p500 is n't large enough for me to play the pay minimums and invest the rest strategy   if your loans were 2 i might think about it however the 4 loans are guaranteed and mandatory expenses discharging them even in bankruptcy is unlikely   the quicker you pay them off the sooner you wo n't have them hanging over your head in case of a financial setback job loss large expense uncovered by insurance etc one good reason to pay the minimums though is to build up a $ 1 k emergency fund   when your debts are paid then you can increase its size

gt speech is free in and of itself it does not justify an investigation evidence does and by all verifiable accounts there is no evidence of wrongdoing   don jr 's email is evidence of attempted collusion   he admitted it   free speech also has limits   you ca n't yell fire in a crowded theater   you ca n't discuss illegal things it 's called conspiracy   gt otherwise they would n't need to fish for it in completely irrelevant trump family financial records from years before the election   trump 's previous business dealings are totally relevant   if he 's colluding those relationships did n't start in 2015   they 're going to look for earlier associations and business dealings with russians that were later used for collusion   gt   i think the opinion of the 17 us intelligence services is a better source of info than a newspaper owned by news corp.   there 's not much question that the russians attempted to influence the election     gt what does your imagination tell you this russian collusion that supposedly took place looked like   i have no idea   let 's let the investigation tell us

like others mentioned you need to look at the big picture personally i 'm not a fan of insurance based investments they tend to have horrible track records and you 're locked it and paying way to much money for them i had one for a number of years and when i finally cancelled it i pulled out almost the exact amount i put in so it basically grew at either zero or negative interest for 5 + years   i ended up buying term life and took the difference and invested it in a roth 401k. much better use of my money the reason why insurance people push these policies so hard is that they make insane commission on it over 2 3 years i asked my insurance guy about it and he admitted that plus doing some research you 'll find that out as well hope this helps somewhat

first you should maintain a monthly expense and find out the burn rate there would be certain expenses that are annual but mandatory school fees insurance premium property taxes etc so the ideal emergency fund depending on your industry should be 3 month to 6 months plus your mandatory yearly payments more so if they come together for example most of my annual payments come out in may and i bank on the bonus payout in april to cater to this spike in expense so if i were to lose a job in march my emergency funds would be sufficient for routine expenses if i do n't provision for additional funds second you need to also figure out the reduced rate of monthly burn and ideally the emergency funds should be for 3 months of normal burn and 6 months of reduced burn

yes you can blame the consumer and that 's fair but the question is are our labelling laws pretty good and the answer is no especially when to comparably affluent countries not at all    what i described is an intentionally created loophole used to mislead the consumer it 's ridiculous

at no point did i advocate against regulation all i advocated was if we want to raise the cost of sin products like meat dairy then the first step is to remove the subsidies that keep their costs low are you denying that most developed countries are n't heavily subsidizing their meat dairy industries

think of your mortgage this way you have a $ 130 k 16 year mortgage at   at 4 the same payment $ or so will pay off the loan in 12.4 years so i agree with littleadv go for a 15yr fixed but still make the higher payment or 10 yr if you do n't mind the required higher payment either way a refinance is the way to go   edit my local bank is offering me a 3.5 15 yr loan with fees totaling $ 2500 for the op here a savings of 3.25 or first year interest savings of $ 7 months to breakeven   it 's important not to get caught up in trying to calculate savings 15 20 years out what counts today is the rate difference and looking at it over the next 12 months is a start if you break even to closing costs so soon that 's enough to make the decision

i actually help companies start up for a living    here are some big parts you should do   1 post on craigslist for work   seems pointless but it helps a ton   you ll get potential new clients and it will help   do one ad every day under something specific   one day maybe dishwashers next garbage disposal next drain next water leaks   you get the point   this will help reach people after a specific thing   also it will help get your name out    2 post on your local news areas   for example your local papers website will have a section to add your business   also do a search for local forums around your area and post there    3 create a website   if you are short on cash get a site from a good name provider   do nt use go daddy as they are an evil company ha   find one local if you can and support your local economy   it might be a few dollars more but it helps everyone out and tell them how you are a new company   they might have friends and family members that can spread word of mouth   also ask them if they know of any local hosting providers   for your website i d say hire someone   it should be under 1500 for everything if its done well   if you are short on cash get wordpress and get a good blog style you like and go from there    update your blog once a week to start   this will help google see it as a site that s worth something and move you up   after 6 months you can post daily but do nt wait 5 months then post   oddly enough google will punish you at times for this   makes no sense but that s how the beast can work   your posts can be a new weekly deal   showing a new job you did   or maybe tricks that people can do themselves   while it seems that would be counter productive to business   when someone sees you as not trying to just sell something they trust you more    5 submit your site to the major search engines google it    6 post your company on local business pages   yelp google and others you have   lots of people use this   also after every job ask them to post a review on yelp and those other sites with a positive review   that might be the biggest helping factor    7 if you are in an older town just get a basic add in the yellow pages   its not hard and very helpful      8 go to your local fair events and do free contests   like a free hours worth of services   this can help you get a good rep from customers   as your company is going to live and die by word of mouth   your skills are not going to cost him much of anything except time and it will in the long run give a great rep    9 you can try mail flyers which at times can have some success but that depends on if you have an older clientele or not in your area   same goes for getting in the yellow pages   i personally am against it as most of the time these companies are scams trying to make an extra buck on you    10 call local organizations that might need you   boy scouts girl scouts and other programs   see if you can place a set of business cards at the counter at these places   this should help   this also goes for local business   auto shops and other small business tend to help each other when it comes to things like this      anyways i typed way too much but there is a great way to help

well then that kind of makes drug tests seem stupid then right i grew up in an area where oil money was big   heard handful of stories of people failing drug tests and being fired heard a few other rare stories of people working 20 + years in the oil industry who knew how to pass and smoked weed daily but you seem pretty convinced this has worked well for you so i guess its fair to ask then do you believe this is the best we can do what are your thoughts about medical conditions should opiates be treated the same as weed do you know that there s different types of weed i encourage you to keep learning and you can start to understand why so many people might be defending this topic the war on drugs is over the facts are out and proven its an extreme waste and set back to humanity step back for a second look more at the bigger picture is this really the best we can do
