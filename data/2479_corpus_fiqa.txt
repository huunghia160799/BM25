staying in idaho you could pursue some additional degree and try to get a job with a bank in the area as an investment advisor of some sort however i have doubts as to whether or not you 'd be able to employ your creativity and test your own instincts in that sort of a position if you really want to get into the big money investment sector i 'd suggest a move to a financial hub chicago new york san francisco and getting a job programming for a big firm after obtaining some experience there you may be able to transfer to a more investment oriented position at the same firm or another and from there to a position where you can unleash your talent assuming you have some putting a degree in finance somewhere in the mix would help too consider the following you want to make $ low by running a fund with a 1 expense ratio high investing other peoples money you 're dealing with at least $ 5 million that 's a good chunk of change to be entrusted with that kind of money is kind of a big deal and you 'll need to get some people to believe in your capabilities you 're not likely to get that kind of trust working out of boise even if you 're just doing research for some fund manager you 're not likely to find too many of those in boise either

it has got to do with market perceptions and expectation and the perceived future prospects of the company usually the expectation of a company 's results are already priced into the share price so if the results deviate from these expectations the share price can move up or down respectfully for example many times a company 's share price may be beaten down for increasing profits by 20 above the previous year when the expectation was that it would increase profits by 30 other times a company 's share price may rise sharply for making a 20 loss when the expectation was that it would make a 30 loss then there is also a company 's prospects for future growth and performance a company may be heading into trouble so even though they made a $ 100 m profit this year the outlook for the company may be bleak this could cause the share price to drop accordingly conversely a company may have made a loss of $ 100 m but its is turning a corner after reducing costs and restructuring this can be seen as a positive for the future causing the share price to rise also a company making $ 100 m in profits would not put that all into the bank it may pay dividends with some it may put some more towards growing the business and it might keep some cash available in case cash flows fluctuate during the year

to me your question emphasizes something i 've heard many times before personal finance is as much or more about behavior than it is about mathematics or head knowledge   sure you know you should n't be wasting a lot of money on something you will use very infrequently but how do you make this behavior stick   here are a few tricks that might help the other aspects of your question really touch more on psychology than finance   but getting yourself into a discipline habit with money will help   and realizing the full cash price of items in relation to how much your disposable income is will help you get control of your impulses as you review your budget monthly and keep limit yourself using the envelope system   but honestly everybody wants stuff they do n't have it 's human nature   the key is finding ways to put physical limits and guards on yourself to keep you from obeying the self destructive impulses

gt;when a business entity is so large and powerful its failure threatens the safety and well being of the nation it is based present in   do n't you think we should approach this issue from the other side and say that the government should be enforcing these restrictions pre in other words firms should be prevented from attaining too big to fail status it seems a bit controversial to me for a government to go in after the fact and forcefully break up a private company where was the government beforehand   gt;the government should be able to forcefully break up the company into smaller groups or laws and regulations that promote competition and allow smaller businesses the ability to compete   how is management distributed across the new entities how is intellectual property distributed it is easy to say we should break these companies up but actually breaking them up is a nightmare each of the new companies will need a duplicate management structure and invariably they will have to source outside resources to fill these roles if one firm retains the more valuable management then it has an advantage over the other firm the same goes for intellectual property or any other rare or unique assets shareholders will not receive the same dividend yield from their shares because the two companies once split will lose out on some economies of scale should the government compensate shareholders for the lost value of their shares if not why not and how is this different from the government directly seizing assets of the shareholders even though they have not committed any crime bear in mind nearly every american citizen owns shares in these companies through their retirement funding and so any loss in market cap will affect normal people not just rich investors   preservation   once again i think we need to be asking a different question how did these firms come to exist in the first place its one thing to turn around and plead to the government to break the firms up but it as the government itself which was asleep on the job and allowed the firm to reach this point anyway should we really trust the government who let the firms come into being to break them up again

yes you as the giver will owe us gift taxes if you give her that sum directly you can reduce it by taking advantage of the threshold being by person so for example if you and your wife each gave your daughter $ 17k you 'd individually be under the threshold and would n't owe gift tax even if the money comes from and goes to the same account given the time of year you could give her that now and another $ in january next tax year and avoid the gift tax if she does n't need all the money immediately that 's the simplest solution if she does need it all now and you do n't want to try arranging to   launder the money through relatives gift allowances which i think would be legal and legitimate actually the other solution is to set this up as an intra family loan web searching that phrase will find details but it essentially lets you spread the gift over multiple accounting years and pay income tax on a minimal amount of interest can be under 0.3 which you 'd also gift her with rather than paying gift tax it does require some paperwork to document and track it properly but it is n't bad i did this when making a large bridge loan to help a relative buy their new house before the old one had sold in that case it really was a loan though i 'm being paid back out of the proceeds from the sale

when you own a share you also own a vote in most cases that vote is your means of controlling the assets and management of the company if you had enough votes and wanted to trade a share for an iphone or liquidate the company entirely you could do it the only thing that prevents you from doing that is that companies are not set up to handle the transaction that way stock holders are usually trying to buy investments not iphones there are companies that have more cash in the bank than the market cap total value of their stock they usually do n't remain as public companies for long in that case an investor or group of investors buy them up and split the cash if you had enough shares of apple you could do that to or just trade one for an iphone

my feeling on this is that anything to do with a child and raising a family has to be a joint effort it is very rare that both of you will have exactly the same income or the same time to spend into caring for your family so work out what you can do for us i work 70 + hour weeks my wife works 18 hour weeks far more of my money goes on clothes kids food etc than her money because that is where the bulk of our income is from it 's just part of sharing she does n't feel dependent and when she was on maternity leave 3 times the agreement was that we would just rely on my income i have the same attitude as you it is a shared pool that you each contribute to in your own way and once the essentials are paid for this includes post pregnancy clothing then you can worry about other bits and pieces having said that while most of our finances are shared we do each keep a separate account for buying gifts things for ourselves etc which gives some flexibility

why simply because it has been mandated as law and so you may have no choice in the matter whether to contribute or not quoting from gov.uk workplace pensions automatic   a new law means that every employer must automatically workers    into a workplace pension scheme if they next even if you think you will work until you die you can still access the money saved in the pension scheme when you attain the required minimum age for withdrawals under your scheme for instance that may be age 55 but it may also vary by scheme becoming fully retired as in stopping all work is not a requirement to access retirement income from your pension scheme in the eyes of a pension scheme retirement is typically when you elect to take your income benefits according to the established rules of the scheme quoting from working past state pension age continuing in work and your workplace pension   if you reached the age at which you can start claiming your workplace    pension scheme you do n't need to stop work in order to claim you have    a number of options including taking some of the pension you 've built    up while continuing to work for the same employer as to why things are set up this way while some younger folk may today expect to continue working until death for a variety of reasons that is n't always possible two typical such reasons are disability and involuntary unemployment i.e. willing and able but still ca n't land the next job moreover plans change young workers with health and vitality may expect they 'll always feel but end up learning otherwise over time and may come to appreciate the savings that were forced upon them the forced savings aspect of state and state sponsored pension schemes are meant to provide some safety net for those later years when it is a strong possibility that one ca n't continue to work the alternative is to be a 100 burden on family and/or society

i doubt that there is an arrangement with any country that would allow you to transfer money out of a 401(k and roll it over to another country that is n't governed by us tax laws without taking a distribution   the us government wo n't let you pull out like that without taking its cut there may be but i 'd be surprised   check around in the appropriate venues if you 're making a distribution that incurs penalties then that 's what you 're doing   if you can do so without incurring penalties then great for you just deposit into the vehicle of your choice in your country

a 401k plan will ask you to name a beneficiary who will receive the funds if you do n't withdraw them all before death usually a primary beneficiary and a secondary beneficiary is requested if you do n't specify a beneficiary your estate is the beneficiary by default   note that the name supplied to the 401k plan is who will get the money and you can not change this by the money in your will for example if you neglected to change the beneficiary upon divorce it is useless to say in your will that the money in the 401k plan goes to your new wife the 401k plan will give it to your ex wife who still remains the beneficiary of your 401k money in a 401k plan is what is called income with respect to a decedent   on which income tax is levied and it is also is part of your estate and thus liable to be subject to estate tax   the latter is true even if the 401k plan assets are not mentioned anywhere in your will and even if the assets got sent to your ex wife which is not what you wanted to have happen   there are various estate tax exceptions for spouse beneficiaries no   estate tax due now but will be charged when the spouse passes away with regard to income tax the beneficiaries of a 401k plan similarly iras 403b plans etc generally get to take the whole amount and pay the income   tax themselves edit in response to littleadv 's comments each 401k plan is different and some plans especially the smaller ones may prefer to distribute the   401k assets as a lump sum rather than allow the beneficiaries to withdraw   the money over several years and pay income tax on the amount withdrawn each year this is because there are far too many rules and regulations to trip over when making withdrawals over several years the lump sum distribution can be transferred into a newly established   inherited ira see the nolo article linked to in @littleadv 's answer for some details and some pitfalls to avoid and the income tax is thus deferred until withdrawals occur   spouse   beneficiaries are entitled to more generous rules than non spouse   beneficiaries if your heirs are otherwise well provided for and you are in a   philanthropic mood or you do n't want to give 'em a dime the who never call not even on father 's day one way of avoiding a   lot of tax is to make the beneficiary of your 401k be one or more of your favorite charities in fact if your testamentary inclination is to make some charitable as part of your will it is much more advantageous to give money from a tax deferred account to the charity size of estate is reduced no income   tax paid by anyone on amount given and assets in non retirement accounts to one 's heirs are not taxable income and heirs get a step up in basis for assets that have appreciated rather than the other way around heirs pay income tax as they withdraw the money from tax deferred   account estate planning is a complicated business and you really should talk to a professional about such matters and not rely on advice from an internet forum

for what it 's worth the distribution i 'm currently using is roughly with about 2/3 of the money sitting in my 401(k i should note that this is actually considered a moderately aggressive position i need to phone my advisor not a broker so they are n't biased toward things which are more profitable for them and check whether i 've gotten close enough to retirement that i should readjust those numbers could i do better maybe at higher risk and higher fees that would be likely to eat most of the improved returns or by spending far more time micromanaging my money than i have any interest in i 've validated this distribution using the various stochastic models and it seems to work well enough that i 'm generally content with it as i noted in a comment elsewhere many of us will want to get up into this range before we retire i figure that if i hit $ 1.8 m i can probably sustain my lifestyle solely on the income despite expected inflation and thus be safely covered for life so this is n't all that huge a chunk of cash by today 's standards cue duck i 'm rich i 'm wealthy i 'm comfortably well off $ 2 m these days is comfortably well off

a falling exchange rate is an indication of falling confidence in a currency   countries like iran or venezuela with a managed exchange rate set their exchange rates at a higher value than the market accepts such market expectations may be influenced by poor government management interventions into markets such as businesses or general instability scarcity the governments act to manage that uncertainty by limiting the availability of foreign exchange and pegging the exchange rate    since there is an inadequate supply of trusted foreign currency people turn to informal exchanges in order to hedge their currency risk   this creates a negative feedback loop   people in government who have access to foreign exchange start to trade on informal markets pocketing the difference in the official and unofficial rates   the increasing gap between the two rates drives increasing informal market exchange and can result in speculative bubbles driving instability or economic contradiction is that the massive and increasing difference between the official and market exchange rates becomes a powerful form of rent for government officials this drives further state led rent seeking behaviour and causes the economy to become even more unstable if you 're interested in a more formal academic study of how such parallel markets in currency arise zimbabwe ’s black market for foreign exchange by albert at the university of is a useful source

you are right in insisting upon a proper b2b contract in any business relationship you wish to reduce your risk and be compensated fairly in addition to the cost and complexity of international wire transfers the us companies may also be considering the fact that as an international contractor in a relatively hard to reach jurisdiction payments to you place the company at higher risk than payments to a domestic contractor by insisting upon paypal or similar they are reducing their internal complexity and reducing their financial exposure to disputed contract terms therefore wire payments are hard in an internal business sense as well as in a remittance transfer reporting sense the internal business procedure will likely be the hardest to overcome changing risk management is harder than filling out forms

i know this can be confusing because you tend to think of money being worth the face value so let 's eliminate that for the sake of an example that will be easier to understand let 's say your friend loaned you rock worth $ 10 today he expects you to pay him back an identical rock whenever you can now let 's also assume that historically the price of rocks tends to go down every year at some point you will need to buy a rock to pay your friend back because they keep getting cheaper it costs less to buy the payback rock the longer you wait replace a dollar with a rock in the example and you have your answer this is known as the time value of money in reality this is priced into the loan via the interest rate because the lender very much understands the math going on here also it is more complicated because the longer you delay payment the more interest you pay if you will so it does n't usually work to your advantage unless they underpriced the loan 's interest rate

when you purchase a mortgage you have to prove the source of your down payment   primarily this is so that the mortgage lender knows that there are no other outstanding liens against the property   if you show that some or part of your down payment was a gift there is no fraud but it may affect your qualification for the mortgage consult a lawyer in your area to determine if there is a legal way to gift the money that is not taxed   if all else fails you could just pay the tax   also you should research whether your gift is above the floor of taxable gifts

they 're not going to look very hard at the asset value except for actual cash in the bank which does n't bear much relationship to the real value of the company more likely they will look at the last three years earnings and choose a target p e ratio based on that the owner 's share depends entirely on how much of the business they choose to sell if the business is worth $ 60 m and they want to raise $ 20 m for themselves then that means selling 33 of the company if they want to raise $ 20 m for the business as well then that means selling half the company and retaining ownership of the other half which is now worth $ 80 m because of the cash infusion but many stock exchanges will have minimum requirements for the percentage of the shares that are trading freely so they will have to sell at least that much

when you pay off a loan early you pay the remaining principal and you save all of the remaining interest so you do save on interest but it 's the interest you would have paid in the future not the interest you have paid in the past your remaining balance when you pay off the loan only includes the principal not the projected interest interest is a factor of the amount borrowed the interest rate and the amount of time you borrow the money the sooner you repay the money the less interest you pay imagine if you had taken a 30 year loan at 4 interest but were allowed to make no payments until the loan term ended if you waited 15 years to make your first payment you would n't owe the same money as if you 'd made payments every month no instead of owing you 'd owe because you had borrowed $ 100k for 15 years plus the interest due rather than borrowing a declining sum so that 's why you do n't get a refund on interest for previous months if you had started with a 16 year loan then you would have been paying more principal every month and your monthly amount due would have been higher to reflect that as you paid the principal off faster the interest each month would drop faster paying a huge portion of the principal at the end of the loan is not the same as steadily paying it down in the same time frame you will pay a lot more interest in the former case and rightfully so it might help to consider a credit card payment in comparison if you run up a balance and pay only the minimum each month you pay a lot of interest over time because your principal goes down slowly if you suddenly pay off your credit card you do n't have to pay any more interest but you also do n't get any interest back for previous months that 's because the interest accrued each month is based on your current balance just like your mortgage the minimum payments are calculated differently but the interest accrued each month uses essentially the same mechanism

it depends on the seller   if the seller wants they can collect the information from you and send it to the payment gateway   in that case they of course have everything that you provide at some point   they are not supposed to keep the security code and there are rules about keeping the credit card number safe    the first four digits of the credit card number often indicate the bank although smaller banks may share   but for example a capital one card would indicate the bank    other sellers work through a payment gateway that collects the information   even there the seller may collect most of the information first and send it to the gateway   in particular the seller may collect name email phone and address information   and in general the gateway will reveal that kind of information   they will not give the seller credit card info other than the name on the card expiration date and possible last four digits   they may report if the address matches the card 's billing address addresses may mean fraud    buying through someone like paypal can provide the least information   for a digital good paypal can only expose the buyer 's name which may be a business name and email associated with the payment account   however paypal still has the other information and may expose it under legal action e.g. if the credit card transaction is reversed or the good sold is illegal   and even paypal will expose the shipping address for physical goods that require shipping

on expiry with the underlying share price at $ 46 we have you ask   how come they 600 100 why because you have sold the $ 45 call to open you position you must now buy it back to close your position   this will cost you $ 100 so you are debited for $ 100 and this debit is being represented as a negative subtracted i.e. because you have purchased the $ 40 call to open your position you must now sell it to close your position   upon selling this option you will receive $ 600 so you are credited with $ 600 and this credit is represented as a positive added i.e. + $ 600 therefore upon settlement closing your position will get you $ = $ 500   this is the first point you are questioning    however you should also note that this is the value of the spread at settlement and it does not include the costs of opening the spread position which are given as $ 200 so you net profit is $ = $ 300 you then comment   i know i am selling 45 call that means as a writer i want stock price to go down or stay at strike as a buyer i want stock price to go up here note that for every penny that the underlying share price rises above $ 45 the money you will pay to buy back your short $ 45 call option will be offset by the money you will receive by selling the long $ 40 call option   your $ 40 call option is covering the losses on your short $ 45 call option no matter how high the underlying price settles above $ 45 you will receive the same $ 500 net credit on settlement   for example if the underlying price settles at $ 50 then you will receive a credit of $ 1000 for selling your $ 40 call but you will incur a debit of $ 500 against for buying back your short $ 45 call   the net being $ 500 = $   this point is made in response to your comments posted under dr. jones answer

the problem is that both the h1b and l1 visas have problems and are gamed and this is what is probably causing resentment   h1b visas have quotas that run out in one day a year it means for a company to employ someone with skills they need to throw a bunch of them at this yearly crap shoot and hope they manage to win a visa for one of them   the rest will have to wait another year to try again   this is not how businesses employ if they find a highly skilled foreign worker with skills they ca n't find in the us and are even willing to pay him more than anyone in the us they ca n't unless they want to play that yearly gamble   a highly skilled employee also do n't want to sit around waiting for it so they 'll work for someone else   the l1 visa at least allows large multi national companies to first employ people at one of their foreign offices for a year before them over to the us   it 's also good in a way to be able to figure out if the employee is as good as he seems on paper and in interviews even before he gets to the usa   this means most of the better skills probably enter the usa this way which leaves the h1b visas to who systematically game the system   they find a lot of young graduate applicants who are willing to wait for the yearly crapshoot and then take all those who win a visa and then employ them and contract them out competitively   the l1 visa can also be systematically gamed those who do n't win an h1b visa could be working for a foreign office of this consultancy in the meantime and then get a transfer to the usa on an l1 visa   i think what needs to happen is that the h1b visa bar should be raised e.g. a minimum salary and then the quotas should be spread over a year like they do in the uk   that means companies have more certainty that they can actually bring a skilled worker in and it would make sure it 's a skilled worker and not someone who is just a cheaper worker   then that would ideally shift the route for most skilled workers to h1b instead of l1 visas which means l1 visas can be tightened to make sure they are used appropriately too for example having to have worked for the company for 2 years instead of one and also a minimum salary

what was the true reason they wanted to use my accounts for we would n't know the true reason the scammer can do multiple things what exactly he would do in your case i am very eager to know what a person was up to who would give to me so much information about themselves i know some of you will jump on the chance to yell it was not their true address but it is where they wanted me to send the cards to and i was to give proof of my identification ie a copy of my drivers license my articles of incorporation and the real estate development project prospectus also they were only willing to work with certain banks ie citibank bank of america etc i can not understand what they were doing wanting such access to accounts that had no money in them save the amount i used to open them with it looks more like they would open accounts under your name but they would be controlling the accounts i.e. what goes in and out i.e. they would be able to deposit and withdraw from a new account they set up they would want to use this account for illegal activities so that if caught the account opening paper trail leads to you even if they gave you an address it could be rental like they have copies of your company registration and id proofs they can use these to get another rental property and then send letters to some and ask them to met there

given that such activities are criminal and the people committing them have to hide them from the law it 's very unlikely that an investor could detect them let alone one from a different country the only things that can realistically help is to keep in mind the adage if something sounds too good to be true it probably is and to stick to relatively large companies since they have more auditing requirements and fraud is much harder to hide at scale but not impossible see enron edit and of course diversify this kind of thing is rare and not systematic so diversification is a very good protection

i agree a disciplined environment is key to knowledge getting deeply i remember at my university there were some great professors about 10 to 20 were not very good at all and a video online of a great professor would have been much better   i suspect there 's some analogy from the field of entertainment that will play out here when movies got sound you had the best entertainers in the world available for everyone albeit in a more limited capacity than live so a great performer on screen is more appealing than some percent of the lowest group this technology killed but i doubt it will kill off the entire university system like it killed i suspect the lowest performers will be out the door and the hippie professor types that do n't provide motivation and structure will be out i wonder if we 'll have professor stars like we had movie stars and now have celebrity chefs and

you and your daughter need to consult a lawyer   generally the court decides how the family debts get split in a divorce and it sounds like the court decided that this student debt belongs solely to your daughter and not her husband   whether that was the correct decision or not depends on lots of details but of course your daughter did n't help herself at all by getting a cheap divorce and not having her own attorney   at this point you and your daughter should consult a good attorney show him or her the divorce decree and the loan paperwork and he or she should be able to tell you if anything can be done   as far as your own personal exposure to the debt as the cosigner that depends on the paperwork you signed and is another question for the attorney

while the other answers are good i wanted to expand a little on why i feel a roth is a bad way to go unless you are young first let 's pretend you have a 25 tax rate and your investments will go up 5 per year for 10 years you contribute 6 of income for one year you can do a traditional or a roth 401k ira here 's the math traditional 6 of income invested grows at 5 for 10 years taxed at 25 on withdrawl = income 6 1.05 ^ 10 100 25 = income 6 .75 = of your original income but this is after taxes roth taxes taken out of income then 6 of that goes into the fund(s still grows at 5 for 10 years not taxed at withdrawl = income 100 25 6 1.05 ^ 10 = income 75 6 = of your original income again this is after taxes look familiar they are the same it 's the simple property of mathematics so why do a traditional vs. a roth the reason is that your tax bracket changes this changes because your income changes say when you retire you plan to have your home or vehicle paid for you expect to be able to live on $ 50,000 per year this means when you make more than $ 50,000 you should do a traditional plan and when you make less than this you should do a roth plan example you make $ 100,000 and your upper bracket is now 30 you save 30 by doing a traditional and then pay back 10 20 and 30 as you withdraw a salary of $ 50,000 traditional = better example you make $ 30,000 annually your upper bracket is 20 you pay 20 on a roth then you withdraw funds to get to $ 50,000 and never pay the higher bracket roth = better roth advocates typically bring up tax rates of course they will go up they insist so you always should do a roth not so fast taxes have gone down in recent years no one please start a political debate with me some went up some went down but overall federal income rates dropped even if taxes rose 5 a traditional will still be better than a roth in many cases

as an expansion on the correct answer consider a really boring economy   nothing changes   wages and prices stay constant for years at a time   every month the consumer price index stays at 0    then something catastrophic happens say on july 31 2000 a cheap local source for a vital resource runs out and it must be obtained from a higher cost source   floods cut internal road networks resulting in higher transportation costs   whatever   the new situation is permanent as a result the next month august 2000 prices go up 5   that is 5 higher than the previous month july 2000 and 5 higher than a year previously august 1999 there is a lot of and politicians each promise that they and only they can inflation to the ground but when the figures for september 2000 come out inflation stays the same   prices are the same as in august 2000 and 5 higher than in september 1999 this goes on for months   nothing changes prices stay the same and the inflation rate year over year stays at 5 finally the figures for august 2001 come out   wonder of wonders   prices are the same as in august 2000 and inflation drops to zero    and the politicians all take the credit short version inflation year over year changes either because of what in now included in the month just past or what is now excluded from a year ago

an experienced individual would n't ask such questions   i do n't say this to take a at you but to provide context   the matter is much more complicated than a simple answer to your question could accomplish the short answer is no not necessarily but it depends on the details generally if the employer matches it 's suggested that you take advantage of the match   it 's free money   that said it comes with some strings attached like a vesting schedule   it 's not yours right away necessarily   choices are limited in a 401k but we should still come out ahead with that free money the investment choices available in a 401k are also a part of the details   if they meet your needs you should certainly consider the 401k even if the employer does n't match there is also the matter of one 's particular tax situation which is certainly an involved matter   a 401k can certainly be a part of judicious tax planning   it 's a matter of working out the details continuing this theme of details and coming back to the employer match if the employer does n't i would make sure that i 'm maxing out an ira before considering the 401k   if the employer matched i would probably contribute to take advantage of that match   however it quickly becomes complicated here   i 'm accustomed to employer matching up to some percentage of pay which typically works out to be less then the contribution limits for a 401k   so i my plan for such a situation is to contribute up to the employer match in the 401k then max out an ira and then return to the 401k to finish contributing up to its yearly maximum there is plenty for you to consider in order to come up with a plan of action   while it 's certainly complicated it 's accessible to most people   you do n't have to be a genius   in fact are regularly by the markets

boards of directors are required for corporations by nearly all jurisdictions   some jurisdictions have almost self defeating requirements however such as in tax havens boards of directors are compensated by the company for which they sit   historically they have set their own compensation almost always with tight qualitative legal bounds but in the us that has now changed so investors now set director compensation   directors are typically not given wages or salary for work but compensation for expenses   for larger companies this is semantics since compensation averages around one quarter of a million of usd regulations almost always agencies such as other corporations from sitting on boards and individuals convicted of serious crimes as well   some jurisdictions will even restrict directories to other qualities such as solvency while directors are elected by shareholders their obligations are normally to the company and each jurisdiction has its own set of rules for this   almost always directors are forbidden from selling access to their votes directors are almost always elected by holders of voting stock after a well publicized announcement and extended time period investors are almost never restricted from sitting on a board so long as they meet the requirements described above

this question is very open ended but i 'll try to answer parts of it an employer can offer shares as part of a compensation package instead of paying cash the employer can use the money to buy up shares and give them to the employees this is done to keep employees for longer periods of time and the employer may also want to create more insider ownership for a number of reasons another possibility is issuance of secondary offerings that are partially given to employees secondary offerings often lower the price of the shares in the market and create an incentive for employees to stay until the stock price rises all of these conditions can be stipulated look up golden handcuffs usually stock gifts are only given to a few high level employees and as part of a bonus package it is very unusual to see a mature company regularly give away large amounts of stock as this is a frowned upon practice start ups often pay their employees with stock up until the company is acquired or goes public

i do n't know really is the best investment strategy people think that they have to know everything to make money but realistically out of the hundreds of thousands of publicly traded securities you really can only invest in a tiny number of them of the course of a week you literally have more than a million buy or do n't buy decisions because the prices of those securities fluctuate every day   simply due to the fact that there are so many securities you can not know what everything is going to do you have to say i do n't know also when you do understand something it is usually fairly priced so will you make money on it i do n't know only very rarely will you find something that you actually understand well and it is significantly undervalued you can be looking at a company a day for two years before you find it but people get trigger happy they bet on odds when they should only bet on odds or higher   if you are forced to bet on everything it makes sense that you bet on everything you believe is greater than 50 chance of winning but since you can not bet on everything you should only bet on the highest quality bets those with greater than 90 chance of winning to find such a bet you may have to shuffle through 100 different companies and only make 2 3 bets you are looking for something that is at least 2 standard deviations away from the mean   people are not good at doing a lot of work most of which yields nothing to find one big payoff they are wired to only look at the present so they take the best bet they can see at the moment which is often barely above 50 and with any it may actually be well below 50 and people are not good at understanding compound geometric growth you can keep 10 gains 1.10 1.10 1.10 but that can all be wiped out by multiplying by one zero which is why taking a bet is so dangerous even though technically it is an advantageous one they forget to adjust for the geometric aspect of compounding a bet is one you should take but if you are allowed to repeat it and you keep going all in you will eventually lose and have $ 0 which is the same as if you took a single all in bet that has 0 chance of winning   as buffett says if you are only allowed to make 20 investments over a lifetime you will most likely do better because it prevents you from making many of these mistakes

whether or not you choose to buy is a complicated question   i will answer as what you should consider think about as i do n't think what should i do is on topic first off renting tends to look expensive compared to mortgages until you factor in the other costs that are included in your rent property taxes   these are a few grand a year even in the worst areas and tend to be more   find out what the taxes are ahead of time   even though you can often deduct them and your interest you 're giving up your standard deduction to do so and with the low interest regime currently unless your taxes are high you may not end up being better off deducting them home insurance this depends on home and area but is at least hundreds of dollars per year and could easily run a thousand   so another hundred a month on your bill and it 's more than renter 's insurance by quite a lot upkeep costs for the property   you 've got a lot of up front costs buy a etc types of things plus a lot of ongoing costs general repair plumbing breaks electrical breaks whatnot    sales commission as scott notes in comments   when you sell you 're paying about 6 commission so you wo n't be above water if housing prices stay flat until you 've paid off 6 of your loan value plus closing costs another couple of percent   you hit the 90 point on a 15 year about year 2 but on a 30 year you do n't hit it until about year 5 so you might not be above water when you want to sell risk of decrease in value whenever you buy property you take on the risk of losing value as well as the potential of gaining value   do n't assume that because prices are going up they will continue to remember that a lot of investors are well aware of possible profits from rising prices and will be buying and driving prices up themselves   2008 was a shock to a lot of people even in areas where it seemed like prices should 've still gone up you never know what 's going to happen   if you buy a house for 20 or so down you have a bit of a safety net if it drops 10 20 in value you 're still above water though you do of course lose money while if you buy it for 0 down and it drops 20 in value you wo n't be able to sell at all for years all that together means you should really take a hard look at the costs and benefits make a realistic calculation including all actual costs and then make a decision i would not buy simply because it seems like a good idea to not pay rent   if you 're unable to make any down payment then you 're also unable to deal with the risks in home ownership not just decrease in value but when your pipe bursts and ruins your basement or when the roof needs a replacement because a tree falls on it   yes home insurance helps but not always and the deductible will still get you just to have some numbers for my area we pay about $ 8000 a year in property taxes on a $ 280k house $ 200k mortgage $ 1k a year in home insurance so our escrow payment is about $ 750 a month   a 15 year for $ 200k is about $ 1400 a month so $ 2200 or so total cost   we do live in a high property tax area so someone in lower tax regimes would pay less say 1800 1900 but not that cheap   a 30 year would save you 500 or so a month but you 're still not all that much lower than rent

they are not basically holds independent pharmacies who do business with them at gun point contracts are structured in such a way which states a pharmacy must spend 90 95 of their monthly drug expenses on meaning they are free to inflate the prices as much as they want and the pharmacies ca n't do anything about it as they are contractually obligated to buy from them   furthermore the savings incentives they offer independent pharmacies are through rebate spend and they introduce really convoluted rebates further masking their actual price for cost of goods and also discouraging spending outside their website often the pharmacist does not have the time to keep track of what is on rebate and shopping around may put them in serious risk of loosing out on money or fines   you may wonder why pharmacies sign such unfavorable contracts the answer is there are n't many players in the industry who can provide all the drugs required to run a pharmacy the much cheaper alternate suppliers do not have the inventory and drug selection a pharmacy can shop around and there are some that do but the vast majority do not have the manpower to do so i will state i am no pharmacist but being around pharmacy owners they blame the wholesalers for how corrupt the system is

derivatives derive their value from underlying assets   this is expressed by the obligation of at least one counterparty to trade with the other counterparty in the future   these can take on as many combinations as one can dream up as it is a matter of contract for futures where two parties are obligated to trade at a specific price at a specific date in the future one buyer one seller if you short a future you have entered into a contract to sell the underlying at the time specified   if the price of the future moves against you goes up you will have to sell at a loss   the bigger the move the greater the loss   you go ahead and pay this as well as a little extra to be sure that you satisfy what you owe due to the future   this satisfaction is called margin if there were n't margin people could take huge losses on their derivative bets not pay and disrupt the markets   making sure that the money that will trade is already there makes the markets run smoothly it 's the same for shorting stocks where you borrow the stock sell it and wait   you have to leave the money with the broker as well as deposit a little extra to be sure you can make good if the market moves to a large degree against you

you will find lots of rules of thumb but there is no universal truth to how much you should save there are factors you do need to consider though you should start as early as possible to set money aside for retirement you should then use a retirement calculator to at least get an understanding of the amount you need to set aside each month to achieve the desired retirement income your default should be not to spend money and only spend money when you must leisure travel and eating out should come last after you have saved up you should have funds for different terms for example my wife and i have an emergency fund for unexpected expenses or losses in income the rule of thumb here generally is to have 3 6 months of salary saved up a longer term fund should be created for larger expenses like buying a car or preparing the on a property finally the retirement fund which should cover your needs after you have retired

for all stocks expected dividends are a part of the price it is traded for consider that originally the whole idea of stocks was to participate in the earnings of the company = get dividends the day the dividend is paid that expectation is of course removed and thereby the stock value reduced by just the amount of dividend paid you will see that behavior for all stocks everywhere the dividend in your example is just high relative to the stock price but that is a company decision they can decide whatever amount they want as a dividend in other words the day before dividend payments investors value the stock at $ plus an expected dividend payment of 12 $ which adds to 26 $ the day after the dividend payment investors still value the stock at $ plus no more dividend payment = 0 $ nothing changed really in the valuation

you definitely need more information this could be a number of things first of all i do n't understand the reason for the 48 hours i would definitely ask them to clarify why this is the case why are they noticing this a year later   you are indeed a participant in the company 401k the plan is theirs and you are agreeing to play by their rules when you enroll i would call hr and get more info this could be excess contribution or a bank error in your favor that they have found it sounds like they over matched your 401k sense they want the money back

you said your mother in law lives with you does she pay rent or are you splitting the cost of housing that would also have to figured into the equation   if you had a business you would now have to declare the expense on your business taxes this would also then be income for her which she would have to account for on her taxes remember there are both state and federal taxes involved regarding expenses like diapers if the mil had the business she could deduct them as a business expense if you have the business it would greatly complicate the taxes your business would be essentially covering your personal expenses if your mil was not a business the cost of diapers would be paid by you regardless of the working situation of you and your spouse to claim the tax credit you must report the name address and taxpayer identification number    either the social security number or the employer identification    number of the care provider on your return if the care provider is a    tax exempt organization you need only report the name and address on    your return you can use form pdf dependent care provider 's    identification and certification to request this information from the    care provider if you do not provide information regarding the care    provider you may still be eligible for the credit if you can show    that you exercised due diligence in attempting to provide the required    information the irs will be looking for an income tax form from your mil that claims the income   getting too cute with the babysitting situation by starting a business just for the purpose of saving money on taxes could invite an audit also it is not as if you just claim 3000 and you are good to go you can only claim a percentage of the expenses based on the household agi the more the make the more you have to have in expenses to get the full 3000 credit which mil cause more taxes for your mil plus the whole issue with having to pay social security and other taxes on a household employee it might be best to skip the risk of the audit claiming your mil as a dependent might just be easier

gt the less chance of people defaulting   you know a non trivial part of the mortgages out there are adjustable right   did you never study what happened when in 07 after rates went up 4 in a year or two   rising interest rates are also a factor in rent prices meaning rent prices go up and people wo n't be saving as much investment accounts savings will be taking a shit because of severe fiscal policy    gt more people buying with flat cash   how much cash do you think the average american has ready to pay for a home   i agree higher interest rates will definitely lead to lower home prices that 's ultimately what happened in 07 but you need to stop thinking about a ceteris paribus model and begin considering the cascade of other variables and what the impact of housing affordability is from their respective changes as well

there is a positive not being mentioned above the depreciation vs your regular earned income disclaimer i am not a tax attorney or an accountant nor do i play one on the internet i am however a landlord with that important caveat out of the way rental properties and improvements to them depreciate in value on a well defined schedule you can claim that depreciation as a phantom loss to lower the amount of your taxable regular income if you make a substantial amount of the latter it can be a huge boon in the first few years you own the property you can claim the depreciation as if the property were new so take the advice of a random stranger on the internet to your accountant attorney and see how much it helps you

in order to compare the two you need to compare your entire portfolio which is not just how much money you have but how much stock in both scenarios you start with at least but let 's assume £ 20 and 0 stock in your scenario you buy 10 shares leaving you with £ 0 and 10 shares you then sell it at £ to cut your losses leaving you with £ 15 and 0 shares that concludes the first transaction with a net loss of £ 5 in a second transaction you then buy 10 shares again at £ 1/share leaving you with £ 5 and 10 shares you are still down £ 15 from the start but you also still have 10 shares any further profit or loss depends on what you can get for those 10 shares in the future in a short sale you borrow 10 shares and sell them leaving you with £ 40 your initial £ 20 plus what you just made on the short sale and -10 shares of stock at the end of the contract you must buy 10 shares to return them you are able to do so at £ leaving you with £ 25 and 0 shares at this point your exposure to the stock is complete and you have a net gain of £ 5

i think you 're right that from a pure expected future value perspective it makes sense to pay this loan off as quickly as possible including not taking the next year 's loan the new student loans with the higher interest rates have changed the balance enough that it 's no longer automatically better to keep it going as long as possible the crucial point in your case which is n't true for many people is that you will likely have to pay it off eventually anyway and so in terms of net costs over your lifetime you will do best by paying it off quickly a few points to set against that that you might want to consider not paying it off is a good hedge against your career not going as well as you expect e.g. if the economy does badly you have health problems you take a career break for any reason if that happens you would end up not being forced to pay it off so will end up gaining from not having done so voluntarily the money you save in that case could be more valuable to you that the money you would lose if your career does go well not paying it off will increase your net cash earlier in life when you are more likely to need it e.g. for a house deposit having more free cash could increase your options making it possible to buy a house earlier in life or it could mean you have a higher deposit when you do buy reducing the interest rate on the entire mortgage balance the savings from that could end up being more than the 6 interest on the loan even though when you look at the loan in isolation it seems like a very bad rate

if you have an increasing population but a steady supply of wealth then there will be a perceived effect of decline   as the average person can afford less and less   if inflation is factored in this effect is accelerated as the value of money is reduced but the availability of that money is as well   in this model those who have tend to accumulate as they produce and those who do not have tend to lose wealth as they consume to fill basic needs at ever increasing prices with a declining source of income exacerbating the effect    if you control your population prevent inflation and deflation and maintain a constant production consumption cycle that is perfectly in balance then you could have that utopian society   but in practice there is waste   that waste makes maintaining that balance impractical at best   people have different desires and motivations   so while that utopian society that you propose seems possible at the theoretical level when solely looking at the mechanics and economics in practice it becomes more about managing the people   which makes the task virtually impossible as for the debt issue that is the strategy of many of the western nations   most of them experienced growth over the last 50 years that was unprecedented in history   many of them simply assumed it would continue indefinitely and failed to plan for a downturn   in addition they planned for the growth and borrowed based on the assumptions   when the growth slowed several continued to use the same projections for their budgeting with the effect of spending money they would not take in   so in a way yes the growth is needed to service the continued growth of debt unless the government issuing that debt is willing to reduce its expenses

i do n't think you 've mentioned which state you 're in here in ontario a person who is financially incapable can have their financial responsibility and authority removed and assigned to a trustee the trustee might be a responsible next of kin as her ex you would appear unsuitable that being a potential conflict of interest otherwise it can be the public guardian and trustee it that happens then the trustee handles the money and handles makes any contracts on behalf of in the name of the incapable person the incapable person might have income e.g. spousal support payments and money e.g. bank accounts which the trustee can document in order to demonstrate credit worthiness or at least solvency for the time being the kids see it as an adventure but i suspect it will get old very fast i hope you have a counsellor to talk with about your personal relationships i 've had or tried several and at least one has been extraordinarily helpful you 're not actually expressing a worry about the children being abused or neglected is your motive for asking that you want her to have a place so that the children will like it being there better as long as your kids see it as an adventure perhaps you can be happy for them perhaps i do n't know depending on the people too it 's a good or at least a better thing that they are visiting with friends and relatives and a better topic with those people might be how they show your children a good time instead of your ex 's money one possible way i thought of co signing is if a portion of child spousal support goes directly to the landlord i asked the child support services who deduct money from my paycheck monthly to pay support to my ex and they told me that they are not authorized to do this perhaps i do n't know there is some way to do that if you have your ex 's cooperation and a lawyer and perhaps a judge you have n't said what portions of your payments are for child support versus spousal support nor who has custody etc if a large part of the support is for the children then perhaps the children can rent the place idea note that in ontario there are two decisions to make 1 financial and 2 personal care which includes housing and medical someone can retain their own self care authority even if they 're judged financially incapable or vice versa if there 's a personal care or medical decision which they can not understand the technical language is mentally incapable of managing property this term applies to a person who is unable to understand information that is relevant to     making a decision or is unable to appreciate the reasonably foreseeable consequences of a     decision or lack of decision about his or her property processes for certifying an     individual as being mentally incapable of managing property are prescribed in the substitute decisions act and in the mental health act the mental heath act is for medical emergencies only but ontario has a substitute decisions act as well an intent of the law is to protect vulnerable people people may also acquire and/or name their own trustee and/or guardian voluntarily via a power of attorney a living will etc i do n't know how about offering the landlord a year 's rent in advance or in trust i guess that 1 a court order can determine override guarantee the way in which the child support payments are directed 2 it 's easier to get that order agreement if you and your ex cooperate 3 there are housing specialists in your neighborhood they can buy housing instead of renting it or be given gifted housing to live in

my company did not have income of $ 1000 and have a $ 500 expense why not your company received $ 1000 from you and based on its agreement with the other company transferred out half of it how does it not translate to having $ 1000 income and $ 500 expense when i run a report i want to see that my business has $ 500 of income not $ 1000 with a $ 500 expense you can write in your reports whatever you want but if you want to see the real picture then that is exactly what you should be expecting that said transferring money from yourself to your company is generally not considered income you can have it booked as owner 's equity or a owner 's loan if the company is required to repay unless you 're paying to your company for some services provided or assets transferred that is

i 'm surprised nobody else has suggested this yet before you start investing in stocks or bonds buy a house not just any house but the house you want to live in 20 years from now in a place where you want to live 20 years from now but you also have to be savvy about which part of the country or world you buy in i 'm also assuming that you are in the usa although my suggestion tends to apply equally anywhere in the world why simple as long as you own a house you wo n't ever have to pay rent you do have to pay taxes and maintenance of course you have a guaranteed return on investment and the best part is because it 's not money you earn but money you do n't have to spend it 's tax free even if the house loses value over time you still come out ahead and if you live abroad temporarily you can rent out the house and add the rent to your savings although that does make various things more complicated you only asked for options so that is mine i 'll add some caveats ok now here are the caveats

this probably wo n't be a popular answer due to the many number of disadvantaged market participants out there but yes it is possible to distort the markets for securities this way but it is more useful to understand how this works for any market since it is illegal in securities markets where company shares are involves   since you asked about the company apple you should be aware this is a form of market manipulation and is illegal when dealing with securities in any supply and demand market this is possible especially during periods when other market participants are not prevalent now the way to do this usually involves having multiple accounts you control where you are acting as multiple market participants with different brokers etc the most ways to do with involve shell companies w/ brokerage accounts but this is usually to mask illegal behavior in the securities markets where there are consequences for manipulating the shares of securities in other markets this is not necessary because there is no authority prohibiting this kind of trading behavior account b buys from account a account a buys from account b etc the biggest issue is getting all of the accounts capitalized initially the third issue is then actually being able to make a profit from doing this at all because eventually one of your accounts will have all of the shares or whatever and there would still be no way to sell them because there are no other market participants to sell to since you were the only one moving the price therefore this kind of market manipulation is coupled with promotions to attract liquidity to a financial product note the mere fact of a promotion does not mean that illegal trading behavior is occurring but it does usually mean that someone else is selling into the liquidity another way to make this kind of trading behavior profitable is via the derivatives market options contracts are priced solely by the trading price of the underlying asset so even if your multiple account trading could only at best break even when you sell your final holdings basically resetting the price to where it was because you started distorting it this is fine because your real trade is in the options market lets say apple was trading at $ 200 the options contract at the $ 200 strike is a call trading at $ 1 with no intrinsic value you can buy to open several thousand of the $ 200 strike without distorting the shares market at all   then in the shares market you bid up apple to $ 210 now your options contract is trading at $ 11 with $ 10 of intrinsic value so you just made 1000 gain and are able to sell to close those call options then you unwind the rest of your trade and sell your $ 210 apple shares probably for $ 200 or $ or less because there are few market participants that actually valued the shares for that high the real bidders are at $ 200 and lower this is hardly a thing to do so like i mentioned before this is illegal in markets where actual company shares are involved and should not be attempted in stock markets but other markets wo n't have the same prohibitions this is a general inefficiency in capital markets in general and certain derivatives pricing formulas it is important to understand these things if you plan to participate in markets that claim to be fair there is nothing novel about this sort of thing and it is just a problem of allocating enough capital to do so

it is possible but unlikely securities firms would prefer never to settle externally rather they prefer to wait until the liabilities can be netted   they are forced to make and take payment in three business days the reason why is because settlement is costly in the same way as any other business would prefer to build trade credit instead of taking or making payment rapidly the only circumstance where a financial firm would wish to take full delivery is when a counterparty is no longer trusted to be solvent

this is completely disgusting utterly unethical deeply objectionable and yes it is almost certainly illegal the federal trade commission has indeed filed suit halted ads etc in a number of cases but these likely only represent a tiny percentage of all cases this does n't make what the car dealer 's do ok but do n't expect the swat team to bust some heads any time soon which is kind of sad but let 's deal with the details let 's see what the federal trade commission has to say in their article are car ads taking you for a ride deceptive car ads here are some claims that may be deceptive and    why vehicles are available at a specific low price or for a specific    discount what may be missing the low price is after a downpayment often    thousands of dollars plus other fees like taxes licensing and    document fees on approved credit other pitches the discount is only    for a pricey fully loaded model or the reduced price or discount    offered might depend on qualifications like the buyer being a recent    college graduate or having an account at a particular bank only $ what may be missing the advertised payments are temporary teaser    payments payments for the rest of the loan term are much higher a    variation on this pitch you will owe a balloon payment usually    thousands of dollars at the end of the term so both of these are what the ftc explicitly says are deceptive practices has the ftc taken action in cases similar to this yes they have if auto dealers make advertising claims in headlines they ca n’t take    them away in fine print said jessica rich director of the ftc ’s    bureau of consumer protection these actions show there is a    financial cost for violating ftc orders in the case referenced above the owners of a 20 + dealership chain was hit with about $ 250,000 in fines if you think that 's a tiny portion of the unethical gains they made from those ads in the time they were running i 'd say you were absolutely correct and that 's little more than a cost of doing business for unscrupulous companies but that 's the state of the us nation at this time and so we are left with caveat emptor as a guiding principle what can you do about it competitors are technically allowed to file suit for deceptive business practices so if you know any honest dealers in the area you can tip them off about it try saying that out loud with a serious face   but even better you can contact the ftc and file a formal complaint online i would n't expect the world to change for your complaint but even if it just generates a letter it may be enough to let a company know someone is watching and if they are a big business they might actually get into a little bit of trouble

credit score is rather misleading each provider of credit uses their own system to decide if they wish to lend to you    they will also not tell you how the combine all the factoring together closing unused account is good as it reduced the risk of identity theft and you have less paperwork to deal with it looks good if a company that knows you will agrees to give you more credit as clearly they think you are a good risk having more total credit allowed on account is bad as you may use it and not be able to pay all your bills using all your credit is bad as it looks like you are not in control using a pay day lender is very bad as only people that are out of control do so credit cards should be used for short term credit paying them off in full most months but it is ok to take advantage of some interest free credit

dan 's link he deleted his answer btw is fine it showed the components of the score fico offers   each input has data behind it a bell curve of the behaviors and risk of the person behind it for example we 've discussed utilization many time here the ideal utilization is not 0 but 1 19 this does not mean paying interest or carrying charges from month to month   say i had just one card with a $ 10 k limit i 'd want to be sure i never ran a bill above $ 2000 if i did i 'd see a slight drop in my score and next month it would go back to normal in my case i have enough available credit that going over 20 is rare and if it happened i 'd pay the bill down before the bill was issued just make a mid cycle payment   fico decided that those who go over 20 have a higher risk of default and it gets higher as it goes up same with every aspect of the score 's components   you are comparing us to non us use in the us it seems far more common to use our cards in my family 's case we use very little cash and run most of our spending through our cards   as far as the david is concerned one should separate those who carry a balance from those who pay in full the pay in full users are better off for their habits and responsible card use in the us it 's not easy to rent a car or book a hotel with no card cards offer a cash rebate that adds up fast and purchase protection from fraudulent vendors they also offer extended warranty coverage   the david and others claim that studies prove those using cards spend 10 15 more than cash buyers this is a proven fact from scientific studies only they do n't exist the best i 've seen proves that college kids given a $ 20 bill spend more carefully than those given a $ 20 credit card this does n't extrapolate to a family budget and never will but that quote has a way of being repeated as fact yes it 's non sense thank you for reading and quoting my blog i recognize the quote   the report also shows accounts that have gone to collection an electric bill is n't a regularly reported item it 's assumed your lights are on but if you stop paying the bill and they send your account to a collection agency you 'll see it hit your report   in response to the comment below journal of experimental psychology applied article titled monopoly money the effect of payment coupling and form on spending behavior runs 13 pages but on the first page offers do consumers spend differently when using one payment mode relative to another mode for example do consumers spend more when they receive $ 50 in the form of a gift card than in the form of cash if indeed they do then why this research addresses these issues   $ 50 a $ 50 gift card is a nuisance i try to use it up within hours of getting one as i stated above the behavior of a person with such a card does n't scale to a many thousand per month budget such articles in my opinion are nonsense proving nothing   unfortunately this is a bit of a tangent to the original question and if i put up a stand alone is it a fact that people spend more if using a card than cash the question would result in being closed as one that 's seeking opinions not facts

i think the other answers raise good points   but to your question how do i find an honest financial adviser ask your friends and family   see who they talk to and in   go meet that person understand what they do and how they view things and if you gel great   honesty and strong ethics exist in individuals regardless of laws what is it you 're trying to accomplish   you just have some money you want to put aside   you want to save for something   you want to start a budget or savings plan   your first step may be talking to a tax person not an investment adviser   sometimes the most significant returns are generated when you simply retain more of your earnings and tax people know how to accomplish that   you 're just graduating university you 're just going to get your first job   you do n't need to hunt for the right heavy 30 gains generating financial adviser   you need to establish your financial foundation   crawl walk then run there are some basics that international borders   if you do n't know much about investing most if not all retirement and individual brokerage type accounts will give you access to some kind of market index fund   you do n't need to diversify in to high fee funds because emerging markets are screaming right now   typically over a few years the fees you pay in the more exotic asset classes will eat up the gains you 've made compared to a very low fee market index fund you can open free accounts at a number of financial institutions   these free accounts at these banks all have a list of zero commission zero load funds all have something resembling an index fund   you can open your account for free deposit your money for free and buy shares in an index fund for free

you would appear to be a swing trader like myself i have been trading futures and futures options for 29 years and have both made and lost a lot of money in that time my trades last hours to days to at most a few weeks from my experience the most important skills are 1 money management keeping trade size small in relation to total capital i typically risk 2 3 of my capital on a trade so a loss is fairly immaterial 2 risk management limit your loss on every trade either by using stop orders options or a combination of these 2 3 emotional discipline be prepared to exit a position or reverse from long to short or short to long   on a moment 's notice the market does n't care where you entered or whether you make or lose money do n't let your or the news influence your decisions but follow the market 4 methodology discipline test your analysis trade entry method to ensure that it is objective and has a reasonably good probability of success then stick with it variation will inevitably lead to indecision or emotional reactions 5 flexibility consider trading anything which can make you a profit but ensure that there is a lot of liquidity i trade 30 different futures markets as well as various option writing strategies in these markets   feel free to reach out if you want to discuss further i have about 500 yes 500 trading e books as well on every trading subject you can think of

the problem is not the credit score it is the competing inquiries multiple inquiries will be considered as one if done withing a short time period 2 month iirc and for the same kind of credit because people do shop for rates you 're not the first one to do that so do n't worry about that what you should be worrying about is banks asking questions about these inquiries which is an annoying at least for me technicality you 'll have to explain to each of the banks that you want a pre approval from that you 're going to take the mortgage from them and not from anyone else in writing with your signature notarized which is ok because it 's done the signature and at closing but you 'll have to convince them that they 're the chosen ones to get approved other than that it 's pretty simple i 've done that including the declaration that i 'm not going to take any loans based on the other competing inquiries and it worked fine when i took the original mortgage and when i refinanced it later in a similar shopping fashion do it closer to the actual bidding because closing does take at least 3 4 weeks and the rate lock is usually for 30 60 days so not much time to shop if you take that road

if you 're looking for some formula i do n't think one exists people talk about this all the time and give conflicting advice if there was a proven accurate formula they would n't be debating it there are basically 3 reasons to do a home improvement project a correct a problem so that you prevent on going damage to your home for example have a leaking roof or replaced or such a job is worthwhile if the cost of fixing the problem is less than the cost of future damage in the case of my termite and leaking roof examples this is almost always worth doing lesser maintenance problems might be more debatable similarly some improvements may reduce expenses like replacing an old furnace with a newer model may cut your heating bills here the question is how long does it take to repay the investment compared to other things you might invest your money in just to make up numbers suppose you find that a new furnace will save you $ 500 per year if the new furnace costs $ 2000 then it will take 4 years to pay for itself i 'd consider that a good investment if that same $ 2000 furnace will only cut your heating bills by $ 100 per year then it will take 20 years to pay for itself you 'd probably be better off putting the $ 2000 into the stock market and using the gains to help pay your heating bill b increase the resale value of your home if you are paying someone else to do the work the harsh reality here is almost no job will increase the resale value by more than the cost of getting the job done i 've seen many articles over the years citing studies on this i think most conclude that kitchen remodeling comes closet to paying for itself and bathrooms come next new windows are also up there i do n't have studies to prove this but my guesses would be replacing something that is basically nice with a different style will rarely pay for itself like replacing oak cabinets with cherry cabinets replacing something that is in terrible shape with something decent is more likely to pay back than replacing something decent with something beautiful like if you have an old iron that 's and falling apart replacing it may pay off if you have a 5-year old that 's in good shape but is not premium top of the line replacing it with a premium will probably do very little for resale value if you can do a lot of the work yourself the story changes many home improvement jobs do n't require a lot of materials but do require a lot of work if you do the labor you can often get the job done very cheaply and it 's likely that the increase in resale value will be more than what you spend for example most of my house has hardwood floors lots of people like pretty hardwood floors i just the floors in two rooms it cost me i do n't know maybe $ 20 or $ 30 for stain and some i 'm sure if i tried to sell the house tomorrow i 'd get my twenty bucks back in higher sale value realtors often advise sellers to paint again if you do it yourself the cost of paint may be a hundred dollars and it can increase the sale price of the house by thousands of course if you do the work yourself you have to consider the value of your time c to make your home more pleasant to live in this is totally subjective you have to make the decision on the same basis that you decide whether anything that is not essential to survival is worth buying to some people a bottle of fancy imported wine is worth thousands even millions of dollars others ca n't tell the difference between a $ 10,000 wine and a $ 15 wine   the thing to ask yourself is how important is this home improvement to me compared to other things i could do with the money like suppose you 're considering spending $ 20,000 remodeling your kitchen what else could you do with $ 20,000 you could buy a car go on an elaborate vacation eat out several times a week for years retire a little earlier etc no one can tell you how much something is worth to you any given home improvement may involve a combination of these factors like say you 're considering that $ 20,000 kitchen remodeling say you somehow find out that this will increase the resale value by $ 15,000 if the only reason you were considering it was to increase resale value then it 's not worth it you 'd lose $ 5,000 but if you also want the nicer kitchen then it is fair to say okay it will cost me $ 20,000 but ultimately i 'll get $ 15,000 of that back so in the long run it will only cost me $ 5,000 is having a nicer kitchen worth $ 5,000 to me note by the way that resale value only matters if and when you sell the house if you expect to stay in this house for 20 years any improvements done are very long term investments if you live in it until you die the resale value may matter to your heirs

pre qualification is only a step above what you can do with a rate payment calculator   they do n't check your credit history and credit score they do n't ask for verification of your income or verify that you have reported your debts correctly they also do n't guarantee the interest rate but if you answer truthfully and completely and nothing else changes you have an idea of how much you can afford factoring in the down payment and estimates of other fees taxes and insurance you can get pre by multiple lenders then base your decision on rates and fees   you want to get pre approved they do everything to approve you you can even lock in a rate you want to finalize on one lender at that point because you will incur some fees getting to that point then knowing the maximum amount you can borrow including all the payments taxes insurance and fees you can make an offer on a house once the contract is accepted you have a few days to get the appraisal and the final approval documents from the lender they will only loan you the minimum of what you are pre approved for and the appraisal minus down payment also do n't go with the lender recommended by the real estate agent or builder they are probably getting a kick back based on the amount of business they funnel to that company

ideally stock price reflects the value of the company the dividends it is expected to pay and what people expect the future value of the company to be only one of those maybe one and a half is related to current   sales and not always directly short term motion of a stock is even less directly linked since it also reflects previous expectations a company can announce disappointing sales and see its stock go up if the previous price was based on expecting   worse news

there are two things i can think of that might be different in other countries until 2013 american express visa and mastercard prevented businesses from charging extra for credit card usage and credit card surcharges still illegal in several states since credit card companies add a surcharge to credit card purchases and merchants ca n't pass that onto credit card users they just make everyone pay extra instead since everyone gets charged the credit card surcharge you might as well use a credit card and recoup some of that via rewards points almost all credit cards here have grace periods where you wo n't be charged interest if you pay back your loans in full within some period of time at least 21 days this makes credit cards attractive to people who do n't need a loan but like the convenience that credit cards provide not carrying cash extra insurance better fraud protection apparently grace periods are n't required by law here so this might be common in other countries as well

i think people are conflating two sets of terms unsecured secured and good bad are not synonyms debt may be secured or unsecured if i take a loan against a car or house it is typically secured so the object is collateral against the loan bad debt in financial terms is a loan that is not expected to be recovered a bank might write off a loan or a portion of a loan as bad debt if the borrower goes bankrupt or into administration for example both secured and unsecured loans may be considered bad debt i think the context in which the question is being asked is how to distinguish between sensible and borrowing an extreme example of borrowing would be to buy a pc on a store card pcs devalue very quickly and a store card may charge 30 apr so paying the minimum off each month would mean paying   more than twice the sticker price for a product that is now worth less than half the original borrowed amount on the other hand a 3 mortgage when borrowing less than 60 of the value of a property is a good bet from a lender 's perspective and would be a good debt to have not as good as no debt but better a high apr one

for new shares to be successfully sold the price has to be below market price if you currently own shares of that company you should always get an option to buy those newly sold shares at that discounted price the number of options depends on the relative number of shares you hold lets say you own 100 out of 1000 shares currently priced at $ 10 100 new shares are to be sold at $ 9 since you are holding 10 of all shares you have the option i.e. the right to buy 10 new cheaper shares 10 of 100 before anybody else can buy them theoretically the money you save by getting the shares at a discounted price is equal to the money you lose by the share 's value being diluted so if you 're a shareholder and the company is increasing it 's capital you 're given the right to go with it

there are many situations where injecting a certain amount of cash at the right time may reap rewards far in excess of the value of the cash injected for example if someone who needs a car to get to work gets in a wreck and that person does not have ready money to make it may have no choice but to secure very expensive financing   receipt of $ 1000 in ready money to repair the car may thus save the person from having to take out a loan that would cost $ 1200 or more to repay while the insurance business has sufficient overhead that it is unlikely that insurance would generally have a positive net expectation even considering such factors it is at least theoretically possible that insurance could have a positive expected value for both the insurer and the insured and in some cases it may have positive expected values for both parties in practice as well

the best way to get cash from retirement is to not do it   leave the retirement savings alone   start saving for house down payment   look for ways to squirrel away money for that down payment   consider payment plus insurance taxes and maintenance costs   if all that comes in less than a rental you 're probably better off buying   most likely it will not   make sure that when you go to buy you have 20 down and an emergency fund that will cover you for 3 months of expenses at the new higher rate   hint that 'll probably be in excess of 10k based on a single person with a 1.5 2k a month mortgage plus utilities and food   and as a home owner you will have a lot of things for which that emergency fund will come in handy   it 's a matter of when not if   consider 5k for a new roof 6k for a hvac system for exterior paint 500 for the plumber 750 for pest control 250 to have the tree removed that fell in a storm   1000 for a new fridge   500 for a new water heater   1200 for washer and dryer   all of these are periodic costs and they all able to fail before they 're supposed to

not everyone pays their balance in full every month they may not make interest off of you or me but they do make interest off of a lot of cardholders in many cases the interest is variable and the larger your running balance the higher your rate if you 're close to your limit and making minimum payments you can literally take decades to pay off $ 2,000 or so   some people do n't pay at all every month and end up paying late fees some people use their cards overseas and pay foreign transaction fees ever take a cash advance me neither but they charge you interest right away for that instead of waiting until your statement the list of fees and charges is as long as my arm and in tiny print that 's how they make money the points bonus cash back and other rewards programs are to get you in the door it 's like when you see a luxury car advertised for a too good to be true price and you get to the lot and find out that the one they are selling for that price is a manual transmission without ac or a radio they only had one and they sold it an hour before you got there it got you on the lot though the rewards programs function in much the same way minus the disappearing part they get you interested in their offering among a sea of virtually identical products but rest assured if the card issuers were losing money because of them they would n't exist for very long

if you have retirement savings the hsa should not be considered in isolation but as part of your complete asset allocation   the hsa is a unique account in that the funds go in pre tax grow tax free and then for qualified expenses are withdrawn tax free with healthcare being the biggest risk to one 's retirement portfolio i.e. a large unknown in that retirement budget funding an hsa to the max and treating it as a long term investment makes a lot of sense   as a comment suggests keeping what you feel is a year 's worth of expenses liquid might make sense the medical plan coverage should have a maximum out of pocket each year that 's another number you can use as a guideline   the question is great and as more people have the high deductible plan with an hsa it 's worth some analysis the problem for those answering is that we do n't know the rest of your situation specifically how these funds fit into your portfolio of assets

if you 've already done some micro and macro you are on the right track to learn finance what you should study next depends on what kind of finance you want to know more about is it m&amp;a and corporate finance more macro would not help much but maybe some financial accounting you could see if you could get your hands on a corporate finance text book since they are a good starting place to learn more about finance in general and such a book is a relatively easy read much finance however requires good quantitative skills so probability statistics linear algebra and calculus and their applications to finance is never a bad thing to look into this would open up for understanding e.g. derivatives that played a huge role in the financial crisis and in financial markets today

no danger you can get in a car accident break your leg or otherwise wind up in the hospital like anyone else   you can also get the money back with a tax penalty but you probably will never need to if you are responsible and live within your means do you need a wake up call about what things can cost   i knew a college student who broke his leg and did n't buy the health insurance    he had to have a rod put in his leg and it was   obviously he did n't have the money and the hospital agreed to put him on some kind of payment plan   i suppose bankruptcy was an alternative but either way not a great way to start out in life    any time you can defer payment of tax for decades or buy something with pre income tax money it is like instantly earning 20 or more on your money   i believe you can pay for and dental out of an hsa as well   so i would n't go overboard on an hsa or ira if you have big credit card debts if you do have room for savings it is dumb not to be putting money in the hsa and ira/401k take a look at hsa bank for a low fee home for your money they pay interest on over $ 3,000 but like most banks not much   the fees for being under $ 3k are currently around $ 2 a month   do n't worry about investing the hsa money until you have like $ 10,000 in there which will be a while

you can not just read one book and some articles on technical analysis and some indicators and expect to be an expert and everything to just start falling into place and give you signals that will tell you when to buy and sell with precision and massive profits all the time   it is like someone reading a book on how to drive a car and then expecting to drive the first time they sit in the driver 's seat or someone reading a book on brain surgery and expecting to be able to operate on a live patient the next day it looks like you are using 3 or 4 indicators to get daily buy and sell signals on a daily chart for an eft you 're looking to hold for decades so firstly you are using short term indicators for a long term outlook you need to decide what timeframe you plan to hold your investments for and use chart periods and indicators that suit that timeframe   secondly each indicator can be used in a number of ways and the settings you use for each indicator can determine whether you get earlier or later signals also you need to work out which indicators work well together and are complementary compared to those that do n't work well together and give conflicting signals all this information will come together for you the more you read about and practice the art of technical analysis if your timeframe is very long term decades i would be using mainly a weekly chart with a longer period ma the roc indicator and possibly some trend lines keep it simple the price itself is very important too you can determine when a trend is starting or has ended purely using the price the definition of an uptrend is higher highs and higher lows so on the weekly chart if there is a lower high followed by a lower low this could be the end of the uptrend if we get a lower low followed by a lower high this again could be the end of the uptrend these could be a good time to start getting cautious and maybe looking to sell if you are using stop losses which i recommend this may be a good time to tighten your stops similarly a downtrend is defined as lower lows and lower highs if we get a higher low followed by a higher high it could be the end of the downtrend and maybe the start of an uptrend this could be a good time to start getting ready to buy you need to learn about how and where to set your buy and sell orders including stops and whether you wait for confirmation when you get a signal all this takes some time but the more you read the more you attend live events and the more you practice the more they will become second nature in order to get the best out of technical analysis you will need to learn plan practice and execute a good book to help you prepare your trading plan is smart trading plans by one of my favourite books is the complete trading course price patterns strategies setups and execution tactics by and another good book is trade your way to financial freedom by van tharp

the answer on the canadian government 's website is pretty clear   most employees can not claim employment expenses you can not deduct the    cost of travel to and from work or other expenses such as most tools    and clothing however that is most likely related to a personal vehicle there is a deduction related to public transportation   you can claim cost of monthly public transit passes or passes of    longer duration such as an annual pass for travel within canada on    public transit for 2016 the second sleeping residence is hard to justify as the individual is choosing to work in this town and this individual is choosing to spent the night there it is not currently a work requirement   as always please consult a certified tax professional in your country for any final on personal and corporate tax laws and filings

budget means both expenses and revenue in quite a few cases say personal finance typically one refers to budget more from expenses point of view as the revenue is typically fixed known mostly salary    the operating budget and capital budget are laid out separately as operating budget gives out day to day expenses that are typically essential employee salaries routine maintenance of infrastructure etc the revenue is also tied in to match this these are done within the same year where as capital budget is to build new infrastructure say a new bridge or other major expense that are done over period of years the revenues to this are typically tied up differently and can even be linked to getting more funding from other agencies or loans

you state any info will be appreciated so here 's some background information on my answer you can skip to my answer when i worked for banks i was required to submit suspicious activity to the people above me by filling out a form with a customer 's name ssn account and id   you may hear in media that it is $ 10 k or sometimes $ 5k.   the truth is that it could be lower than that depending on what the institution defines as suspicious   every year we were required to take a course which implied that terrorists and criminals use cash regularly whether we agree or disagree is irrelevant this is what the course implied it 's important to understand that many people use cash only budgets because it 's easier than relying on the banking system which charges overdraft fees for going over or in some cases you pay more at merchants because of card usage some merchants give discounts for cash   if someone has a budget of $ 10 k a month and they choose to use cash that 's perfectly fine   also why is it anyone 's business what someone does with their private property   this created an interesting contrast among differently aged americans older americans saw the banking system as tyrannical whereas young americans did n't care   this is part of why i eventually left the banking system i felt sick that i had to report this information but it 's amazing how quick everyone is to accept the new rules   notice how one of the comments asks you what you intend to do with the money as if it 's any of their business   welcome to the new america my answer if you withdraw $ 100,000 here is what will more than likely happen now watch the anger at this answer because i 'm telling you the truth   this article will explain why   your very question had a negative 1 as if asking what you 're asking is wrong see the absurdity   if joseph stalin ran for president in the united states the majority of americans would welcome him   you have good reason to be concerned others at this site have noticed this as well

hi accounting major here   a lot of people mentioned both tax advantages and cheap money money you can borrow at a low interest rate   another reason businesses do this is to reward investors generally people with stock in a company want to see some of its operations financed with debt instead of all of it financed from investors money or profit this way the company can grow more and still pay better dividends to its investors however you do n't want too much debt either it 's a balance and a way to see how much debt vs equity a company has is called a leverage ratio leverage = debt hope this helps

weird from the bad old days when you had to do arithmetic by hand i would guess   stocks used to trade in so bonds trading in even smaller increments makes sense   also and i am unsure if this is still true u.s. bonds trade on a 360 day year or used to anyway for the same reason 360 divides well into months and quarters for easier math whereas 365 is considerably harder   most of the world now trades in and years so i am unsure why the u.s. does n't   institutional inertia i would guess

are you obligated to do what they ask probably not with one big caveat discussed below your employer sent your money and their money after every paycheck to the 401 k management company then after a while the 401 k management company followed your instructions to roll it over into an ira now the ira management company has it pulling it out of the ira would be very hard and the ira company would be required to report it to the irs as a withdraw here is the caveat if the extra funds you put in allowed you to exceed the annual contribution amount set by the law or if it allowed you to put more than 100 of your income into the fund then this would be an excess contribution and you and your employer would have to resolve or face the excess contribution penalties though if the 401 k company and hr allowed you to exceed the annual limit they have a much more complex problem with their payroll system the bigger concern is why they want you to pull out your $ 27.50 and their $ 27.50 unless you were hitting the maximum limit your $ 27.50 could have been invested by adjusting the percentage taken out of each check   you could have picked a percentage to reach a goal that money is yours because you contributed it and unless you exceed the irs set limits it is still pre tax retirement money the return of matching funds may be harder to calculate the returns for 2013 were very good each $ 1.06 of matching funds each paycheck purchased a fraction of some investment that investment went up and down ok mostly up if it was invested in the broad market i guess you should be glad they are n't asking for more due to the increase in value   it would be very hard to calculate what happened if you have moved it around since then which of course you did when you moved it into an ira if the average employee was also given a $ 55 gift last year then the suggestion to the employer is that the tax complexity you and your fellow employees face would exceed the cost of the extra funds they should chalk it up to an expensive lesson and move on

loans do not carry an interest balance you can not pay off all the interest the only way to reduce the interest to zero is to pay off the loan otherwise the interest due each month is some percentage of the outstanding principal think of it from the bank 's perspective they 've invested some amount of money in you and they expect a return on that investment in the form of interest if you somehow paid in 16 years all the interest the bank expected to receive in 30 years you 've been scammed

the assumption that companies listed otc are not serious is far from the truth many companies on the otc are just starting off there because they do n't meet the requirements to be listed on the nasdaq or nyse major stock exchanges like the nasdaq and the nyse only want the best companies to trade on their exchanges the nasdaq for example has three sets of listing requirements a company must meet at least one of the three requirement sets as well as the main rules for all companies these include now do n't assume that the otc does n't have rules either as this is far from the truth as well while there are no minimum level of revenue profits or assets required to get listed on the otc there are requirements for audited financial statements and ongoing filing and reporting to the sec and nasd additionally there are several different levels of the otc including the the and the otc pink each with their own set of requirements for more information about what it takes to be listed on otc look here a company deciding to trade on the otc is making the decision to take their company public and they are investing to make it happen currently the fees to get listed on the otc range from $ 30,000 to $ 150,000 depending on the firm you decide to go with and the services they offer as part as their package now i know i would n't consider $ 30 k or more to not be serious money when i looked into the process of getting a company listed on the tsx the requirements seemed a lot more relaxed than those of the major u.s. markets as well consisting of an application records submission and then a decision made by a tsx committee about whether you get listed more information about the tsx here i think the way that the otc markets have gotten such a bad reputation is from these get rich on penny stock companies that you see pumping up otc company stocks and getting massive amounts of people to buy without doing their due diligence and investigating the company and reading its prospectus then when they loose a bunch of money on an ill informed investment decision they blame it on the company being an otc stock   whether you decide to trade the otc market or not i would n't make a decision based on how many exchanges the company is listed on but rather based on the research you do into the company

bitcoin payments involve by far the lowest fees   for pure bitcoin to bitcoin transfers you have the option of not paying any fee at all while if you want to avoid the risk currently very small of miners ignoring your transaction you can pay a small transaction fee   currently no more than btc is ever required $ 0.01 at $ bitcoin also does not support chargebacks which is an advantage for the merchant no risk that paypal will freeze your account as it did in with a burning man nonprofit but more risk for the consumer popular sites for exchanging bitcoins with other currencies charge rates of or less   the primary barrier is that it typically takes a few days to get funds into your account from bank accounts etc   given the volatility of the bitcoin exchange rate you may want to treat bitcoin like cash and only keep a small amount on hand a variety of shopping cart interfaces are supported the obvious downside is that only a small fraction of users would be likely to go through the steps to use this option since bitcoin is new and immature so your investment in adding support may be hard to pay off   on the other hand just advertising that you accept bitcoin payments would give you a bit of free advertising another downside is the risk of government intervention   in npr 's 2011 story a law professor said it was legal for now in the us but that could change i 'd say that given the sizable current fees and other barriers to international commerce and micro payments if bitcoin does n't succeed something else will

without getting to hung up on terminology here the management of a company will often attempt to keep stock prices high because of a number of reasons ideally companies keep prices up through performance   in some cases you 'll see companies do other things spending cash and/or issuing bonds to continue to pay dividends e.g. ibm or spending cash and/or issuing bonds to pay for stock buybacks e.g. ibm   these methods can work for a time but are not sustainable and will often be seen as acts of desperation   companies that have a solid plan for growth will typically not do much of anything to directly change stock prices bonds are a bit different because they have a fairly straight forward valuation model based on the fact that they pay out a fixed amount per month   the two main reason prices in bonds go down are the key here is that bonds pay out the same thing per month regardless of their price or the price of other bonds available   most stocks do not pay any dividend and for much of those that do the main factor as to whether you make or lose money on them is the stock price the price of bonds does matter to governments however   let 's say a country successfully issued some 10 year bonds last year at the price of 1000   they pay 1 per month to keep the math simple   every month they pay out $ 10 per bond   then some stupid politicians start threatening to default on bond payments   the bond market freaks and people start trying to unload these bonds as fast as they can   the going price drops to $ 500   next month the payments are the same   the coupon rate on the bonds has not changed at all   i 'm oversimplifying here but this is the core of how bond prices work you might be tempted to think that does n't matter to the country but it does   now this same country wants to issue some more bonds   it wants to get that 1 rate again but it ca n't   why would anyone pay $ 1000 for a 1 per month bond when they can get the exact same bond with basically the same risks for $ 500   instead they have to offer a 2 per month rate in order to match the market price a government or company could in fact put money into the bond market to bolster the price of it 's bonds i.e. keep the rates down   the problem is that if you are issuing bonds it 's generally caveats apply because you need cash that you do n't have so what money are you going to use to buy these bonds   or in other words it does n't make sense to issue bonds and then simply plow the cash gained from that issuance back into the same bonds you are issuing   the options here are a bit more limited   i have to mention though that the us government via a quasi governmental entity did actually buy it 's own bonds   this policy of quantitative easing qe was done for more complicated reasons than simply keeping the price of bonds up

note that if 1   the stock prices are continuously differentiable they are n't 2   you rebalance continuously in the absence of trading fees and taxes then the return fraction future price original price will be the geometric mean of the return fractions for each investment if you do n't rebalance then the return fraction will be the arithmetic mean but the arithmetic mean is always greater than or equal to the geometric mean so continuous rebalancing in the case of continuously differentiable prices will always hurt you even trading costs taxes any argument in favor of blind rebalancing which does not somehow fail in the continuously differentiable case is simply wrong see

if you do not understand the volatility of the fx market you need to stop trading it immediately there are many reasons that fx is riskier than other types of investing and you bear those risks whether you understand them or not below are a number of reasons why fx trading has high levels of risk 1 fx trades on the relative exchange rate between currencies that means it is a zero sum game over time the global fx market can not grow if the us economy doubles in size and the european economy doubles in size then the exchange rate between the usd and the eur will be the same as it is today in an extreme example all else being equal yes i know that value of currency /= value of total economy but the general point stands   compare that with the stock market if the us economy doubles in size then effectively the value of your stock investments will double in size that means that stocks bonds etc tied to real world economies generally increase when the global economy increases it is a positive sum game where many players can be winners on the long term on average most people earn value without needing to get into timing of trades this allows many people to consider long term equity investing to be lower risk than day trading with fx because the value of a currency is in its relative position compared with another currency 1 player is a winner 1 player is a loser by this token most fx trading is necessarily short term day trading which by itself carries inherent risk 2 fx markets are insanely efficient i will lightly state that this is my opinion but one that i am not alone in holding firmly this means that public information about a currency ie economic news political news etc is nearly immediately acted upon by many many people so that the revised fx price of that currency will quickly adjust the more efficient a market is the harder it is to time a trade as an example if you see on a news feed that the head of a central bank authority made an announcement about interest rates in that country a common driver of fx prices you have only moments to make a trade before the large institutional investors already factor it into their bid ask prices keep in mind that the large fx players are dealing with millions and billions of dollars markets can move very quickly because of this note that some currencies trade more frequently than others the main currency pairs are typically between usd and or other country currencies jpy eur etc as you get into currencies of smaller countries trading of those currencies happens less frequently this means that there may be some additional time before public information is priced in to the market value of that currency making that currency less efficient on the flip side if something is infrequently traded pricing can be more volatile as a few relatively smaller trades can have a big impact on the market   3 uncertainty of political news if you make an fx trade based on what you believe will happen after an expected political event you are taking risk that the event actually happens politics and world events can be very hard to predict and there is a high element of chance involved see recent expected election results across the world for evidence of this for something like the stock market a particular industry may get hit every once in a while with unexpected news but the fx market is inherently tied to politics in a way that may impact exchange rates multiple times a day 4 leveraging it is very common for fx traders to borrow money to invest in fx this creates additional risk because it amplifies the impact of your positive or negative returns this applies to other investments as well but i mention it because high degrees of debt leveraging is extremely common in fx to answer your direct question there are no single individual traders who spike fx prices that is the impact you see of a very efficient market with large value traders reacting to frequent surprising news   i reiterate if you do not understand the risks associated with fx trade i recommend that you stop this activity immediately at least until you understand it better and i would recommend personally that any amateur investor never get involved in fx at all regardless of how informed you believe you are

at the very least you should invest as much as you can that your employer will match as they are basically giving you free money for saving after that i would prioritize a roth ira as that offers similar tax benefits with more liquidity provided you have enough money available in your emergency fund and have plenty for everyday expenses i see no reason not to max out your 401k after that if you can afford it however if your emergency fund is lacking be sure to put some there other investments like a 529 may come into play if you have kids you plan on sending to college but it all depends on your situation

remember carrying debt on a credit card and waiting to pay it is increased risk in the event something happens and you ca n't pay it off i have 1 cc and i have it set to auto pay on the day it 's due paid in full each month as i do n't carry debt anymore learned that lesson a hard way so the day it 's due it auto drafts out of my checking no worries of late payments missed payments etc if you feel that having any balance is bad then by all means pay it off the minute you get your statement it should come at the same time each month or close to the same time and you should be able to setup an auto payment to pay it off in full as soon as the new statement goes live to be honest those extra few days of supposed interest saved by keeping the money in your checking account is so minimal that 's it 's probably not worth it most checking is horrible in interest all my high interest checking accounts are now less than 1 apr boo and if you 're late 1 day then bam all that earned interest is gone in 1 late fee

is a high value realtime settlement system across europe and for this to be open on weekends would mean all the banks including central banks in the euro zone work quite a few times to manage intra day liquidity banks borrow from each other hence there is an active of the liquidity by banks the borrowing happens over phone and fax and the lending bank sending a high value transaction that credits the borrowing banks these is the day to day job of treasury group highly paid individuals to manage liquidity now if on weekends the volume is less it does not make sense to keep these people the cost of supporting this for very business gain is not driving to build such systems   on the other hand on retail transactions say cards debit credit atm the value is not high and hence there is no treasury function involved and there is a huge need everything is automated so no issues

adding international bonds to an individual investor 's portfolio is a controversial subject   on top of the standard risks of bonds you are adding country specific risk currency risk and diversifying your individual company risk   in theory many of these risks should be rewarded but the data are noisy at best and adding risk like developed currency risk may not be rewarded at all also most of the risk and diversification mentioned above are already added by international stocks   depending on your home country adding international or emerging market stock etfs only add a few extra bps of fees while international bond etfs can add 30 of fees over their domestic versions   this is a fairly high bar for adding this type of diversification   us bonds for foreign investors are a possible exception to the high fees though the government 's bonds yield little if your home currency or currency union does not have a deep bond market and/or bonds make up most of your portfolio it is probably worth diversifying a chunk of your bond exposure internationally   otherwise you can get most of the diversification much more cheaply by just using international stocks

yes and no first off commodity prices reflect the cost of a good about 3 steps back in the retail supply chain the agreed upon price for the raw between farmers and manufacturers your grocer may carry bags of whole grain wheat but that 's certainly not all he carries that contains it same for corn rice and other staple grains as well as for fruits and vegetables yes you can buy by the ton on the cme meats various sugars etc so a long term sustained change in prices of a commodity will eventually affect the real cost to you to buy things they 're made from however in the short term the retail supply chain will generally act as a buffer between these prices and the ones you see on the store shelf consumers do n't like price increases especially of necessities like food when food costs go up consumers can and will very quickly change their spending habits buying cheaper options to get their needed calories that makes manufacturers nervous consumers not buying their product is a worse scenario than consumers buying their product at a reduced gain or even at a loss so manufacturers and suppliers and retailers will all absorb as much as they can of the cost of a commodities increase before beginning to pass it on to consumers on the flip side while consumers like price drops they do n't notice them as much as price increases so the supply chain will also absorb a fall in commodity prices by price reductions in the consumer goods as long as they can get away with it which is usually longer than the price reduction actually lasts the net effect is that processed food prices typically follow the gentle upward climb of long term inflation and only rarely do you see drastic price increases or decreases where this model breaks down a little bit is in highly perishable especially seasonal or wild managed foods fruits and vegetables seafood etc the limited time in which the stuff can be sold makes the process of getting a fish out of the ocean and a fruit off the tree and into your grocery store much more market driven the producers suppliers and grocers are all in constant contact over what 's available and how much they can get for what price the prices therefore are typically a lower markup unlike highly processed grain based foods there 's not much added value to be marked up between the apple farmer picking the fruit and the grocer putting it on display but also much more volatile if there 's a bumper crop of fruit the farmer has to unload it all or it goes to waste while similarly if an early freeze decimated the apple crop the suppliers ca n't just get some of last year 's bumper crop out of storage they fight with everyone else for what little made it to market farmers will sometimes intentionally let excess crop spoil in order to maintain a minimum price for what they sell the rest can at least be and used for fertilizer saving them some money on maintenance but there 's no silver bullet for a shortage this is why a lot of these foods especially seafood are considered luxury items they 're not stable enough for everyone to get as much as they want whenever they want unlike staple grains

whole life in most instances is a very bad plan it 's marketed as a life insurance policy wrapped in an investment but it does neither very well the hidden caveat of whole life is that the investment goes away if you die   say for example i have a $ 100,000 whole life insurance policy and over the years i have paid in enough to have a $ 15,000 cash value on the policy if i die my family gets $ 100,000 and the cash value is lost with term life you can get a substantially higher amount of coverage for a smaller payment if you invest the difference you end up not only with better coverage but a better cash value from the difference if you do n't die which is what we all hope for anyways as said your insurance should be designed around replacing lost income value   you should get 10x your annual income in term life insurance

i agree with grade eh bacon 's answer but there are a couple of ideas that are relevant to your particular situation if i were you i would invest at least half of the cash in growth etfs because you 're young enough that market variability does n't affect you and long term growth is important the rest should be invested in safer investments value and dividend etfs bonds cash so that you have something to live off in the near term you said you wanted to invest ethically   the keyword to search is socially responsible etfs   there are many and if this is important to you you 'll have to read their prospectus to find one that matches your ethics since you 're american the way i understand it you need to file taxes on income selling stocks at a gain is income   you want to make sure that as your stocks appreciate you sell some every year and immediately rebuy them so that you pay a small tax bill every year rather than one huge tax bill 20 years from now   claiming about $ of capital gains every year would be tax free assuming you are not earning any other money   i would claim a bit more in years where you make a lot you can mitigate your long term capital gains tax exposure by opening a roth ira and maxing that out   capital gains in the roth ira are not taxable   even if you do n't have income from working you can have some income if you invest in stocks that pay dividends which would allow you to contribute to a roth ira you should figure where you 're going to be living because you will want to minimize the currency risk of having your money in usd while you 're living abroad   if the exchange rate were to change by a lot you might find yourself a lot poorer   there are various hedging strategies but the easiest one is to invest some of your money in securities of the country you 'll be living in you should look into how you 'll be converting money into the foreign currency   there are sometimes way of minimizing the spread when converting large amounts of money e.g. 's gambit   shaving off 1.5 when exchanging $ 100k saves $ 1500

i will add one thought on to this thread   this is a financial concept called net present value   in plain english it means what 's the best use for your money right now so let 's say you have an extra € 300/month which is not being spent on living expenses if you leave that money under your pillow or spend it on beer or fancy electronics instead of paying off your early that is costing you per month every month   so € or €   this is cumulative for the life of your loan   so not paying € 300 this month will ultimately cost you € 120 assuming you keep the loan open for 10 years   if you 're saying pay my debts or spend the money on a smartphone the answer is that you should pay your debts now here 's the important part   let 's suppose you have a better use for the money than beer or electronics   let 's suppose you have a mutual fund which will reliably provide you with a return of 10 a year if you put that € 300/month into a high yield fund and if the returns are consistent you are still paying that € because you invested elsewhere and did n't pay your debts but you are realizing profits of on the invested money   € 2.5 which is a net gain   so in some cases paying off your debt may not be the best use of your money there are a number of other questions involved which are related to your exposure to capital gains taxes incentives or disincentives for holding debt c. c.   these are generally country specific   a poster above who seems to be familiar with netherlands law did a good explanation of some of those incentives   i 'm in the us and our incentive and disincentive system is different tl;dr   it depends

your question begins with a misunderstanding   when you prepare your tax return form you always try to minimize your total tax bill   when you fill out form w4 you trying to estimate how much tax will be shown on next years tax return   the penalty for having too much tax withheld is not having the use of the money until you get a tax refund at the moment interest rates are very low and your economic loss is the temporary loss of access to the money one exception would be if you are carrying credit card debt in that case you are in effect paying 20 30 interest to borrow money you lending to the us treasury for 0 interest the penalty for having too little tax withheld is having to make a large payment with your tax return if your pre payments are n't at least as much as your total income tax from last year there may also be modest underpayment penalty based on the difference between your pre payments and your total income tax from last year or this year whichever is less a large underpayment will trigger a different larger penalty the w4 combined with the withholding rates tends to over withhold income tax for most but not all taxpayers most people do n't have enough savings to pay a large tax due which leads to more penalties and an even larger bill over witholding protects the overall tax system from the consequences of those events people tend to be very unhappy not quietly on balance your greatest economic benefit depends on whether or not you have high interest debt if you do then accurate and even slightly under withholding will probably work to your advantage as long as you can pay next 4/15 if not avoiding the chance of having any unexpected balance due next year may be more important

let 's assess the situation first then look at an option this leaves you with about $ in cash flow provided you spend money on nothing else entertainment oil changes general merchandise gifts etc so i 'd say take $ 200/mo off that as backup money now we 're at $   question what have you been doing with this extra $ 800/mo if you put $ of that extra towards the 10 loan it would be paid off in 12 months and you would only pay $ in interest if you have been saving it like all the wisest people say you should then you should have plenty enough to either pay for a new transmission or buy a good enough car outright   10 interest rate on a vehicle purchase is not very good not sure why you have a personal loan to handle this rather than an auto loan but i 'll guess you have a low credit score or not much credit history   cost of a new transmission is usually $ $ 3,500 not sure what vehicle we 're talking about so let 's make it $ 3,000 to be conservative   at your current interest rate you 'll have paid another $ in interest over the next 33 months just trying to pay off your underwater car   if you take your old car to a dealership and trade it in towards a new to you car you might be able to roll your existing loan into a new loan now i 'm not sure when you say personal loan if you mean an official loan from a bank or a personal loan from a friend family member so that could make a difference i 'm also not sure if a dealership will be willing to recognize a personal loan in the transaction as i 'd wager there 's no lien against the vehicle for them to worry about but if you can manage it you may be able to get a lower overall interest rate if you ca n't roll it into a new financing plan then you need to assess if you can afford a new loan provided you even get approved on top of your existing finances one big issue that will affect interest rates and approvals will be your down payment amount the higher it is the better interest rate you 'll receive ultimately you 're in a not so great position but if your monthly budget is as you describe then you 'll be fine after a few more years the perils of buying a used car is that you never know what might happen what if you do n't repair your existing car buy another car and it breaks down in a year it 's all a bit of a gamble do n't let your emotions get in the way of making a decision you might be frustrated with your current vehicle but if $ 3,000 of repairs makes it last 3 more years by which time your current loan should be paid off then you 'll be in a much better spot to finance a newer vehicle of course it would be much better to save up cash over that time and buy something outright but that 's not always feasible   would you rather fix up your current car and keep working to pay down the debt or would you rather be rid of the car and put $ 3,000 down on a new to you car and take on an additional monthly debt there 's no single right answer for you first and foremost you need to assess your monthly cash flow and properly allocate the extra funds get out of debt as soon as reasonably possible

mortgage qualification is typically done based on pretax income to keep the math easy let 's assume $ 10k month gross   a well written loan allows 28 or $ 2800 to be used for the mortgage and property tax property tax varies but 1 is the average of the 2 states mentioned this results in $ property or $ tax leaving $ note here op stated $ 750 k house   $ will finance $ 450 k at years $ will finance $ 300 k at 3.5 let me pause here facts are most important to make these decisions unless you 're clear on gross income which may be higher the constraints above quickly come into play   once the numbers are spelled out you may find that you are qualified to only borrow $ 350 k based on a 30 year note nathan 's $ 2500 payment was correct but for the mortgage only add property tax and you 'd be at $ you 'd need a gross $ to meet the 28 rule   the above discussion would render any further thoughts of mine moot

you would need to check with bank as it varies from bank to bank   you can break the fd 's generally you do n't loose the interest you have earned for 1 years however the rate of interest will be reduced i.e. if the rate was 7 for 1 year fd and 8 for 2 years fd when you break after a year you will get only 7 generally this can happen in few hours but definitely in 2 days you can get a loan against fd 's generally the rate of interest is 2 higher than fd rate there is also initial processing fee etc check with the bank it may take few days to set things up

what you may be looking for are multi manager etfs these invest in a basket of diversified funds to get the best out of all of the funds the problem with multi manager funds is of course that you pay fees twice once to the fund itself and once to each of the funds in the fund the low fees on etfs mean that it is not very profitable to actively maintain one so there are not many around googling returns very few noting that historic success does n't guarantee future success and that fees are being applied to fees these funds only really benefit from diversification of manager performance risk partial source of information and an example of a non outperforming multi manager etf

at least in the us a cashier 's check is just like a regular personal check only it 's guaranteed by the bank itself so the person accepting it can be pretty certain the check wo n't be returned for insufficient funds if the check is genuine most banks therefore have a policy for cashier 's checks that is very similar to their policies on regular checks and money orders if you are a member with an account in good standing they 'll make all or part of the money available to you according to their fund availability policy which is usually anywhere from immediately to 7 10 days with amounts over $ 5,000 banks will tend to put a hold on the funds to ensure it clears and they get their money if you are not a member then many banks will refuse to cash the check at all unless the cashier 's check is drawn on on that brand of bank so if the cashier 's check is issued by say chase bank chase banks will usually be willing to cash out the entire check to you immediately with properly provided id because the bank is guaranteed by them they are able to check their system and ensure the check is real and can clear the check instantly this policy is n't just up to individual banks entirely as it is defined by united states federal banking policies and federal regulations on availability of funds if you really must cash the check without a holding period and won't can't have a bank account of your own to perform this then you will generally need to go into a branch of the bank that is guaranteeing the check to be able to cash it out fully right away note that since the check might be issued by a bank with no branch near you you should have a back up plan generally banks will allow you to setup a special limited savings only account to deposit your check even if you do n't have a checking account so if no other option works you might try that as well the funds availability policies are the same but at least you 'll be able to cash it generally in 10 days time and then close the account and withdraw your money

it is not absolutely clear that transitioning all your retirement money from mutual funds stocks bonds cds etc to an annuity either now or just before retirement is the best decision especially once you are old enough to have to take required minimum distributions rmds the irs says in publication 590 distributions from individual retirement annuities    if your traditional ira is an individual retirement annuity special rules apply to figuring the required minimum distribution for more information on rules for annuities see regulations section these regulations can be read in many libraries irs offices and online at irs.gov i would recommend talking to a tax accountant before going your proposed route

i bought health insurance for myself after a period without it and my premiums were not terrible i was a 27 year old man living in california no preexisting conditions and i paid approximately 90 $ a month this was for a standard health insurance plan   however when i moved back to ny a little while later insurance companies wanted almost $ 500/month for catastrophic coverage   so from personal experience my answer is that price varies widely by state different states have different regulations as to what health insurance companies need to cover and at what price in ny health insurance companies ca n't charge different rates according to age also in ny there is a price spiral where the price is so high few people buy it so they have to raise the price because not enough well people are in the pool so fewer people buy it to test it out go to an online insurance broker like and put in your proposed information including that you have n't been covered for a period this way you will know

your maximum risk is 100 if you buy the stock 15 off and your company goes bankrupt tomorrow you 've lost everything it also sounds like you have foreign exchange risk one can debate how much risk this is in terms of expected outcomes but that was not your question however if you purchase the company stock and buy put options at the same time you can lock in a sale price ahead of time and absolutely limit your risk depending on the amount of stock we 're talking about you can buy currency futures as well to hedge the exchange risk you do n't necessarily have to buy the break even strikes you can buy the ones that guarantee a positive return these are probably fairly cheap   note that a lot of companies have policies that prohibit beneficiaries from shorting the company stocks in which case you might not be able to hedge yourself with put options

did i do anything wrong by cashing a check made out to trustee of    < 401k plan > and if so how can i fix it i thought i was just    getting a termination payout of the balance yes you did it was not made to you and you were not supposed to even be able to cash it both you and your bank made a mistake you made a mistake by depositing a check that does n't belong to you and the bank made a mistake by allowing you to deposit a check that is not made out to you to your personal account how do i handle the taxes i owe on the payout given that i had a    tax free 1099 two years ago and no 1099 now it was not tax free two years ago it would have been tax free if you would forward it to the entity to which the check was intended since that would not be you but you did n't do that as such there was no withdrawal two years ago and i believe the 401k plan is wrong to claim otherwise you did however take the money out in 2014 and it is fully taxable to you including penalties you should probably talk to a licensed tax adviser ea cpa licensed in your state my personal and unprofessional opinion is that you did n't withdraw the money in 2012 since the check was not made out to you and the recipient never got it you did withdraw money in 2014 since that 's when you actually got the money even if by mistake as such i 'd report this withdrawal on the 2014 tax return however as i said i 'm not a professional and not licensed to provide tax advice so this is my opinion only i strongly suggest you talk to a licensed tax adviser to get a proper opinion and guidance on the matter if it is determined that the withdrawal was indeed in 2012 then you 'll have to amend the 2012 tax return report the additional income and pay the additional tax + interest and probably underpayment penalty

another thing to consider is that paying extra principal either via one of these services or by including something extra with your normal mortgage payment and designating that it go to principal rather than be held to reduce next month 's payment or just sending an additional payment to the bank and designating it as reducing the principal the term of your loan is this good maybe consider that banks lend with a variety of terms usually the 15-year fixed rate mortgage has a lower interest rate than the 30-year fixed rate mortgage and the 5-year home equity loan has an even lower rate when you prepay your loan your interest rate stays the same but the bank gets its money back sooner this makes more profit for the bank as it can then invest the money in other things that profit could have been yours if you had made that investment instead of prepaying your mortgage

as far as i can recall savings and chequing accounts exist due to regulations on the banking industry that put were into effect after the depression to prevent a run on the bank    a chequing account is a demand account meaning you can go and demand your money and they have to pay immediately by means of a withdrawal or a cheque   banks used to get out of hand and loan out pretty much all the money they had on deposit and of course those people with loans just put the money they borrowed into another chequing account and the bank loaned that out to someone else   the money that people believed they had access to multiplied indefinitely   however when everyone goes to take that money out at the same time you have a run on the bank   therefore government regulations stipulate a that the bank must have on hand   the typical number is 5   that effectively limits the money multiplier to 19 times savings accounts get around this restriction by putting limits on how much and how quickly you can withdraw the amounts   they pay you more interest because the money in a savings account is worth more to them because it 's not subject to those restrictions some chequing accounts pay interest but you have to maintain a minimum balance   some savings accounts allow you to write cheques but i assume the withdrawal limitations probably still apply there 's also something to do with deposit insurance as in the chequing accounts are covered by government deposit insurance but savings accounts are not   i 'm not 100 certain of that though

first of all setting some basics what is a sound way to measure the risk of each investment in order to compare them with each other there is no single way that can be used across all asset classes risks generally speaking you want to perform both a quantitative and qualitative assessment of risks that you identify   quantitative risk assessment may involve historical data and/or parametric or non parametric models using historical data is often simple but may be hard in cases where the amount of data you have on a given event is low e.g. risk of bust by investing in a cryptocurrency parametric and non parametric risk models exist e.g. value at risk var expected shortfall es etc and abound but a lot of them are more complicated than necessary for an individual 's requirements qualitative risk assessment is simply assessing the likelihood and severity of risks by using intuition expert judgment where that applies etc one may consult with outside parties e.g. lawyers accountants bankers etc where their advisory may help highlighting some risks or understanding them better to ease comparing investment opportunities you may want to perform a risk assessment on categories of risks e.g. investing in the stock market vs bond market to compare between those categories one should look at the whole picture quantitative and qualitative with their risk appetite in mind of course after taking those macro decisions you would need to further assess risks on more micro decisions e.g. microsoft or google you would then most likely end up with better as you would be comparing items similar in nature should i always consider the worst case scenario because when i do that i always can lose everything generally speaking you want to consider everything so that you can perform a risk assessment and decide on your risk mitigating strategy see q4 by assessing the likelihood and severity of risks you may find that even in cases where you are comparatively as worse off e.g. in case of complete bust the likelihood may differ for example keeping gold in a personal stash at home vs your employer going bankrupt if you are working for a large firm do note that you want to compare risks both likelihood and severity after any risk mitigation strategy you may want to put in place e.g. maybe putting your gold in a safety box in a secure bank would make the likelihood of losing your gold essentially null is there a way to estimate the probability of such events better than intuition estimating probability or likelihood is largely dependent on data on hand and your capacity to model events for most practical purposes of an individual modelling would be way off in terms of reward benefits you may therefore want to simply research on past events and assign them a 1 5 1 being very low 5 being very high risk rating based on your assessment of the likelihood for example you may assign a 1 on your employer going bankrupt and a 2 or 3 on being this is only slightly better than intuition but has the merit of being based on data e.g. frequency of in your neighborhood should i only consider more probable outcomes and have a plan for them if they occur this depends largely on your risk appetite the more risk averse you are the more thorough you will want to be in identifying tracking and mitigating risks for the risks that you have identified as relevant or of concern you may opt to establish a risk mitigating strategy which is one of accepting sharing by taking insurance for example avoiding and reducing it may not be possible to share or reduce some risks especially for individuals and so often the response will be either to accept or avoid the given risks by opting in or out on an opportunity

in theory in a perfect world what you state is almost true apart from transaction fees if you assume that the market is perfectly efficient ie public information is immediately reflected in a perfect reflection of future share value in all share prices when the information becomes available then in theory any transaction you would choose to take is opposed by a reasonable person who is not taking advantage of you just moving their position around this would make any and all transactions completely reasonable from a cost benefit perspective   ie if the future value of all dividends to be paid by apple ie the value of holding a share in apple exactly matches apple 's share price of $ 1,000 then buying a share for $ 1,000 is an even trade selling a share for $ 1,000 is also an even trade now in a perfectly efficient market which we have assumed then there is no edge to valuing a company using your own methods if you take apple 's financial statements press releases reported information and if you apply modern financial theory to evaluate the future dividends from apple you should get the same $ 1,000 share price that the market has already arrived at so in this example why would n't you just throw darts at a printout of the s&p 500 and invest in whatever it lands on because even if the perfectly efficient market agrees on the true value of something different investments have different characteristics as an example consider a simple comparison of corporate bonds corporations make bond offerings to the public allowing individual investors to effectively lend money to the corporation for a future benefit for simplicity assume a bond with a face value the amount to be repaid to the investor on maturity of $ 1,000 has these 3 defining characteristics 1 the price what the investor pays to acquire it 2 interest payments how much if any the corporation will pay to the investor before maturity and when those payments will be made and 3 a bond rating which is a third party assessment of how risky the bond is based on the health of the corporation now if the bond rating agency is perfect in its risk assessment and if the price of all bond 's is fair then why does it matter who you loan your money to it matters because different people want different things out of their investments if you are waiting to make a down payment on a house next year then you do n't want risk you want to be certain that you will get your cash back even if it means lower returns so even though a high risk bond may be perfectly priced it should only be bought by someone willing to bear that risk if you are retired and you need your bonds to pay you interest regularly as your sole source of income then of course a zero coupon bond one that pays no interest is not helpful to you if you are young and have a long time to invest then you may want risk because you have time to overcome losses and you want to get the most return possible in addition taxes are not universal between all investors some people benefit from things that would be tax heavy to their neighbors for example in canada there is a dividend tax credit which reduces the taxes owing on dividends received by a corporation this credit exists to prevent double taxation because otherwise the corporation would pay its ~30 of tax and then a wealthy investor would pay another of tax due to the mechanics of how the credit is calculated however someone who makes less money gets an even lower tax bill than they normally would this means that someone making under the top tax bracket in canada has a tax benefit by receiving dividends this means that while 2 stocks may be both fairly priced if one pays dividends and the other does n't ie if the other company instead reinvests more heavily in future projects creating even more value for shareholders down the road then someone in the bottom tax brackets may want the dividend paying stock more than the other in conclusion picking investments yourself does require some knowledge to prevent yourself from making a bad buy this is because the market is not perfectly efficient as well specific market mechanics make some trades more costly than they should be in theory consider for example transaction fees and tax mechanics finally even if you assume that all of the above is irrelevant as a theoretical idea different investors still have different needs just because $ 1,000,000 is the fair price for a factory in your home town does n't mean you might as well convert your retirement savings to buy it as your sole asset

i started a business a few years ago   at one point it was n't going so well and my father loaned me an amount not too dissimilar to what you 've done from a personal perspective the moment i took that loan there was a strain the relationship   especially when i was sometimes late on the interest payments   unfortunately thoughts like he does n't need this right now but if i do n't pay the car loan then that is taken away came up a few times and paying the interest fell to the bottom of the monthly bill payment stack at some point my wife and i finally took a hard look at my finances and goals   we got rid of things that simply were n't necessary car payment cable tv etc and focused on the things we needed to   doing the same with the business helped out as well as it helped focus me to to turn things around   things are now going great that said two of my siblings ran into their own financial trouble that our parents helped them on   when this happened my father called us together and basically everyone 's debt by an equal amount which covered everything plus wrote a check to the one that was doing fine   this cleared the air with regards to future inheritance questions about how much one sibling was being helped vs another etc   honestly it made family gatherings more enjoyable as all that underlying tension was now gone i 've since helped one of my children   although i went about it an entirely different way    rather than loan them money i gave it to them   we also had a few discussions on how i think they ought to manage their finances and a set of goals to work towards which we co developed   bearing in mind that they are an individual and sometimes you can lead a horse   given the current state of things i consider it money well spent

if you 've already used turbotax on your 2015 taxes you can use the numbers turbotax gave you as your reasonable estimate   line 4 is your estimate of total tax liability for 2015 this would be line 63 of form 1040 this is federal income tax only not social security tax   line 5 is the total of tax payments you made last year you should be able to read this off your w-2 forms box 2 it corresponds to line 74 on the 1040   line 6 is the difference between lines 4 and 5 you ca n't claim a refund on the extension so if line 5 is more than line 4 enter 0 otherwise subtract line 5 from line 4 and enter it in line 6 this is the amount you should send in with the form to minimize any penalty due with your taxes later   the turbotax software can generate this extension form automatically i believe   also do n't forget to give a copy of this extension form to your tax preparer he will need to know the amount you sent in

gt tax rates do make a difference between whether to invest here or in ireland    not actual investment but if you have the discretion to profits to a lower taxed jurisdiction necessarily a loophole that can be closed then you may structure transactions accordingly   gt he money that american businesses profit overseas stays overseas instead of being repatriated because the taxes are too high to justify paying them before reinvesting the money in the economy    that is an issue that is also independent of tax rates   providing incentives to bring money back is unlikely to finance any new investment though   there are loopholes that allow using foreign assets cash especially to fund foreign loans that can finance any desired investment   still even if repatriation is used for stock buybacks and dividends that would be more money flowing into the us though not really money flowing to people who spend a high portion of flows rich investors   but just because there are reasonable arguments for tax reform encouraging repatriation and hq locations as at least not being does not support also including the genuinely directly harmful effects of cuts to tax rates

in most cases if you are a member of the class the law firm will contact you via postal mail to notify you of the class action and give you an opportunity to opt in or opt out of participating in any settlement that happens   more often than not they take the opt out approach meaning that if you do n't say you want out of the class it is assumed that you agree with the complaints as defined in the class action and would like to receive your portion of the money if there is a settlement   if you have n't gotten such a letter and you think you should have it is a good idea to contact the law firm how do you find the law firm usually some googling on class action and the name of the defendant company will get you there also check the legal section of the of the local newspaper they sometimes advertise them there   typically they are n't hard to find because it is in the law firm 's best interest to have everyone sign on to their class action for a number of reasons including if you have a lot of people who are supposedly it makes the defendant look more likely to be guilty and more participants can equate to higher settlement amounts for which the law firm gets a percentage that is why you see non stop ads on daytime tv for lawyers marketing class action cases and looking for people who took this drug or had that hip implant once a settlement occurs and you are a member of that class there are a number of ways you might get your piece including a credit to your account a check in the mail a coupon or some other consideration for your damages lame a promise that they will stop doing the bad thing and maybe some changes in your favor on the terms of your account a final note do n't get your hopes up the lawyers are usually the only ones who make any substantial money from these things not the class members i 've been paid settlements from lots of these things and it is rare for it to be more than $ 25 but the time the are divided i 've gotten numerous settlements where my share was less than a dollar there are some decent resources on but beware that although the site has some good information it is primarily just an ad for a also note that i am not affiliated with that site nor can i vouch for any information contained there they are not an impartial source so understand that when reading anything on there

i agree that to take the money from the defined benefit plan you are saying that you can get a better return than the plan you are taking all the risk if you take the lump sum but there are two more risks that you are taking by keeping the money in the plan even though you are decades from retirement funding risk companies and state city county governments have underfunded their pension programs due to budget pressure in some cases they have skipped payments when the market was good because they felt they were ahead of their obligations they also delayed or skipped contributions when they had a budget shortfall and wanted to not end the government company fiscal year in the red the risk is that they can get so far behind that they change their promises to current and former employees this was one of the issues with the city of detroit this year bankruptcy even though their are guarantees regarding pension benefits the pension benefit guaranty corporation does set a maximum benefit if the company goes bankrupt or the plan is terminated   you might not get all the money you were expecting while the chances of taking a haircut generally impacts people who have a long career because they are entitled to a large benefit it can impact people who do n't expect it

can you easily stomach the risk of higher volatility that could come with smaller stocks how certain are you that the funds would n't have any asset bloat that could cause them to become large cap funds for holding to their winners if having your 401(k balance get chopped in half over a year does n't give you any pause or hesitation then you have greater risk tolerance than a lot of people but this is one of those things where living through it could be interesting while i would n't be against the advice i would consider caution on whether or not the next 40 years will be exactly like the averages of the past or not in response to the comments you did n't state the funds so i how i do know you meant index funds specifically look at fidelity low priced stock for a fund that has bloated up in a sense could this happen with small cap funds possibly but this is something to note if you are just starting to invest now it is easy to say i 'll stay the course and then when things get you may not be as strong as you thought this is just a warning as i 'm not sure you get my meaning here imagine that some women may think when having a child i do n't need any drugs and then the pain comes and an is demanded because of the different between the hypothetical and the real version while you may think i 'll just turn the cheek if you punch me if i actually just did it out of the blue how sure are you of not at me for doing it really stop and think about this for a moment rather than give an answer that may or may not what you 'd really do when the matter hits the oscillator could n't you just look at what stocks did the best in the last 10 years and just buy those companies think carefully about what strategy are you using and why or else you could get tossed around as more than a few things were supposed to be the sure thing that turned out to be incorrect like the dream team of long term capital management the banks that were too big to fail the japanese taking over in the late 1980s etc there are more than a few times where things started looking one way and ended up quite differently though i wonder if you are aware of this performance chasing that some will do

when you invest say $ 1000 in say 100 shares of a mutual fund at $ 10 per share and the price of the shares changes   you do not have a capital gain or loss and you do not have to declare anything to the irs or make any entry on any line on form 1040 or tell anyone else about it either you can brag about it at parties if the share price has gone up or bitter tears into your cocktail if the price has gone down but the irs not only does not care but it will not let you deduct the paper loss or pay taxes on the paper gain   what you put down on form 1040 schedules b    and d is precisely what the mutual fund will tell you on    form 1099-div and form 1099-b no more no less if you did not report any of these amounts on your previous    tax returns you need to file amended tax returns both    federal as well as state a stock mutual fund invests in stocks and the fund manager may buy and sell some stocks during the course of the year if he makes a profit that money will be distributed to the share holders of the mutual fund that money can be re invested in more shares of the same mutual fund or taken as cash   and possibly invested in some other fund this   capital gain distribution is reported to you on form 1099-div and you have to report sit on your tax return even if you re invested in more share of the same mutual fund and the amount of the distribution is taxable income to you similarly if the stocks owned by the mutual fund pay dividends those will be passed on to you as a dividend distribution and all the above still applies you can choose to reinvest etc the amount will be reported to you on form 1099-div and you need to report it to the irs and include it in your taxable income if the mutual fund manager loses money in the buying and selling he will not tell you that he lost money but it will be visible as a reduction in the price of the shares the loss will not be reported to you on form 1099-div and you can not do anything about it   especially important you can not declare to the irs that you have a loss and you can not deduct the loss on your income tax returns that year when you finally sell your shares in the mutual fund you will have a gain or loss that you can pay taxes on or deduct say the mutual fund paid a dividend of $ 33 one year and you re invested the money into the mutual fund buying 3 shares at the then cost of $ 11 per share you declare the $ 33 on your tax return that year and pay taxes on it two years later you sell all 103 shares that you own for $ 10.50 per share   your total investment was $ 1000 + $ 33 = $ you get $ from the fund and you will owe taxes on $ $ = $ you have a profit of $ 50 on the 100 shares originally bought and a loss of $ 1.50 on the 3 shares bought for $ 11 the net result is a gain of $ you do not pay taxes on $ as the profit from your original $ 1000 investment you pay taxes only on $ remember that you already paid taxes on the $ 33 the mutual fund will report on form 1099-b that you sold 103 shares for $ and that you bought the 103 shares for   an average price of $ = $ per share the difference is taxable income to you if you sell the 103 shares for $ 9 per share say    then you get $ out of an investment of $ for    a capital loss of $ 106 this will be reported to you    on form 1099-b and you will enter the amounts on    schedule d of form 1040 as a capital loss what you actually pay taxes on is the net capital gain if any after combining all your capital gains and losses for the year if the net is a loss you can deduct up to $ 3000 in a year and carry the rest   forward to later years to offset capital gains in later years but your unrealized capital gains or losses those that occur because the mutual fund share price goes up and down like a while you grin or grit your teeth and hang on to your shares are not reported or deducted or taxed anywhere it is more complicated when you do n't sell all the shares you own in the mutual fund or if you sell shares within one year of buying them but let 's stick to simple cases

really this is no different from any kind of large lump sum and having a mortgage   there are probably many questions and answers on this subject   it really does n't matter that the proceeds were the result of a sale an inheritance would not change the answer i think it is important to note that the proceeds will not eliminate the house 2 mortgage a high level choice of investment one makes is between equity such as stock and debt investments such as bonds and mortgages   you are in a unique case of being able to invest in your own mortgage with no investment fee   this may tip the scales in favor of paying down the mortgage    it is difficult to answer in your specific case as we do n't know the rest of your finances   do you have a sizable 401 k that is heavily invested in stocks   do you have the need for a college fund   do you have an emergency fund   do you have a desire to own several homes generating income property if it was me i 'd do the following in order skipping steps i may have already completed i 've heard that the bank may agree to a one time adjustment to lower the payments on mortgage 2 because of paying a very large payment is this something that really happens i really kind of hate this attitude   your goal is to get rid of the mortgage in a timely manner   doing such makes paying for kids college a snap reduces the income one might need in retirement basically eliminates the need for life insurance and gives one a whole lot of money to have fun with

in the us there is only one stock market ignoring penny stocks and of different exchanges behind it   nyse and nasdaq are two different exchanges but all the products you can buy on one can also be bought on the other i.e. they are all the same market   so a us equities broker can not possibly restrict access to any markets in the us because there is only one interestingly it is commonplace for us equity brokers to cheat their customers by using only exchanges where they the brokers get the best deals even if it means your order is not executed as quickly or cheaply as possible   this is called payment for order flow and unfortunately will probably take an act of congress to stop some very large brokers will have trading access to popular equity markets in other countries toronto stock exchange mexico stock exchange london stock exchange and can support your trades there   however at many brokers or in less popular foreign markets this is usually not the case to trade in the average foreign country you typically must open an account with a broker in that country

there are very few circumstances where forming an out of state entity is beneficial but a website is within these circumstances in certain instances businesses with no physical operations do not need to care what jurisdiction they are registered in your home state a better united state or non united state the limited liability does it 's job if you are storing inventory or purchasing offices to compliment your online business you need to register in the state those are located in an online business is an example of a business with no physical presence all states want you to register your llc in the state that you live in but this is where you need to read that state 's laws what are the consequences of not registering there might be none there might be many   in new york for example there are no consequences for not registering and registering in new york especially the city is likely the most expensive in the usa if your llc needs to represent itself in court new york provides retroactive foreign registrations and business licenses so basically despite saying that you need to pay over $ 1000 to form your llc or else the reality is that you get the local limited liability protection in courts whenever you actually need it check your local state laws but more times than not it is analogous to asking a barber if you need a haircut the representative is always going to say yes you do while the law and associated case law reveals that you do n't the federal government does n't care what state your form an llc or partnership in banks do n't care what state you form an llc or partnership in the united states post office does n't care making an app the apple itunes store does n't care so that covers all the applicable authorities you need to consider now just go with the cheapest in the us alone there are 50 states and several territories all with their own fee structures so you just have to do your research despite conflicting with another answer wyoming is still relevant because it is cheap and has a mature system and laws around business entity formation has agents in every state but there are registered agents everywhere you can even call the secretary of state in each state for a list of registered agents get an employer id number yourself after the business entity is formed it takes less than 5 minutes all of this is also contingent on how your llc or partnership distributes funds if your llc is not acting like a pass through entity to you and your partner but instead holding its own profits like a corporation then again none of this matters you need to form it within the state you live and do foreign registrations in states where it has any physical presence as it has becomes its own tax person in those states this is relevant because you said you were trying to do something with a friend

it seems to be that your main point is this no matter what my chances can not be worse than random and if my trading system has an edge that is greater than the percentage of the transaction that is transaction cost then i am probabilistically likely to make a profit in general yes that is true but consider this very bad strategy buy one share of stock and sell it one minute later and repeat this every minute of the day obviously you would bleed your account dry with fees however even this horrible strategy still meets your criteria because if this bad strategy had an edge beyond the transaction fees you would likely still make a profit in other words your conclusion reduces to an uninteresting statement if there were no transactions fees then if your trading system has an edge then you will likely make a profit sorry to be the bearer of bad news but imho that statement and others made in the question are just obvious things stated in convoluted ways i do n't want to discourage you from thinking about these things though i personally really enjoy these type of thought experiments i just feel you missed the mark on this one

simply put it makes sense from the moment you can afford the loss without negative consequences for example if your car costs $ 20000 and you happen to have another $ 20000 laying around you can choose not to insure your car against damage in the worst case you can simply buy a new one however not insuring your car has a hidden cost you ca n't long term invest that money anymore if your insurance costs $ 500 a year and you can invest those $ 20000 with a return on investment of more than 2.5 it still makes sense to invest that money while having your car insured

what is my best course of action trying to minimize future debt minimizing expenses is the best thing you can do the first step to financial independence is making do with less assuming i receive this $ 3500 am i better off using the bulk to pay off my credit cards or should i keep as much cash available as i can this would depend on the interest rate that is associated with the credit cards and the $ 3500 if the $ 3500 has a higher interest rate than your credit cards then do not use any of it to pay your credit cards paying back the money you borrow hurts but it 's the interest rate that does you in if the interest rate for the $ 3500 is lower than the credit card interest then placing some of it on the credit cards may be a wise course of action but this depends on how long you are out of work if you could be out of work for an extended period of time i would recommend holding on to all of the funds note on saving i know this goes against the grain but i would actually not recommend saving several months worth of funds maybe one month though most employers offer some type of retirement savings account 401(k thrift savings plan etc i contribute 5 to this fund instead of putting the money in savings this is an especially effective strategy if your employer offers matching contributions such as mine because the for a savings account are so low it is not a wise place to store your money in the long run if i had placed my thrift savings plan contributions in a standard savings account i would now be $ 12,000 poorer in addition to this most long term investment accounts allow you to withdraw the money early in case of emergency such as being without work i also find it too to have huge amounts of funds on hand

this depends on the jurisdiction but such companies are typically subject to regulations and audits that require them to keep the customers accumulated premiums very strictly separated from the company 's own assets liabilities and expenses additionally they are typically only allowed to invest the capital in very safe things like government bonds so unless something truly catastrophic happens like the us government defaulting on its bonds or people in the company break the regulations which would all kinds of serious crimes and require or complete failure of the auditors your premiums and the contractual obligation to you would still be there and would be absorbed by a different insurance company that takes over the defunct company 's business   realistically what all this means is that insurance companies never go bankrupt if they do badly they are typically bought up by a competitor long before things get that bad

you ca n't tell for sure   if there was such a technique then everyone would use it and the price would instantly change to reflect the future price value however trade volume does say something   if you have a lemonade stand and offer a large glass of ice cold lemonade for 1c on a hot summer day i 'm pretty sure you 'll have high trading volume   if you offer it for $ 5000 the trading volume is going to be around zero since the supply of lemonade is presumably limited at some point dropping the price further is n't going to increase the number of transactions    trade volumes reflect to some degree the difference of valuations between buyers and sellers and the supply and demand   it 's another piece of information that you can try looking at and interpreting   if you can be more successful at this than the majority of others on the market not very likely you may get a small edge   i 'm willing to bet that high frequency trading algorithms factor volume into their trading decisions among multiple other factors

eu and north america long term strategy is to tell russia that it does n't get to do whatever the hell it feels like i.e. taking crimea   eu and north america long term strategy is to lower eu dependence on russian gas and possibly fond a way to increase imports of canadian or us gas    now i 'm not saying this whole thing is n't stupid in many ways it is indeed ukraine should have stuck with russia they are not in the position to join eu however due to circumstances it happened    i fully agree that it will hurt everyone but it 's going to and has hit russia much harder than many russians care to admit

as long as your bank does not have any limits on the number of transactions per month you should be fine the danger would be theft while you had the money before depositing into the new account i would expect that your new credit union could do a wire transfer for you it might cost you a few dollars but it would be safer and probably faster

is it possible her husband obtained a card from a bank overseas unlikely a bank overseas generally will not issue such cards is that why she ca n't find it on the credit report the data sent to credit bureau is periodic and not immediate at times it may take a month or more for a bank to start reporting the new card to credit agencies if he got the card recently she has a freeze in effect and no bank can issue a card in her name without her approval possibly timing issue i.e. the freeze was put after card company pulled the report and approved it may take sometime to dispatch a new card so it could be that her husband applied for this card previously before the freeze was put in place

how does finra 's 5 markup policy   affect the expense profit value of an etf mutual fund   an extreme example to illustrate if my fund buys 100 ibm 100 the fund would credit the broker $ 10,000 for those shares and the broker would give the fund 100 shares additionally there would be some sort of commission say $ 10 paid on top of the transaction which would come out of the fund 's expense ratio   but the broker is allowed to charge a 5 markup so that means that $ 100 price that i see could have hit the tape at $ 95 assume 5 markup which is allowed thus assuming that the day had zero volatility for ibm   when the fund gets priced at the end of the day my 100 shares which cost 10,000 plus $ 10 now has a market value of $ 9,500 is that how it could work that 500 is n't calculated as part of the expense of the fund is it how could it be they do n't know about the exact value of the markup

yes yes beholden to the shareholders at all possible costs of morals ethics or long term sustainability the wonders of the stock market   nonetheless it 's not entirely true he has a responsibility to do what the shareholders want which might not be profit above all furthermore since he is the biggest shareholder he has the largest single say in what the shareholders want in fact he and the mason company own just under 50 so they pretty much get to decide between them what to do   now add to that the fact that being a patent troll is n't necessarily a profitable strategy nor a particularly palatable behaviour and it 's pretty easy to say we will not go down this road and get approval   finally it does n't change the fact that bezos is still a fucking hypocrite

i think what you 're asking is   can i buy 1000 shares of the stock at $ 1   for $ 1000    it goes up to $ 2 then sell 500 shares of the stock with proceeds of $ 1000 now    having my original $ 1000 out of it and still owning 500 shares     and that not create a taxable event since all i    did was take my cost basis back out and did n't collect any gains    and then i want to repeat that over and over nope not in the usa anyway    each sale is a separate taxable event the first sale will have proceeds of $ 1000 and a cost basis of $ 500 with $ 500 of capital gains and taxes owed at the time of that sale the remaining stock will have a cost basis of $ 500 and proceeds of whatever you sell it for in the future the next batch of stock will have a cost basis of whatever you pay for it    the only thing that works anything like the way you 're thinking is a roth ira    you can put your cost basis in pull it back out and put it back in again all tax free    but every time your cost basis cycles in that counts your contribution limits unless you do it fast enough to call it a rollover

when i was in high school my mom got me a joint credit account with both of our names on it for exactly this reason well that and to have in case i found myself in some sort emergency but it was mostly to build credit history that account is still on my credit report it 's my oldest by a few years and looking at the age of it i was 17 at the time we opened it and i think my younger sister got one around the same time   in my case i now have an excellent credit score and my weakest area is the age of my accounts so having that old account definitely helps me i do n't think i 've really taken advantage of it and i 'm not sure if i 'd really be worse off if my mom had n't done that but it certainly has n't hurt and i plan on buying a house in the next year or so so having anything to bump up the credit score seems like a good thing

the store card that amazon offers gives 5 back on amazon purchases some time ago when i realized how much of my spending was going through amazon i chose that card over this one   if you want the card that 's fine but if you are going to play the reward game there are far higher bonuses available for card signups no it 's not a scam many stores will offer a discount at the register the day you sign up for there card in general the store cards should also give a discount when used at that store or airline for that matter
