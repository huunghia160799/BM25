as a gift the responsibility lays with the giver to file a 709 with their taxes for gifting to a single entity barring certain exclusions an amount over $ 14,000 within the 2017 tax year if this person is a foreign entity from outside the country you might need to provide in your tax filing a form 3520 the reporting limits are more than $ 100,000 from a foreign estate or non resident alien or more than $ from a foreign company if you do n't know who where the money came from i.e. cash it would be considered found money and fall under income not a gift

appears to be a hypothetical question and not really worth answering but must it be explained no not until audited it 's saying that for everything reported on a tax return people have to include an explanation for everything which you do not unless you want to make some type of disclosure which is a different matter must it be reported yes based on info presented all income is taxable unless specifically exempted per the us tax code or court cases gift vs found income it 's not found income as someone gave gifted the money to him generally gifts received are not taxable and do n't have to be reported

this is a case where you sit down with an advisor or two there are legal and tax issues   when you deposit the cash or buy a car with it the large cash transaction will trigger a notice to the us government so they will eventually find out   before you get to that point you need to know what obligations and consequences you will be facing because you do n't know if it was a gift or found money or if the owner will be back looking for you to return it therefore you need expert advice

nah fill it in on the line that says other income with type of 5th amendment there 's lots of reasons why you might want to do this and it 's the government 's job to find out which one and they 're not allowed to use the bare fact that you put 5th amendment there to open an investigation

well that 's probably not even all of it if that stranger did his taxes properly then he already paid about a third of it to the government because wherever he got it from it was income for him and thus it must have been taxed now the remainder is in your hands and yes according to us law it is now your income and so now you too must pay about a third of it to the government and yes you are supposed to explain where it came from be careful giving it to somebody else or it 'll be taxed yet again disclaimer i am not a us citizen

you can report it as illegal income and you do n't have to elaborate any further   for instance spirit the cash off to a state where pot is legal and set up a   that is not legal at the federal level so it is in fact illegal income vis a vis your form 1040 and that 's all you say make sure you look walk and like a fairly successful pot distributor that will most likely be the end of their inquiry since they 're not terribly driven to investigate the income you do report   having to give 33 of it to the irs is generally strong motivation for folks to not report fake income   you 're not claiming the money is from pot you 're allowing them to infer it

do i have to explain the source of all income on my taxes yes you do say the of and mary the argued to the irs that the money was n’t income and so it should not be taxed as such the irs was n’t swayed by the couple ’s argument the case went to federal court and the irs won found property and money has been considered taxable income ever since the irs plainly states that taxpayers must report all income from any source even income earned in another country unless it is explicitly exempt under the u.s. tax code this covers a wide range of miscellaneous income including gambling winnings according to the decision money you find is n’t explicitly exempt the tax impact wo n’t be significant if you find an item of property with a fair market value of only $ 500 and are in the 25 tax bracket you ’ll owe the irs $ 125 $ 500 x .25 = $ 125 however if you are a finder and keeper of $ 10,000 your tax burden will be $ 2,500 $ 10,000 x .25 = $ 2,500

gt so i asked this question in /r and got some interesting answers mostly about how banks exist to make money out of nowhere and to fool people what do y all have to say   that is n't what they said nobody mentioned fooling people from what i can see from a cursory glance and if they did they 're being facetious   also they did n't mean make money from thin air in the sense of it being a magical trick they make money from a sort of market inefficiency they broker between people who want to invest money and those who want to borrow it   the top two answers are about right a bank borrows money from investors who deposit money in checking and savings accounts and lends it to borrowers in the form of loans or mortgages the difference between the interest rates is their profit   you deposit $ 1000 with me at 2 for 20 years i give you $ at the end of that term where did i get the extra five hundred books well i lent it out in mortgages over the same terms at 6 and received $ over the same period of time your $ 1000 made you $ and made me $ which i keep for the purposes of providing you with atms dealing with bad debts and staffing the place simple eh   of course they also provide other services in addition to this and the way in which they do it is regulated but that 's all a bank is at its core   a central bank is slightly different they issue money i.e. print it and supply it at a headline interest rate to the commercial banks and of course banks borrow amongst themselves but then we get ourselves down the rabbit hole of grown up economics and libor and the like there are whole textbooks used to explain exactly how that mechanism works and what 's going on there   but if you want to get rich find a way to start a bank seriously doing it to the old school way is seriously profitable if you can be trusted

in the us you can get a home warranty when you buy a house that will cover major repairs for the first few years of owning a home   the costs vary based on age and the results of the home inspection   ours cost a year   this was put into our closing costs   unfortunately this market does have some companies that come i m with prices that seem too good to be true   as is usually the case they are   do research on the company you are getting the home from to make sure you are dealing with a reputable company that will honor its commitments by having 20 down you will avoid needing mortgage insurance which will save you a considerable   my pmi cost me about $ 70 a month however once you get to 20 equity in your home the pmi drops off   so if you can put down 15 you should be able to get out from under your pmi in a few years if you want to keep that 5 cushion while making extra payments the question is how much do you feel you need   so far owning a 70 year old home my extra costs have been around 2500 a year   but they seem to be in 1k chunks every 4 or 5 months

as others have pointed out there are often many factors that are contributing to a stock 's movement other than the latest news   in particular the overall market sentiment and price movement very often is the primary driver in any stock 's change on a given day    but in this case i 'd say your anecdotal observation is correct all else equal announcements of layoffs tend to drive stock prices upwards here 's why to the public layoffs are almost always a sign that a company is willing to do whatever is needed to fix an already known and serious problem mass layoffs are brutally hard decisions   even at companies that go through cycles of them pretty regularly they 're still painful every time   there 's a strong personal drain on the chain of executives that has to decide who loses their livelihood   and even if you think most execs do n't care and i think you 'd be wrong it 's still incredibly distracting    the process takes many weeks during which productivity plummets and it 's to everyone when it happens so companies very rarely do it until they think they have to   by that point they are likely struggling with some very publicly known problems usually contracting or negative margins    so the market 's view of the company at the time just before layoffs occur is almost always this company has problems but is unable or unwilling to solve them   layoffs signal that both of those possibilities are incorrect   they suggest that the company believes that layoffs will fix the problem and that they 're willing to make hard calls to do so and that 's why they usually drive prices up

this is a short diagonal put spread generally you 're writing that long dated one at the money and buying the short dated one out of the money   the maximum amount that can be made is if the stock breaks out strongly to the upside and you keep the upfront credit minus whatever small amount it took to buy the april puts back   you can also make money if it breaks strongly to the downside but only if the credit when you opened your positions was more than $ 10 example   now say the stock falls to $ 500 by the time of that march expiration you 'd make $ on the march put and lose $ 100/share on the april put or a little more but that deep in the money there wo n't be much premium on it that 's a loss of $ 10/share or so i make a point of pointing this out because in that article i linked to the fact that your upfront credit needs to be greater than the strike spread in order to profit to the downside is not clearly mentioned

yeah there 's a lot to talk about with basic income like how currently there is an incentive to not work harder or move up the socio economic ladder because as you earn more your welfare benefits go away so people think it 's not worth getting a better job because they will pay more in taxes and lose benefits but now they are working harder and not getting more for it a basic income would n't go away with that sweet new job promotion therefore there is an incentive to work more   i like the basic income idea but i wonder about how to handle immigration and global relations you will have it in some countries where others are like literally falling apart basically we have a long way to go until we are comfortably collecting our bi checks at least in the us

that 's a dumb thesis for klarman if it 's what he 's doing   what history shows is that new investors are very interested in the total debt payments you are on the hook for    the higher your debt payments the less room there is for new payments      you clear off all debts people are more excited to lend because it 's the previous lenders that got the pain   it 's gambling   i really have no idea what klarman is doing we just know what happened with the situation    if klarman is not demanding 100 face value of the bonds but something not too much more than what he bought them for then who cares    there 's a reasonable function of debt where the debt holder who does n't want to deal with a long term repayment plan sells the debt to be out of the stress and the guy taking it on knows he will get an amount more that is a function of being willing to wait things out    it should n't be a amount more though   otherwise the original investor is an idiot for not waiting

banks have a financial and duty called know your customer established to avoid a number of historical problems occurring again such as money laundering terrorism financing fraud etc thanks to the scale and scope of the problem millions of customers billions of transactions a day the way they 're handling this usually involves fuzzy matching looking for irregular patterns problem escalation and other warning signs when exceeding some pre set limit these signal clues are then filtered and passed on for human inspection needless to say these algorithms are not perfect although thanks to financial pressure they are improving in order to understand why your trading account has been suspended it 's useful to look at the incentives false positives your trade and assuming you guilty until proven could cost them merely your ltv lifetime value of customer much your business brings in as profit while false negatives catching you while engaging in activities listed might cost them multi month investigations penalties and court   ultimately this is n't against you i 've been with the bank for 15 years and the money in the accounts has been very slowly accumulated via direct deposit paychecks over that time from this i gather the most likely explanation is that you 've hit of account threshold that the average credit happy customers usually do not exceed which triggered a routine checkup how do you deal with it practice there is only one way to survive angry customers emotionally you have to realize that they ’re not angry at you they ’re angry at your business and you just happen to be a convenient representative of that business and since they ’re treating you like a puppet an iconic stand in for the real business you need to treat yourself as a puppet too pretend you ’re a the customer is yelling at the puppet they ’re not yelling at you they ’re angry with the puppet your job is to figure out gosh what can i make the puppet say that will make this person a happy customer   in an investigation case go with boredom the puppet does n't care have no feelings and is patient figure out what are the most likely words that will have the matter mentally resolved from the investigator 's point of view tell them what they have to hear and you 'll have case closed in no time hope this helps

stock basically implies your ownership in the company if you own 1 ownership in a company the value of your stake becomes equal to 1 of the valuation of the entire company dividends are basically of company 's profits to its shareholders by holding stocks of a company you become eligible to receiving dividends proportional to your ownership in the company dividends though are not guaranteed as the company may incur losses or the management may decide to use the cash for future growth instead of it to the shareholders for example let 's say a company called abc inc is listed on nyse and has a total of 1 million shares issued let 's say if you purchase 100 stocks of abc your ownership in abc will become let 's say that the share price at the time of purchase was $ 10 each total investment = stock price number of stocks purchased = $ 10 100 = $ 1,000 now let 's say that the company declares a dividend of $ 1 per share then   dividend yield = dividend stock price = $ = 10 if one has to draw analogy with other banking products one can think of stock and dividend as fixed deposits analogous to stock and the interest earned on the fixed deposit analogous to dividend

let 's start from the premise that the mortgage is something you will have anyway because you need it to live as opposed to say getting a bigger mortgage initially in the expectation of paying it down faster than scheduled in that case i think paying down a mortgage certainly is an investment one with a well defined interest rate and maturity that depends on the precise terms of the mortgage for example i have a uk mortgage that 's fixed for the next two years at about 5 and allows overpayments of £ 500 per month which can be withdrawn at any time so i treat those overpayments as equivalent to savings with quite a nice interest rate especially since mortgage interest is n't tax deductible and so i actually get the full benefit of that interest rate

climate scientists urgently need to explain why global warming has declined in recent years   i have a scientific background but this is not necessary to understand the relevance of this point   the nature of climate science means that the reverse should be true   man has not reduced the overall amount of co2 and other greenhouse gases therefore the climate should have continued to warm this is simple logic   what is worse for climate scientists is that the historical data suggests that climate is cyclical with much warmer periods apparent in pre industrial times   the inconvenience of this has led to climate scientists concentrating on the period from 1980 onwards the basis for this is that much more detailed information is available unfortunately the data for this period is showing the climate cooling rather than rising   man is doing tremendous damage to the environment in terms of pollution and fossil fuels are limited these are worrying have nothing to do with climate science   to believe in climate change is akin to believing in the tooth fairy to be a non believer is akin to being the little boy in the story of the emperor with no clothes   climate scientists are starting to run scared they have a theory but no evidence or even worse they have evidence that shows them to be wrong   they have built up a whole industry based on a fallacy now they are willing to tell any lie necessary to perpetuate it   this is not science

only you can decide whether it 's wise or not given your own personal circumstances brexit is certainly a big risk and noone can really know what will happen yet the specific worries you mention are certainly valid additionally you might find it hard to keep your job or get a new one if the economy turns bad and in an extreme no deal scenario you might find yourself forced to leave though i think that 's very unlikely house prices could also collapse leaving you in negative equity if you 're planning on staying in the same location in the uk for a long time a house tends to be a worthwhile investment particularly as you always need somewhere to live so owning it is a hedge against prices rising even if prices do fall you do still have somewhere to live if you 're planning on going back to your home country at some point that reduces the value of owning a house if you want to reduce your risk consider getting a mortgage with a long term fixed rate there are some available for 10 years which i 'd hope would be enough to get us over most of the brexit volatility

with every caveat that rick said plus many many more lets have some fun   one common way to measure risk is volatility of returns roughly how much the value of your asset jumps around   interestingly the following ordering is fairly similar for many other common measures of risk the first three on the list would be mostly interchangeable   generally putting your money in cash investments has no real day to day price variability and the main risk is that the bank wo n't give you your money back at the end   money market funds are last as they can break the buck to get a feel for the next few on the list i 'm using previous 360 day volatility numbers for representative broad indices 2014 10 27   while these volatility values can move around quite a bit the order is actually remarkably stable hedge funds might seem out of place here but remember that hedge funds can hold be long and short at the same time and this can cancel out daily variation   however hedge funds do have plenty of risks that may not be well accounted for by this measure    for derivatives i 'll refer to back to rick 's answer this is a measure for broad investment in these categories your particular investment in long term capital management or bonds may vary it is important to note that your return on your investment generally grows as you go toward more risky investments down this list as people generally expect to be rewarded   in the long term for risky investments

i suggest to start charging slightly more than needed to cover expenses all you need is to show profit it does n't have to be significant a couple of hundred of dollars of consistent yearly profit should suffice to show a profitable business then you can deduct on schedule c all the related expenses the caveat is that the profit after the deduction of the expenses will be a bit smaller will be subject to not only income tax but also the self employment tax but at least you 'll pay tax on profit that is not entirely phantom i remember suggesting you getting a professional consultation on this matter a while ago you should really do that talk to a ea cpa licensed in your state it may be well worth the $ 100 200 fee they 'll charge for the consultation if at all

therefore i get the outcome i want    the human brain must think it ca n't stop   if you do n't believe me try     the mental process of putting stuff in those is called rationalization   this is a bored mind who wants something   if that mind is not particularly well disciplined those things will get pretty unrealistic    that is what has happened to your friend   landlords do not like drama   they do like money   generally a landlord will be happy to take your money any reasonable way that they can achieve   it sounds like either your landlord lost the ability to do credit cards or he got sick of paying the 3 overhead or some other overhead costs that may be higher because he does not have the right credit card merchant service   for instance paypal here charges flat but a traditional can cost up to $ 2000 a year in up fees and charges    as soon as the landlord calls the rent a debt he has to take cash   but in most places rental is at will and the landlord can evict for any reason or no reason at all except race color national origin family running a daycare center and a few other protected reasons   and there 's not a whole lot you can do about it   even for a lease he can trump up a reason   your friend would be wise to have a meeting of the minds with the landlord about how he 'd like to pay   business is done by mutual consent not non consensual legal tricks   i agree i would n't do ach either    one problem with ach or credit is the landlord can charge anything he pleases and that 's when they start in surcharges for things   once he 's pulled the money out you 're really at a disadvantage to argue since he already has the money and it 's really difficult to do a chargeback on part of a payment so you end up having to chargeback the entire rent check and now he can evict you

the rent vs. buy debate or strategy has been a really interesting and surprising one to me i can see both sides   for instance where i live one of the points on the local politician 's platform is that he keeps property taxes low     there are also significant tax deductions in the current tax code that favor the early stages of a primary residence home loan amortization where the payments are mostly interest     so such a place might be a more effective place to live to retain the most income for some period of time early in the loan term      often places with cheap rent are n't places someone would want to live you make important points about problems related to that places that someone with enough income to make this strategy significant needs to live are n't always going to be cheap to rent or cheap to own    for some people in their prime earning amp investing years this is a significant calculation to consider

i think you need to study the history of industrialization   first of all these people are nt losers they work honestly do nt commit crime   second minimum wage laws come out of the history of industrialization   the only reason we have any middle class whatsoever is because of the labor movement ill allow you some time to look up as an example coal miners strikes or the jungle by    second please take an econ course above 201 regulation yes brings more business if it is correcting a market failure   a market failure is when the private market does not produce maximum social benefit when = that is a market failure pb being private benefit   then entire field of economics is dedicated to discovering proper methods to correct market failures   since most industries have at least some failures in the most efficient way possible to where =   yes regulation can bring benefit to the economy    one great and obvious example is the regulation of lemons without regulation there would be no restriction against selling products with widespread sale of dysfunctional products the economy would suffer as users demand lower prices even for perfectly good products because they can not know whether it is a lemon this is just one example of a regulation against business benefiting the economy    once you have done educated yourself i m happy to continue this discussion on a rational footing

because companies big or small only pay taxes on profits rather than it ca n't be any other way really because of the $ 5 you pay for the big mac most of that goes to pay suppliers and employees and only perhaps $ 0.50 would be profit   but that fact also opens up all sorts of loopholes for example a us company can license a patent from a cayman islands company and make yearly payments thus the us company no longer has any profits and all of that money winds up in the caymans   that 's a trivial example but there 's an entire industry dedicated to doing this shit i 'd be impressed if you could craft any law that banned this without also banning legitimate international commerce

given that the laws on consumer liability for unauthorized transactions mean no cost in most cases the cvv is there to protect the merchant   typically a merchant will receive a lower cost from their bank to process the transaction with the cvv code versus without as far as the netflix case goes or any other recurring billing for that matter they would n't care as much about it because visa mc amex regulations prohibit storage of the cvv   so if they collect it then it 's only used for the first transaction and just use the rest of the card info name expiration date address does the presence of cvv indicate the merchant has better security   maybe maybe not   it probably means they care about their costs and want to pay the bank as little as possible to process the transaction

the company was paying only $ 1 a share in dividends compared to $ 10 a share in earnings that is a so called payout ratio of 10 which is low a more normal payout ratio would be 40 something like $ 4 a share if a $ 13 stock had a $ 4 dividend the dividend yield would be about 30 which would be too high meaning that the price would go up to drive down the resulting yield even $ 1 a share on a $ 13 stock is a high dividend of about 7 allowing for appreciation to say the $ range graham was a great believer in the theory that management should pay out most of its earnings in dividends he believed that by holding dividends so far below earnings the company was either being stingy or signalling that the $ 10 a share of earnings was unsustainable either of these would be bad for the stock for instance if $ 1 a share in dividends actually represented a 40 payout ratio it would signal management 's belief that they could normally earn only $ 2.50 a year instead of $ 10

what a lovely position to find yourself in there 's a lot of doors open to you now that may not have opened naturally for another decade if i were in your shoes benefiting from the hindsight of being 35 now at 21 i 'd look to do the following two things before doing anything else 1- put 6 months worth of living expenses in to a savings account a rainy day fund 2- if you have a pension i 'd be contributing enough of my salary to get the company match then i 'd top up that figure to 15 of gross salary into stocks shares isas with a view to them also being retirement funds now for what to do with the rest some thoughts first house if you do n't want to live in it just yet i 'd think twice about buying you would n't want a house to limit your career mobility or prove to not fit your lifestyle within 2 years costing you money to move on travel spending it all on travel would be excessive travel tends to be more interesting on a lower budget that is meeting people and riding trains and buses putting a amount in an account to act as a natural budget for this might be wise wealth managers approx 12 gain over 6 years so far equates to about 1.9 annual return not even beat inflation over that period so guessing they had it in ultra safe cash a guaranteed way to lose money over the long term give them the money to look after again i 'd sooner do it myself with a selection of low cost vehicles and equal or beat their return with far lower costs decisions a if you decided not to use the money for big purchases for at least 4 5 years then you could look to invest it in equities as you mentioned a broad basket of high yielding shares would allow you to get an income and give opportunity for capital growth the yield income could be used for your travel costs over a few years you could fill your isa allowance and realise any capital gains to stay under the annual exemption over 4 years or so it 'd all be tax free b if you do want to get a property sooner then the best bet would to seek out the best interest rates current accounts fixed rate accounts etc are offering the best interest rates at the moment usual places like and would help you identify them there 's nothing wrong with sitting on this money for a couple of years whilst you your way with it it might n't earn much but you 'd likely keep pace with inflation and you definitely would n't lose it or risk it unnecessarily c if you wanted to diversify your investment you could look to buy to let as the other post suggested this would require a 25 deposit and likely would cost 10 of rental income to have it managed for you there 's room for the property to rise in value and the rent should cover a mortgage but it may come with the headache of poor tenants or periods of so it 's not the buy and forget that many people assume with some effort though it may provide the best route to making the most of the money d some mixture of all of the above at different stages your money your choices and a valid choice would be to sit on the cash until you learn more about your options and feel the direction your heart is pointing you hope that helps i 'm happy to elaborate if you wish chris

you have not specified what country you are in that radically changes everything in case you are in canada there 's a great blog that covers bankruptcy and student loans at loan fundamentally in order to discharge government backed student loans you must have ceased to be a student for at least seven years prior to filing even then though the government can object in which case you will still have to repay some or all of the loan more generally given that the collection agency appears to be operating in bad faith you 'll want to ensure that they send you written documentation of any offer they are extending you if they refuse to do this you should assume that they are n't actually offering you anything at all and you will have to pay back the full amount plus interest and penalties note that in many countries if you settle the debt that is pay anything less than the full amount plus interest and penalties this will be a black mark on your credit report in this case if you repaid the full $ 16,000 and they the extra $ 4,000 they would most likely still add a note to your credit report indicating that you did not pay the full amount that you owed and this will negatively impact your credit rating even beyond your late payments

the price gaps up because the offer is for a price above the current price therefore people want to buy now before the price jumps to the offer level of course it does depend on the tone of the announcement   which party is making the announcement and are they announcing an offer or a deal if the price is $ 10 and the offer is for $ 12 then the price may quickly jump the early buyers will make the most quick money they hope that the deal is done quickly or if not the final price ends up higher   there are risks the company could reject the offer the due diligence could expose a problem the regulators could reject the deal based on anti trust issues the deal could take many months to complete or the final deal could be for shares in the new company   the risks are one reason people sell after the deal offer is announced in other cases the seller finally is seeing a profit or a smaller loss and wants out while they can

you have just answered your question in the last sentence of your question   more volume just means more people are interested in the stock i.e supply and demand are matched well if the stock is illiquid there is more chance of the spread and slippage being larger even if the spread is small to start with once a trade has been transacted if no new buyers and sellers enter the market near the last transacted price then you could get a large spread occurring between the bid and ask prices here is an example has a 50 day moving average volume of only 1200 share traded per day obviously it does not trade every day   as you can see there is already an 86 spread from the bid price if a new bid price is entered to match and take out the offer price at $ then this spread would instantly increase to from the bid price

i read rich dad poor dad and i must say found a lot of value in it   and i like to think i have a very good understanding of finance both personal and corporate   econ major have worked at several major brokerages financial advice for a living including at my current employer   but i do remember back in 2005 when i read kiyosaki 's book signing up to be contacted by a rich dad coach or something like that   basically some guy at the rich dad company who would be a financial mentor or sorts     long story short the rich dad coach asked for my credit score which was high and proceeded to recommend that i max out my credit to buy a house to flip in 1 2 months   now it 's true that it could have worked   but was it good advice   fucking hell no it was n't   and i think he wanted 5k to coach me through the process   i could have made money doing it even with paying him 5k but speculating by taking out personal lines of credit is not consistent with anything in the rich dad book   showed me right there that while the book 's advice may be good that organization was just out to make a buck at the readers expense

it 's a good point to make with bot presence for the most part twitter is made of people even if there are a lot of false or bot accounts that being said i do n't find it as strong a marketing channel because of the nature of twitter at its core    if you follow 1000 people you 're likely to have nearly 10,000 tweets going through your feed it 's hard to really fight for attention but you can still get decent response and views when done right    as for instagram   i think in the long term just as any other social network the lifespan of it depends on the content as long as people are having new experiences and taking photos of them there will always be more content    that being said there are tons of accounts that pretty much post the same content it things like the explore feature because they 're using less than kosher tactics to get likes    ultimately i think policing of instagram as they have been is the best strategy for keeping it going    even though i 'm a marketer i 'm also a millennial with pretty typical values blatant advertising is annoying and intrusive when it comes to user experience and many young people today feel that way    by policing things like auto engaging false locations you used to be able to just type locations like follow me and being very keen on following through with reports of spam accounts is a good way to keep younger people on it    unless you 're paying for ads marketing on instagram typically consists of native content that looks good on feeds and needs engagement to rise up this is a good way to curb marketing while still maintaining a good user experience    as a side note part of why i use snapchat less is how they shove ads down your throat which gets old pretty fast ads on snapchat pretty much ruined the platform for me personally aside from using it for communication    as long as instagram maintains this balance based around the user and not the advertisers i think it will be going for quite some time

war 2 was what carried america out of the great depression   not really the end results of world war ii did basically the destruction of all economic competition along with the fortunate improvements in productivity the advent of gasoline tractors in agriculture etc but the war years were ones of a combined voluntary forced austerity amp centralized planned production the vast majority of what was produced being destroyed or squandered   's possible people do desperate things when they 're hungry most people will resort to within 2 weeks without food    no most people will resort to a lot of other things first and then those failing they die of starvation   is and always has been a relatively rare thing   gt;it 's too unpredictable but my bet is that the coming collapse will be multiple times worse than the great depression   yes and no   probably longer in duration 20 to 30 years rather than ~10 and no doubt some significant parts of the infrastructure will deteriorate to the point of collapse   what in political amp economic terms comes out the other side of that is what is really unpredictable there will almost undoubtedly be some type of dictatorship police state in there most likely during the depression making it longer amp worse before it amp gets better but whether it would survive amp remain or be replaced by yet another in the aftermath is the big question

in the usa you probably owe self employment tax the cutoff for tax on this is you will need to file a tax return and cover the medicaid expenses as if you were both the employer and employee   in addition if he earns income from self employment he may owe self employment tax which means paying both the employee ’s and employer 's share of social security and medicaid taxes the trigger for self employment tax has been $ 400 since 1990 but the irs may change that in the future also see the irs website   so yes you need to file your taxes how much you will pay is determined by exactly how much your income is   if you do n't file you probably wo n't be audited however you are breaking the law and should be aware of the consequences

's answer is spot on with the advice to avoid repeated conversions but i 'd like to provide some specifics on the fees involved each time you round trip canadian dollars cad through a u.s dollar usd priced security at td waterhouse and leave your proceeds in cad you 're paying a total foreign exchange fee implied in their rate   spread of about 3 give or take that 's ~3 per buy sell combination or on each end you can imagine if you trade back forth frequently you can quickly lose a lot of money   do it back and forth ten times in a year and you 're out ~30 on the fees alone the td u.s. money market fund that td waterhouse is referring to has no direct commission to buy or sell but it does have a management expense ratio mer of 0.20 per year basically a fee which is deducted from the fund 's returns which today are also close to zero   practically speaking that 's a very slim fee to hold some usd in your canadian dollar tfsa while 0.20 is cheap a point to keep in mind is if you maintain a significant usd balance you are maintaining currency risk   you can lose money in cad terms if the cad appreciates vs. usd additional references canadian capitalist describes td waterhouse and the use of and wash trades at how to wash your trade   he 's referring to rrsps but the same applies to tfsas which came out after the post was written canadian couch potato has two relevant articles are us listed etfs really cheaper and lowering your currency exchange fees

i have an example that may be interesting for your question my grandfather had a tennis club around 35 years ago and some other businesses some investments went bad and he was heading for bankruptcy due to the tennis club 's expensive payments so he asked to renegotiate a variable rate rather than a fixed rate even though the interest rates were going up not down the idea was that if the current situation is going to bankrupt you taking a chance might be better as an analogy if you ca n't swim and you 'll drown in 6 feet of water it does n't matter that you 're taking the risk to go deeper you might have to take that chance to survive he did keep the tennis club in the end but that 's irrelevant here for student loans if i 'm not mistaken declaring bankruptcy does n't free you of all their debt so it may not be applicable   and this situation is when renegotiating not when negotiating the first time because obviously if you 're in trouble financially taking a loan you know you ca n't repay is suicide

to begin with bear in mind that over the time horizon you are talking about the practical impact of inflation will be quite limited inflation for 2017 is forecast at 2.7 and since you are talking about a bit less than all of 2017 and on average you 'll be withdrawing your money halfway through the overall impact will be < 1.3 of your savings you should consider whether the effort and risk involved in an alternative is worth a few hundred pounds if you still want to beat inflation the best suggestion i have is to look at peer to peer lending that comes with some risk but i think over the course of 1 year it 's quite limited for example zopa is currently offering 3.1 on their access product and are offering 2.9 on the everyday product both of these are advertised as instant access albeit with some caveats these are n't fscs guaranteed bank deposits and they do come with some risk firstly although both and zopa have a significant level of provision against bad debt it 's always possible that this wo n't be enough and you 'll lose some of your money i think this is quite unlikely over a one year time horizon as there 's no sign of trouble yet secondly there 's liquidity risk although the products are advertised as instant access they are actually backed by longer duration loans made to people who want to borrow money for you to be able to cash out someone else has to be there ready to take your place again this is very likely to be possible in practice but there 's no absolute guarantee

i do n't know really is the best investment strategy people think that they have to know everything to make money but realistically out of the hundreds of thousands of publicly traded securities you really can only invest in a tiny number of them of the course of a week you literally have more than a million buy or do n't buy decisions because the prices of those securities fluctuate every day   simply due to the fact that there are so many securities you can not know what everything is going to do you have to say i do n't know also when you do understand something it is usually fairly priced so will you make money on it i do n't know only very rarely will you find something that you actually understand well and it is significantly undervalued you can be looking at a company a day for two years before you find it but people get trigger happy they bet on odds when they should only bet on odds or higher   if you are forced to bet on everything it makes sense that you bet on everything you believe is greater than 50 chance of winning but since you can not bet on everything you should only bet on the highest quality bets those with greater than 90 chance of winning to find such a bet you may have to shuffle through 100 different companies and only make 2 3 bets you are looking for something that is at least 2 standard deviations away from the mean   people are not good at doing a lot of work most of which yields nothing to find one big payoff they are wired to only look at the present so they take the best bet they can see at the moment which is often barely above 50 and with any it may actually be well below 50 and people are not good at understanding compound geometric growth you can keep 10 gains 1.10 1.10 1.10 but that can all be wiped out by multiplying by one zero which is why taking a bet is so dangerous even though technically it is an advantageous one they forget to adjust for the geometric aspect of compounding a bet is one you should take but if you are allowed to repeat it and you keep going all in you will eventually lose and have $ 0 which is the same as if you took a single all in bet that has 0 chance of winning   as buffett says if you are only allowed to make 20 investments over a lifetime you will most likely do better because it prevents you from making many of these mistakes

the issue here is that the transaction your funds to her account looks very similar to the rent payments which you plan to make in the future those rental payments if deemed to be commercial would normally be subject to tax consider the scenario where rather than an up front $ 5000 and $ 5000 over 2 years you paid her $ 10000 and paid no rent that might be an attempt to avoid paying tax a commercial transaction ca n't be re labeled as a gift just based on your election the transaction needs to be considered as a whole however an interest free unsecured loan connected with you paying rent at market rate would be depending on local laws simply foolish to some extent i do n't think you are able to structure the transaction as a joint purchase since the mortgage will prevent her from allocating a part of the property to you its also likely that you can live in her house and contribute an adequate amount to the household costs without creating a taxable income for her for example in the uk up to pa rental income generated from the property in which you reside does not need to be declared you need to identify the scenarios where your particular arrangement could be imagined as resulting in a taxable or potentially taxable event then make sure you are not avoiding those events just by choosing how you label the events

as you are not a tax resident in india the income you have earned can be moved to india tax free however if you are investing the funds into say shares fixed deposits etc the income you earn on these funds is taxable in india the funds can be transferred directly into savings account however its to open an nre nro account as its easier to track funds for tax purposes i.e. these accounts by nature certify that the funds received into them are from foreign sources and can easily be explained to the tax authorities however establishing the origin of funds in ordinary savings accounts needs more paper work whenever there is a scrutiny by tax authorities on this savings account it would need more efforts to establish that the credits are from foreign earnings

the sears ceo eddie lampert is an ayn rand fanatic   this is what happens when you take ayn rand newshour amp making sense column this is what happens when you take ayn rand seriously   in 2008 sears ceo eddie lampert decided to restructure the company according to rand 's principles   lampert broke the company into more than 30 individual units each with its own management and each measured separately for profit and loss the idea was to promote competition among the units which lampert assumed would lead to higher profits instead this is what happened as described by a reporter for bloomberg business   an advocate of free market economics and fan of the ayn rand he created the model because he expected the invisible hand of the market to drive better results if the company 's leaders were told to act selfishly he argued they would run their divisions in a rational manner boosting overall performance   instead the divisions turned against each other and sears and kmart the overarching brands suffered interviews with more than 40 former executives many of whom sat at the highest levels of the company paint a picture of a business that 's by infighting as its divisions battle over fewer resources   a close up of the debacle was described by stuart in a salon article from 2013   it got crazy executives started undermining other units because they knew their bonuses were tied to individual unit performance they began to focus solely on the economic performance of their unit at the expense of the overall sears brand one unit kenmore started selling the products of other companies and placed them more prominently than sears own products units competed for ad space in sears units were no longer incentivized to make sacrifices like offering discounts to get shoppers into the store   sears became a miserable place to work rife with infighting and screaming matches employees focused solely on making money in their own unit ceased to have any loyalty to the company or stake in its survival   we all know the end of the story sears share prices fell and the company appears to be headed toward bankruptcy the moral of the story in 's words   what lampert failed to see is that humans actually have a natural inclination to work for the mutual benefit of an organization they like to cooperate and collaborate and they often work more productively when they have shared goals take all of that away and you create a company that will destroy itself

over a decade of rigorous testing because it does n't support your narrative   faulty testing how fucking hard is it for you to get that point through your thick head the testing is irrelevant because it 's possible to get past it it was not rigorous at all because again it could n't test for everything the drug armstrong used being one of them   it is possible to beat the test   it is possible to beat the test   it is possible to beat the test   it is possible to beat the test   it is possible to beat the test   it is possible to beat the test   it is possible to beat the test   it is possible to beat the test       do you finally understand why saying he passed all the tests is useless if he did have positive tests then that would be evidence of guilt saying there is no positive test is not evidence of innocence just absence of the evidence of guilt it would be evidence of innocence if it was absolutely impossible for him to beat the test but he can beat the test   get that through your thick fucking head   it is possible to beat the test   it is possible to beat the test   it is possible to beat the test   it is possible to beat the test   it is possible to beat the test   it is possible to beat the test   it is possible to beat the test   it is possible to beat the test   it is possible to beat the test   it is possible to beat the test   it is possible to beat the test   it is possible to beat the test   it is possible to beat the test   it is possible to beat the test   it is possible to beat the test   it is possible to beat the test   it is possible to beat the test   it is possible to beat the test   it is possible to beat the test   it is possible to beat the test   it is possible to beat the test   it is just fucking mind retarded of you to continually push the fact that he passed the tests as fact he is n't doping when i have repeatedly told you that the was able to beat the test and it has been outlined how he did it so yes you are like a in the sense that you ignore the evidence said evidence being information on how it is possible for someone to beat the test and yet you still say he passed the test   saying he passed the tests which could n't check for the drug he was on and therefore he is innocent is like saying we used a shitty camera to check for gun shot residue on the murder suspect the shitty camera could n't detect any residue therefore he has no residue on him and therefore he is n't the murder suspect   fucking idiot   i really do think you 're a troll at this point because the fact that he was able to beat the tests is the basic core of the argument against your claims of his tests are all clean and you still do n't seem to understand that

you might be confusing two different things an advantage of investing over a long term is the compounding of returns   those returns can be interest dividends or capital gains   the mix between them depends on what you invest it and how you invest in it   this advantage applies whether your investment is in a taxable brokerage account or in a tax advantaged 401 k or ira   so start investing early so that you have longer for this compounding of returns to happen the second thing is the tax deferral you get from 401(k or iras   if you invest in a ordinary taxable account then you have to pay taxes on your interest and dividends for the year in which they occur   you also have to pay taxes on any capital gains which you realize during the year   these yearly tax payments are then money that you do n't get the benefit of compounding on   with 401(k and iras you do n't have to pay taxes during these intermediate years

your post has some assumptions that are not or may not be true for one the assumption is that you have to wait 7 years after you settle your debts to buy a home   that is not the case   for some people me included settling an charged off debt was part of my mortgage application process   it was a small debt that a doctor 's office claimed i owed but i did n't   the mortgage company told me settling the debt was the cost of doing business   settling your debts can be looked as favorable option 1 in my opinion is akin to stealing   you borrowed the money and you are seeking to game the system by not paying your debts   would you want someone to do that to you   iirc the debt can be sold to another company and the time period is refreshed and can stay on your credit report for beyond the 7 years   i could be wrong but i feel like there is a way for potential lenders to see accounts well beyond specified time periods   after all the lenders are the credit reporting agencies customers and they seek to provide the most accurate view of a potential lender   with 20 k of cc debt they should point that out to their customers option 2   do you have 20 k   i 'd still seek to settle you do not have to wait 7 years    your home may not appreciate in 2 years   in my own case my home has very little in the 11 years that i have owned it   many people have learned the hard way that homes do not necessarily increase in value    it is very possible that you may have a net loss in equity in two years   repairs or improvements can evaporate the small amount of equity that is achieved over two years with a 30 year mortgage    i would hope that you pause a bit at the fact that you defaulted on 20 k in debt   that is a lot of money   although it is a lot it is a small amount in comparison to the cost and maintenance of a home   are you prepared to handle such a responsibility   what has changed in your personality since the 20 k default   the tone of your posts suggests you are headed for the same sort of calamity this is far more than a numbers game it is behavioral

the scenario you mention regarding capital gains is pretty much the core of the issue here 's a run down from that explains it a bit it 's important to focus on it being the tax rate not the tax amount which i think you get but i want to reinforce that for other readers   basically most of buffett 's income comes from capital gains and    dividends income from investments he makes with the money he already    has income earned by buying and selling stocks or from stock    dividends is generally taxed at 15 percent the rate for long term    capital gains and qualified dividends buffett also mentioned that some of the mega rich are hedge fund    managers who earn billions from our daily labors but are allowed to    classify our income as carried interest thereby getting a bargain    15 percent tax rate we do n't know the taxes paid by buffett 's secretary who was mentioned    by obama but not by buffett buffet 's secretary would have to make a    high salary or else typical deductions such as the child tax credit    would offset taxes owed let 's say the secretary is a particularly    well compensated executive assistant making adjusted income more than    $ in income yes that sounds like a lot to us too but    remember we 're talking about the secretary to one of the richest    people in the world in that case marginal tax rates of 28 percent    would apply then there would be payroll taxes of 6.25 percent on the    first $ money that goes to social security and another 1.45    percent on all income which goes to medicare the secretary ’s overall    tax rate would be lower than 28 percent since not all the income    would be taxed at that rate only the income above $ buffett meanwhile would pay very little if anything in payroll    taxes in the new york times op ed buffett said he paid percent    in taxes thinking of the secretary it gets a little complicated    given how the tax brackets work but basically people who make    between $ 100,000 and $ 200,000 are paying around 20 percent in federal    taxes including payroll and income taxes according to an analysis    from the nonpartisan tax policy center so in this case the secretary 's rate is higher because so much of    buffett 's income comes from investments and is taxed at the lower    capital gains rate here 's buffet 's original op ed in the nyt for those of you that are n't familiar

much of the interest on a loan comes in the first years of a mortgage so the sooner you can pay that off the better   but let 's see what the numbers say if you have a loan at 4 principal of $ 100,000 a term of 30 years then this gives monthly payments of $ using the excel pmt function if you sell the house after precisely 5 years worth of payments then you have made $ in payments you still owe $ suppose you sell the house for $ 100,000   that means you will be in the hole for $ 100,000 $ $ = now suppose you pay an extra $ 50 per month over the five years   the same calculation becomes $ 100,000 $ $ = so in this scenario which is a little simplistic you are $ better off the question you have to ask is whether you could have done better investing the $ 3,000 in extra payments somewhere else the cagr in doing this is 1.7 so you might be better off putting the money away running the same numbers for a 6 mortgage the cagr you have is about 2.7 edit i 've added a google docs spreadsheet read only that you can download and play with   feel free to correct anything you find edit 2   ok so i 've had a look at what joetaxpayer is saying in the comments below and now i agree   the cagr should be 4 where i want wrong was to assume that the $ 50 per month payments over the five years are worth $ 50 5 12 = $ 3000    this neglects the time value of money having small amounts of money periodically rather than all of it in a lump sum including this makes the effective value of the monthly $ 50 payments $ written as = in excel or google docs i 've added a tab to the original spreadsheet to show the different calculations   note that it still does n't quite come to 4 but i guess it 's a minor error in the sheet nb i know i 'm leaving out mortgage interest tax relief costs for selling etc etc

here is a good example of why our bankruptcy laws need some   gt;this horror story begins with the chapter 11 bankruptcy filing made by corp. the holding company that owns american airlines last november bankruptcy speaking is about restructuring debts owed to banks and bondholders but most of american ’s debt was backed by hard assets like airplanes what ’s more actually had some cash on hand at the time of the filing the debts american really wanted to restructure were the implicit debts to employees as s&amp;p analyst philip put it at the time the goal was to reorganize in chapter 11 and emerge as a somewhat smaller airline with more competitive labor costs and a lighter debt load in other words american went into bankruptcy primarily so it could pay people less

a lot of there e.g. comfortable selection bias etc but regardless this is a bit of a strawman i 'm not at all arguing that success is n't correlated with effort it 's a question of the degree of correlation and the amount of attribution i 'm in a engineering startup myself and i would hardly be motivated in any commercial endeavor if i believed there was n't a correlation between effort and outcome   i would actually grant you that engineering is probably one of the better examples of meritocracy out there today but there 's a lot of caveats to that and many engineers i know in large corporate environments are an underclass to much less technical much less hard working superiors    and from personal experience high level academia breaks down rapidly beyond the undergraduate level

this is just a guess but i would imagine that it has to do with risk the deposits in banks are usually as safe as government bonds broad oversimplification as the us government is considered the most trustworthy even in unlikely event of being close to default it would be rescued by fed so it can just print the money so the banks at the same time have very low competition regarding government bonds and the investments they can do have relatively low roi so they can not offer much more competitive rates on the other hand ukrainian bonds have current rating i.e. the goverment is judged to be likely to default as you pointed out there is war going on and in result the government bonds are considered highly speculative therefore to attract foreign investors they need to have high interest rating similarly the cds at the banks can be considered at the risk of being lost so to prevent flight of capital overseas or people keeping usd in cash form at home they need to offer rates that reflect the risk

i 'm sorry   but no   it is not   some simple theories can be predictive in the current   but macroeconomic theories are almost never predictive and always more reminiscent of a religion   science must be predictive by definition   but predictions about complex systems are notoriously   this is why your ca n't predict more than a few days out     it 's because it 's impossible   the system is too complex   it is sensitive to initial conditions which are unknown and unknowable   and the inputs are too numerous and varied to account for everything   but they can be accurate to within a given confidence interval even if it does not achieve formal statistical significance   and they can run something akin to what economists would call monte carlo simulations given their models   but so far as macroeconomics go there is no admission by many practitioners in many schools about the predictive limitations on the whole endeavor based on the complex nature of the system   there are simply constructed theoretical frameworks which are not predictive but which seem to have fit certain patterns in the past that are cherry picked to confirm a hypothesis   if that is science it is bad science   this does not mean one can not have an untested hypothesis   economists generally can not set up their own experiments after all   and they deal in complexity and human decision just like the other social scientists   but economists perhaps more so than other social scientists due to the increased mathematical skill set in the standard tool box of the field tend to overstate their case   this is particularly true for those larger named economists in the field who inevitably get hired by major media companies   if friedman and were both scientists how did they come to such widely different conclusions     how does the university of chicago predict and prescribe the polar opposite of u. mo st. louis    basing any theory on splitting one half of 's theory of rationality from the other and assigning the behavioral patterns to actors already makes several cognitive leaps   and yes in the last few years we have had the school of behavioral economics and bounded rationality models to try to cope with this   but it 's still far from predictive   the austrians are certainly on some of the ground in my view   at least keynes work was rigorous   so was marx 's for that matter   that stands in stark contrasts to the austrians and their ilk   but regardless when dealing with essentially contested concepts consensus through induction becomes the only path forward   empirical deduction falls off the menu   the schools of biology and chemistry at u mo and u will not come to opposite conclusions given identical data   the schools of economics do   that in and of itself is anecdotal evidence of a severe flaw in the science in a very sense   and so i stand by my statement

no suppose you have 100 canadian dollars and the exchange rate is 2 cad = 1 usd   you use your 100 cad to purchase 50 usd in your bank account that is in usd   some time later the canadian dollar grows stronger so that now 1 cad = 1 usd   if you now withdraw your 50 usd and get canadian dollars you will receive 50 cad   you have lost half your money if you want to make money on currency exchange rates which is a risky plan you should buy the currency that is cheap i.e. weak   if say oil is very cheap you do n't make money by selling oil you buy it and sell it later when the price goes up   likewise if the canadian dollar is n't worth much and the us dollar is you should buy canadian dollars not us dollars hoping to sell them later when the exchange rate is more favorable   see also this similar question

the big question is whether you will be flexible about when you 'll get that house the overall best investment in terms of yielding a good risk return ratio and requiring little effort is a broad index fund mutual or etf especially if you 're contributing continuously and thereby take advantage of cost averaging but the downside is that you have some volatility during an economic downturn your investment may be worth only half of what it 's worth when the economy is booming and of course it 's very bad to have that happening just when you want to get your house then again chances are that house prices will also go down in such times if you want to avoid ever having to see the value of your investment go down then you 're pretty much stuck with things like your high interest savings account which sounds like a very good fit for your requirements

you should always invest if your investment rate of return is higher    than your interest rate your next line about standard deviation is dead on   there are too many variables to give an exact answer here in my opinion the main reason is that one variable is n't easy to quantify one 's risk tolerance   clearly there 's one extreme the 18 credit card unless you are funding type rates of it 's safe to say that 18 debt should take priority over any investments except for the matched 401(k deposits   what i think you 're talking about is something we 've addressed here in multiple threads   do i prepay my sub 4 mortgage or invest in this case and to noah 's comment the question is whether you can expect a post tax return of over 3 during your time horizon i look at the return for 15 years from 1998 2013 and see a 6 cagr for the s&p. i chose 15 years as the choice is often one of paying a 30 year mortgage faster as fast as 15 the last 15 years offer a pretty bad scenario 2 crashes and a mortgage crisis 6 after long term gains would get you 5.1 net   you can pull the data back to 1871 and run cagr numbers for the timeframe of your choosing i have n't done it yet but i imagine there 's no 15 year span that lags the 3 target i cite   what makes it more complex is that the investment is n't lump sum it may not be obvious but cagr is a dollar invested at t=0 and returns calculated to t = final year it would take a bit of to invest the extra funds every month year over your period of analysis   in the end there are still those who will choose to pay off their 4 mortgage regardless of what the numbers show even if the 15 year result showed worst case 3.5 almost no profit and an average 10 the feeling of risk is more than many will want

the big reason why this is hard to wrap your head around via analogy is because we think of money as printed paper cash now that stuff is money but it 's not the only kind of money in fact it 's not even close to the majority of money in the system    when you charge dinner to a credit card your credit card company sends an electronic promise to the restaurant which based on your promise to re pay the credit card company which is in turn based on your employer 's promise to pay you for wages that you earned this past week and so on similarly the restaurant pays their landlord and employees and suppliers with checks and electronic funds funds transfers which are promises that the restaurant 's bank will pay the check holder 's bank and so on    it 's not like there are running around with bags of cash or gold behind the scenes these promises are money that is actually being spent and re spent usually without ever getting reconciled as actual cash withdrawals of printed currency it 's promises all the way down you can pay off a mortgage without ever once handing anyone a single printed it 's just checks and bank transfers from your employers investments passed along to the creditor and that 's real money even if it never gets printed    this can be pretty cleanly described mathematically that 's the kind of stuff where econ is pretty genuinely a science as opposed to the market prediction and public policy stuff but it is very hard to make sense of via analogy    that 's why i used a fictional world where money does n't exist if you set aside your do n't try to second guess or think ahead to the conclusions but just read through the story as it is written you will see that there is no meaningful difference at all between the apple certificates the merchant cartel printed loddars and a personal iou handwritten from one person to another except for the credibility of the issuer    seriously do n't argue do n't yeah but do n't try to tie this to your paycheck do n't try to think about how this relates to the mortgage collapse just read through the story as it is written because i ca n't prove to you except through pretty hairy mathematical models that money is debt by explaining it in it runs counter to all of your experiences as a participant in the model in countless ways but it    until you internalize that fact and wrap your head around the fact that money is just ious it will never make sense that money can be just gone if you sell me a watermelon and i get hit by a bus carrying it home the watermelon is gone yeah but i still have the money you say    but suppose that instead of cash i had written a promise to come paint your house this weekend sure you say but that 's not the same as money but it is in very literal ways    i 'm never going to convince you that my promise to paint your house is the same fundamental stuff as us dollars differentiated only by the credibility of the issuer you 're just not going to believe me and we 'll get nowhere arguing analogies    so instead just read through the story above without prejudice and follow the history of that little make pretend world because you 'll never make sense of where the money went until you can internalize the concept of money as promises that can be broken

in essence the problem that the op identified is not that the fx market itself has poor liquidity but that retail fx brokerage sometimes have poor counterparty risk management the problem is the actual business model that many fx brokerages have most fx brokerages are themselves customers of much larger money center banks that are very well capitalized and provide ample liquidity by liquidity i mean   the ability to put on a position of relatively decent size long eurusd say at any particular time with a small price impact relative to where it is trading for spot fx intraday bid ask spreads are extremely small on the order of fractions of pips for majors eur usd gbp jpy chf even in extremely volatile situations it rarely becomes much larger than a few pips for positions of 1 to 10 million usd equivalent notional value in the institutional market given that retail traders rarely trade that large a position the fx spot market is essentially very liquid in that respect the problem is that there are retail brokerages whose business model is to encourage excessive trading in the hopes of capturing that spread but not guaranteeing that it has enough capital to always meet all client obligations what does get retail traders in trouble is that most are unaware that they are not actually trading on an exchange like with stocks every bid and ask they see on the screen the moment they execute a trade is done against that fx brokerage and not some other trader in a transparent central limit order book this has some deep implications one is the nifty attribute that you rarely pay commission to do fx trades unlike in stock trading why because they build that cost into the quotes they give you in markets buyers and sellers cancel out they just capture that spread which is the desired outcome when that business model functions well   there are two situations where the brokerage 's might lose money and capital becomes very important in extremely volatile markets every one of their clients may want to sell for some reason this forces the fx brokers to accumulate a large position in the opposite side that they have to offload they will trade in the institutional market with other brokerages to net out their positions so that they are as close to flat as possible in the process since bid ask spreads in the institutional market is tighter than within their own brokerage by design they should still make money while not taking much risk however if they are not fast enough or if they do not have enough capital the brokerage 's position might move against them too quickly which may cause them lose all their capital and go belly up the brokerage is net flat but there are huge offsetting positions amongst its clients in the example of the swiss franc revaluation in early 2015 a sudden pop of 10 20 would have effectively meant that money in client accounts that were on the wrong side of the trade could not cover those on the other side when this happens it is theoretically the brokerage 's job to close out these positions before it wipes out the value of the client accounts however it would have been impossible to do so since there were no prices in between the instantaneous pop in which the brokerage could have terminated their client 's losing positions and offload the risk in the institutional market since it 's extremely hard to ask for more money than exist in the client accounts those with strong capital positions simply ate the loss such as oanda those that fared worse went belly up the irony here is that the more leverage the brokerage gave to their clients the less money would have been available to cover losses in such an event using an example to illustrate say client a is long 1 contract at $ 100 and client b is short 1 contract at $ 100 the brokerage is thus net flat if the brokerage had given 10:1 leverage then there would be $ 10 in each client 's account now instantaneously market moves down $ 10 client a loses $ 10 and client b is up $ 10 brokerage simply closes client a 's position gives $ 10 to client b. the brokerage is still long against client b however so now it has to go into the institutional market to be short 1 contract at $ 90 the brokerage again is net flat and no money actually goes in or out of the firm had the brokerage given 50:1 leverage however client a only has $ 2 in the account this would cause the brokerage close client a 's position the brokerage is still long against client b but has only $ 2 and would have to eat the loss for $ 8 to honor client b 's position and if it could not do that then it technically became insolvent since it owes more money to its clients than it has in assets this is exactly the reason there have been regulations in the us to limit the amount of leverage fx brokerages are allowed to offer to clients to assure the brokerage has enough capital to pay what is owed to clients

making extra principal payments will reduce the term of your loan i would n't sign up for a biweekly schedule just do it yourself so you have more flexibility a simple spreadsheet will allow you to play what if and make it clear that extra principal payments are most effective early in the term of the loan my wife and i paid off our home in less than 10 years with this approach some will say that the opportunity costs of not using that money for something else outweighs the gains i would say that not having a mortgage has a positive impact on your cash flow and your assets you own the home which combine to create more opportunity not less that being said it should be obvious that paying off higher interest debt first is the priority paying off a zero percent interest car loan early is just foolish

a mutual fund could make two different kinds of distributions to you capital gains when the fund liquidates positions that it holds it may realize a gain if it sells the assets for a greater price than the fund purchased them for as an example for an index fund assets may get liquidated if the underlying index changes in composition thus requiring the manager to sell some stocks and purchase others mutual funds are required to distribute most of their income that they generate in this way back to its shareholders many often do this near the end of the calendar year   when you receive the distribution the gains will be categorized as either short term the asset was held for less than one year or long term vice versa based upon the holding period the gain is taxed differently currently in the united states long term capital gains are only taxed at 15 regardless of your income tax bracket you only pay the capital gains tax not the income tax short term capital gains are treated as ordinary income so you will pay your probably higher tax rate on any cash that you are given by your mutual fund you may also be subject to capital gains taxes when you decide to sell your holdings in the fund any profit that you made based on the difference between your purchase and sale price is treated as a capital gain based upon the period of time that you held the mutual fund shares it is categorized as a short- or long term gain and is taxed accordingly in the tax year that you sell the shares dividends many companies pay dividends to their stockholders as a way of returning a portion of their profits to their collective owners when you invest in a mutual fund that owns dividend paying stocks the fund is the owner that receives the dividend payments as with capital gains mutual funds will redistribute these dividends to you periodically often quarterly or annually the main difference with dividends is that they are always taxed as ordinary income no matter how long you or the fund have held the asset i 'm not aware of texas state tax laws so i ca n't comment on your other question

the answer probably varies with local law and you have n't said where you 're located in most or all us states it appears that after some statutory length of time the bank would transfer the money to the state government where it would be held indefinitely as unclaimed property in the name of the recipient technically the payee the person to whom the check is made payable   this process is called escheatment   most states publish a list of all unclaimed property so at some later date the payee could find their name on this list and realize they were entitled to the funds   there would then be a process by which the payee could claim the funds from the state    usually the state keeps any interest earned on the money as far as i know there typically would n't be any way for you the person who originated the payment to collect the money after escheatment   before escheatment if you have the uncashed check in your possession you can usually return it to the bank and have it refunded to you i had trouble finding an authoritative source explaining this but a number of informal sources found by googling cashier check escheatment seem to agree that this is generally how it works   here is the web site for a law firm saying that in california an uncashed cashier 's check to the state after 3 years until escheatment occurs the recipient can cash the check at any time   i do n't think that cashier 's checks become stale like personal checks do and there is n't any situation in which the funds would automatically revert to you

a $ 1 note and four quarters are both real money but how and when they become real money is different the important thing is that the fed 's stockpile of cash that it gets from the bureau of engraving and printing is n't real money i.e. yet that cash is only used for fulfilling withdrawals from reserve accounts you ca n't use it to buy a car or a house or to pay janet yellen 's salary no one not even janet can use even a single dollar to buy a diet coke in other words it 's not really an asset or a liability or anything but a stack of paper in the fed 's vaults that looks astonishingly like money but is n't the upside to this is that when the makes a delivery of fresh bills to the fed or when the fed destroys old bills that are n't usable anymore the fed 's balance sheet does n't change that 's good those are practical considerations not financial ones the downside is that there 's nothing on the asset side of the sheet to explain how the fed 's liability to a bank is reduced when the bank makes a cash withdrawal from its reserve account so the fed balances it 's balance sheet by recording an increase in a different liability the cash in circulation kinda like transferring the balance on a credit card you 're paying down one liability by increasing another one it looks a bit silly but less silly than recording the destruction of old bills as an expense of the face value of the bills coins on the other hand become money as soon as the treasury gets them from the mint if they wanted to they could pay their employees salaries by ordering coins from the mint for cheap giving them to their employees at face value and reaping fat profits as a result in fact that 's pretty much exactly what they do when someone wants quarters the treasury mints them at less than face value and then sells them at face value in practice the fed does all of this buying and then distributes the coins according to demand the important thing is that this bunch of coins is not like the fed 's stockpile of bills it 's already real money and therefore shows up as an asset not much if the fed bought coins at the cheaper price from the mint instead them like they stockpile bills then distributed them as usual the extra profit just goes to the treasury anyway like all the fed 's profit does however as things are the fed 's purchases of coins are recorded on the fed 's balance sheet at face value which is kinda silly

he did n't lock in a growth rate of 4 he locked in a yield of 4 that 's the amount the bond pays in interest on his original investment each year if he just spends that money the bond will continue to pay 4 each year but there 's no growth in order to get growth he has to reinvest the interest as it comes in if he puts it into bonds the return on that new money and hence the growth depends on the prevailing interest rate at the time that the interest is paid that interest rate can be higher or lower than the original 4 there 's no connection between the two

the fund is an energy fund so this is a function of recent price changes in oil and gas coal c    for example lets say last year when oil was $ 100 per barrel a bunch of companies saw a good return and put $ 100 million into a bunch of leases pumps c to return $ 10 million per year and the market says yeah they 're all together worth now oil is less maybe $ 40 per the link   these exploration companies do n't have a lot of labor or variable costs they are operationally profitable may have use it or lose it leases or minimum pumping requirements for contract or engineering reasons   lets say the cash flow is 7 m so the market values them at   they still have about 100 m book value so here we are at and i believe the scenario in the question   nobody would invest in new capacity at this oil price   the well equipment could be but not the or lease so the best use is to continue pumping and value it on cash flow   if an individual well runs negative long enough and goes bust either a different will pay the minimum price that gives profitable cash flow or that that cost millions to dig is shut off and rendered valueless   the cnbc article says some explorers are playing games with debt to maintain yield so there is that too in the etf your bet is that the market is wrong and oil will go up increasing future cash flows or you like the current yield taking on the risk that some of these oil explorers could go bust

closing your oldest revolving account will lower your average age of accounts and hurt your score   no ifs or   the amount it drops is hard to tell and it may only be a few points if your other cards are fairly old as well while the fico scoring algorithm is proprietary and hard to predict you can use the official fico simulator to estimate the impact   based on the information you provided 5 + cards oldest card 5 years your estimate is 750 800   performing the same estimate and only changing the number of cards and age 2 4 cards oldest card 2 4 years the score estimate drops to   both of these estimates assume you have 9 or less utilization   you can probably estimate that your score will drop at least 15 points however it may not matter to you whether your score is maximized   once you get above a certain fico score it does n't matter   for example i recently refinanced a vehicle and asked the loan officer about their lowest apr and found out that they required a 780 fico for it   kind of like the difference between getting a 91 or a 99 in a class an a is an a. some other factors you may want to consider before you make your choice

well primarily because that 's fraud and fraud prevents a debtor from receiving a discharge in bankruptcy court   fraud would be pretty easy to prove if you did n't have an income change and you have several lines of credit opened on and around the same day with almost no payments made toward them   additionally thanks to the reforms of the bankruptcy code if your income exceeds the median income of your state you 'll be forced in to a chapter 13 and committed to a repayment plan that allocates all of your disposable income to your creditors now if whoever posted that will attempt to simply not pay then negotiate repayment plans with their creditors the process will last far longer than 7 years   it takes a long time to be in default for enough time that a consumer creditor will negotiate the debt and this is assuming the creditor does n't sue you and get a judgement which could apply liens to any property you may own   the will likely cause you to pursue bankruptcy anyway only now you 're at least a few years beyond the point at which you ruined your credit

it is a good enough approximation with a single event you can do it your way and get a better result but imagine that the $ 300 are spread over a certain period with $ 10 contribution each time then and compounding will be a lot of work to do the original roi formula is averaging the roi by definition so why bother with precise calculations of averages that are by definition when you can just adjust the average without losing the level of precision and are n't significantly different its immaterial

first of all in the u.s. no federal gift tax has to be paid by the recipient of   the gift it is the donor who has to pay gift tax if any is due nor does the recipient have to pay federal income tax on the gift it is not considered taxable income   i do not believe that any states view matters differently for the purposes of state gift and income taxes but i am always ready to be of any such held notions if your parents were required to pay any gift tax that would have been at the   time the gift was originally given and only if they gifted more than the maximum allowable exemption per person for that year currently the exemption is $ 14 k from each donor per recipient per year additional gifts were made by your parents to you during your minority when your parents paid any income tax   due on the distributions in your account but these amounts would unlikely to have been larger than the exemption for that year in any case gift tax is   none of your concern if you have been declaring the income from distributions from the mutual funds all these years then the only tax due on the distributions from the funds in 2013 is the federal income tax for the 2013 tax year plus a special assessment of medicare tax on investment income if your income is large unlikely based on your question and follow up comment   if you sold all or part of your shares in the funds in 2013 then you would need to calculate the basis of your investments in the fund in order to figure out if you have capital gains or losses   ditto if you are thinking of cashing out in 2014 and wish to estimate how much income tax is due but if you want to just hang on to the funds then there is no immediate need to figure out the basis right away though taking care of the matter and keeping in top of things for the future will be helpful as a final note there is no tax due on the appreciation of the fund 's shares the increased value of your account because the fund 's share price rose is not a taxable event nor are decreases in the account deductible these are called unrealized capital gains or losses and you do not pay tax on them or deduct them as losses until you realize the gains by   disposing of the property

re   in retirement i do n't see how we can    be in a higher tax bracket than we are    now maybe than we will be if one of    us stops working we buy a house we    have a couple of kids etc that 's assuming tax rates remain the same   what if tax rates go up   consider the u.s. deficit and the debt and unfunded entitlement programs even though you may be in a lower bracket in retirement bracket as in ordered income ranges there 's still a possibility that at that later point in time tax rates in general could be higher than today   so even though you may find yourself in a lower bracket in retirement who is to say the tax rate for that bracket wo n't exceed what you pay today in the higher bracket do n't think switch   rather i 'd consider diversifying retirement savings across both pre tax and roth i.e. make contributions to each type of account so you 're not gambling 100 on which bracket you 'll be in what tax rates will be like in the future etc then you 'll at least have some money in a roth account that in retirement you can do with as you please without having a tax consequence assuming the u.s. government does n't get so desperate as to change the tax free nature of roth account withdrawals

or here 's a better idea do n't have a credit card at all   they offer no real benefits and plenty of dangers   do n't take my word for it though i tell every student class i get high school students university    students you know they 'd be better off if they never used credit    cards    warren buffet net worth $ 44 billion before anyone says anything about using credit cards wisely and getting the rewards points i can save 15 on many kinds of large purchases $ 100 + using cash   you wo n't find a reward system offering that level of incentive   two recent examples of cash discounts after i bought my house i needed a and a my wife wanted a new vacuum cleaner   went to lowe 's and found the ones we wanted   they were $ 600 combined   found the manager stuck five $ 100 bills in his hand and said this is what i have and that is what i need   saved bought my a bed recently queen box spring and mattress were on sale for $ 300 but it did n't come with the rails which they wanted $ 50 extra for   went to the bank and got $ 320 in cash from the bank walked in set it in his hand and said i need the bed box spring and rails tax included   he replied sorry man i ca n't   i 'm already taking a loss on then he stopped mid sentence looked down at the cash again and said hold on let me ask my manager manager walks over guy explains what i said manager looks at the cash and says make it happen   saved as for purchasing a home it is a myth that you need a credit score to obtain a mortgage for a home   lending institutions can do manual underwriting instead of just relying on your credit score   it is a little tougher to do and banks usually have stricter requirements but based on the information the op has given in this and other questions i think he can easily meet them

yes you should take in the expenses being incurred by the mutual fund this   lists down the fees charged by the mutual fund and where expenses can be found in the annual statement of the fund to calculate fees and expenses as you might expect fees and expenses vary from fund to fund a fund with high costs must perform better than a low cost fund to generate the same returns for you even small differences in fees can translate into large differences in returns over time you do n't pay expenses so the money is taken from the assets of the fund so you pay it indirectly if the expenses are huge that may point to something i.e. fund managers are enjoying at your expense money is being used somewhere else rather than being paid as dividends if the expenses are used in the growth of the fund that is a positive sign else you can expect the fund to be downgraded or upgraded by the credit rating agencies depending on how the credit rating agencies see the expenses of the fund and other factors generally comparison should be done with funds invested in the same sectors same distribution of assets so that you have a homogeneous comparison to make else it would be unwise to compare between a fund invested in oil companies and other in computers yes the economy is inter but that is not how a comparison should be done

are you talking about a country besides the us   and you 're talking about a commercial bank right   in the us banks do n't buy gold from consumers   the last time they sort of did in the early 1900s they were trading gold coins for gold certificates and then they later stopped allowing consumers to trade them back   this is known by a well known financial term gotcha suckers if someone were naive enough to deposit a $ 50 gold american eagle today in a bank the depositor will get a credit of $ 50 on their account and later some clever person will ask the teller if they have any strange money lying around and that lucky person will be able to withdraw a $ coin for $ 50 if it lasted for even a second in the teller 's drawer but let 's say you 're going to a place that does indeed still buy gold coins the discount depends on the type of coin and the type of damage   an old collectible coin has a part of its value set by the gold value and part by the collector 's premium   better command better collector 's premiums so a damaged coin as long as it is n't a chunk of the coin missing wo n't be worth less than the melt value   you may not get that much from a dealer but it should be fairly close   if part of the coin is missing then the person buying it should weigh the coin and adjust the price proportionately   it 's likely though that if you have the items in a safe you may have a or of gold but it should still all be there unless someone takes it   gold at about 1850 degrees but it would take half the surface temperature of the sun for it to boil away   if it 's it may need to be again

you clearly have no understanding of the issue   as an example lets say apple sells an iphone in france    apple has to pay income tax and and whatever else on that money they receive for the iphone they sold that makes sense they use france 's infrastructure and citizens to sell the phones    then when the money comes back to the us the money is not coming back at this time apple is taxed on the same money from the iphone they just paid taxes on in france that makes selling iphones outside of the us difficult due to tax law and regulations that other companies do n't have to deal with this makes it easier for other phone manufacturers to sell phones at a profit and not apple this hurts apple at the end of the day and keeps the money in foreign countries when it could be re invested in the us   what is the point of selling internationally if you are going to have to pay two sets of taxes and likely lose money

there are two different issues at play here and they are completely separate from each other a bank or cashier 's check is safer than a regular personal or business check because it avoids problem 1 problem 2 exists with all kinds of paper checks i assume the reason the warnings are about cashier 's check moreso than personal checks is simply because people already know to wait for personal checks to clear before handing over merchandise to the buyer people are less likely to do that when receiving cashier 's checks but perhaps they still should if there is any doubt about the validity of the check one could argue that a cashier 's check actually provides a false sense of security due to this to the receiver on the flip side if you are the payer then a cashier 's check could be thought of as more secure than a personal check because you do n't have to reveal your bank account information to a stranger

as others have said please talk to a professional adviser from my quick research domain names can only be amortized as 197 intangible if it 's used for the taxpayer 's business for example if corp a pays $ 200,000 for and uses that to point to their homepage they can amortize it over 15 years as a 197 intangible please refer to this irs memo the above memo does not issue any guidance in your case where domains are purchased for investment or resale regarding domain names the u.s. master depreciation guide 2016 by says many domain names are purchased in a secondary market from third parties who register names and resell them at a profit these cost must be capitalized because the name will have a useful    life of more than one year the costs can not be amortized because a    domain name has no useful life so your decision to capitalize is correct but your amortization deductions may be challenged by the irs when you sell your domain the gain will be determined by how you treat these assets if you treat your domains as 197 intangibles and thus had ordinary deductions through amortization your gain will be ordinary if you treated them as capital assets your gain will be a capital gain very conceptually and because the irs has not issued specific guidelines i think holding domain names for resale is similar to buying stock of a company you ca n't amortize the investment and when you sell the gain or loss is a capital gain loss

there are benefits in the melting of the arctic but the risks are much greater   now that summer is here the arctic is crowded with life are in its seas fish birds and whales are on them millions of are in their northern breeding grounds and the area is with scientists performing a new arctic between now and early september when the polar pack ice to its summer minimum they will over the daily sea ice reports of america ’s national snow and ice data centre its satellite data will show that the ice has shrunk far below the long term average this is no anomaly since the 1970s the sea ice has by around 12 each decade last year the summer minimum was m square km m square half the average for the 1960s the arctic ’s including those of ’s vast ice cap are the land is the area covered by snow in june is roughly a fifth less than in the 1960s the is shrinking alien plants birds fish and animals are creeping north atlantic and cod are coming up in arctic nets some arctic species will probably die out perhaps not since the 19th century clearance of america ’s forests has the world seen such a spectacular environmental change it is a stunning illustration of global warming the cause of the melt it also contains grave warnings of its dangers the world would be mad to ignore them less feedback please as our special report shows in detail the arctic is warming roughly twice as fast as the rest of the planet since the 1950s the lower atmosphere has warmed by a global average of 0.7 degrees ’s air has warmed by 1.5 degrees the main reason appears to be a warming effect triggered by global warming when snow or ice melt they are replaced by melt water pools land or sea as a result the arctic surface more solar heat this causes local warming therefore more melting which causes more warming and so on this positive feedback shows how even a small change to the earth ’s systems can trigger much greater ones   some scientists also see a tipping point another feared term in the in the accelerating of the sea ice the term describes the moment at which the planet shifts from one environmental state to another in this case from an arctic with summer sea ice to one without it by the end of this century perhaps much sooner there will probably be frequent summers with no sea ice at all arctic peoples have also noticed what is going on hunters are finding the sea ice too thin to bear their arctic governments are starting to see a in the melt the arctic is stocked with minerals that were largely inaccessible including an estimated 30 of reserves of natural gas and 13 of oil reserves a combination of high commodity prices proactive governments technological progress and melting ice will help bring these to market encouraged by arctic governments and dwindling reserves elsewhere oil companies are flocking north like migrating to explore the continental shelves of alaska canada norway and russia canada and russia also hope to develop their arctic shipping lanes which the melt is making accessible russia ’s northern sea route hugging the coast cuts the normal distance between europe and asia by more than a third it will help russia ’s arctic resources to asian markets and could one day be a wider boost to world trade these exciting developments carry risks however many fear for arctic cultures a canadian argues for her right to be cold others foresee conflict between arctic countries scrambling for the region ’s resources greens warn of environmental risks in developing them a big oil spill would be disastrous for fragile arctic the have gone such fears are reasonable but often exaggerated traditional arctic peoples have been changed far more by than they will be by melting ice none lives in an these days and everywhere except russia their rights have been recognised nor is conflict much of a worry the arctic is no most of it is and arctic countries have a commercial incentive to keep the peace last year russia and norway settled an old dispute over their maritime border soon they will open the border region to oil firms   watch our animation of the arctic ice shelf and the shipping routes it could unlock   the risks of pollution from water mining and oil are real yet the arctic is not unprotected it is by and large among the most regulated oil provinces its development will also be slower and more cautious than greens fear even with little sea ice the arctic will remain cold remote and therefore expensive to operate in the worry that needs to be taken most seriously is climate change itself the impact of the melting arctic may have a effect on the planet it is likely to disrupt circulation the mixing of warm tropical and cold polar waters of which the gulf stream is a part and will lead to the emission of masses of carbon dioxide and methane and thus further warming it is also raising sea levels the ice sheet has recently shed around 200 of ice a year a increase on a decade ago if the warming continues it could eventually raising the sea level by seven many of the world ’s biggest cities would be inundated long before that happened some scientists argue that the perils are so immediate that mankind should consider the atmosphere to avert them see article they may turn out to be right but there could be enormous risks involved a slower but safer approach would be to price greenhouse gas emissions preferably through a carbon tax which would encourage the adoption of cleaner technologies see article that shift would be costly but the costs of inaction are likely to be larger in the end the world is likely to get a grip on global warming the survival instinct demands it but it is likely to lose a lot of the unique arctic first that would be a terrible pity

10-q is the quarterly report and accordingly is filed quarterly similarly 10-k is the annual report is a general form for notification of material events it is filed every time a material event is required to be reported to the shareholders it may accompany the periodical reports but does n't have to it can be filed on its own if you 're only interested in the financial statements then you should be looking for the forms sec will tell you when the forms were filed dates but it wo n't tell you what 's more material and what 's less so you can plot a stock price graph on these dates and see what was deemed more material by the investors based on the price fluctuations but be prepared to find fluctuations that have no correlation to filings because the market as a whole can drag the stock up or down also some events may not be required to be reported to sec but may be deemed material by the investors for example a cupertino town hall meeting discussing the zoning for the new aapl hq building may be deemed material by the investors based on the sentiments even if no decision was made to be reported to sec

if it turns out that you do want to help pay the tax bill after answering all the questions above i say cash out those funds you are apparently very young with a long work life ahead lucky you step aside from the actual money part of it for a moment what does your mom want what do you really want to do about this is it from love that you want to help but are afraid it 's a bad financial decision or is it from a feeling of duty and you deep down do n't really want to spend your savings on mom 's tax bill if you really do want to help and you have the to do so then do it otherwise do n't you can recover financially i myself have had my retirement savings go to nearly zero 3 times the first time i recovered pretty easily the second time not so easily i 'm just starting on the recovery path for the 3rd time at age 58 and i highly doubt i ever will recover this time i did n't cash out on purpose but the stock market was not friendly my main point is to figure out truly what you want

if you are looking to go long buy you would use bid prices as this is what you will be matched against for your order to be executed and a trade to go through if you are looking to go short sell you would use the ask prices as this is what you will be matched against for your order to be executed and a trade go through in your analysis you could use either this convention or the midpoint of the two prices as fx is very liquid the bid and ask prices would be quite close to each other so the easiest way to do your analysis is to use the convention i listed above

you and your husband are fronting all the money upfront i 'm guessing this will cost you around once closing costs and fees are included so obviously you would be hundred percent owners at the beginning you 'll then pay 31 of the mortgage and have your sister pay the remaining 69 this puts your total investment at the end at + + 31 of interest accrued and your sisters total investment at of interest accrued if you hold the full length of the mortgage your sister will have invested much more than you assuming 30 year fixed rate and 3.75 she 'd pay in interest as opposed to your she will have spent and y' all will have spent however if you sell early your percentage could be much higher   these calculations do n't take into account the opportunity cost of fronting all the cash it could be earning you more in the stock market or in a different investment property liability also could be an issue in the case of her not being able to pay the bank can still come after you for the whole amount lastly and most importantly this also does n't include the fact that she will be living there and y' all will not what kind of rent would she be paying to live in a similar home if it is more than 1400 you will basically be subsidizing her living as well as tying up funds and increasing your risk exposure if it is more than 1400 she should n't be any percent owner

you could use and other similar funds that exchange distributions for capital gains   there 's and which is canada and us equity markets   the swap fee + mer is a little more than some funds except for which is very cheap there 's a risk for long term holders that this may eventually get banned and you 're forced to sell with a gain at the wrong time but this wo n't matter much if you 're planning on selling in a few years   you have to pay the capital gains tax eventually   note the tax on distributions is really a long term drag on performance and wo n't make a big difference in the short term

when we speak about a product or service we generally refer to its value currency while neither a product or service has its own value as the value of currency goes down the price of products bought by that currency will go up you could consider the price of a product or service the value of the product multiplied by the value of the currency for your first example we compare two cars one bought in 1990 and one bought in 2015 each car has the same features ac radio abs etc we can say that when these products were new each had the same value however we can deduce that since the 1990 car cost $ 100 and the 2015 car cost $ 400 that there has been 75 inflation over 25 years comparing prices over time helps identify the inflation or devaluation of currency that an economy is experiencing in regards to your second question you can say that there was 7 inflation over five years total keep in mind that these are absolute cumulative values it does n't mean that there was a 7 increase year over year that would be 35 inflation over five years but simply that the absolute value of the dollar has changed 7 over those five years the sum of the percentages over those five years will be less than 7 because inflation is measured yearly but the total cumulative change is 7 from the original value to put that in perspective say that you have $ 100 in 2010 with an expected 7 inflation by 2015 which means that your $ 100 will be worth $ 93 in 2015 this means that the yearly inflation would be about 1.5 for five years resulting in a total of 7 inflation over five years note that you still have a hundred dollar bill in your pocket that you 've saved for five years but now that money can buy less product for example if you say that $ 100 buys 50 gallons of gasoline $ in 2010 you will only be able to afford gallons with that same bill in 2015 $ as you can see the 7 inflation caused a 7 increase in gasoline prices in other words if the value of the car remained the same its actual price would go up because the value stayed the same however it 's more likely that the car 's value will decrease significantly in those five years perhaps as much as 50 or more in some cases but its price would be higher than it would have been without inflation if the car 's value had dropped 50 so $ 50 in original year prices then it would have a higher price 50 value 1.07 currency ratio = $ note that even though its value has decreased by half its price has not decreased by 50 because it was up by inflation for your final question the purpose of a loan is so that the loaner will make a profit from the transaction consider your prior example where there was 7 inflation over five years that means that a loan for $ 100 in 2010 would only be worth $ 93 in 2015 interest is how loans combat this loss of value as well as to earn some profit so if the loaner expects 7 inflation over five years they 'll charge some higher interest say 8 10 or even more so that when you pay them back on time they 'll come out ahead or they might use more advanced schemes like adjustable rates etc so interest rates will naturally be lower when forecasted inflation is lower and higher when forecasted inflation is higher the best time to get a loan is when interest rates are if you get locked into a high interest loan and inflation stalls they will make more money off of you because the currency has more value while if inflation skyrockets your loan will be worth less to loaner however they 're usually really good about predicting inflation so it would take an incredible amount of inflation to actually come out on top of a loan

in addition to having separate income for federal and state tax purposes things can get really complicated if you ever have capital gains and losses suppose you sell taxable stocks for a loss of $ 5000 and meanwhile have capital gains of $ 1000 in your hsa from the federal perspective the gains in the hsa do n't exist so you deduct $ 3000 of the loss and then carry over the remaining $ 2000 however from the state perspective $ 1000 of the capital loss went to canceling out the gains in the hsa therefore you only carry over $ 1000 assuming you continue to have losses and gains this will carry on forever you 'll have to track completely independent sets of gains and losses and carryover losses for federal and state purposes forever even if you no longer use the hsa therefore i 'd recommend not investing hsa proceeds at all if you live in a state that does n't recognize hsas it 's just too complicated to be worth it especially since your provider wo n't track any of this for you

the biggest reason why one might want to leave 401k money invested in an ex employer 's plan is that the plan offers some superior investment opportunities that are not available elsewhere e.g. some mutual funds that are not open to individual investors such as s&p index funds for institutional investors these have expense ratios even smaller than the already low expense ratios of good s&p index funds or hot funds that are usually temporarily closed to new investors etc the biggest reason to roll over 401k money from an ex employer 's plan to the 401k plan of a new employer is essentially the same the new employer 's plan offers superior investment opportunities that are not available elsewhere of course the new employer 's   401k plan must accept such roll overs i do not believe that it is a requirement that a 401k plan must accept rollovers but rather an option that a plan can be set up to allow   for or not   another reason to roll over 401k money from one plan to another   rather than into an ira is to keep it safe from creditors if you are   sued and found liable for damages in a court proceeding the plaintiff can come after ira assets but not after 401k money   also you can take a loan from the 401k money subject to various rules about how much can be borrowed payment requirements etc which you can not from an ira that being said the benefits of keeping 401k money as 401k money must be weighed against the usually higher administrative costs and usually poorer and more limited choices of investment opportunities   available in most 401k plans as muro has said already

back when i was 25 and living near kansas city i would put 500 700 miles on my car almost every weekend traveling to other places like omaha st. louis iowa city occasionally minneapolis once to fargo and one longer trip all the way to virginia there 's a whole lot of nothing out there so road trips are quite naturally long they 're also quite attractive and i still would n't miss an opportunity to get up and drive somewhere for the weekend but i have spent less money on cars in my entire lifetime than you have on this single car i preferred then and still do to buy older cars for a few thousand dollars or even less and drive them until they die or can no longer pass inspection changing the oil is usually the most maintenance i 'll do since i 've spent so little on each car i do n't really care if it suffers some minor damage or even gets totaled in an accident which fortunately has never happened so i would only carry the mandatory liability insurance this is going to be much cheaper than the full coverage you will have on your car if something did happen i would just go buy another junker one such car i bought cost me a grand total of $ 150 excluding gas and gave me almost 10,000 miles until its transmission fell out another that i paid $ 100 for had difficulty getting over 60 miles an hour but it did those trips almost every weekend for two years before the engine threw a rod this might not be something you want to do perhaps you do n't want to be seen driving what one of my called a mobile because people will you but consider that billionaire sam walton of wal mart could afford any vehicle he wanted but drove an old pickup truck i present it as an option because it works for me and might work for you and my ex liked my old cars especially the 1983 station wagon with enough space in the back for a full size bed thus you have one possible way to cut your expenses significantly the only thing left to deal with is parking and its attendant security issues my have never been stolen broken into or even looked at funny though i have never left anything visible in them but the occasional bit of trash thieves do n't seem to expect an old beater to contain valuables or even be and a chop shop certainly would n't want one and as i noted in a comment earlier it 's possible to find cheaper monthly parking in nyc if you search carefully the $ example in the being just the first one i found after 25 seconds on google i am pretty sure that if you do some more extensive research you can find cheaper parking that is reasonably secure and at least relatively convenient to your most common travel plans

yes simply put printing money is called monetizing the debt and would result in some nasty inflation it 's a no no as it quickly devalues the currency and makes it far more difficult to borrow in the future an entire generation will remember getting burned by it if say canada 's currency were suddenly worth half as much and you received half your investment back in us dollars e.g. you paid us$ 10,000 but now have us$ 5000 would you ever trust them again   the economy is far more complex than one can discuss here but the fractional reserve system is the next creator of money although it 's not unlimited the reserve requirement it back the demand for loans is impacted both by the rate itself and the bank 's willingness to lend   the housing bubble had multiple causes in a sense is right anything we do to make houses more affordable can cause house price inflation but the over the top underwriting had more impact in my opinion people lost sight of good lending practices the option rate interest only arms were financial time bombs

i work at a large bank that is n't too unusual although a lot of banks are moving to fee free basic accounts and upping their fees on other specific transactions for example my bank did away with minimum balance requirements to waive a monthly service fee but we started charging $ for paper statements and our out of network atm fee by 50 cents   would like to point out that most financial institutions will reorder your transactions slightly for the purposes of accounting it is much easier to run all transactions in big batches at the end of the day than individually as they come in required disclosures you receive upon account opening explain the exact order but most banks do all credits money in first and then debits money out like checks debit cards and ach payments after if you overdraft you can usually avoid a fee if you make a cash deposit before the end of the business day as the cash will go into your account before your purchases are debited   occasionally this accounting based reordering will result in additional fees but that is not the intended purpose of reordering them and i would always refund any incurred fees that happened due to accounting based transaction reordering    what wells fargo is doing has been illegal since 2008 and their continued appeals are hoping to get the ruling overturned so they wo n't have to pay out restitution to affected customers it 's frankly despicable

two things you should consider about paying off student loans ahead of the 10 year amortization schedule what interest rate are you paying on your loans what are you earning on your investments in a balanced mutual fund when you pay off your student loans you are essentially guaranteed a return of the interest rate on your loan future interest you would have had to pay however if you are investing well and getting a good return on your investments you will get a greater return ex half of my student loans are at 6.8 other half are at 2.5 i make the minimum payments on the loans at 2.5 and invest my money in tax sheltered retirement accounts the return on these funds has been 8 and that is on per tax dollars so really closer to 11 now there is also downside risk when you invest in the market but 2.5 guaranteed i will for 11 in low risk return however my loans at 6.8 i repay in excess of the minimums because 6.8 guaranteed return is pretty good so this decision is based on your confidence in your investments and your own risk tolerance once you pay your bank on your student loans that money is gone out of your control if you need it in the future you may need to pay higher interest on an unsecured loan or you may not be able to borrow it when you want to make large purchases a car house that money you per paid on your loans is n't available to you as a down payment banks should want you to have some of your own skin in the game on these purchases and the lending standards keep getting tougher you are better off if you have money saved in your name rather than against the balance on your loan yes you ca n't bankrupt these loans but the money you repay on them does n't go toward housing you or paying your bills on a rainy day i went through the same feeling when i completed my mba with $ 50k in debt you want to pay it off as soon as possible but you need to step away and realize that it was an investment in your future and your future is long you need time to make a financial foundation for it and you will feel a lot more empowered when you have money saved and you can make the decision for how you want to deploy it to work for you ex i could pay down my student loans with the balance i have in the bank but i am going to use it to invest in myself and open my own business

i know the money is n't taxable when i send it to my parents yes this is right they send it to their nephew as it will count as a gift no this is incorrect yes refer to income tax guide on relations exempt under gifts gifts received from relatives are not charged to tax relative for this purpose means    a spouse of the individual    b brother or sister of the individual    c brother or sister of the spouse of the individual    d brother or sister of either of the parents of the individual    e any lineal or of the individual    f any lineal or of the spouse of the individual    g spouse of the persons referred to in b to f    friend is not a relative as defined in the above list and hence gift received from friends will be charged to tax if other criteria of taxing gift are even if you assumption were true i.e. your dad gives it to his brother and his brother gives it to his son   but if this is done sequentially and soon one after the other is it taxable the intent is important one can do it immediately or after few years if the intent is established that this was done to evade taxes then you will have to pay the tax as well as penalty

all for us yes you will have a realized long term capital gain which is taxable long term gains including those distributed by a mutual fund or other and also qualified dividends both not relevant here are taxed at lower rates than ordinary income but are still almost not quite like ordinary income not always 15 specifically if your ordinary taxable income after deductions and exemptions equivalent to line 43 minus ltcg ends in the 25 to 33 brackets your ltcg income is taxed at 15 unless the total of reaches the top of those brackets then any remainder at 20 these brackets depend on your filing status and are adjusted yearly for inflation for 2016 they are single 37,650 to married joint or to head of household to special married separate 37,650 to which i 'd guess covers at least the middle three quintiles of the earning population   otoh if your ordinary income ends below the 25 bracket your ltcg income that fits in the lower is taxed at 0 not at all and only the portion that would be in the ordinary up brackets is taxed at 15 if your ordinary taxable income this year was below those brackets or you expect next year it will be possibly due to status exemption deduction changes as well as income change then if all else is equal you are better off realizing the stock gain in the where some or more of it fits in the 0 bracket if you 're over about $ 400k a similar calculation applies but you can afford more reliable advice than potential dogs on the internet update near dupe found see also how are long term capital gains taxed if the gain pushes income into a new tax bracket   also a warning on estimated payments in general you are required to pay most of your income tax liability during the year not wait until april 15 if you underpay by more than 10 or $ 1000 whichever is larger you usually owe a penalty computed on form 2210 whose name is frequently and for most people whose income is mostly from a job this is handled by payroll withholding which normally comes out close enough to your liability if you have other income like investments as here or self employment or pension retirement disability etc you are supposed to either make estimated payments each quarter the irs quarters are shifted slightly from everyone else 's or increase your withholding or a combination for a large income lump in december that was n't planned in advance it wo n't be practical to adjust withholding however if this is the only year increased there is a safe harbor if your withholding this year 2016 is enough to pay last year 's tax 2015 which for most people it is unless you got a pay cut this year or a filed status change like or having a child you get until next april 15 or next business day in 2017 it is actually april 18 to pay the additional amount of this year 's tax 2016 without underpayment penalty however if you split the gain so that both 2016 and 2017 have income and thus taxes higher than normal for you you will need to make estimated payment(s and/or increase withholding for 2017 ps congratulations on your gain and on the patience to hold anything for 10 years

now asking if college is worth it   that 's not the question that should be asked   higher education and extended training are always a benefit at any point in life when it 's of high quality   the question that should be asked is why is the cost of college as high as it is   when i went to college to get my bachelors a semester at my state university cost $ bucks us this was in the early to mid 90s   twenty years later that same education cost $ 6,500 per semester   the main difference between these periods is that borrowing for school is now standard practice much less so in the 90s   any time you need to borrow to pay for something you 're going to overpay just because you have access to credit and can keep borrowing when someone hands you a bill   today kids borrow for college because they do n't have much choice if their parents did n't save enough or stopped supporting them right out of high school   and if you have this level of debt right out of college your hands will be tied for decades it affects things like first home buying and disposable income spending   the only way to drive the cost of college down is to plan ahead and pay with cash and to do that you need to have enough luck to be born to parents who care enough to help with your future   if schools know you ca n't or wo n't borrow to pay for an education they adjust

there 's nothing illegal in hiring your friends to manage your property or provide you services and it is definitely deductible there 's nothing specific to reference here this is a standard deduction for a landlord just as any i mentioned 1099 in the comments if the total is over $ 600 and your friend is not a corporation then you should issue 1099 that would provide you the necessary of the deduction of course you need to keep some documentation that shows the relation between the money paid and the services provided like a contract or invoice or receipt you can but do n't have to issue 1099 for lower amounts as well if you do n't you 'll need to keep more documents as checks documents about the agreement and the amounts etc in addition your deduction may be disallowed if your friend does n't declare this as taxable income issuing 1099 helps here since your friend will be forced to declare it otherwise it will be recorded as a mismatch by the irs and trigger an audit as to reimbursements that would go into the same bucket they 'll have to deduct their expenses from that income on their own taxes so if you give them $ 300 for the work $ 300 for the miles and $ 300 for the materials they bought you issue the 1099 for $ 900 and let them deduct the $ 600 on their own schedule c.

yield can be thought of as the interest rate you would receive from that investment in the form of a dividend for stocks or interest payments on a bond   the yield takes into account the anticipated amount to be received per share unit per year and the current price of the investment    of course the yield is not a guaranteed return like a savings account   if the investment yield is 4 when you buy it can drop in value such that you actually lose money during your hold period despite receiving income from the dividend or interest payments

they do n't actually need to they accept deposits for historical reasons and because they make money doing so but there 's nothing key to their business that requires them to do so here 's a decent summary but i 'll explain in great detail below by making loans banks create money this is what we mean when we say the monetary supply is at least if you believe sir king who used to run england 's central bank the only real checks on this are regulatory capitalization requirements and reserve requirements which impose a sort of tax on a bank 's circulating loans i 'll get into that later let 's start with why should you believe that story that loans create deposits it seems like a bizarre assertion but it actually matches how banks behave in practice if you go borrow money from a bank the loan officer will do many things she 'll want to look at your credit history she 'll want to look at your income and assets she 'll want to look at what kind of collateral or guarantees you 're providing that the loan will be repaid what she will not do is call down to the vaults and make sure that there 's enough bills stacked up for them to lend out loans are judged based on a profitability function determined by the interest rate and the loan risk if those add up to profitable the bank makes the loan so the limiting factor on the loans a bank makes are the available creditworthy borrowers not the bank 's stock of cash further the story makes sense because loans are how banks make money if a bank that was short of money suddenly stopped making loans it 'd be screwed no new loans = no way to make money to pay back depositors and also keep the lights on = no more bank and the story is believable because of the way banks make so little effort to solicit commercial deposit business oh sure they used to give you a free toaster if you opened an account but now it 's really quite challenging to find a no fee checking account that does n't impose a super high deposit limit and the interest paid on savings deposits is approaching zero if banks actually needed your deposits they 'd be making a lot more of effort to get them i mean they wo n't turn up their noses your deposited allowance is a couple basis points cheaper to the bank than borrowing from the fed but banks seem to value small potatoes depositors more as a source of fees and sales opportunities for services and consumer credit than as a source of cash it 's a bit different if you get north of seven figures but smaller depositors are n't really worth the hassle just for their cash this is where someone will mention the regulatory requirements of fractional reserve banking banks are obliged by regulators to keep enough cash on hand to pay out a certain percentage of deposits note nothing about loans was said in that statement this requirement does not serve as a check on the bank making bad loans because the bank is ultimately liable to all its depositors for the full value of their deposits it 's more making sure they have enough liquidity to prevent bank runs the self fulfilling prophecy in which an bank could be forced into bankruptcy as you noted in your question banks can always borrow from the fed at the fed discount rate or from other banks at the interbank overnight rate which is a little lower to meet this requirement they do have to pledge collateral but loans themselves are collateral so this does n't present much of a problem in terms of paying off depositors if the bank should collapse and minimizing the amount of fdic insurance payout from the government it 's really capital requirements that are actually important i.e. the bank has to have investors who do n't have a right to be paid back and whose investment is on the hook if the bank goes belly up but that 's just a safeguard for the depositors it does n't really have anything to do with loans other than that bad loans are the main reason a bank might go under banks like any other private business have assets things of value and liabilities obligations to other people but banking assets and liabilities are counterintuitive the bank 's assets are loans because they are theoretically recoverable the principal and also generate a revenue stream the interest payments the money the bank holds in deposits is actually a liability because it has to pay that money out to depositors on demand and the deposited money will never by itself bring the bank any revenue at all in fact it 's a drain because the bank needs to pay interest to its depositors well they used to anyway so what happens when a bank makes a loan from a balance sheet perspective strangely enough the answer is nothing at all if i grant you a loan the minute we shake hands and you sign the paperwork a teller types on a keyboard and money appears in your account your account with my bank my bank has simultaneously created an asset the loan you now have to repay me and an equal sized liability the funds i loaned you which are now deposited in your account i 'll make money on the deal because the interest you owe me is a much higher rate than the interest i pay on your deposits or the rate i 'd have to pay if i need to borrow cash to cover your withdrawal i might just have the cash on hand anyway from interest and origination fees and whatnot from previous loans from an accounting perspective nothing has happened to my balance sheet but suddenly you owe me closing costs and a stream of extraneous interest payments nice work if you can get it okay so i 've demonstrated that i do n't need to take deposits to make loans but we live in a world where banks do here 's a few reasons you can probably think of more but at the end of the day a bank should be designed so that if every single non borrowing depositor withdrew their deposits the bank would n't collapse or cease to exist

i 'll chime in and say that my wife and i thought this was a really dumb idea until we tried it i was keeping track of everything in my checkbook ledger but having the physical money in the envelopes really does work we thought it would be more hassle than it 's worth and there were the first month or two but in the end we both agree this is what started our movement towards responsible money management and debt reduction we have the following categories   obviously ymmv but the point is to take any categories in your budget that are hard to budget for as they vary from month to month and just set aside an amount form your paycheck in cash for each one of those categories in an envelope   what i 've noticed is that by putting the money aside up front it 's much easier to stick to the budget we 'll often shuffle money around in the envelopes if priorities change for a particular month as well so rather than taking money away from an extra payment on a debt or our planned savings transfer which would have been our default action pre envelopes we can just move $ xx from date night into groceries if we have to hence planning out how we 'll spend our money budgeting has gotten a lot easier since adopting this system

from my limited experience having taken a class on bankruptcy in order to become a chapter 11 is the portion of the bankruptcy code that allows certain corporate entities to reorganize basically the entity files for bankruptcy protection to halt credit collections or any number of reasons and then work with the courts to get out if the entity can put together a reasonable sounding restructuring plan the court may allow them to do it a restructuring plan essentially is a plan of who to pay back when and by what means this is seriously a simple explanation it 's much more complex than this so if the court approves the plan the entity will attempt to carry it out and come out of bankruptcy several years down the road in a more solvent position if the court rejects the plan or the plan fails then the entity has to then engage in chapter 7 proceedings selling assets to pay off debts

the biggest challenge with owning any individual stock is price fluctuation which is called risk the scenarios you describe assume that the stock behaves exactly as you predict price portfolio doubles and you need to consider risk one way to measure risk in a stock or in a portfolio is sharpe ratio risk adjusted return or the related ratio one piece of advice that is often offered to individual investors is to diversify and the stated reason for diversification is to reduce risk but that is not telling the whole story when you are able to identify stocks that are not price correlated you can construct a portfolio that reduces risk you are trying to avoid 10 tax on the stock grant but need to accept significant risk to avoid the 10 differential tax $ 1000 an alternative to a single stock is to invest in an etf much lower risk which you can buy and hold for a long time and the price growth of an etf ex spy can be charted versus your stock to visualize the difference in growth fluctuation look up the beta volatility of your stock compared to spy for example ibm compare the beta of ibm and tsla and note that you may accept higher volatility when you invest in a stock like tesla over ibm what is the beta of your stock and how willing are you to accept that risk when you can identify stocks that move in opposite directions and mix your portfolio look up beta balanced you can smooth out the variability reduce the risk although you may reduce your absolute return this can not be done with a single stock but if you have more money to invest you could compose the rest of your portfolio to balance the risk for this stock grant keep the grant shares and still effectively manage risk some years ago i had accumulated over 10,000 shares grants options in a company where i worked during the time i worked there their price varied between $ 30/share and < $ 1/share i was able to liquidate at $

so basically they are trying to see two things   one is whether prices are correlated to each other for long periods of time as a preliminary study suggested which would go against efficient markets hypothesis since you could use that info to game the market or if that result is illusory and the long term returns are close to a standard normal distribution which would follow the markets   the second thing i do n't follow as well but they 're trying to solve the first thing so that they can then look at why when they look at returns at different time scales one hour one week the model which had been proposed for these returns is not supported by the data   the first thing they say that the old model levy says that the variability should not be the same at the different time scales but the data suggests that it is   so they then propose a modification of the old levy model and say that it would also explain the strange first result they looked at that prices are correlated for longer periods   that probably does n't make any sense but you might have more luck by posting in /r statistics

the piece is a little misguided at best and poor journalism at worst the problem lies in the difference between what 's deductible for individuals and what 's deductible for corporations the short version of the story is that corporations can deduct a hell of a lot more things than individuals can individual deductions are spelled out in the internal revenue code stuff like medical expenses above 7.5 of your agi certain educational things etc   for corporations the basic rule is that they can deduct any ordinary and necessary business expenses that includes operating travel interest employee etc   i wish that the article had cited specific sections of the code if this was some kind of loophole or something but alas it appears that they did n't that leads me to believe that these companies are deducting the portion not paid to the government as a business expense    what it 's worth i do n't believe that a company can deduct those expenses for tax purposes unless it 's to protect their business interests my assumption i do n't have the time or desire to search case law right now is that settlements with the us government are considered to fall under that   edit see my comment r business for the relevant treasury regulation dealing with this

i would move some or all of the money with £ 30 k savings you have a 20 deposit whereas you can get a much better mortgage rate with a 40 or 50 deposit that 's true no matter how good bad your credit rating and it 's possible that with a bad credit rating you may not even be able to get a mortgage with a small deposit also you will almost certainly save significantly more by paying less mortgage interest compared to the interest rates on your savings in the netherlands shop around for a cheap option to transfer money i had a quick look at transferwise no affiliation they just happen to have a convenient calculator on their website and the all in cost for a large one way transfer seems to be about 0.5 i think you 'll more than make that back in terms of savings on your mortgage if you intend to move back to the netherlands at some point then you are taking some exchange rate risk by moving your savings to the uk you do n't know if it 'll be better or worse when you want to transfer money back but i guess it wo n't be that soon if you want to buy a house so i think the risk is probably worthwhile i calculated the cost of the transfer by converting € 100k into gbp and then converting the resulting amount back again that left € so a two way transfer cost 1 and from that i that a one way transfer costs roughly 0.5

at that sum it essentially does n't matter what you do unless you just want to outright gamble the money   let 's look at some options high interest guaranteed savings   a five year cd returns a sad 2 right now   that means if you invest all $ 1,000 into a cd by 2016 you will have earned $ in interest   think about that   about a hundred bucks over the next five years   of course with 3 inflation that $ will be worth about $   in fact the total amount will be worth $   your doing something with your money did nothing stocks can return significantly more interest but there is no guarantee   even if you made 20 year on year you would only make maybe $ 1,500 in returns or so in the next 5 years and 20 every year is like warren buffet territory totally unrealistic   that 's also not taking into account inflation and neither of these is taking into account taxes however if you go to a casino and gamble the $ 1,000 it is possible you could turn it into significantly more   it 's very much unlikely and i do not advise it at all but it 's possible    the point is you need money to make money and in some sense $ 1,000 is not money at all   i recommend you work on your skills knowledge and preparation for making money in the future and by 25 or so you can really be cooking with gas   do n't waste your efforts trying to find a brilliant way to make a few hundred bucks over the next half decade   save the money and find ways to try to double it by earning money on small projects   then challenge yourself to double it again and keep honing your skills

if you look at the definition of time value on wikipedia you may notice this line time value can be thought of as the price an investor is willing to pay for potential upside   you are right to think that the time value is increasing as the increases from deeply otm to atm once the crosses the strike price threshold per wiki 's interpretation the upside potential decreases as the underlying price moves away from the strike price think it as if an option is already deep in the money the chance of it getting further itm is slim hence the willingness to pay for that chance aka the upside potential decreases

the is a record of the total benefits you 've received in a tax year that have n't been taxed in another way a bit like the is a record of the total pay and tax you 've paid in a tax year note that travel for business purposes should n't be taxable and if that 's what 's being reported on the you may need to make a claim for tax relief to hmrc to avoid having to pay the tax i 'm not sure whether it 's normal for such expenses to be reported there hmrc will normally collect that tax by adjusting your tax code after the is issued so that more tax is taken off your future income so you do n't need to do anything as it 'll be handled automatically as to how you know it 's accurate if you have any doubts you 'd need to contact your former employer and ask them to confirm the details in general you ought to know what benefits you actually received so should at least be able to figure out if the number is plausible if your travel was a flight to the usa then probably it was if it was a bus ticket less so if you fill in a tax return you 'll also have to report the amount there which will increase the tax you owe reduce your refund you wo n't be charged twice even if your tax code also changes as the tax return accounts for the total amount of tax you 've already paid for travel benefits the exact treatment in relation to tax is here

a major thing to consider when deciding whether to invest or pay off debt is cash flow specifically how each choice affects your cash flow and how your cash flow is affected by various events simply enough your cash flow is the amount of money that passes through your finances during a given period often a month or a year some of this is necessary payments like staying current on loans rent etc while other parts are not necessary such as eating out for example you currently have $ 5,500 debt at 3 and another $ 2,500 at 5 this means that every month your cashflow effect of these loans is $ 5,500 3 12 + $ 2,500 5 12 = $ 24 interest before any applicable tax effects plus any required payments toward the principal which you do n't state to have the $ 8,000 paid off in 30 years you 'd be paying another $ 33 toward the principal for a total of about $ 60 per month before tax effects in your case if you take the full $ 7,000 you have available and use it to pay off the debt starting with the higher interest loan then your situation changes such that you now assuming that the repayment timeline remains the same the cashflow effect of the above becomes $ 1,000 3 12 = $ interest plus $ toward the principal again before tax effects in one fell swoop you just reduced your monthly payment from $ 60 to $ 5.25 per year this means $ 720 to $ 63 so on the $ 7,000 invested in repayment you get $ in return every year for a annual return on investment it will take you about 11 years to use only this money to save another $ 7,000 as opposed to the 30 years original repayment schedule if the extra payment goes toward knocking time off the existing repayment schedule but keeping the amount paid toward the principal per month the same you are now paying $ 33 toward the principal plus $ 2.50 interest against the $ 1,000 loan which means by paying $ you will be debt free in 30 months two and a half years instead of 30 years an effective 92 reduction in repayment time you immediately have another about $ in your budget and in two and a half years you will have $ 60 per month that you would n't have if you stuck with the original repayment schedule if instead the total amount paid remains the same you are then paying about $ toward the principal and will be debt free in less than a year and a half not too shabby if you ask me also do n't forget that this is a known guaranteed return in that you know what you would be paying in interest if you did n't do this and you know what you will be paying in interest if you do this even if the interest rate is variable you can calculate this to a reasonable degree of certainty the difference between those two is your return on investment compare this to the fact that while an investment in the s&p might have similar returns over long periods of time the stock market is much more volatile in the shorter term as the past two decades have so demonstrated it does n't do you much good if an investment returns 10 per year over 30 years if when you need the money it 's down 30 because you bought at a local peak and have held the investment for only a year also consider if you go back to school are you going to feel better about a $ payment or a $ payment even if the payments on old debt are deferred while you are studying you will still have to pay the money and it will likely be accruing interest in the meantime now i really do n't advocate your savings account entirely the way i did in the example above stuff happens all the time and some stuff that happens costs money instead you should be keeping some of that money easily available in a liquid non volatile form which basically means a savings account without withdrawal penalties or a money market fund not the stock market how much depends on your necessary expenses a buffer of three months worth of expenses is an often recommended starting point for an emergency fund the above should however help you evaluate how much to keep how much to invest and how much to use to pay off loans early respectively

most investors should not be in individual stocks the market however you measure it can rise yet some stocks will fall for whatever reason the diversification needed is to have a number of shares of different stocks and that a bit higher than most investors are able to invest and certainly not one starting out i suggest you look at either mutual funds or etfs and keep studying i 'm told i should have offered the uk equivalent investment trusts or unit trusts

i 'd refer you to is it true that 90 of investors lose their money the answer there is no not true and much of the discussion applies to this question   the stock market rises over time even after adjusting for inflation a positive return those who try to beat the market choosing individual stocks on average lag the market quite a bit even in a year of great returns as is this year 13 is up nearly 25 as measured by the s&p there are stocks that are up and stocks that are down simply look at a dozen stock funds and see the variety of returns i do n't even look anymore because i 'm sure that of 12 2 or three will be ahead 3 4 well behind and the rest clustered near 25   still if you wish to on individual stock purchases i recommend starting when you can invest in 20 different stocks spread over different industries and be willing to commit time to follow them so each year you might be selling 3 5 and replacing with stocks you prefer it 's the etf i recommend for most along with a buy and hold strategy buying in over time will show decent returns over the long run and the etf strategy will keep costs low

i do n't know the details of whether or not you should pay this money or who is at fault but clearly you believe that you do not owe the money and the bank investigation seems to agree with you since they gave you your money back   since you have your money and they have n't sued you the only issue yet remaining is your credit report here is what i would suggest   first make sure you check all three credit reports to see which reports the collection appears on then dispute the report with each credit bureau reporting the problem there is an article on creditkarma that explains the process when you file your dispute with the credit they will investigate this usually involves asking the creditor for proof of the debt and if you did n't sign anything they probably wo n't have any proof hopefully the credit bureaus will come to the same conclusion as the bank did and remove the collection from your credit reports   in my opinion it does n't make sense to pay them now if you do n't believe you owe it paying them wo n't remove all the bad stuff from your credit report but it will improve it and you do n't want to pay them and then immediately sue them   if however the credit bureaus side with the landlord and leave this on your report paying the $ 300 is better on your report than leaving the unpaid debt on there

when you get a loan car home student the lending company bank give the auto dealer previous home owner school money you as the borrow promise to pay this money back with interest   so in your case the 100,000 you borrow requires a payment for principal and interest of per month after 240 payments you will have paid the bank   so who got the in interest the bank did it was used to pay interest to the people who made deposits into the bank it was also used to pay the expenses of the bank salaries retirement rent electricity computers etc if the bank is a company with investors they may have to pay dividends to them to   of course not all loans are successfully paid back so some of the payment goes to cover the loans that are in default in many cases loans are also refinanced or the house is sold long before the 20 30 year term is up in these cases the amount of interest received for that loan is much less than anticipated but the good news is that it can be loaned out again

you can expect about a 7 return when investing in the general market if your horizon is ten years or more the market fluctuates which means that you should be absolutely fine with losing 10 or more of your invested money during this period you say yourself that i have been setting aside money into a savings account earmarked for that purpose repairs maintenance so that i do n't have to take out loans it 's obvious from your question that the purpose of this money is not savings this is money that you are already investing not in stocks or bonds but in your house while this money sits around of course you could put it into the market and hope that it grows it all depends on your horizon which in your case sounds like about 1 year is that long enough to be fairly sure you will make a profit from what i 've written so far hopefully you can gather that the answer is no if you choose to invest $ 6,000 but you need that money back in one year you need to be aware of the risk that you 'll instead end up with $ or even less your options are then to if you 're asking for personal advice my opinion would be this you 're already investing in your house the housing market like most markets fluctuate whether you like it or not you 're already a victim or of this value fluctuation the difference is that a house is something you 'll live in for a long time probably that will give you daily joy in a way stocks and bonds wo n't of course saving up money and investing them is always a good idea anyway you should still save a small amount every month and put it into low medium risk bonds in my opinion

hey i hear ya on this situation i also graduated from a good school finance comp sci with a mediocre gpa and had difficulty securing a full time position in finance my best advice is to network the shit out of alumni you can connect to through linkedin or your schools alumni network homepage people are much more open to talking than you would typically think   like your friends said getting into ibd as an analyst is ideal as it gives you a great line on your resume shows you worked hard and has amazing training now comes the really shitty part of this conversation if you 've already graduated college it 's next to impossible to get into a bulge bracket as an analyst your best bet in this case would be to try to get into a mid cap or boutique ib and work your way from there again though networking means 100x more than anything else   now the good news investment research is very different from investment banking yes equity research is within an investment bank sell side and buy side but it is very different from investment banking see chinese walls it 's easier to make the transition into research without formal recruiting than it is to get into ib directly   couple things to keep in mind know the difference between sell side an buy side i 'm not talking about just one buys stuff the other tries to get you to buy it i 'm talking about conflicts of interest on the sell side personalities types of research what your role entails org structure etc sell side is extremely different than buy side buy side is much less flexible than sell side in recruiting also do you currently own stocks trade track stocks all day long etc if the answer is no to any of those buy side is really really hard they want people who live and breath investing markets news companies because that 's what they do also training is effectively non existent on the buy side due to the size of the shops some can have $ 10b with 10 people including admins    now lets talk sell side this is where i 'd recommend you put your resources if you 're really passionate about it they tend to hire people without experience more often into entry level jobs b c most are larger investment banks that use research to promote underwriting investment business also you need to have a pitch but not as extensive as on the buy side those 1 2 i talked about the best advice i can offer is to hop on a bloomberg tr capiq terminal if you can and just start finding email addresses of sell side analysts they publish them in their reports and start writing the analysts directly expressing your interest in the business and your desire to talk with them be frank about where you are in your career but show a true passion for research and that you are hungry attach your resume and keep the email short a few sentences with maybe some bullets about how you could help that company spend the time to it to that person follow up with a phone call in 1 2 weeks they will appreciate the and   you 'll find them to be very receptive   even if these analysts do n't have a job available right there if they like you they will pass you on to someone who might this is how networking works that guy might not have a job but someone is always hiring and its a tight community   the other option is to work for any finance firm in some role for 3 5 years then go back to get an mba with an mba from a top school you can basically transition into anything    pm me if you ever want to talk over im i 'd be happy to chat

we measure the value of gold by comparing it to other things sorry but there is no better answer than that there is no gold standard pun intended by which objects can be measured in value because value is a subjective term it would be comparable to asking how funny is an object different objects are funny to different people even if we gathered all the really funny object together there is no guaranty those objects would be funny next year unless we all agreed they were as part of a social contract which is basically what we do with currency while gold does not need a social contract in order for it to retain its value this is only because it is has been 1 very useful and 2 rare if either of these two factors change the value of gold will change which it has on several occasions rant about intrinsic value of gold below gold has no intrinsic value none whatsoever   intrinsic value makes just as much sense as a cat dog animal dog and cat are referring to two mutually exclusive animals therefore a cat dog is a nonsensical term intrinsic value the actual value of a company or an asset based on an underlying perception of its true value intrinsic value is perceived which means it is worth whatever you or a group of people think it is intrinsic value has nothing i repeat absolutely nothing to do with reality   the most obvious example of this is the purchase of a copy right you are assigning an intrinsic value to a copy right by purchasing it however when you purchase a copy right you are not buying ink on a page you are purchasing an idea someone 's that for all intensive purposes does n't even exist in reality by definition things that do not exist do not have intrinsic properties because things that do n't exist do n't have any natural properties at all intrinsic according to dictionary   belonging to the essential nature or constitution of a thing the intrinsic of a star an intrinsic property of an object is something we know that exists because it is a natural property of that object emit light we know this because we can measure the light coming from it it is not subjective intrinsic value by definition is the opposite of intrinsic

to a certain degree the only sure thing i know is the price i paid for the stock is the fair price at the time i buy it is absolutely right by definition and by the law of the free and efficient market and forces of supply and demand freedom of public information about share price sensitive information etc etc etc and you 've made a good point that many investors i 'd say however in practise the market has many participants and they will all be arriving at a different idea of what the fair price is by way of a slightly different analysis and slightly different information in theory they all have the same information but unfortunately in practise there is always some disparity when one participant feels a stock is undervalued though the last thing they want to do is say so instead they will start buying stock they might feel it is undervalued by 20 but that does n't mean they 'll keep buying and buying until it gets to 20 they might push the price up just a little then let the price drift down again buy some more relax buy some more etc over time the price will rise of course because the supply will become weaker but even if the participant is correct about the 20 the price might have only risen 7 by the time they acquire all the stock they want given their risk models market exposure and margin guidelines etc and it might be more than a year later before the price has actually risen to 20 presumably because more and more other market participants have come to the same conclusion the opposite can obviously also happen a participant might dump stock it feels is over valued long before it hits the values it believes in so right away you can see that pricing might not really reflect value or fair price

the short answer zero 's answer gives some good reasons why   you will basically never be able to achieve diversification with individual stocks that is anywhere close to what you can get with mutual funds   owning individual stocks exposes you to much greater risk in that random one off events that happen to affect one of the companies you own can have a disproportionate effect on your assets   for instance some sort of scandal involving a particular company can cause its stock to tank there are only two reasons i can see to invest in individual stocks a. you have some unique opportunity to acquire stock that other people might not be able to get or get at that price   this can be the case if you work for a privately held company that allows you to buy stock or options or allows you to participate in its ipo   even then you should not go too crazy since having too much stock in the company you work for can double your pain if the company falls on hard times you may lose your job and your investment b. for fun   if you like tracking stocks and trying to beat the market you may want to test your skills at this by using a small proportion of your investable cash no more than 10   in this case you 're not so much hoping to increase your returns as to just enjoy investing more   this can also have a psychological benefit in that it allows you to blow off steam and indulge your desire to make decisions while allowing your passive investments index funds to shoulder the load of actually gaining value

it 's worth noting that there have been several studies with differing results for minimum wage in general and now specifically for seattle it 's unwise to take any single one as the study best to look at them all in context   i think the broad consensus is that there 's an elasticity of somewhere between and   so a minimum wage increase of 10 will lead to a decrease in employment of somewhere between 0.5 and 2     it just comes down to how you value the tradeoff between higher wages for the working and fewer hours worked and where you place that elasticity   i think there 'd be pretty broad support if you could double the minimum wage and only see a 5 decline in hours worked

most businesses want to grow and there are a variety of ways to raise the money needed to hire new employees and otherwise invest in the business to increase the rate of that growth you as a stock holder should hope that management is choosing the least expensive option for growth some of the options are debt selling equity to venture capitalists or selling equity on the open market going public if they choose debt they pay interest on that debt if they choose to sell equity to venture capitalists then your shares get diluted but hopefully the growth makes up for some of that dilution if they choose to go public dilution is still a concern but the terms are usually a little more favorable for the company selling because the market is so liquid   in the us current regulations for publicly traded companies cost somewhere in the neighborhood of $ year so that 's the rule of thumb for considering whether going public makes sense when calculating the cost of fundraising but as mentioned regulations make it less advantageous for executives who choose to sell their shares after the company goes public they ca n't sell when good spot prices appear going public is often considered the next step for a company that has grown past the initial venture funding phase but if cash flow is good plenty of companies decide to just reinvest profits and skip the equity markets altogether

what interests me in the article is the way california seems to be quite happy to be losing people who pay taxes because the state can so easily attract new warm bodies what happens to a state when there is no incentive to retain its people    it struck a cord with me because i 've been reading about the history of mining if an industry can always bring in newer poorer people conditions for those working in that industry will never rise in mining conditions can be so bad that you can almost think of it as if the workers are expendable working conditions can be so bad that many die each year and nobody seems to care because if one group of workers gets a little management simply starts importing them from another country    you can disagree but i see a parallel with california sure one is an industry and one is a country but this is a state that seems more than the rest of the country to depend on cheap mexican labor as mexico stopped breeding people for export california begin to simply import new slave labor from or any other place that still exports people as though they were only cattle of course this makes it difficult for those who came in an earlier wave to improve quality of life in fact life gets harder and just look at what happened to the world class famous free public education in california yeah distant memory now    i also wonder if allowing california to ignore national immigration law is good for the rest of the nation what about this quote   also more than 30 of the nation ’s welfare recipients are californians even though california has just 12 of the nation ’s population   it is not surprising therefore that california is ranked number one in poverty   california has so many electoral votes that i do n't expect to see them prosecuted by the federal government like az no matter what they do the state is too big to piss off but it is becoming a cancer to the rest of the nation
