the bank will make this even more confusing because they use the terms from their own perspective from the bank 's perspective   printed on your statements credit money into your account   increases the bank 's liabilities debit money out of your account   decrease bank liabilities from your perspective it depends on the nature of the transfer of money but here are the most common for a personal account income into your account credit expenses out of your account debit payment on a loan made for an asset house car credit for the loan account debit for the equity account for the car house etc yes it 's complicated neither credits nor debits are always a + or that 's why i agree with the advice of the others here that double entry accounting is overkill for your personal finances note i simplified the above examples for the purpose of clarity technically every transaction in double entry accounting includes both a credit and a debit hence the double in the name in fact sometimes a transaction involves more than one credit or debit but always at least one of each also this is for each party so any transaction between you and your bank involves at least four debits and/or credits when all involved are considered

i agree with mbhunter 's suggestion of labeling your columns income and expenses however to answer your question money coming in a paycheque for example is credited to your account money going out a utility bill for example is debited from your account there 's no real why this is simply the definition of the words

most bank registers where you write down entries show deposits + to account as a credit payments fees and withdrawals are debits to your bank on loans such as credit card accounts a credit to your loan account is a payment or other reductions of the amount you owe a charge to your account is a debit to you loan account they did this just to confuse us
# 107833
it sounds like you 're mixing a simple checkbook register with double entry bookkeeping do you need a double entry level of rigor otherwise why not have two columns one for income like a paycheck and one for expenses like paying a cable bill   then add up both columns and then take the difference of the sums to get your increase or decrease for the time period if you want to break up income and expenses further then you can do that too

the bank credit 's your account for money coming into it in double entry accounting you always have a debit and a credit to balance the accounts as an example for $ 500 that the bank credited to your checking account you would post a debit to cash and a credit to income earned the accounting equation is assets = liabilities + owner 's equity $ 500    = $ 500 cash is the asset side of the equation income is part of owner 's equity and so is the credit side to make the equation balanced
# 208219
if you are considering this to be an entry for your business this is how you would handle it you said you were making a balance sheet for monthly expenses so on the balance sheet you would be debiting cash for the income statement side you would be crediting owner 's equity to balance the equation assets = liabilities + owner 's equity so if you deposited $ 100 to your account the equation would be affected thus $ 100 in assets debit to cash account = 0 liabilities $ 100 credit to owner 's equity it is correctly stated above from the bank 's perspective that they would be crediting you account with $ 100 and any outflow from the bank account would be debiting your account

in the netherlands its cheaper in some cases to have a mortgage then to own a house    example if you own a house you pay more taxes because you own something expensive you have to pay < owners tax so if you instead of owning the house   keep the mortgage low and only pay the mortgage interest the interest will be much lower then the tax you would have to pay the sweet spot for lowest interest and not having to pay the owners tax is different for any mortgage but by grandparents use this method and they pay a really small amount for a rather large house

one important thing that has n't been mentioned here is that the vast majority of companies have eventually eliminated their company provided pension plans and replaced it with a 401 k with some degree of matching   there is a cost advantage to doing this as companies no longer have to maintain or work to maintain a 100 vested pension plan   this takes a great burden off them   they also do n't have to manage the pension annuity that the retirement benefit entails

agree with it is rare larger cap examples include nokia and holdings   if cash exceeds market cap that means total debt is greater than ev the value of the operating assets if the debt is partially repaid matures the equity is ok but if management is crap and the cash is spent at an below the interest rate on the debt now you have a situation where the net debt exceeds the value of the operating assets the credit quality suffers debt trades down you need to in order to avoid bankruptcy   the above assumes debt is greater than cash situations where cash exceeds market cap and debt is less than cash i.e. a negative ev are exceedingly rare in larger companies and are either a a wonderfully attractive mispricing or b market views management as so awful that the cash will get burnt up by the business and the value of that cash will be destroyed

the real reason credit cards are so popular in the us is that americans are lazy and broke and the credit card companies know how to market to that   have you ever heard of the $ 30k millionaires these were individuals that purchased as if they were some of the wealthy elite but had no real money to back it up american society has pushed the idea of living on credit for quite some time now an idea that is even by watching the us government operate solely on credit raise the debt ceiling much live in america for more than six months and you will be bombarded with pre approved deals with low introductory rates that are designed to sucker the average consumer into opening multiple accounts that they do n't need then they try and get you to carry a balance by allowing low minimum payments that could take in the neighborhood of 20 years to pay off depending on carried balance this in turn pads the credit companies pockets with all of the interest you now pay on the account the few truly wealthy americans do not purchase on credit

the s&p 500 is an index this refers to a specific collection of securities which is held in perfect proportion the dollar value of an index is scaled arbitrarily and is based off of an arbitrary starting price side note this is why an index never has a split lets look at what assumptions are included in the pricing of an index all securities are held in perfect proportion this means that if you invest $ 100 in the index you will receive shares of ibm shares of general motors etc also if a security is added dropped from the list you are immediately rebalancing the remaining money zero commissions are charged when the index is calculated they are using the current price last trade of the underlying securities they are not actually purchasing them therefore it assumes that securities may be purchased without commission or other liquidity costs also closely related is the following the current price has full liquidity if the last quoted price is $ 20 for a security the index assumes that you can purchase an arbitrary amount of the security at that price with a counterparty that is willing to trade dividends are distributed immediately if you own 500 equities and most distributed dividends quarterly this means you will receive on average 4 dividends per day management is free all equities can be purchased with zero research and administrative costs there is no gains tax trading required by the assumptions above would change your holdings constantly and you are exempt from short term or long term capital gains taxes each one of these assumptions is of course invalid and the fund which endeavors to track the index must make several decisions in how to closely track the index while avoiding the problems costs caused by the assumptions these are shortcuts or each shortcut leads to performance which does not exactly match the index management fees fees are charged to the investor as load annual fees and/or redemptions securities are purchased at real prices if facebook were removed from the s&p 500 overnight tonight the fund would sell its shares at the price buyers are bidding the next market day at this could be significantly different than the price today which the index records securities are purchased in blocks rather than buying shares of general motors each time someone invests a dollar they wait for a few people and then buy a full share or a round lot securities are substituted with lots of analysis it may be determined that two stocks move in tandem the fund may purchase two shares of general motors rather than one of general motors and ford this halves transaction costs debt is used as part of substitution equities may be replaced by options option pricing shows that ownership of options is equivalent to holding an amount of debt other forms of leverage may also be employed to achieve desired market exposure see also beta   dividends are bundled vfinx the largest s&p 500 tracking fund pays dividends quarterly rather than immediately as earned the dividend money which is not paid to you is either deployed to buy other securities or put into a sinking fund for payment there are many reasons why you ca n't get the actual performance quoted in an index and for other more exotic indices like vix the volatility index even more so the best you can do is work with someone that has a good reputation and measure their performance

that 's easy keep making the payments and go on with life the number that matters more than loan market value is loan equity as long as you can sell it for enough to pay the balance on your loan you should be okay not saying it does n't suck but financially you are fine if you owe more than the house is worth i 'd suggest paying it down as quickly as possible to fix that ratio to reduce your financial risk in case you lose your source of income personally i think it is pretty slimy for people to walk away from house notes or try to short sell them when they can afford to continue payments just because the market value of the house fell   how would you feel if when house prices were skyrocketing the bank canceled your loan and repossessed your house because they could resell it for more money not that they could realistically just speaking hypothetically

in addition to what quid said i think your risk tolerance should depend on how likely you are to need the funds in the near future say that you have $ 100k saved up and you want to decide how to invest it then you should ask yourself the idea here is that if you invest say in stocks high risk then the value of your position could drop significantly and you 'd potentially have to wait for a long time before it recovers if you are forced to sell you could make a substantial loss if you do n't urgently need this cash however then you can feel relaxed and just wait for the market to reverse again this is viewing risk through the lens of how likely it is that you 'll have to wait a long time to get a substantial amount of your money back which itself is a function of how likely it is for a substantial downturn to occur in a certain market

various types of corporate actions will a price adjustment   in the case of dividends the cash that will be paid out as a dividend to share holders forms part of a company 's equity   once the company pays a dividend that cash is no longer part of the company 's equity and the share price is adjusted accordingly for example if apple is trading at $ 101 per share at the close of business on the day prior to going ex dividend and a dividend of $ 1 per share has been declared then the closing price will be adjusted by $ 1 to give a closing quote of $ 100 although the dividend is not paid out until the dividend pay date the share price is adjusted at the close of business on the day prior to the ex dividend date since any new purchases on or after the ex dividend date are not entitled to receive the dividend distribution so in effect new purchases are buying on the basis of a reduced equity    it will be the exchange providing the quote that performs the price adjustment not google or yahoo   the exchange will perform the adjustment at the close prior to each ex dividend date so when you are looking at historical data you are looking at price data that includes each adjustment

this article has a section titled do you need an umbrella policy to cover your personal liability risks that says if you have young children for example you might need a policy    because they have lots of friends these little might get into    some and hurt themselves at your home if so you ’re at risk    of being sued do you have people over often do you drive like a or a    do you have firearms on your premises do you have gardeners    and on the grounds all these are reasons why you might    want to own an umbrella policy although many people in the us are homeowners parents drivers etc not everyone falls into these categories for some people as low as the premiums for such a policy might be   the expected cost outweighs the expected benefit the cost of a lawsuit may be extremely high but someone may feel that the chance of a lawsuit being filed against them is low enough to be safely ignored and not worth insuring against i 'm probably not a great example but i 'll use my own situation anyway even though a liability policy probably would n't cost me too much i 'm almost certain that i would n't derive any benefit from it i live alone without children or firearms pet tigers gardeners etc in a 520 sq ft apartment so the probability that something bad would happen to someone on the small bit of property that i rent and that they would file a sizable lawsuit against me is small enough that i choose to ignore it

firstly it is completely legal for a company to buy its own shares i do n't believe it would be legal to do so secretly it would also be very difficult to do that secretly    so hypothetically we have a company inc. it does n't have any assets other than $ 100 in a bank account and there are 100 shares each owned by a different person each share would be worth $ 1 so the company decides to buy one share now there is $ 99 in the account and 99 shares each share is still worth $ 1 so the company continues to buy shares until there is only one share left and $ 1 in the account if the company buys that last share it will no longer have any assets and will cease to exist effectively dissolving the company   tl dr it is called dissolving the company or dissolution and it happens fairly often with limited liability corporations

gt our corporations pay some of the lowest taxes in the world with some of the larger ones actually paying none   no they do n't the top marginal rate for income taxes is 38 meanwhile in the republic of ireland rates vary from 12.5 25 depending on the exact source of the income so no our corporations do not pay the lowest taxes in the world as far as them paying none that stems from one of two things one corporations that pay out all their money in salaries and therefore have no retained earnings hence all their money is taxed at the individual level and workers get at a full 35 and two corporations that create a price transfer agreement with a foreign corporation so that income is shifted to a low tax region where they end up paying nothing to uncle sam that money will still be taxed if they ever try to bring it home and distribute it but as long as it stays overseas then no one can touch it because technically it has n't been earned as income yet that 's how companies avoid greedy bastards trying to take their money because contrary to your opinion you 're not actually entitled to any of their money or anyone else 's money either it 's not your money or our money its their money and they have an effective method to make sure it stays that way   gt btw if wanting decent opportunity to take care of me and mine is greed then yes i 'm greedy    you can already do that it 's called getting a fucking job and living within your means you do n't deserve anything in life you have to earn it no one is obligated to just give you things just because you want them ultimately this whole lets sock it to the rich attitude does n't actually take any money out of their pockets the only people harmed are workers who ca n't take advantage of the methods they use to shift income overseas in short you 're not simply wrong you 're criminally ignorant

each of us makes our own way in life making choices based upon or own needs and desires some of us choose to live simple lives others choose more complex lives where we earn and spend more there are several points which one should examine and consider consider that the market for new cars is not the entire population but only the fraction of the population that can afford to spend $ 20,000 + for a new car at $ payments you quickly realize that most people making below median income can not afford to purchase a new car they buy used cars from the pool of cars left after depreciation has reduced the price of the car by half or more one rule of thumb might be to spend < 10 of your income on transportation which might allow for a $ 400 500/month car payment for half of families and when you keep a car for 10 years that can mean two cars one payment free consider that a new honda accord or toyota camry is $ 20 30,000 which is 2/3 to 3/4 the price of a new luxury car when i purchased my used civic several years ago the price was nearly 1/2 the price of a new luxury car i recently purchased a used luxury car 7 year old 70,000 miles less than 1/3 the new price the leather interior looks new more amenities better performance than my civic the car runs well and with proper maintenance i expect to drive it for 2 3 years and pass it along to one of my children

gdp being a measurement for an economy 's growth and with the stock market being driven mostly by company profits you would expect a tight correlation between gdp growth and stock market performance after all a growing economy should lead to a corresponding increase in profit right but the stock market is heavily influenced by investor mentality irrational buying and panic selling make the stock market far more volatile than gdp ever can be just look at the 2001 bubble and 2008 panic sell off for famous examples i feel emerging markets are particularly prone to overly optimistic buying to get in on the gdp growth followed by overly pessimistic selling when politics get unfavorable also keep in mind that gdp measurements are all done after the fact the growth that is reported has already happened the stock market might have already expected the reported growth and priced it in a final point governments and companies in emerging markets have a reputation sometimes deserved of poor governance think corruption nepotism etc so even if the economy grows substantially investors might not believe they can profit from the growth   p.s. what do you base the no great increase on emerging markets have had a rough decade but that index would have still returned 9 annually if you held it since 2001

it starts here   you said you are a high earner but high is relative this tax table will show what marginal rate you have for your taxable income look at your 2015 return to get a better idea what taxable means vs gross income for starters with a standard deduction and just the two of you $ 20 k comes off your gross even so let 's assume you are in the marginal 25 bracket   the w4 form does offer instructions on how to calculate how much extra to withhold but to your point and brilliant criticism of the process withholding is not available as a percent only as normal withholding i.e. if spouse 's income were a flat predictable number or as an extra fixed number per check   you shared with us in your other question she expects to earn $ the average of these 2 numbers is $ 11 k which at 25 is $ i 'd divide that over the number of checks remaining this year 20 and just withhold that much extra use your tax software from last year or an online calculator and in 3 months see if you are on track you can adjust the w4 any time to get as close to the actual total year tax due as you 'd like my answer focuses on the adjust repeatedly part of keshlam 's own answer his quarterly payments suggestion also works and you might prefer it in general mine would only take 1 2 adjustments per year at most   if you withhold too much as most people seem to do you 'll get it back when you file but worst case you withhold $ and she makes just $ 8000 this is $ too much the average refund is over $ 3000 too little and mhoran 's answer explains when you 'd owe a penalty

in general you are expected to pay all the money you owe in taxes by the end of the tax year or you may have to pay a penalty but you do n't have to pay a penalty if the amount you owe i.e. total tax due minus what you paid in withholding and estimated taxes is less than $ 1000 you paid at least 90 of your total tax bill you paid at least 100 of last year 's tax bill i think point 3 may work for you here suppose that last year your total tax liability was say $ 5,000 this year your tax on your regular income would be $ 5,500 but you have this additional capital gain that brings your total tax to $ 6,500 if your withholding was $ 5,000 the amount you owed last year than you 'll owe the difference $ 1,500 but you wo n't have to pay any penalties if you normally get a refund every year even a small one then you should be fine i 'd check the numbers to be sure of course if you normally have to pay something every april 15 or if your income and therefore your withholding went down this year for whatever reason then you should make an estimated payment the irs has a page explaining the rules in more detail

if you 're fiscally responsible go ahead and use a   honestly in all of the horror story experiences i 've seen where someone went into honest details they were trying to skate by with risky decisions at the extreme bottom end of the financial spectrum nearly all of the complaints boil down to overdraft fees for people who run their account down to less than $ 10 and then get upset when something unexpected happens   for example when banks re order purchases from largest to smallest so that users would have to pay a larger quantity of overdraft fees that can literally only happen if you 've tried to spend more than you have in the account it 's mathematically not possible for that to happen any other way so yes i think everyone can agree re ordering is shitty but those overdrafts are also 100 preventable by not trying to spend more than you   most people just want to jump on the gripe train and they are n't going to share the real details of their situation if they even understand them

according to this post on turbotax forums you could deduct it as an unreimbursed employee expense this would seem consistent with the irs guidelines on such deductions an expense is ordinary if it is common and accepted in your trade business or profession an expense is necessary if it is appropriate and helpful to your business an expense does not have to be required to be considered necessary office rent is not listed explicitly among the examples of deductible unreimbursed employee expenses but this does n't mean it 's not allowed   of course you should check with a tax professional if you want to be sure

for a 401(k only contributions that you make for the current tax year through payroll deduction are tax deductible   those contributions are subtracted off of your income for your w-2 box 1 income amount   if you make a manual contribution to your 401(k outside of that it is not tax deductible and there is nowhere on your form 1040 to deduct it your commuter benefits are also paid for out of payroll deduction and deducted on your w-2 so this is not an option either you could contribute to a traditional ira for last year up to your tax return deadline and deduct the amount on form 1040 line 32   however because you have access to a retirement plan at work your ira contribution is only tax deductible if your income is below certain limits

there is a very simple calculation that will answer the question is the expected roi of the 401 k including the match greater than the interest rate of your credit card some assumptions that do n't affect the calculation but do help illustrate the points you have 30 years until you can pull out the 401k. your credit card interest rate is 20 compounded annually   the minimum payoffs are being disregarded because that would legally just force a certain percentage to credit card you only have $ 1000   you can either pay off your credit card or invest but not both   for most people this is n't the case   ideally you would simply forego $ 1000 worth of spending and do both   worked example pay $ 1000 in credit card debt at 20 interest    after 1 year if you pay off that debt you no longer owe $ 1200   roi = 20 duh after 30 years you no longer owe and this is pretty amazing $   roi = in all cases the roi is guaranteed invest $ 1000 in matching 401k with expected roi of 5 2a for illustration purposes let 's assume no match after 1 year you have $ 1050 $ 1000 principal $ 0 match 5 interest but you ca n't take it out roi = 5 after 30 years you have $ roi of assuming away all risk 2b then we 'll assume a 50 match after 1 year you have $ $ 1000 principle $ 500 match 5 interest but you ca n't take it out roi = 57 but you are   stuck for a bit after 30 years you have $ roi of assuming away all risk 2c finally a full match after 1 year you have $ 2100 $ 1000 principle $ 1000 match 5 interest but you ca n't take it out roi = 110 but again you are stuck after 30 years you have $ roi of assuming away all risk here 's the summary the interest rate is really all that matters   paying off a credit card is a guaranteed investment    the only reason not to pay off a 20 credit card interest rate is if after taxes time etc you could earn more than 20 somewhere else    note that at 1 year the matching funds of a 401k in all cases where the match exceeded 20 beat the credit card if you could take that money before you could have paid off the credit card it would have been a good deal the problem with the 401k is that you ca n't realize that gain until you retire credit card debt on the other hand keeps growing until you pay it off as such paying off your credit card debt assuming its interest rate is greater than the stock market which trust me it almost always is is the better deal indeed with the exception of tax advantaged mortgages there is almost no debt that has an interest rate than is better than the market

yes you should be saving for retirement there are a million ideas out there on how much is a reasonable amount but i think most advisor would say at least 6 to 10 of your income which in your case is around $ 15,000 per year you give amounts in dollars are you in the u.s. if so there are at least two very good reasons to put money into a 401k or ira rather than ordinary savings or investments a often your employer will make matching contributions 50 up to 6 of your salary is pretty common i.e. if you put in 6 they put in 3 if either of your employers has such a plan that 's an instant 50 profit on your investment b any profits on money invested in an ira or 401k are tax free effectively the mechanics differ depending on the type of account so if you put $ 100,000 into an ira today and left it there until you retire 30 years later it would likely earn something like   $ 600,000 over that time assuming 7 per year growth so you 'd pay takes on your initial $ 100,000 but none on the $ 600,000 with your income you are likely in a high tax bracket that would make a huge difference if you 're saying that you just ca n't find a way to put money away for retirement may i suggest that you cut back on your spending i understand that the average american family makes about $ 45,000 per year and somehow manages to live on that if you were to put 10 of your income toward retirement then you would be living on the remaining $ which is still almost 4 times what the average family has yeah i make more than $ 45,000 a year too and there are times when i think how could anyone possibly live on that but then i think about what i spend my money on did i really need to buy two new computer printers the last couple of months i certainly could do my own cleaning rather than hiring a cleaning lady to come in twice a month etc a tough decision to make can be paying off debt versus putting money into an investment account if the likely return on investment is less than the interest rate on the loan you should certainly concentrate on paying off the loan but if the reverse is true then you need to decide between likely returns and risk

you might want to look up dividend yield trap many stocks with high dividend yields got that way not because they decided to increase their dividend but because their prices have dropped usually the company is not in good shape and will reduce their dividend and you 're stuck with a low yield stock which has also decreased in price

the biggest question is do you want to be a landlord there are a lot of ups and down to managing property from bad tenants to having to fix a water heater or replace a fridge    if you are n't interested in being a landlord it is definitely a bad idea    if you do want to be a landlord then the question is how close do you want to be to your tenants    what if they are up late making noise etc    what if they watch tv all night and you hear it through the walls    what is your plan    you ask if people have trouble sharing a house    if you are the landlord and the other party the tenant then you are n't sharing you are leasing    it 's a different relationship with different strains

inflation is theft   it is caused when banks lend money that someone deposited but still has claim to called fractional reserve banking    on top of that the federal reserve bank in the us or the central bank of the currency i.e. bank of japan european central bank etc can increase the monetary base by writing checks out of thin air to purchase debt such as us treasury bonds inflation is not a natural phenomenon it is completely man made and is caused solely by the two methods above inflation causes the business cycle   lower interest rates caused by inflation cause long term investment even while savings is actually low and consumption is high   this causes prices to rise rapidly the boom and eventually when the realization is made that the savings is not there to consume the products of the investment you get the bust i would encourage you to read or listen to the case against the fed by murray n. great book free online or via itunes

to expand on keshlam 's answer a direct feed does not involve a website of any kind   each exchange publishes its order trade onto a packet network where subscribers have machines listening and reacting let 's call the moment when a trade occurs inside an exchange 's matching engine   an exchange then publishes the specifics of that trade as above and the moment when that information is first available to subscribers is t1   in some cases t1 is a few microseconds in other notorious cases it can be as much as 100 milliseconds longer because it 's expensive for a subscriber to run a machine on each exchange 's network and also because it requires a team of engineers devoted to understanding each exchange 's individual publication protocols it seems unlikely that google pays for direct access   instead google most likely pays another company who is a subscriber on each exchange around the world let 's say reuters to forward their incoming information to google   reuters then charges google and other customers according to how fast the customer wants the forwarded information   reuters has to parse the info it gets at t1 check it for errors and translate it into a format that google and other customers can understand   let 's say they finish all that work and put their new packets on the internet at time t2 then the slow crawl across the internet begins   some 5 100 milliseconds later your website of choice gets its pre processed data at time   even though it 's your favorite website has to unpack the data store it in some sort of database and push it onto their website at time t4 a sophisticated website might then force a refresh of your browser at time t4 to show you the new information   but this forced refresh involves yet another slow crawl across the internet from where your website is based to your home computer competing with your neighbor 's 24/7 netflix stream etc   then your browser with its 83 plugins and banner ads everywhere has to refresh and you finally see the update at so a thousand factors come into play but even assuming that google is doing the most expensive and labor intensive thing it can and that all the networks between you and google and the exchange are as short as they can be you 're not going to hear about a trade even a massive market moving trade for anywhere from 500 milliseconds to 5 seconds after   and in a more realistic world that time will be 10 30 seconds this is what google calls realtime on that disclaimer page because they feel they 're getting that info to you as fast as they possibly can for free meanwhile the computers that actually subscribe to an exchange heard about the trade way back at time t1 and acted on that information in a few microseconds   that 's almost certainly before t2 and definitely way way before   the market for a particular instrument could change direction 5 times before google even shows the first trade so if you want true realtime access you must subscribe to the exchange feed or as keshlam suggests sign up with a broker that provides its own optimized market feeds to you note this is not an endorsement of trading through brokers

when people even people in the media say the stock market is up because of x or the stock market is down because of y they are often engaging in what nicolas taleb calls the narrative they see the market has moved in one direction or another they open their newspaper pick a headline that provides a plausible reason for the market to move and say oh that is why the stock market is down very rarely do statements like this actually come from research asking people why they bought or sold that day sometimes they may be right but it is usually just story telling in terms of old fashioned logic this is called the post hoc ergo proper hoc fallacy now all the points people have raised about the us deficit may be valid and there are plenty of reasons for worrying about the future of the world economy but they were all known before the s&p report which did n't really provide the markets with much new information note also that the actual bond market did n't move much after hearing the same report in fact the price of 10 year us treasury bonds actually rose a tiny bit take these simple statements about what makes the market go up or down on any given day with several of salt

most etfs are index funds meaning you get built in diversification so that any one stock going down wo n't hurt the overall performance much you can also get essentially the same index funds by directly purchasing them from the mutual fund company to buy an etf you need a brokerage account and have to pay a transaction fee buying only $ 1000 at a time the broker transaction fee will eat too much of your money you want to keep such fees way down below 0.1 pay attention to transaction fees and fund expense ratios   or buy an equivalent index fund directly from the mutual fund company this generally costs nothing in transaction fees if you have at least the minimum account value built up if you buy every month or two you are dollar cost averaging no matter what kind of account you are using keep doing that even if the market values are going down especially if the market values are going down   if you can keep doing this then forget about certificates of deposit at current rates you can not build wealth with cds

i was recently terminated from a company that promoted its company culture as one of the of the perks there i can assure you that in many cases it is all a facade for any company claiming how amazing their culture is you can easily go to glassdoor and check out the reviews and get an idea of what the true company culture is like   at this particular company it was almost cult like in how they pushed the culture down your throats every monday was a monday and every department hold meetings after part of the was that dinner would be served every monday night catered from popular restaurants around the city most people do n't get home until 8 and most of them start 8 if you failed to show up for these 's you were an and managers often confront those that they noticed were not present    of course one of the big selling points of working at this company was the many perks they try to entice you with beer on tap on every floor free coffee and spa water tons of snacks on a weekly basis company events wellness programs etc of course they will often pay you 30 40 under the market rate for your skills in fact almost everyone i knew there have told me they took a pay cut to work for this company the company would also hold major annual corporate events namely a huge summer camp event where they will fly everyone in around from the world and spend 4 days at a weekend retreat there 's also an annual company summit where again the company flies everyone in to a location to hold a major conference all of these events however cuts into your actual vacation time as they subtract it away from your accrued vacation these events are mandatory for all employees to attend   underneath the facade of culture the management was extremely toxic if you did not drink the you were almost assuredly on your way out as this is an at will company i would often see people let go for the most stupid reasons if any were even given including myself anybody who concerns or had different ideas going against someone in charge were soon to be performance managed out of the company   i highly encourage anyone looking for a job to check out the prospective company 's glassdoor page it is a great resource and will truly give you an idea about what kind of ride you 'll be in for

right now the unrealized appreciation of vanguard tax managed    small cap fund admiral shares is of nav as long as the fund    delivers decent returns over the long term is there anything stopping    this amount from ballooning to say 90 fifty years hence i 'd have a heck of a time imagining how this grows to that high a number realistically   the inflows and outflows of the fund are a bigger question along with what kinds of changes are there to capital gains that may make the fund try to hold onto the stocks longer and minimize the tax burden if this happens wo n't new investors be scared away by the prospect of    owing taxes on these gains for example a financial crisis or a    superior new investment technology could lead investors to dump their    shares of tax managed index funds triggering enormous capital gains    distributions and if new investors are scared away wo n't the fund be    forced to sell its assets to cover redemptions even if there is no    disruptive event leading to larger capital gains distributions than    in the past possibly but you have more than a few assumptions in this to my mind that i wonder how well are you estimating the probability of this happening finally do etfs avoid this problem assuming it is a problem yes etfs have creation and redemption units that allow for in kind transactions and thus there is n't a selling of the stock   however if one wants to pull out various unlikely scenarios then there is the potential of the market being shut down for an extended period of time that would prevent one from selling shares of the etf that may or may not be as applicable as open end fund shares i would however suggest researching if there are hybrid funds that mix open end fund shares with etf shares which could be an alternative here

fyi prices do n't always go up   inflation is a monetary phenomenon   i 'm simplifying greatly here if more money is printed or the money supply increases through fractional reserve banking and it is chasing the same amount of goods then prices will go up   conversely if money is held constant and the economy becomes more productive producing more goods then a constant amount of money is chasing an increasing amount of goods and prices go down after the civil war the greenback went back to being on a gold standard in   after could be redeemed for gold   gold restricts money growth since it is difficult to obtain here are the price and wage indexes from from here   notice from to that wholesale and consumer prices fall but wages start to increase   imagine your salary staying the same or even increasing but the prices of items falling still do n't think inflation is a monetary phenomenon   here is a cpi chart from 1800 to 2007   notice how the curve starts to go drastically up around 1970   what happen then   the us dollar went off the gold exchange standard and the us dollar became a purely fiat currency backed by nothing but government decree which allows the federal reserve to print money ad

as someone who works in tech and has seen a thing or two the fallacy of moving to college towns to foster innovation is a farce the whole reason businesses do this is to get an endless supply of cheap labor from new graduates who do n't have families thus will work nights and weekends for free to make a name for themselves once those kids wise up and maybe want to start a family they move to suburbs away from these college towns and leave those companies which leads to high attrition rates for mid level employees this also leads to inferior products from a high technology standpoint because of lack of senior mentors and you end up with shit projects just slapped together that just barely work would you want your ge jet engines designed on the cheap by recent graduates or disciplined engineers i 'm not saying it 's a bad business decision it is totally valid and smart for some markets but it seems like ge has their hands in important technology that should n't be designed like this if they want to reinvent themselves why not make a boston technology center for innovation not move their whole business it just did n't make sense

prior to having children we did exactly what you describe   we would visit my mother in law about four to six times a year a each way trip for a weekend   we 'd simply rent a car drive down drive back return it out $ 150 or so for the weekend a total of under $ 1000 a year far cheaper than owning you should factor in whether you will save money though on things you might not immediately consider   will you spend less on groceries in particular if you can drive to costco or sam 's club or even just to a regular grocery store   i doubt you 'll save the cost of the car $ as you say but it 's possible it will factor into the mix i definitely would discourage purchasing a new car if you 're considering the financial side primarily   i suspect you can get a used car maybe the $ 10k car you would've sold and spend more like $ 1000 a year on it or less   i do n't know if i 'd go to the $ 5000 level as those in comments suggested as if you 're doing long trips you want something with higher than average reliability but even a car like a 5 year old mid level sedan easily costing you less than $ 10k would be fine and likely sell in 5 years for $ 5k itself while hopefully not having too much maintenance especially if you choose something with lower mileage shop around   but even with those assumptions 20 days a year of rental which you can probably get less than $ 50 rates on particularly if you look at some of the car sharing options and enterprise both allow you to do longer term rentals for reasonable prices seems like a fine deal compared to the hassle of owning

credit score is rather misleading each provider of credit uses their own system to decide if they wish to lend to you    they will also not tell you how the combine all the factoring together closing unused account is good as it reduced the risk of identity theft and you have less paperwork to deal with it looks good if a company that knows you will agrees to give you more credit as clearly they think you are a good risk having more total credit allowed on account is bad as you may use it and not be able to pay all your bills using all your credit is bad as it looks like you are not in control using a pay day lender is very bad as only people that are out of control do so credit cards should be used for short term credit paying them off in full most months but it is ok to take advantage of some interest free credit

no it 's perhaps a bit obvious but with the shorter term loan you would be contractually obligated to pay the higher monthly payment by paying double on the longer loan you retain the flexibility to pay less and you would pay less interest if you truly doubled your payment on the longer loan this is because you 'd be paying off more of the principal more quickly but you 'd also be making a slightly higher payment than on the shorter term loan you can play with the amortization calculator at bankrate to understand this

in this case the market interest rate is the discount rate that sets equal the market price current value of the bond to its present value to find the market interest rate which is also referred to as promised yield ytm you would have solve for the interest rate in the bond price formula a market price of bond is the sum of discounted coupons and the terminal value of the bond most spreadsheet programs and calculators have a rate function that makes possible finding this market interest rate first see this for finding a coupon paying bond price the coupon payments are discounted so is the par value of the bond and sum of such discounts is the market price of the bond the tvm functions in excel and calculators make this possible using the following equation let us take your data 9 $ 100,000 coupon with 5 years remaining to maturity with market interest rate of 10 bonds issued in the us mostly pay two coupons per year thus we are finding the present value of 10 coupons each worth $ 4500 and par value of $ 100,000 the semi annual market interest rate is or 5 the negative sign indicate money going out of hand now solving for rate is only possible using numerical methods and the rate function is programmed using newton method to find one of the roots of the bond price equation this rate will be the periodic rate in this case semi annual rate which you have to multiply by 2 to get the annual rate do remember there is a difference between annual nominal rate and an annualized effective rate to find the market interest rate   if you do n't have excel or a financial calculator then you may opt to use my version of these financial functions in this javascript library

tl;dr sure do your own homework is sometimes a cop out but that does n't mean we should n't do our homework i agree that in many cases this is a cop out by commentators however even if you believe in perfect market efficiency there is benefit in doing your homework for many reasons one of which you already mention in the question different stocks all with the same value might have widely ranging risk another factor that might vary between stocks is their tax consequences high dividend stocks might be a better fit for some buyers than others one stock might be priced at $ 40 because there is a small chance they might get regulatory approval for a new product this might make this stock very risky with a 20 of being $ 150 in 12 months and a 80 chance of being $ 20 another stock might be priced at $ 40 because the company is a cash cow declining in revenues but producing a large dividend of $ 0.40 per quarter low risk but also with some potential tax disadvantages another stock might be priced at $ 40 because it 's a high growth stock this would be less risky than the first example but more risky than the second example and the risk would be more generalized i.e. there would n't be one day or one event that would be make or break the stock in short even if we assume that the market is pricing everything perfectly not all stocks are equal and not all stocks are equally appropriate to everyone sometimes when we hear an analyst say they should have done their homework they are really saying this was a high risk high reward stock they should have known that this had a potential downside and that all assumes that we believe in 100 pure market efficiency which many disagree with at least to some extent for example if we instead subscribe to peter lynch 's theories about local knowledge we might believe that everyone has some personal fields of expertise where they know more than the experts a professional stock analyst is going to follow many stocks and many not have technical experience in the field of the company this is especially true of small and mid cap stocks if you happen to be an expert in led lighting it is entirely feasible at least to me that you could be able to do a better job of doing homework on than the analysts or if you use a specialized piece of software from a small vendor at work and you know that the latest version stinks then you will likely know more than the analyst does i think it is somewhat akin to going to a doctor we could say to ourselves the doctor is more knowledgeable about me than medicine i 'm just going to do what they tell me to do and 99 of the time that is the right thing to do but if we do our homework anyway and research the symptoms diagnoses and drugs ourselves as well we can do get benefits sometimes we just can express our preferences amongst equal solutions sometimes we can ask smarter questions and sometimes we have some piece of knowledge that the doctor does n't have and can actually make an important discovery they did n't know and just like investing sometimes we can also have just enough knowledge to be dangerous and do ourselves harm if we go against the advice of the professionals

if you are in an economy which has a decent liquid debt market corporate bonds etc then you may look into investing in aa or rated bonds they can provide higher returns than bank deposits and are virtually risk free though in severe economic downturns you can see defaults in even very high rated bonds leading to partial or complete loss of value however this is statistically quite rare you can make this investment through a debt mutual fund but please make sure that you read through the offer document carefully to understand the investment style of the mutual fund and their expense ratio which directly affect your returns in any case it is always recommended to reach out to an investment adviser who is good with local tax laws to minimize taxes and maximize returns

the way to think about this is what would happen to the family if stay at home mom were to die you obviously ca n't do anything about the loss grief and trauma but think about the financial implications assuming that dad continues to work and that the child is young you are going to have to find someone to take care of him her if you have relatives willing to step in that may be fine but if not you will have to pay for daycare an expense you do n't now have that 's going to get less as the child goes to school but not go away until he she is old enough to look after themselves bringing up a child as well as working a full time job is pretty demanding you may find that you do n't have as much time for cleaning the house cooking or other chores having a sum of money which can be used to hire help or pay for a few meals out can be very useful in these cases here is an article which places a value on the work done by a stay at home mom you might not need to pay for all of those services but it gives you an idea of what the extra expenses might be   think about what extra money you might need to spend and arrange for life insurance to cover it

you 're not responsible for the mortgages on the property those are agreements between the lender and the borrower the risk you have is that the title search missed something   if the seller i.e. the bank or banks who foreclosed did not have full rights to sell the property and there was another party who had a lien on the property or had an interest in it in some fashion that party could make a claim that would interfere with your purchase   you would n't be responsible for the loan but you might not end up with the title to the property if that happened

when you invest in a single index security you are completely exposed to the risk of that security diversification means spreading the investments so the losses on one side can be compensated by the gains on the other side what you are talking about is one thing called risk more formally known as risk tolerance risk tolerance is the degree of variability in investment returns that an investor is willing to withstand emphasis added this means that you are willing to accept some losses in order to get a potential bigger return fidelity has this graph   as you can see in the table above the higher the risk tolerance the bigger the difference between the best and worst values that is the variability the right most pie can be one example of an agressive diversified portfolio but this does not mean you should go and buy exactly that security high risk means playing with fire unless you are a professional playing with fire usually leaves people burnt in a financial context this usually means the money is gone recommended reading investopedia risk and diversification the risk reward tradeoff investopedia how to construct a high risk portfolio fidelity guide to diversification kpmg understanding and risk appetite pdf

first excellent choice to say no to non subsidized loans but i 'd say you are cutting things very close either way and you need to face up to that now   $ extra at the end of the month is within the noise of financial life meaning you should think of it as essentially $ 0 each month or even negative money since one vet bill school books unforeseen problem could remove it for the entire year easily   you are leaving yourself no buffer but by taking the loan unless you are as joe said socking away savings to pay for it upon graduation you are guaranteeing you 'll leave college with debt which i think should be avoided if you can   could you do a hybrid plan in which you worked hard to do the following if you do these things or something along these lines the loan is probably ok if not i 'd be concerned about taking it probably unnecessary but keep in mind that student loans are not by bankruptcy so one is on the hook for them no matter what also consider whether you can take a semester off now and then to catch up financially   the key is to really stay far from the edge of any financial

my perspective is from the us many employers offer 401(k)s and you can always contribute to an ira for either tax deferred or tax free investment growth if you 're company offers a 401(k match you should always contribute the maximum amount they max or you 're leaving money on the table     companies ca n't always support pensions and it is n't the best idea to rely on one entirely for retirement unless your pension is from the federal government    even states such as illinois are going through extreme financial difficulties due to pension funding issues it 's only going to get worse and if you think pension benefit accrual is n't going to be cut eventually you 'll have another thing coming i 'd be worried if i was a state employee in the middle of my career with no retirement savings outside of my pension    ranting employees pushed hard for some pretty absurd commitments and public officials let the public down by giving in it seems a little crazy to me that someone can work for the state until they 're in their 50 's and then earn 70 of their 6 figure salary for the rest of their life something needs to be done but i 'd be surprised if anyone has the political will to make tough choices now before thee options get much much worse and these states are forced to make a decision

disclaimer this should go without saying but this answer is definitely an opinion i 'm pretty sure my current accountant would agree with this answer and i 'm also pretty sure that one of my past accountants would disagree when i started my own small business over 10 years ago i asked this very same question for pretty much every purchase i made that would be used by both the business and me personally i was and naive then and i just assumed everything was deductible until my accountant could prove otherwise at some point you need to come up with some rules of thumb to help make sense of it or else you 'll drive yourself and your accountant here is one of the rules i like to use in this scenario if you never would have made the purchase for personal use and if you    must purchase it for business use and if using    it for personal use does not increase the expense to the business it    can be fully deducted by the business even if you sometimes use it personally too here are some example implementations of this rule note about partial expenses i did n't mention partial deductions above because i do n't feel it applies when the criteria of my rule of thumb is met note that the irs states personal versus business expenses generally you can not deduct personal living or family expenses however if you have an expense for something that is used partly for business and partly for personal purposes divide the total cost between the business and personal parts you can deduct the business part at first read that makes it sound like some of my examples above would need to be split into partial however i think the key distinction is that you would never have made the purchase for personal use and that the cost to the business does not increase because of allowing personal use partial deductions come into play when you have a shared car or office or something where the business cost is increased due to shared use in general i try to avoid anything that would be a partial expense though i do allow my business to reimburse me for mileage when i lend it my personal car for business use

you talk about an individual not being advised to sell or purchase in response to trends in the market in such a buy and hold strategy but think of this for a moment you buy stock abc for $ 10 when both the market as a whole and stock abc are near the bottom of a bear market as say part of a value buying strategy you 've now held stock abc for a number of years and it is performing well hitting $ 50 there is all good news about stock abc profit increases year after year in double digits would you consider selling this stock just because it has increased 400 it could start falling in a general market crash or it could keep going up to $ 100 or more maybe a better strategy to sell abc would be to place a trailing stop of say 20 on the highest price reached by the stock so if abc falls say in a general market correction by less than 20 off its high and then rebounds and goes higher you keep it if abc however falls by more than 20 off its high you automatically sell it with your stop loss order you may give 20 back to the market if the market or the stock crashes but if the stock continues going up you benefit from more upside in the price take aapl as an example if you bought aapl in march 2009 after the gfc for about $ 100 would you have sold it in december 2011 when it hit $ 400 if you did you would have left money on the table if instead you placed a trailing stop loss on aapl of 20 you would have been still in it when it hit its high of $ in september 2012 you would have finally been stopped out in november 2012 for around the $ 560 mark and made an extra $ 160 per share and if your thinking how about if i decided to sell aapl at $ 700 well i do n't think many would have picked $ 700 as the high in hindsight the main benefit of using stop losses is that it takes your emotions out of your trading especially your exits

you are not actually entitled to any raise at all unless you had something contractually legally binding which made that so i 'm answering this from the uk but it has been common practice for people over the last 10 years or so to receive no yearly raise in some sectors this is what i would consider a bad raise if wages are not kept in line with inflation you are effectively earning less every year in this regard i would not work for any employer who did not offer an annual raise that was at the very least covering the rate of inflation these rates are easy to find in your country by googling it in terms of a standard raise i would argue there is no such thing this depends on the industry sector you work in your employers opinion of your performance note i 've used the word opinion because sometimes you may think the effort you put in is different to what they think be prepared to give evidence of what you 've achieved for them with things to back it up a good raise is anything which is way above a standard raise since there is no concise of a standard raise this is also hard to quantify as others have mentioned do not stay in a role where you are not being given a raise that covers inflation because it means every year you have less purchasing power which is akin to your salary going down it 's very easy to justify to an employer you 're leaving and indeed one you 're going to why you 're making the move under these conditions

bonds might not be simple but in general there are only a few variables that need to be understood bid coupon interest rate maturity and yield   bond tables clearly lay those out and if you 're talking about government bonds a lot of things like do n't apply although default is still a concern this might be overly simplistic but i view etf 's primarily as an easy way to bring somewhat esoteric instruments like grain futures into the easily available markets of nasdaq and the nyse that they got enhanced with leveraged funds and the such is interesting but perhaps not the original intent of the instrument   complicating your situation a bit more is the fee that gets tacked onto the etf even vanguard government bond funds hang out north of 0.1 that 's not huge but it 's not particularly appealing either considering that unlike rounding up live cattle futures it 's not that much work to buy us government bonds so the expense might not seem worth it to someone who 's comfortable purchasing the securities directly   i 'd be interested to see someone else 's view on this but in general i 'd say that if you know what you want and know how to buy it the government bond etf becomes a lot less relevant as the liquidity offered including the actual ease of transacting seem to to be the biggest factors in favor from investopedia 's description the bond etf is an exciting new addition to the bond market offering    an excellent alternative to self directed investors who looking for    ease of trading and increased price transparency want to practice    indexing or active bond trading however bond etfs are suitable for    particular strategies if for instance you are looking to create a    specific income stream bond etfs may not be for you be sure to    compare your alternatives before investing

they are basically asking for the name of the legal entity that they should write on the check you as a person are a legal entity and so you can have them pay you directly by name this is in effect a sole proprietorship arrangement and it is the situation of most independent contractors you 're working for yourself and you get all the money but you also have all the responsibility you can also set up a legal alias or a doing business as dba name the only thing that changes versus using your own name is well that you are n't using your own name to be honest you pay some trivial fee for the paperwork to the county clerk or other office of record and you 're now not only john doe you 're enterprises and your business checks can be written out to that name and the bank who will want a copy of the dba paperwork to file when you set the name up as a payable entity on the account will cash them for you an llc since it was mentioned is a limited liability company it is a legal entity that is your in the business world it not you is the entity that primarily faces anyone else in that world you become for legal purposes an agent of that company authorized to make decisions on its behalf you can do all the same things make all the same money but if things go pear shaped the company is the one liable not you sounds great right well there 's a downside and that 's taxes and the increased complexity thereof depending on the exact structure of the company the irs will treat the llc either as a corporation a partnership or as a disregarded entity most one man llcs are typically disregarded meaning that for tax purposes all the money the company makes is treated as if it were made by you as a sole proprietor as in the above cases and with the associated increased fica and lack of tax deductions that an employee would get nothing can be retained by the company because as far as the irs is concerned it does n't exist so whether the money from the profits of the company actually made it into your personal checking account or not it has to be reported by you on the schedule c. you can elect if you wish to have the llc treated as a corporation this allows the corporation to retain earnings and thus to own liquid assets like cash as opposed to only fixed assets like land cars etc it also allows you to be an employee of your own company and pay yourself a true salary with all the applicable tax rules including pre tax healthcare employer paid fica etc however the downside here is that some money is subject to double taxation any monies retained by the company or paid out to members as dividends is profit of the company for which the company is taxed at the corporate rate then the money from that dividend you receive from the company is taxed again at the capital gains rate on your own 1040 return this also means that you have to file taxes twice once for the corporation once for you as the individual you ca n't of course have it both ways with an llc you ca n't pay yourself a true salary and get the associated tax breaks then receive leftover profits as a distribution and avoid double taxation it takes multiple members owners to have the llc treated like a partnership and there are specific types of llcs set up to handle investments where some of what i 've said above does n't apply i wo n't get into that because the question inferred a single owner situation but the tax rules in these additional situations are again different

with my current limited knowledge see end i understand it the following way are share prices really described as memoryless   yes   is there a    technical meaning of the term what does it really mean the meaning comes from markov models think of the behavior of the stock market over time as a markov chain i.e. a probabilistic model with states and probabilistic transitions a state is the current price of all stocks of the market a transition is a step in time memoryless means that transitions that the stock market might make can be modelled by a relation from one state to another i.e. it only depends on the current state the model is a markov chain as opposed to a more general stochastic process where the next state depends on more than the current state so in a markov chain all the history of one stock is encoded already in its current price more precisely in all stock 's prices   the of stocks is the main statement of the efficient market theory emt if a company 's circumstances do n't change then a drop in its share price is going to be followed by a rise later   so if the emt holds your statement above is not necessarily true i personally belief the emt is a good approximation only large corporations e.g. renaissance technologies have enough hundreds of mathematicians billions of $ to be able to leverage tiny non random movements that stem from a not completely random mostly chaotic market   the prices can of course change when the company 's circumstances change but they are n't memoryless either a company 's future state is influenced by its past in the emt a stock 's future state is only influenced by its past as much as is encoded in its current price more precisely the complete market 's current state whether that price was reached by a drop or a rise makes no difference   the above is my believe but i 'm by far no finance expert i am working professionally with probabilistic models but have only read one book on finance kommer 's mit und etfs it 's supposed to contain many statements of malkiel 's a random walk down wall street

there is no way to stop any merchant from setting a recurring charge flag on a purchase according to the following article mastercard and visa encourages merchants to use this feature and even give them a better rate i have found it impossible to stop these unauthorized transactions   the article sites that the merchant is allowed to march the charges across expired cards to find a good card that you might have as well as the article states they can cross banks to find you if you have the same type of card virtual account numbers will not protect you sorry but the only solution i have found is to close the account with the bank and move to a different type of card mastercard to visa or vice versa this will only protect you for one move because if you have to do this again merchants that you thought were forgotten even years later will find you and post a charge legally virtual numbers from mastercard or visa wo n't stop them    i believe this is the number one reason for credit card fraud for consumers there is no reason for a merchant to let anyone off the hook when the credit card company will side with them   the article below does state that mastercard does have a stop recurring payment flag   apparently no csr i have talked to knows about it when i have asked to get a problem fixed i have found that the only way to stop these charges from happening is to close all my visa and mastercard credit cards pay with a check that you write and mail or a paypal one time payment that is sent to pay for an invoice    recurring credit card charges may consumers

in the netherlands specifically there are several reasons to pay extra off on your mortgage first house prices have dropped significantly in the last several years   they are rising slowly now but it 's region specific and you can still borrow more than 100 of the price of the house   under these conditions if you choose to sell your house and the outstanding mortgage amount is greater than the value of your house you are left with a gap to finance   i think the rules have changed recently around this allowing you to finance this gap with a new mortgage but this is not a good idea   the tax implications of this are likely to be complicated in the long run and your new house may not cover this gap for some time second the less you owe on your house the lower mortgage rates you can get   mortgages in the netherlands usually fall into categories based on percentage of the auction price at a foreclosure sale   if you pay more of your mortgage off you may qualify for a lower interest rate possibly making refinancing interesting   this is especially important if interest rates continue to drop but the value of your house does not increase or even decreases third if you choose to keep your house and rent it out the banks in the netherlands have very strict rules on this if you want to do it above board   i 've read that some banks require the mortgage amount nb not the value you may have built up in a linked savings or insurance account to be less than 50 of the foreclosure auction price   also related to point 2 if you have something other than a linear or annuity mortgage you will need to refinance to do this as the tax advantages around savings mortgages do not apply if it is not used as your own residence finally if you choose to sell and you are in the happy position of having the value of your house be greater than the value of your mortgage you have an there may still be some obstacles   any value you have accumulated in a linked savings or life insurance account is not available until after you sell your house   extra value derived purely from the difference between mortgage value and sale price may be easier to deal with edit as a final note i 've made extra payments on both a linked life insurance and a linked savings account   in one the principal paid each month reduced and the mortgage lifetime stayed the same   in the other the principal paid each month stayed the same and the lifetime reduced   in both cases interest payments were less each month   i would contact your mortgage provider to understand what the expected impact of extra payments will be

i still think it will be rather difficult best bet is to call around to the five or so closest dealers and express you are considering the car contingent on price not payment ask for them to send you their best out the door price on a base model then when you get quotes from each of them shop the lowest price around usually dealers will budge a few hundred bucks to beat other dealers    but a 2018 will be difficult if not impossible to negotiate a few grand under msrp understand that the people that buy this car are not doing so because it is a great bargain so dealers can usually push this car at or near msrp    lastly do not set foot in a dealership until you have a firm out the door price they will play sales tricks until you give up on negotiation and will pay anything just to get out of there the only time you should go to the location is to sign papers and drive away with the car do not worry about being nice and with the salesperson    this advice got me my current vehicle at about 15 below the lowest true car estimate i do n't claim this is the best advice out there but it works

there seems to be a gap in the internal logic of this story   gt some enterprising person maybe the merchant who runs the trading post comes up with the idea to just issue one note for all the farms in town he calls a meeting with all the farmers and proposes to have the town priest keep a book of certificates and so on and the farmers will get notes just like everyone else in exchange for the crops they contribute to the pool and the merchant will keep a cut of the crops with which to hire some accountants and farm to estimate the total crop yields across town and so on   gap   gt everyone agrees or at least enough farmers agree to kind of force the other ones to get on board if they want to participate meaningfully in the town economy and we now have something like a central bank issuing something like fiat currency that is currency whose value is decided by some central authority as opposed to the kind of straight up exchange certificates that can be traded for an actual apple from the issuer for example   we went from a system where the underlying product apples could actually be obtained to a system in which the underlying product apparently can not be obtained leaving only derivative if that markets of people swapping notes for other products and services   do you mean to say the enterprising person simply ended the ability to get apples and switched cold turkey to a new system in which the underlying product either does not exist or is not redeemable

for scoring purposes having a dti between 1 19 is ideal   from credit karma   that being said depending on the loan type you looking at receiving fha va conventional etc there are certain max that you want to stay away from as a rule for va you want to try to stay away from 41 dti exceptions are made for people with sufficient funds in the bank 3 9 months to go to higher if you keep a 19 utilization overall that will get you a higher score but it will also show that you have a monthly payment on a particular revolving credit account while the difference between and seems like a lot of points there are rules as to how the interest rates are determined so you will find that many banks have the same or similar rates due to recent legislation in dodd frank in the days of subprime mortgages this was not the case adjustable rate mortgages did not necessarily go away the servicer just has to make sure that the buyer can weather the full amount once it reaches maturity not the lower amount that is what got a lot of people in trouble from how interest rates are set before quoting you an interest rate the loan officer will add on how    much he and his branch want to earn the branch or company sets a    policy on how little that can be the minimum amount the loan officer    adds on to his cost but does not want to overcharge borrowers either    so they set a maximum the loan officer can charge between that    minimum and maximum the loan officer has a great deal of flexibility for example say the loan officer decides he and his branch are going    to earn one point when you call and ask for a rate quote he will add    one point to the cost of the loan and quote you that rate according    to the rate sheet above seven percent will cost you zero points six    and three quarters percent will cost you one point in our example at the loan officer and branch would earn one    point and have some money left over this could be used to pay some of    the fees processing documents etc which is how you get a no fees    points mortgage you just pay a higher interest rate where this scoring helps you is in credit card interest rates and auto loan and personal loan rates which have different rate structures   my personal opinion is to avoid the use of the credit cards playing games to try to maximize your score in this situation wo n't help you when you are talking about 20 points potentially if you were at the bottom level and were trying to meet a minimum score to qualify then i would recommend you try to game this scoring system take the extra money you would put on a credit card and save it for housing expenses taking the dave ramsey approach you should have at least $ 1000 in emergency funds as most problems you encounter will be less than $ 1000 that advice rings true

someone posted a very insightful article on reddit a while back that basically explained the whole cable pricing model and why a la carte would n't work or would be so prohibitively expensive that nobody would go for it    iirc the breakdown was that basically a few super popular channels and live sports in the standard $ 100/mo package helped subsidize the rest of the less popular channels       most of the niche channels probably could n't exist in an a la carte environment unless they were ridiculously cheap and if they were ridiculously cheap they would n't be able to generate enough revenue to stay afloat    also how would the pricing work   could i subscribe to amc for 1 hour a week to watch mad men   or would i be locked into subscribing for a minimum of a day week month       imho what makes more sense is to allow people to subscribe to individual shows like rss feeds

gt;now if we convert the average income in 1965 into today 's dollars we get an average salary of $ pretty low right well today in the year 2012 the average income is somewhere around $ which means that over almost half century the average income grew by a mere 35 or only $ 11,000   in some ways it 's actually a lot worse than that   the numbers you cite are gross average income   first of all the average part is a problem since outliers greatly affect it one ought to be looking at median income   and second the fact that it is gross income before taxes rather that net income after taxes this is really critical when you look not at income taxes but rather payroll taxes and the rate changes over the years while in 1965 the payroll tax was all of total it was essentially doubled to 7.65 by 1990 and actually 15.3 if you include the employer contribution   and of course many other taxes have increased as percentages during those same years back in 1965 sales taxes were either minimal say 1 or non existent whereas now most states tax sales at somewhere between 5 and 10   but at the same time it is actually a lot better than the raw numbers make it seem   that many goods especially electronics related have continued to become cheaper even in nominal unadjusted dollars and in conjunction with that lower price much more widely available    in part that was due to continued productivity increases in farming and manufacturing and lower in real inflation adjusted terms cost of energy plus of course integrated and computers dramatically improved efficiency of operations in everything from the of cad to the mundane aspects of tracking amp controlling inventories so all hail to farmers to oil and to moore 's law else you probably would n't be able to afford a color tv much less a computer video game dvd player and many of the rest of the relatively affordable amenities including non electronic things that have been made cheaper and more widely available due to the use of computers in business amp industry that make life today more enjoyable than it was circa 1965

outstanding principal balance is the amount you owe at any given time not including the amount of interest you need to pay as soon as possible the capitalized interest shown is consistent with an average of 13.5 months between when each dollar is borrowed and when the repayment period begins suppose you borrow the first half of the money on september 1 2017 and the second half of the money on february 1 2017 5 months later   at that point half the money has been accruing interest for 5 months   on january 1 2018 half the money accrued interest for 16 months and half the money accrued interest for 11 months   the lender now expects you to start repaying the loan with the first payment due at the end of january 2018 or the beginning of february 2018   if you make the minimum payments on time the lender expects you to make 120 monthly payments   the last monthly payment would be at the end of december or the beginning of january the lender or the website should provide details about the actual payment plan grace periods provisions for handling inability to pay due to unemployment and other terms in the united states most installment loans pretend that for purposes of calculating interest every month has 30 days even february and july   each month 1/12 of the annual percentage rate apr is charged as interest   if you do the compounding a 6.8 percent apr corresponds to 1 + 1 = percent annual percentage yield apy also the apr is understated   the 6.8 percent applies to the full balance including the loan fees even though the borrower only gets the amount minus the loan fees   the 6.8 percent rate is useful for doing calculations after the loan fees have been charged though   these calculations include the capitalized interest and the monthly payment amounts a true calculation of the apr would take the loan fees into account and give a higher number than 6.8 percent   but the corrected apr would not be useful for calculating the capitalized interest nor for calculating the monthly payment amounts

did you get an option contingency this is usually part and parcel with getting a home inspection you negotiate a nominal fee like $ 100 that gives you the option to back out of the deal for any reason at all within x days typically 7 calendar days this is usually the time you schedule the home inspection and figure out what needs repairing if you 're still in your option window then yes you can back out and get your earnest money back from escrow the seller keeps your option fee it can be credited to your portion of closing costs if you were to go forward if you are not in an option period because it 's expired or you did n't get one you can still back out but unless you 're covered by another contract contingency that would apply such as financing or appraisal the bank may not be able to underwrite the property even after agreed repairs you default and typically lose your earnest money technically the seller could hold you to strict performance and force you to the closing table but that requires going to court and it 's almost never heard of just taking the earnest money and putting the house back on the market is the easier route for everyone

the value of the car is only of interest if there is an intention to sell it i would make the following calculation this gives you the costs per time period that the car really costs you now do the same with a new used car you intend to buy instead of this car with the new car you also need to add the costs of buying it sales price plus any interests and fees if you finance it   if the old car costs you less than the new car keep it otherwise get the new car

here are my re run figures   not counting capital gains taxes i calculate you need to be making per annum or per month on your $ 8,000 investment to break even on the loan   it 's interesting that the return you need to gain to break even is less than the interest you 're paying even with commission   it happens because the investment is gaining a return on an increasing amount while the load is accruing interest on a decreasing amount     ref r logarithmic return

on blackrock 's page under key facts it says the number of holdings as 1 looking at the top 10 holdings shows efa as the number 1 holding with a 101 weighting is ishares msci eafe index etf cad hedged so it takes the underlying component and hedges it to cad   the underlying component is an etf itself efa so they only need to hold that one component since that is the msci eafe index etf how is it possible to hold over 100 take a look at the full list of holdings   while efa is the only underlying security e.g. etf stock bond the remaining holdings looks to be 133 remaining holdings are cash positions   some of those positions are negative for hedge purposes   because of this the total value of the portfolio is less than the position of efa itself since total value is efa plus a bunch of negative entries because the total value is less than efa itself efa has a > 100 weighting

there 's an old adage in the equities business buy on rumor sell on fact   sometimes the strategy is to buy as soon as the rumor is out about a potential merger and then sell off into the news when it is actually announced since this is normally when the biggest bounce occurs as part of a merger the other part of the analysis you should do is to understand which of the companies benefits most or is hurt the worst by the merger and then make your play accordingly   sometimes the company being acquired will see a bounce while the acquiring firm takes a hit which is an indication the experts think the acquisition will be a drag on the acquiring company perhaps because it is taking on a great deal of debt to make the acquisition or because the acquiring firm is paying too much of a premium for what it 's getting in return   other times the exact opposite is true where the company being acquired takes a hit while the buyer bounces and again the reasons for this can vary widely if you wait until the merger is actually announced then by the time you get in most of the premium from the announcement will likely have already been realized and you 'll be buying near the top of the market for the stock   the key is to be ahead of the other sellers by seeing the opportunities before they do and then knowing when to get out before everyone else does   not an easy thing to pull off when you 're trying to anticipate the markets but it can be done if you do the right research and have patience good luck

wikipedia has a nice list of currencies that use cents and currencies that use 1/100th division that is not called cent cent means 100 in latin and french and probably all the roman family of languages so if the currency is divided by 100 it will likely to be called cent or something similar in the local language the list of currencies on the same page where it is not the case is significantly shorter and includes countries with relatively ancient currency units that were invented before the introduction of the decimal system even though now they are in fact decimal they still kept the old names like the british pence or the russian the point is that dollar and cent are not directly related many currencies that are not called dollar are using cents as well euro among others it just means 1/100th and it is safe to assume that most if not all of the modern currencies are divided into 1/100th

target date funds automatically change their diversification balance over time rebalancing and new contributions to become progressively more protective of what you 've already earned as opposed to other funds which continue to maintain the same balance of investments until you explicitly move the money around you can certainly make that same evolution manually we all used to do that before target funds were made available and many of us still do so i 'm still handling the relative allocations by hand but i 'm also close to my retirement target so a target fund would n't be changing that much more anyway and since i 'm already tracking the curve note that if you feel a bit or a bit more cautious than the average investor the target fund was designed for you can tweak the risk benefit curve of a target date fund by selecting a fund with a target date a bit later or earlier respectively than the date at which you intend to start pulling money back out of the fund

there are several ways you can get out of paying your student loans back in the usa you become disabled and the loan is dismissed once verified by treating doctor or the social security administration you become a peace officer you become a teacher generally k-12 but i have heard from the doe that teachers at state schools qualify as well so the malicious friend b is to the theory that if one of those conditions becomes true friend a will not have to pay back the loan the longer you drag it out the more chance you have to fulfill a condition given that 2 of these methods require a commitment my guess is that they are thinking more along the lines of the first one which is horrible financially it makes no sense to delay paying back your loans because deferred loans are only interest free until you graduate and are past your grace period after which they will begin accruing interest unsubsidized loans accrue interest from the day you get them only their payback is deferred until you graduate and exhaust your grace period anytime you ask for forbearance you are still accruing interest and it is capitalizing into your principal you are just given a chance to delay payback due to financial hardship bad health or loss of job therefore at no point are you benefiting beyond the time you are in school and getting an education still looking for a job or dealing with health issues in the current market no cd no savings account and no investment will give you substantially more return that will offset the loss of the interest you are accruing even those of us in the old days getting rates would not do this there was a conditional consolidation offer the doe allowed which could bring all your loans under one roof for a competitive rate allowing you a single payment but even then you would benefit if you had rates that were substantially higher from a credit worthiness aspect you are hurt by the outstanding obligation and any default along the way so you really want to avoid that paying off or down your loans are a good way to ensure you do n't shoot yourself in the foot

here 's an excerpt from the charles schwab website which i think will help evaluate your position the simple answer to your question is no the value of a gift of stock    for gift tax liability is not the donor 's cost basis but rather the    fair market value of the stock at the time the gift is given so let 's    say you purchased 100 shares of xyz stock at $ 50 a share your cost    basis is $ 5,000 now the stock is $ 80 a share and you give it as a    gift the value of your gift for gift tax purposes is $ 8,000 in 2015 you can give up to $ 14,000 to an unlimited number of    individuals each year without paying a gift tax or even reporting the    gifts if you give over that amount to any individual however you    must report the gift on your tax return but you do n't have to pay    taxes until you give away more than the current lifetime limit of    $ the amount above and beyond $ 14,000 per person per    year so in the example above there would be no gift tax liability    however if the stock happened to be $ 150 a share the value of the    gift would be $ 15,000 you 'd then have to report it and $ 1,000 would    be applied toward your $ lifetime exclusion you will need to pay a gift tax on the current value of the stock i 'm not familiar with the tax laws in india but if your brother was in the us he would n't pay taxes on that gift until he sells the stock the recipient does n’t have to worry about gift taxes it 's when the    recipient decides to sell the stock that the issue of valuation comes    up for income taxes and this is where things can get a bit more    complicated in general when valuing a gift of stock for capital gains tax    liability it 's the donor 's cost basis and holding period that rules    as an example let 's say you receive a gift of stock from your    grandfather he bought it for $ 10 a share and it 's worth $ 15 a share    on the day you receive it if you then sell the stock whether for a    gain or a loss your cost basis will be the same as your    grandfather ’s $ 10 per share sell it at $ 25 and you 'll pay tax at    the short- or long term rate depending on how long he owned the    stock on a gain of $ 15 a share sell it at $ 8 and your capital loss    will be $ 2 a share ultimately with a gift this large that also crosses international borders you really should hire a professional who is experienced with these types of transactions their fees commission will be completely offset by the savings in risk and paperwork

the first two answers to this are very good but i feel like there are a couple of points they left out that were a little too long for comments first off take a look at the expense percentage the load fees and the average turnover ratio for the funds in your retirement account assuming they are mutual funds having low expense fees < 1 preferably and turnover ratios will help tremendously because those eat into returns whether the value of the fund goes up or down the load fees either incoming or outgoing will lower the amount of money you actually put in and get out of the fund there are thousands of no load funds and most that have a backend load for taking the money out have clauses that lower that percentage to zero over several years it is mostly there to keep people from trying to swing trade with mutual funds and pull their money out too quickly   the last thing i would suggest is to look at diversifying the holdings in your account bond funds have been up this year even though the stock market has done poorly and they provide interest income that can increase the amount of shares you own even when the value of the bonds might have gone down

i think you might be asking the wrong question you have plenty of capital on the side that can be invested instead of asking whether you should get an adviser you might want to examine what your end goal is are you looking to build long term growth of you capital are you asking about and adviser because you do n't want to handle your money or is it simply because that 's what people do i would imagine that the answer to 1 is yes and that the answer to 2 is that you want to handle your money and you always considered this something best left to the advisers i shall proceed on these hypothetical assumptions in my humble opinion i would do the following skip the adviser and the fees that go with it for a young professional like yourself especially with an engineering background you can certainly handle the education required to learn the mechanics of investing invest some time to learn the fundamentals of the market such as asset classes basic terminology ect you will benefit in several ways for one you will learn an invaluable skill and save tens of thousands in fees during your lifetime moreover you will have complete control of your risk profile allocation and every penny that belongs to you i really am not bashing advisers but no one will care as much about your money as you will and do n't be fooled the market is efficient an adviser does not have any more edge in a market than anyone else and from first hand experience they rarely outperform benchmarks net of fees i assume you have made it to this step because you want to manage your own money and financial future sounds scary how should one proceed let 's assume that $ 100,000 is in play and since you are learning the ropes let 's leave $ 50,000 in cash for now this leaves $ 50,000 to start a portfolio i 'd start by building a core position of all the major asset classes in etf form this means buying things like spy or tlt if you 're comfortable you can start selling monthly calls against these positions to reduce basis and earn some income the point is your only limitation at this point is taking time to learn the ropes the technology is there the free education is there and liquidity and product mix is there next thing you know you 're learning how gamma scalping works or maybe you 're more of a buffett type   this is how i view finance in general and truly hope you break through the initial barrier to your own finances

if we 're including psychological considerations then the question becomes much more complicated will having a higher available credit increase the temptation to spend will eliminating 100 of a small debt provide more positive reinforcement than paying off 15 of a larger debt etc if we 're looking at the pure financial impact the question is simpler the only advantage i see to prioritizing the lower interest card is the float when you buy something on a credit card interest is often calculated for that purchase starting at the beginning of the next billing cycle rather than immediately from the purchase date i 'm not clear on what policies credit card companies have on giving float for credit cards with a carried balance so you should look into what your card 's policy is   other than than paying off the higher interest rate card is better than paying off the lower interest rate on top of that you should look into whether you qualify for any of the following options presented from best to worst

the question is n't fair it 's how much do you have to give them in order to get them to trust you with the money for a year rather than doing something else with it and does that exceed what you are willing able to give them and how sure are you that you can either do without the money or find it elsewhere   this has to be negotiated there is no standard answer since there is no standard company or lender heck even a simple bank loan is a negotiation though that usually takes the form of shopping around for an acceptable rate and their deciding whether they 'll accept you rather than going back and forth on what rate would be the best compromise

in my opinion you should pay off the student loans as soon as possible before you start saving for the house downpayment $ is a big number but you have a great salary   nice   up until now you have been a poor college student accustomed to a relatively low standard of living   your $ 800 per month plan would have you pay off the loan in 3 years but i would challenge you to pay off this entire student loan in 1 year or less   a monthly loan payment of $ will pay off your loan in 12 months after that is done if you take the same amount you had been paying toward your student loans and save it for your condo in less than two years you 'll have a 10 down payment saved $ 50k   the whole thing will take less than three years there are three reasons why i recommend paying off the loan first before saving for the condo one is practical and two are philosophical practical you will save money on interest   paying off the loan in 1 year vs. 3 years will save you $   you wo n't find a short term safe investment that will beat 5 in interest philosophical the loan is something current and concrete that you can focus on   your condo is a dream at this point and there is lots of time to change your mind   if the $ per month amount is at all a sacrifice for you then in a few months you might be tempted to say to yourself this month i really want a vacation so i 'll just skip this month of saving   for the loan however if you establish a concrete goal of 12 months to pay off the loan it will hopefully help motivate you to allocate this money and stick to your plan philosophical getting used to borrowing money making payments to a bank and paying interest is not a great way to live   it is better in my opinion to eliminate your debt as fast as possible and start getting accustomed to saving cash for what you want   clean up your debt and resolve not to borrow any more money except for a reasonably sized mortgage on your home

others have made excellent suggestions one thing i would add and this can not be understated is to assess your risk tolerance   we tend to think of investing as a purely rational and financial decision yet myself and so many others when times get tough make emotional decisions doing a risk tolerance test as honestly as possible will help you recognize what you can and ca n't handle    on top of that consider how well you face adversity or celebrations in other areas of life i 've found many similarities in the ways that we handle a gain in our investments to the way we celebrate a raise same thing with adversity once you know this you can begin the process of elimination on funds added the point above this does not consume a lot of time and could end up saving you a great deal of money and emotional so it 's well worth it

i 'm not sure about reimbursement you 'll have to talk to a tax adviser cpa ea licensed in your state from what i know if you pay your own insurance premiums they 're not deductible and i do n't think reimbursements change that but again not sure verify however since you 're a salaried employee even if your own you can have your employer cover you by a group plan even if the group consists of only you then you 'll pay your portion as part of the pre tax salary deduction and it will be deductible the employer 's portion is a legitimate business expense thus since both the employee and the employer portions are pre tax the whole cost of the insurance will be pre tax the catch is this this option has to be available to all of your employees so if you 're hiring an employee a year from now to help you that employee will be eligible to exactly the same options you have you can not only cover owner employees if you do n't plan on hiring employees any time soon this point is moot for you but it is something to keep in mind down the road as you 're building and growing your business

there 's a bit of truth to that except in reality when you ask for business loan the bank most definitely looks at the background of the owners assuming it 's a small business   you might have some luck fooling investors as a way to get some capital but that 's doubtful as well if you have a history of starting companies that later fail

we have a lot of debt at this point i do n't even know how much this is your problem find out and while you 're at it find out how much income you have and also what your total expenditures are you seem to be facing up to the problem but not looking it in the eyes you just need to take some time and a little to get all your financial documentation together and lay it all out so you know what your situation actually is its not hard to do this get a box and put all old bills and statements in that you can find and at the end of a month pick them out and write down the totals then work out your income and all that you 've spent that month this is known as a statement of affairs and there are calculators to help you then you can work out how much you need to pay off and how much spare money you have to do this with you can also start to cut down on all the really unnecessary stuff to increase your spare money that you can use to pay off the debts hopefully this wo n't take too long and you can easily if work the debt off over time if it really is there are things you can do to help firstly contacting your creditors and seeing what they can do to either part write off the debt or freeze it as you pay it off most creditors understand that if you 're desperate enough to talk to them then they may not see any of their debt back and are at least willing to help you pay them back generally though it sounds like you are not in a total mess as you can pay it off there are people in far worse states than you but you really do need to be fully aware of your financial situation sit down and count your money one lazy sunday there are links to help try the motley fool 's guide and its dealing with debt forum both of which are very practical if uk based the fool has a us site too see for yourself if there 's the same stuff on it but this kind of thing tends to be fundamental to people of all nations

on what basis did you do your initial allocation of funds to each stock    if you are re balancing that implies returning things to their initial allocation   you can do this without any research or recommendations if you started out with say 10 stocks and 10 of the funds allocated to each stock then re balancing would simply be either buying selling to return to that initial allocation   if you are contributing to the portfolio you could adjust where the new money goes to re balance without selling   or if you are drawing money from the portfolio then you could adjust what you are selling if on the other hand you are trying to decide if you want to alter the stocks the portfolio is holding then you have an entirely different question from re balancing

having a separate checking account for the business makes sense it simplifies documenting your income expenses you can explain every dollar entering and exiting the account without having to remember that some of them were for non business items my credit union allowed me to have a 2nd checking account and allowed me to put whatever i wanted as the name on the check i think this looked a little better than having my name on the check i do n't see the need for a separate checking account for investing the money can be kept in a separate savings account that has no fees and can even earn a little interest unless you are doing a lot of investment transactions a month this has worked for me i fund iras and 529 plans this way we get paychecks 4 5 times a month but send money to each of the funds once a month you will need a business account if the number of transactions becomes large if you deposit dozens of checks every time you go to the bank the bank will want to move you to a business account

first off is right at the end of the day you should not accept what anyone says to do without your money take their suggestions as directions to research and decide for yourself   i also do not think what you have is too little to invest but that depends on how liquid you need to be   often in order to make a small amount of money grow via investments you have to be willing to take all the investment profits from that principle and reinvest it   thus can you see how your investment ability is governed by the time you plan to spend without that money   they mantra that i have heard from many people is that the longer you are able to wait the more risk you can take   as someone who is about the same age as you i 'm 24 i ca n't exactly say yet that what i have done is sure fire for the long term but i suggest you adopt a few principles 1 go read a random walk down wall street by burton g. malkiel   a key point for you might be that you can do better than most of these professional investors for hire simply by putting   more money in a well selected index fund   for example vanguard is a nice online service to buy indexes through but they may require a minimum   2 since you are young if you go into any firm bank or financial planner they will just think you are naive and try to get you to buy whatever is best for them one of their mutual funds money market accounts annuities some flashy cd    do n't   you can do better on your own and while it might be tempting because these options look more secure or well managed most of the time you will barely make above inflation and you will not have learned very much 3 one exciting thin you should start learning now is about algorithmic trading because it is cool and super efficient is a good platform for this   it is a fun community and it is also free 4 one of the best ways i have found to watch the stock market is actually through a stock game app on my phone that has realtime stock price feed   seeking alpha has a good mobile app interface and it also connects you to news that has to do with the companies you are interested in

i actually have a bit of experience with the supplier side of this having worked with other people attempting to get the business launched i can shed a bit of insight the primary reason for the pricing is that there simply is n't enough competition to warrant dropping the price any lower than it already is large companies such as hallmark will typically buy card designs at 5 of the card 's selling price with their existing distribution network this makes bringing in new and varied designs much easier for large companies that are already well established having talked with such designers in the past someone working full time producing designs makes on average 30 60k annually from this which is worth it to someone who does n't want to jump through the hoops of actually getting into the business independently the primary issue stifling competition is actually getting your product into stores there are topics here that i can not discuss due to nda but i can break down the overall outline for you you need to start with a large number of designs with enough variety that companies think could sell well if you bring a handful of designs with you no company is going to take your business venture seriously enough you need to find a company that can stamp out a large production process for you the company is going to need to be nice enough to take smaller purchase orders on the magnitude of several hundred cards but also be capable of scaling that production to several hundreds of thousands of cards very quickly for cards specifically most companies want you to ship custom racks with your cards some companies may provide their own racks for stocking your product but not all of them will this will also cost a lot of money up front you need to find a buyer for a company you want to sell your product to this is important and what killed our original business plans think wal mart target or even cvs pharmacy these big companies are going to have people who 's entire job is to buy new products to put on their shelves this is where networking is key you need to find people with connections to these buyers if you 're not already well established with them you will also likely fail several times either getting outright ignored or through a broker that ca n't meet expectations for example we had a broker that introduced us to a buyer for a large store chain and after several months of work we found out that this broker was just pulling our strings typically a company will want to test your product in a handful of stores to see if it will sell for example target may want to test your product in 100 200 stores over 3 months and expect your product to sell at a minimum rate finally you need to be able to scale your production suddenly you 'll be asked to go from supplying 100 stores to supplying 1,800 stores with a deadline in 2 weeks buyers will even turn you down at this point if they do n't think you can meet the production all of this work takes at least a year and typically takes several years to go from an initial product to having your product in every store without breaking the numbers down too much we could make a profit of for every $ 3 card that sold that number does n't cover the cost of racks and other overhead that 's just the per card profit even then people are more likely to go view the hallmark or other big name cards over your offering only when another company becomes a big powerhouse to be competitive will these companies be forced to drop their prices

i completely agree with pete that a 401(k loan is not the answer but i have an alternate proposal reduce your 401(k contribution down to the 4 that you get a match on   if you are cash poor now and have debts to be cleaned up those need to be addressed before retirement savings   you 'll have plenty of time to make up the lost savings after you get the debts paid off    if your company matches 50 meaning you have to contribute 8 to get the 4 match then consider temporarily stopping your 401(k altogether a 100 match is very hard to give up but a 50 match is less difficult   you have plenty of years left ahead of you to make up the lost match   plus the pain of knowing you 're leaving money on the table will incentivize you to get the loans paid as quickly as possible   it seems to me that i would be reducing middle to high interest debt while also saving myself $ 150 per month   no you 'd be deferring $ 150 per month for an additional two years and not reducing debt at all just moving it to a different lender interest rate is not your problem   right now you 're paying less than $ 30 per month in interest on these 3 loans and about $ 270 in principal and at the current rate should have them paid off in about 2 years   you 're wanting to extend these loans to 4 years by borrowing from your retirement savings    i would buckle down reduce expenses wherever possible cable cell phone coffee movies restaurants until you get these debts paid off   you make $ 70,000 per year or almost $ 6,000 per month   i bet if you try hard enough you can come up with $ 1,100 fairly quickly then the next $ 1,200 should come twice as fast then attack the next $ 4,000 you can argue whether the $ 1,200 should come first because of the interest rate but in the end it does n't matter either one should be paid off very quickly so the interest saved is negligible maybe you can get one of them paid off get yourself some breathing room then loosen up a little bit but extending the pain for an additional two years is not wise some more drastic measures

this sort of thinking is one of the problems with economics it 's way too simplistic and of how a company works no company increases the price of a product because they hired a more expensive employee unless said employee is dead weight    it might be a process engineer that right now costs the company a bit more but 12 months down the line will improve production efficiency by at least the value of his salary and if they improve it more by say 200 of their salary product price stays the same he gets a pat on his back from the boss and the company increases it 's profits    and what usually happens when you nickel and dime your employees they lose engagement and interest or worst they hire a shit employee for a shit salary and get little to no benefit from hiring

retail purchases are purchases made at retail i.e. as a consumer individual customer that would include any standard individual expenditure but may exclude wholesale sales or purchases from merchants who identify themselves as service providers to businesses specifics of these limitations really depend on your card issuer and you should inquire with the customer service at what are their specific eligibility requirements as an example here in the us many cards give high cash back for gasoline purchases but only at retail locations that excludes wholesale club sellers like costco for example

you should probably have a tax professional help you with that generally advisable when doing corporation returns even if its a small s corp with a single shareholder some of it may be deductible depending on the tax exemption status of the recipients some may be deductible as business expenses to address chris 's comment generally you can deduct as a business on your 1120s anything that is necessary and ordinary for your business charitable deductions flow through to your personal 1040 so 's reference to pub is the right place to look at if it was a c corp it might be different   advertisement costs is a necessary and ordinary expense for any business but you need to look at the essence of the transaction did you expect the sponsorship to provide you any new clients did you anticipate additional exposure to the potential customers was the investment 80 hours of your work similar to the costs of paid advertisement for the same audience if so it is probably a business expense while you ca n't deduct the time on its own you can deduct the salary you paid yourself for working on this materials attributed depreciation etc if you ca n't justify it as advertisement then its a donation and then you can not deduct it because you did receive something in return it might not be allowed as a business expense and you might be required to consider it as personal use i.e. salary

i 'm guessing you 're conflating bonus share issuance with stock split   that seems very common to me from a quick search there 's even some issues of terminology between the us and europe i think it seems some europeans may use bonus shares to mean stock split as opposed to the more common meaning in the us of stock dividend sometimes a bonus share issuance is incorrectly called a stock split like in this public announcement from in 2004   it is a 1:1 bonus share issuance meaning they issue one bonus share to everyone who has one share now but it is in essence the same thing as a stock split a 2:1 stock split namely   they combined the 1:1 from bonus share with the wording split causing the confusion bonus share issuance also known as a stock dividend is covered well in this question answer on this site or from a search online   it has no obvious effect initially both involve doubling shares out there and halving the price but it has a substantially different treatment in terms of accounting both to the company and to your tax accountant

if john signs the lease he is entitled to stay there for the duration of the lease regardless of the foreclosure status    i would suggest that signing a year lease even by email with the plan to leave as early as possible is a good thing   the key will be to make sure the penalty for leaving early is nothing john does n't know the status of the foreclosure how long it will take who might own afterwards and a lot of other unknowns   the worst case is to be unsure of where you are living sign the lease and be secure for one whole year that you know where you will be living   spend that year finding a new place to live    if the bank does n't offer you clear and obvious ways to submit rent open an account at the bank and deposit the rent there on time you are establishing credibility that you deserve to stay   you still owe the rent so pay it they do n't want to be your landlord but do n't let a bank bully you around

the short answer to your initial question is yes the option does n't expire until the close of the market on the day of expiration because the option is expiring so soon the time value of the option is quite small   that is why the option once it is in the money will track so closely to the underlying stock price if someone buys an in the money option on the day of expiration they are likely still expecting the price to go up before they sell it or exercise it many brokers will exercise your in the money options sometime after 3 pm on the day of expiration   if this is not what you desire you should communicate that with them prior to that day

if you and your parents both put up money to buy a house or anything else what share each of you owns would be a subject for negotiation and agreement between you to the best of my knowledge there is no law that says if person x pays the down payment and person y pays the monthly payments than x owns 40 and y owns 60 or any other specific numbers parents often give their children money to help with a down payment on a house or a car with the understanding that this is a gift and the child still owns 100 of the item other times they are unwilling or unable to just give the money and want some stake in exchange in the case of a house or a car there 's a title that identifies the owner and legally the owner is the person or people named on the title i 'd suggest that if you want to have split ownership like if your parents are saying that they 'll help with the down payment but they want to get that money back when you sell or some such that you come up with a written agreement saying who owns what percentage and you both sign it if there was a dispute if you never had an agreement about what share each owned and now you 're selling the house and you 're arguing over how much of the money each of you should get or your parents want you to sell the house so they can get their money back but you do n't want to sell or whatever ultimately a court would decide presumably the judge would consider how much you had each paid in but he might also consider who 's been paying property taxes how much work each has done to maintain the place etc it 's better to have a written and signed agreement something that everyone involved is satisfied with and where you all know exactly what you 're agreeing to rather than having a nasty surprise when a judge says no you 're not getting what you were assuming you were getting

quant has been an interesting part of finance but i always thought they missed something really important    the standard methods of statistical analysis ca n’t explain what ’s going on with economy and firms otherwise quant hedge funds would have been making money all the time    the conventional quants find patterns in data test them then go live these models work until some fundamental or not so fundamental shifts in the market then they find themselves back in the drawing board looking for their next model this kind of analysis seems like a lot of grind for fairly   unpredictable returns    there are more and more companies that do n’t lend themselves well to fundamental analysis as we know it financial data and some poor flawed human analysts insights alone can no longer explain much    this is a unique set of challenges that data science more specifically ai could solve the speed at which ai can learn and process information is just mind boggling ai can learn the entire financial history of decision making in minutes it can recognize patterns make sophisticated analysis and constantly update its probability tables as the new information comes in this is something no human can compete with     imagine a quantitative engine that adapts as the economy changes it could draw heaps of data about a company learn from it in real time make course corrections and spit out its recommendations    to the degree that human decision making is involved in the strategic decision making of companies we will need the depth of context that can be provided by humans but i see the field moving away from excel spreadsheets with fairly poor predicting capacity to ai models with strong predictive capacity

this is just an addition to 's answer   in order to maximize your overall wealth and wellbeing in a long run it is not enough to look only at the expected value ev in his example of always keeping $ or having $ 10000 99 of the time ev in the second case is greater $ > $ and if you are bill gates than you should not take an insurance in this case but if your wealth is a lot less than that you should take an insurance take a look at kelly criterion and utility functions if i offer you to take 100 million dollars no strings attached or to take a risk to get 200 million dollars 60 of the time and $ 0 40 of the time would you take that risk you should n't but bill gates should take that risk because that would be a very good investment for him utility functions can help you choose if you want an insurance or not maybe you want to insure your house because the value of the house is a large percentage of your wealth but on the other hand you do n't need to insure your car if it is very easy for you to afford another one but not easy to afford another house lets calculate what your wealth should be in order not to take this $ 150 insurance on a $ 10000 item if you pay $ 150 for an insurance you have guaranteed $ but choosing not to take an insurance is the same as betting $ in order to gain $ 150 99 of the time by using kelly criterion formula fraction of the wealth needed to make this bet is = + 1 = 1/3   that means that if your wealth greater than $ you do n't need an insurance but if you want to be sure it is advised to use fractional kelly betting for example you could multiply fraction by 1/2 and in that case if your wealth is more than $ you do n't need an insurance for this item

i strongly doubt that being executor will make the assets of the estate vulnerable to a suit against him personally the estate is it 's own separate legal entity with its own tin only creditors against the estate itself can make claims against it and after all creditors are paid then the balance is distributed in accordance with the terms of the will unless he has commingled assets and treated estate assets as his own the legal separation should be quite strong   whether his personal assets are at risk remember that the opposition will likely overstate their case to try to scare him into settling if the business was organized as an llp or llc his personal assets should be pretty safe if it was a sole proprietorship he has occasion to worry

sure   even milton friedman called hayek 's economic work   much of the austrian economic foundation rests without as solid of a   philosophical or mathematical foundation as most other schools of thought   i suppose the easiest way to understand this is to look at three foundational works   i recommend reading each of these anyways but skimming and paying attention to references should give you a good idea of the varying levels of rigor introduced into each school of thought   leaf through das = = = = = = = = false this is marx 's primary   it is far older than the following two that i will present   nevertheless it perhaps more than any other book played a pivotal role in the 20th century    leaf through a general theory of employment interest and = = = = = = = = = false this is the foundational work of the keynesians   there is much more here than simply the advice to increase government spending to stabilize demand during economic downswings   and it has been probably the most widely accepted work by the greatest number of economists over the 20th century      leaf through the theory of money and credit this is the austrian from von mises   it is the newest of the three   it is also likely the least rigorous   but please judge for yourself   von mises did do some more rigorous work in other areas     but all schools of economics ultimately rest on their theory of capital   so before you pick which church to belong to it 's worth reading their respective

probably the most important thing in evaluating a dividend yield is to compare it to itself in the past if the dividend yield is higher than it has been in the past the stock may be cheap if it is lower the stock may be expensive just about every stock has a normal yield for itself it 's zero for non dividend paying stocks this is based on the stock 's perceived quality growth potential and other factors so a utility that normally yields 5 and is now paying 3 is probably expensive the price in the denominator is too high while a growth stock that normally yields 2 and is now yielding 3 e.g. intel or may be cheap

gt;and a lot of people that have communist party wealth are afraid that there will be an uprising against them so they are preparing escape plans   my guess would be more along these lines albeit maybe a bit less dramatic   there were a lot of dubious things that party members did over the past hundred years to stash away cash for themselves   siphoning off public resources investing with them and as long as the investments made money keeping the results for example played a significant role in some of the complaints that farmers had about local officials   if they keep money in china and there 's some sort of fallout or charges that go through my guess is that it 's a lot easier to seize a corrupt official 's resources   on the other hand if you just bought a bunch of land in the us that 's a lot less easily and harder to immediately get ahold of for chinese officials   there 's also the more legit possibility that china quite arguably has a real estate bubble in investable real estate and the result is that if you want to invest in land and reduce your risk to a bubble deflating you want to do so overseas

theoretically yes you can only buy or sell whole shares which is why you still have shares in your account you ca n't sell that fraction on the open market this is especially true for voting stock stock which gives you voting rights in company decisions makes each stock one vote so effectively whomever controls the majority of one stock gets that vote however various stock management policies on the part of the shareholder brokerage firm or the issuing company can result in you owning fractional shares perhaps the most common is a retirement account or other forward planning account in such situations it 's the dollar amount that counts when you deposit money you expect the money to be invested in your chosen mix of mutual funds and other instruments if the whole shares rule were absolute and you wanted to own for instance berkshire hathaway stock and you were contributing a few hundred a month it could take you your entire career of your contributions sitting in a money market account essentially earning nothing before you could buy even one share you are virtually guaranteed in such situations to end up owning fractions of shares in an investment account in these situations it 's usually the fund manager 's firm that actually holds title to the full share part of a pool they maintain for exactly this situation and your fractional ownership percentage is handled purely with accounting they give you your percentage of the dividends when they 're paid out and marginal additional investments increase your actual holdings of the share until you own the whole thing if you divest the firm sells the share of which you owned a fraction or just holds onto it for the next guy fractionally investing in the stock no need to pay unnecessary broker fees and pays you that fraction of the sale price   another is dividend reinvestment the company may indicate that instead of paying a cash dividend they will pay a stock dividend or you yourself may indicate to the broker that you want your dividends given to you as shares of stock which the broker will acquire from the market and place in your account other common situations include stock splits that are n't x companies often are n't looking to halve their stock price by offering a two for one split they may think a smaller figure like 50 or even smaller is preferable to fine tune their stock price and thus p e ratio and eps figures similar to industry competitors or to companies with similar market capitalization in such situations they can offer a split that 's x for y with x > y like a or similar these are relatively uncommon but they do happen home depot 's first stock split in 1987 was a other ratios are rare and msft has only ever been split 2-for-1 so it 's most likely that you ended up with the extra sixth of a share through dividend reinvestment or a broker policy allowing fractional share investment

how can i calculate my currency risk exposure   you own securities that are priced in dollars so your currency risk is the amount all else being equal that your portfolio drops if the dollar depreciates relative to the euro between now and the time that you plan to cash out your investments not all stocks though have a high correlation relative to the dollar   many us companies e.g. apple do a lot of business in foreign countries and do not necessarily move in line with the dollar   calculate the correlation using excel or other statistical programs between the returns of your portfolio and the change in fx rate between the dollar and euro to see how well your portfolio correlated with that fx rate   that would tell you how much risk you need to mitigate how can i hedge against it   there are various currency etfs that will track the usd eur exchange rate so one option could be to buy some of those to offset your currency risk calculated above   note that etfs do have fees associated with them although they should be fairly small one i looked at had a 0.4 fee which is n't terrible but is n't nothing also note that there are etfs that employ currency risk mitigation internally including one on the nasdaq 100    note that this is not a recommendation for this etf just letting you know about alternative products that might meet your needs

if you are investing in a mortgage strictly to avoid taxes the answer is pay cash now   a mortgage buys you flexibility but at the cost of long term security and in most cases an overall decrease in wealth too   at a very basic level i have to ask anyone why they would pay a bank a dollar in order to avoid paying the government 28 36 cents depending on your tax rate after all one can only deduct not principal interest is like rent it accrues strictly to the lender not equity in theory the recipient should be irrelevant if you have a need to stiff the government go ahead just realize you making a banker three times as happy   additionally the peace of mind that comes from having a house that no banker can take away from you is at least for me compelling if i have a $ 300,000 house with no mortgage no payments etc i feel quite safe even if my money is tied up in equity if a serious situation came along say a huge doctors bill i always have the option of a reverse mortgage later on so to directly counter other claims yes i 'd rather have $ 300k in equity then $ 50k in equity and $ in liquid assets did you notice that the total net worth is $ 25k less and that 's even before one considers the cash flow implication of a continuing mortgage   i have no mortgage and i 'm 41 i have a lot of net worth but the thing that i really like is that i have a roof over my head that no on e can take away from me and sufficient savings to weather most crises   that said a mortgage is not about total cost it is about cash flow to the extent that a mortgage makes your cash flow situation better it provides a just not one that is quantifiable in dollars and cents rather it is a risk reward situation by taking a mortgage even when you have the cash you pay a premium the interest rate in order to have your funds available when you need it   a very simple strategy to calculate and/or minimize this risk would be to invest the funds in another investment if your rate of return exceeds the interest rate minus any tax preference e.g. 4 minus say a 25 deduction = 3 your money is better off there obviously and indeed when interest rates are only 4 it may may be possible to find that that said in most instances a cd or an inflation protected bond or so wo n't give you that rate of return there you 'd need to look at slightly more risky when interest rates are back to say 5 or 6 it gets even harder   if you could however find a better return than the effective interest rate it makes the most sense to do that investment hold it as a hedge to pay off the mortgage see you get your security back if you decide not to work and pocket the difference if you ca n't do that your only real reason to hold the cash should be the cash flow situation

a lot of people on here will likely disagree with me and this opinion    in my opinion the answer lies in your own motives and intentions    if you 'd like to be more cognizant of the market i 'd just dive in and buy a few companies you like   many people will say you should n't pick your own stocks you should buy an index fund or this etf or this much bonds etc   you already have retirement savings capital allocation is important there   you 're talking about an account total around 10 of your annual salary and assuming you have sufficient liquid emergency funds there 's a lot of non monetary benefit to being more aware of the economy and the stock market   but if you find the house you 're going to buy you may have to liquidate this account at a time that 's not ideal possibly at a loss if all you 're after is a greater return on your savings than the paltry 0.05 or whatever the big deposit banks are paying then a high yield savings account is the way i 'd go or a cd ladder yes the market generally goes up but it does n't always go up   get your money somewhere that it 's and you can be certain how much you 'll have tomorrow assuming a gain the gain you 'll see will pale in comparison to the deposits you 'll make   deposits grow accounts   consider these scenarios if you allocate $ 1,000 per month to this account    1 assuming an investment return of 5 you 're talking about $ 330 return in the first year not counting commissions or possible losses 2 assuming a high yield savings account at 1.25 you 're talking about $ 80 in the first year    also remember both of these amounts would be taxable i 'll admit in the event of 5 return you 'll have about four times the gain but you 're talking about a difference of on $ 12,000   over three to five years the most significant contributor to the account by far will be your deposits    anyway as i 'm sure you know this is not investment advice and you may lose money etc

like i said the heat index is just a how it feels calculation i never said the heat index determines evaporation just that the calculation for getting the heat index is based on humidity and temperature   the dew point based on temperature and humidity is what governs evaporation   the dew point is the temperature at which water will evaporate given a specific relative humidity   in other words you ca n't calculate the dew point unless you know the humidity   if your skin temp is lower than the dew point water will condense on your skin   it does n't matter if other things are cooler than your skin water may condense on those items more quickly but it will still condense on you

in general prices are inversely proportional to rates however accurate interest rate prediction would make one worthy of managing a large credit derivative hedge fund this is not to say that interest rates can not go up in canada since the world is currently undergoing a resource bust and the united states has begun exporting more oil even trying to recently open the market to europe both of which canada is relatively dependent upon also to say that canada currently has the most overpriced real estate is an oversight to say the least considering china currently has entire cities that are empty because prices are too high a ten to twenty percent drop in real estate prices would probably be a full blown financial crisis and since mortgage rates are currently around 2.5 a one to two hundred basis point rise could mean a nearly 50 decrease in real estate prices if interest payments are held constant   canada would either have to start growing its economy at a much higher rate to encourage the central bank to raise rates to such a height or oil would have to completely collapse suddenly to cause a possible collapse of cad to encourage the same the easiest relationship to manipulate between prices and rates is the perpetuity where p is the price i is the interest payment and r is the interest rate   in this case an increase of r from 2.5 to 4.5 would cause a decrease in p if i is held constant   however typical canadian mortgages seem to mature in ten years at a fixed rate so i can not be held constant and the relationship between r and p is less strong at earlier maturities thus the most likely way for prices to collapse is for a financial collapse as described above

this is the meat of your potato question the of the question to a lending real estate executive such as myself i 'd ask what 's the scenario i would say you 're looking for an owner occupied super jumbo loan with 20 down or $ 360 k down on the purchase price $ 1.8 mil purchase price loan amount is mil fico is strong assumption if this is your scenario please see image yellow is important more debt increases your backend dti which is not good for the deal as long as it 's less than 35 you 're okay   can someone do this loan the short answer is yes it 's smart that you want to keep more cash on hand which is understandable if the price of the property declines you 've lost your shirt and your down payment then it will take close to 10 years to recover your down consider that you are buying at a peak in real estate prices prices ca n't go up more than they are now consider that properties peaked in 2006 cooled in 2007 and crashed in 2008 properties declined for more than 25 45 in 2008 regardless of your reasons of not wanting to come to the full 40 down it 's a bit smarter to hold on to cash for other investments purposes just incase a recession does hit   in the end if you do the deal pay more in points a higher rate compared to the 40 down scenario the origination fee would increase slightly but you 'll keep your money on hand to invest elsewhere perhaps some units that can help with the cashflow of your home i 've highlighted in yellow what the most important factors that will be affected on a lower down payment if your debt is low or zero and income is as high as the scenario with a fico score of at least you can do the deal all day long these deals are not uncommon in today 's market rate will vary do n't pay attention to the rate the rate will fluctuate based on many variables but it 's a high figure to give you an idea on total cost and monthly payment for qualification purposes also to look at the dti requirement for cash debt   see image below

a company start with say $ 100 lets say the max it can borrow from bank is $ 100 $ 10 a year as interest after a years say on the $ 200 the company made a profit of $ 110 so it now has total $ 310 option 1 company pays back the bank $ 100 + $ 10 it further gave away the $ 100 back to shareholders as dividends the balance with company $ 100 it can again start the second year borrow from bank $ 100 10 interest and restart    option 2 company pays back the bank $ 100 + $ 10 it now has $ 200 it can now borrow $ 200 from bank $ 20 after a year it makes a profit of $ 250 economics of scale result $ 30 more quite a few companies in growth phase use option 2 as they can grow faster achieve economies of scale keep competition at bay etc now if i had a share of this company say 1 $ 1 by end of first year its value would be $ 2 at the end of year 2 it would be $ 3.3 now there is someone else who wants to buy this share at end of year 1 i would say this share gives me 100 returns every year so i will not sell at $ 2 give me $ 3 at the end of first year the buyer would think well if i buy this at $ 3 first year i would notionally get $ .3 and from then on $ 1 every year not bad this is still better than other stocks and better than bank cd etc so as long as the company is doing well and expected to do well in future its price keeps on increasing as there is someone who want to buy why would someone want to sell and not hold one 1 needs cash for buying house or other purposes close to retirement etc 2 is balancing the portfolio to make is less risk based 3 quite a few similar reasons    why would someone feel its right to buy 1 has cash and is young is open to small risk 2 believes the value will still go up further 3 quite a few similar reasons

if you are using software like quickbooks or even just using spreadsheets or tracking this without software use two equity accounts something like capital contributions and capital distributions when you write a personal check to the company the money goes into the company 's checking account and also increases the capital contribution account in accordance with double entry accounting practices when the company has enough retained earnings to pay you back you use the capital distributions equity account and just write yourself a check you can also make general journal entries every year to zero out or balance your two capital accounts with retained earnings which i think is an automatically generated equity account in quickbooks if this sounds too complex you could also just use a single capital contributions and distributions equity account for your contributions and distributions

once a debt has gone to a debt collector you have to work with the debt collector to settle your debt essentially the department store sold your debt to the debt collector so they do n't have to deal with it anymore you have rights when contacted by debt collectors you can negotiate a deal so that the amount you actually pay is lower than what you owe it is illegal for them to quote you for a higher amount than what you actually owe also they ca n't threaten you or pretend to be a credit bureau your best bet is to work with them and negotiate a better payment do n't give up collectors often times purchase the debt for a very low amount so even if you pay less than what you actually owe the collector will still make a profit

did a great job explaining your options so i wo n't rehash any of that i know you said that you do n't want to save for retirement yet but i 'm going to risk answering that you should anyway specifically i think you should consider a roth ira when it comes to tax advantaged retirement accounts once the contribution period for a tax year ends there 's no way to make up for it for example in 2015 you may contribute up to $ 5,500 to your ira you can make those contributions up until tax day of the following year april 15th 2016 after that you can not contribute money towards 2015 again   so each year that goes by you 're losing out on some potential to contribute as for why i think a roth ira specifically could work well for you i 'm advocating this because i think it 's a good balance you put away some money in a retirement account now when it will have the most impact on your future retirement assets taking advantage of a time you will never have again at a low cost custodian like vanguard you can open an ira with as little as $ 1,000 to start and choose from excellent fund options that meet your risk requirements if you end up deciding that you really want that money for a car or a house or beer money you can withdraw any of the contributions without fear of penalty or additional tax but if you decide you do n't really need to take that money back out you 've contributed to your retirement for a tax year you likely would n't have   otherwise and would n't be able to make up for later when you have more than enough to max out an ira each year i also want to stress that you should have a liquid emergency fund in a savings or checking account to deal with unexpected emergencies before funding something like this but after that if you have no specific goal for your savings and you do n't know for sure you 'll actually need to spend it in the near future funding a roth ira is worth considering in my opinion

grad school applications typically have deadlines around december or january so you 're thinking about this at the right time    first obviously you should get an idea of where you want to go and what kind of program there 's plenty of ranking lists online that can help give you an idea grad school applications take a non trivial amount of effort so most people apply to only 5 10   next you 'll want to contact potential references the grad school websites should inform you what type of reference they want but in my experience these were mostly academic and usually 2 3 per application finance programs may want more professional references as well try to choose the right references for the application e.g. i applied to financial engineering programs and would usually have one economics professor and then either a math professor or a statistics professor depending on the focus of the program   now check to see if your programs require a gre gmat score they probably will and start studying asap there 's tons of study materials available both in book form and online and if you can put the time in you can probably get a decent score with just a few weeks 4 6 of studying as far as i know just about every program that accepts a gmat score will also accept a gre score but not necessarily the other way around so you may be better off studying for the gre verify this   and with all those components complete you 'll basically be done some applications will ask for various forms of cover letter or have other essay questions so set aside some time to write these as well    also if you 're looking at finance master 's programs i notice that they tend to come in a few varieties some set you up for phds and are naturally more academic focused where as terminal master 's that resemble an mba will focus on trying to get you a job reflect a bit on what you want to accomplish with your degree and figure out the program that 's best for that if you get in to a top school then it wo n't matter much regardless but otherwise it is very likely that schools which produce good phd candidates and research are not necessarily the same schools which place people on wall street   hope that helps

people seem to think that yelp serves businesses or the public   it does n't   it serves yelpers   yelpers want reviews from other yelpers and that 's it   if you do n't review things frequently on yelp they do n't care about your opinion   sorry   nothing personal but this website is only interested in reviews from people who use the site frequently   you might be the most person in the world and you might post a great review of a business but this is n't your blog   you 're not entitled to have the world see your review here   they only want the opinion of regular yelpers   if you want to be a part of the yelp community keep making reviews and they 'll un filter your reviews   there are people who say that businesses that pay yelp get more reviews but it 's not true   the article even states that she was paying $ 350/month before these reviews got filtered out   the article also says a court case against yelp was thrown out because there was no evidence showing bias   people who claim this are just butt hurt and want to justify their bias by claiming that yelp is greedy and unscrupulous   the fact of the matter is this yelp has a powerful community   business owners see yelp as possibly affecting their business   they want to have control over that but they ca n't   in fact yelp goes out of their way to prevent that   many business owners simply are n't mentally capable of grasping how some things work and when things do n't go their way they get angry and make accusations   this particular woman who is currently taking 3 hours of social media classes per week wtf thinks there maybe needs to be some rules on the net that are n’t there now   no offense lady but you probably should n't be writing internet laws until you 're done with your internet for dummies classes   you might think that this is not a good model for a review website   if so do n't use it   it 's not a government institution and you 're not obligated to use it   go find another review site   better yet if you think yelp is so horrible go make your own review website that allows anyone to review things   i 'm sure it will be great and everyone will love it   whatever you choose stop trying to ruin yelp   the people who use it like the way the it is and do n't want some butt hurt non users fucking it up

i agree that there is a lot of filtering going on i run filters for people 's blogs and news sites i rarely read the caveat is that i sites i use frequently and pay for youtube red music streaming and patreon to support content creators that i enjoy this to me is an issue of the ad targeting not being mature enough yet once companies figure out that i 'm responsive to ads on certain sites but will blacklist others that do the same they can selectively serve ads on platforms i 'm more likely to engage with in the meantime the shotgun approach is what advertisers go for    the future is really in honing how and when these ads are delivered as well as offering more widespread alternatives to ads such as subscription services   for what its worth i also run i 've had isps in the past that had data caps and given how much data i already use via streaming and steam i need every spare mb i can get

it depends what rate mortgage you can get for any extra loans   if you remortgage you are likely to get a rate of 3.5 4 depending who you go with with deposit accounts in the uk around 1 yes you can get more by tying it up for longer but not a huge amount more clearly you 're better off not having a mortgage rather than money in the bank does your 8k income allow for tax if it does you are getting 6 return on the money tied up in the flat if you are getting 6 after tax on the invested money that 's way better than you would get on any left over cash paid into an investment borrowing money on a mortgage would cost you less than 6 so you are better off borrowing rather than selling the flat if you are getting 6 before tax depending on your tax rate it probably makes very little difference you 'd need to work out how much an extra 80k mortgage would cost you how much the 50k on deposit would earn you and how much you make after tax there is a different route set up a mortgage on the rental flat you can claim the interest payment off the flat 's income reduce your tax bill so the effective mortgage rate on the flat would be less than what you could get with a mortgage on the new house use the money from the flat 's mortgage to finance the difference in house price in fact from a tax view you may be better off having a mortgage free house and maxing out the mortgage on the flat so you can write off as much as possible against your tax bill all of the above assume that the flat is rented all the time the odd dry spell on the flat could influence the sums a lot all of the above assume that   your cash flow works whichever route you choose as no one on stack exchange has all of the numbers for your specific circumstances it may be worth talking to a tax accountant they could advise you properly knowing the numbers which makes the best sense for you in terms of overall cost cash flow risk and so on

let 's say you should have paid $ 4000 in taxes in a year but you paid $ 5000 so you get a tax return of $ 1000 somebody thinks that you should have tried to only pay $ 4000 in the year and get zero tax return i hope he or she does n't think you should pay $ 5000 and mess up your tax return so you get no refund   once the end of the tax year is there you should do what you can to get as much tax returned as possible on the other hand you should also have tried to pay less during the year obviously every dollar you paid less is a dollar less refund

gt operating in a country that allows you to make profit in my opinion establishes a duty to pay one 's fair share of taxes paying legislators to make laws enabling tax avoidance is in my mind unethical clearly we have a different idea of what is ethical and not   you have stumbled upon the heart of exactly why burger king 's actions and those of other companies that do similar things are perfectly justified although perhaps not in the manner you intended    in the entire developed world corporations are taxed at a certain rate on the income that they make as a result of business operations in that country   in the us us headquartered corporations are taxed at a certain rate not only on the income that they make a result of business operations in that country but also on the income that they make as the result of business operations in other countries    operating in a country that allows you to make a profit established a duty to pay one 's fair share of taxes operating in a country that allows you to make a profit does not establish any duty to pay one 's fair share of taxes to an entirely different or at least no moral or ethical obligation to do so the us may try to make a legal obligation to do so but i certainly ca n't fault any company which tries to avoid that obligation since the obligation is inherently unjust in the first place   if you do n't want companies doing stuff like this might i suggest that your country should stop imposing such ridiculous tax laws and get in line with the rest of the developed world every other country in the world is content to tax their fair slice of the pie for stuff that happens in their borders only the us expects a bite out of everyone else 's pie too    same should go for personal income earned by us citizens living abroad they should have no obligation to pay us income taxes

you ca n't transfer mortgages when you purchase a new property you can purchase a new property now or you can refinance your current property now and leverage yourself as far as possible while rates are low the higher rates you are worried about may not be as bad as you think with higher interest rates that may put downward pressure on housing prices or when rates do rise it may simply move from historic lows to relative lows i had a mortgage at 4.25 that i never bothered refinancing even though rates went much lower because the savings in interest paid minus my tax deduction for mortgage interest did n't amount to more than the cost of refinancing if rates go back up to 5 that will still be very affordable

i do n't know of a guideline to how often you can ask for an increase you can ask as often as you like as for consequences refer to is there a downside to asking for a credit increase where the consensus is that aside from a possible temporary hard pull on your credit report there 's probably no risk to asking depending on your credit score history and especially in the current economy you may get no as an answer most often you can try talking to your card 's credit department or even customer retention department as they may have more leverage they may say yes or no or that they need to review your account when you do ask for an increase i would make sure to ask if there will be a hard pull on your report if there is any cost or downside to applying and to make sure that this would be an increase to your current credit line not a new account

also interest rates and credit risk directly to greece 's ability to service the debt   japan could be at 400 and greece 50 but if they ca n't make payments or have credit good to refi the debt that 's when they will default    meanwhile the fact that they are risky drives up rates further and makes it even harder to make payments   it 's called the death spiral    japan has low rates solid gdp and good credit = non issue

you have a sequence of questions here so a sequence of answers if you stopped at the point where you had multiple wins with a net profit of $ 72 then you would pay regular income tax on that $ 72 it 's a short term capital gain which does not get special tax treatment and the fact that you made it on multiple transactions does not matter when you enter your next transaction that takes the hypothetical loss the question gets more complicated in either case you are paying a percentage on net gains   if you took a two year view in the second case and you do n't have anything to offset your loss in the second year then i guess you could say that you paid more tax than you won in the total sequence of trades over the two years although you picked a sequence of trades where it does not appear to play if you 're going to pursue this type of strategy then you are likely at some point to run into a case where the wash sale rules apply so you should be aware of that   you can find information on this elsewhere on this site and also for example here   basically these rules require you to defer recording a loss under some circumstances where you have rapid wins and losses on substantially identical securities edit a slight correction you can take part of your losses in the second year even if you have no off setting gain   from the irs if your capital losses exceed your capital gains the amount of the excess loss that you can claim on line 13 of form 1040 to lower your income is the lesser of $ 3,000 $ 1,500 if you are married filing separately

knees will become life threatening   not true at all   antibiotics assist the body 's immune system standard practice can prevent and a healthy individual 's immune system can fight off the vast majority of infections   now the problem is that places like hospitals are not only breeding grounds but are often becoming endemic community of super antibiotic resistant bacteria so if the kid with the knee goes to the emergency room then he 's in store for a life threatening problem   as to the viability of things like hip surgeries they are already a problem the solution will be to separate that kind of elective surgery to a different location probably an outpatient overnight only surgical center away from the normal hospital   the trend of rolling all medical care in an area into one big building facility combining clinic emergency room surgical long term care etc has actually been a big but seldom talked about source of the problem   the benefits of doing that are actually minimal and the detrimental effects far outweigh them

when weed growing is decriminalized i will not pay dollars for a small sack of it because now i will be able to go over to my friend house and he will give me a large sack of it for five bucks which he now does anyways but he only does this for his very good friends cuz he does nt want to go to prison and lose him home and his family and he tells me that he would rather live in his house rather than living in prison lol   the value of weed will drop thru the floor when i can grow it and not risk losing my freedom and my family and all of my assets not to mention the criminal record that would prevent me from ever living a productive life ever again   if i said that no person would pay for weed that is not really what i meant to say   i meant to say that there will be a lot of weed floating around and you wo nt need to pay $ per ounce for it but instead you will probably get an ounce of decent weed for $   funny story when i was in california there was a weed club that i used to go to and they were at risk to lose their license to sell weed and the country that worked there put a sign up that basically said this   dont make us quit selling weed lol   cuz we dont really like selling crack   but if we sell weed we would have to go back to selling crack   i am not kidding they put this sign up where all of the customers could see it   i almost on myself when i read it

old question but in the comments of the accepted answer i believe nate is correct and littleadv is incorrect nate copied the actual quote from the irs guidelines quoted below an expense is ordinary if it is common and accepted in your trade business or profession an expense is necessary if it is appropriate and helpful to your business an expense does n't have to be required to be considered necessary noise cancelling headphones certainly count as appropriate and helpful to your business in the software industry especially with the trend of open office layouts and because of the ubiquitous distractions inherent in the aforementioned office space noise cancelling headphones are becoming quite common and accepted for use by developers   i 'd be more hesitant about the keyboard and monitor as presumably the employer is providing those already as using your own could be said to just be a personal preference over those provided the argument that providing your own version is appropriate and helpful is a little more shaky   i am not a tax lawyer so do n't come after me if you get audited but my guess from reading the actual irs guidelines is noise cancelling headphones probably keyboard and monitor maybe

a lender will look at three things when giving a loan income do you make enough money each month to afford the payments they will subtract from your income any other loans credit card debt student loan debt mortgage they will also figure in your housing costs your collateral for a mortgage the collateral is the house for a car loan it is the car they will only give you a loan to a specific percentage of the value of the collateral your money in the bank is n't collateral but it can serve as a down payment on the loan   your credit score this is a measure of how well you handle credit the longer the history the better using credit wisely is better than not using the credit you have   if you do n't have a credit card get one start with your current bank you have a history with them if they wo n't help you join a credit union another source of car loans is the auto dealer though their rates can be high make sure that the purchase price does n't require a monthly payment too high for your income good rules of thumb for monthly payments are 25 for housing and 10 for all other loans combined even a person with perfect credit ca n't get a loan for more than the bank thinks they can afford note do n't drain all your savings you will need it to pay for the unexpected expenses in life you might think you have enough cash to pay off the student loan or to make a big down payment but you do n't want to stretch yourself too thin

generally anyone can selling them is an interesting point as the buyer has a counterparty risk that you wo n't be able to pay at the term of the contract so if i was a vendor buying a derivative in my example i would definitely get that derivative from a bank as opposed to my friend jim bob especially in cases of bespoke derivatives it does n't make sense for anyone except people who have material interest to by it as the expectation value of the hedge is negative essentially you 're more likely to lose money than gain money from a hedge the exception is when you have information above that of the market which could allow for a positive return that is the reason that people advocate for derivatives as mechanisms of price discovery because large imbalances are n't likely to form when someone could arbitrage or even just take positions when the market goes out of whack that only really works in publically traded markets however bespoke derivatives do n't really contribute to better pricing afaik   of course that 's the simple explanation to a huge complex and varied field certainly speculators exist particularly in the more commoditized derivatives especially in the to the financial crisis large amounts were spent on exotic derivatives that blew up in people 's faces the easiest thing to say about them is that they are double edged in theory they 're fantastic as it allows risk to be spread around to people that want it it should lead to a safer system as hedged are less exposed to shocks and are more resilient but in practice we 've seen them used as risk aig we 've seen cases where correlations arise that were n't assumed before and what used to be manageable positions become lead weights we 've seen the dangers that large systemically important financial institutions have when they are a counterparty to tens of trillions in notional derivatives as when they fail the risk of failure is over every derivative they are counterparty to not just the hedged exposure    sorry this is more than you asked for i tend to get carried away
