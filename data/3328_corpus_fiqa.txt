what kind of deductions are you talking about many deductions like the standard itemized deductions come after the agi and do not affect the agi so i do n't see how this would make any difference maybe you are talking about deductions that come before the agi if you want to increase your agi legitimately here 's a way every year itemize deductions on your federal return and over withhold your state income tax assuming your state has income tax by a lot and/or make voluntary extra payments to your state income tax as a result you will get a huge refund on your state taxes the following year then you will need to include this refund as income on line 10 of the federal return that year which will be included in the agi of course you will also be able to deduct a lot of state income tax paid every year in the federal itemized deductions but those come after the agi

i did a little research and found this article from 2006 by a law professor titled no thanks uncle sam you can keep your tax break   the final paragraph of the article says under these circumstances it is reasonable to conclude that a taxpayer is not required to claim a allowable deduction unless a statutory provision so requires or a binding judicial precedent so specifies it would be unwise of course to forego a deduction that the irs considers mandatory such as those claimed by self employed individuals with respect to their self employment     whether for purposes of the self employment tax or the earned income tax credit until the statute is changed or some other binding authority is issued there is no reason taxpayers who wish to forego deductions such as the dependency exemption deduction should hesitate in doing so the self employment tax issues in the quote cited by cqm are explicitly discussed in the article as one of a few special kinds of deduction which are mandatory this is not a binding statement it 's not law or even official irs policy   you could never use it as a defense in the event that this professor turned out to be wrong and the irs decided to go after you anyway   however it is a clear statement from a credible qualified source

legally gods know i would strongly recommend asking the law of stack exchange to advise on that practically what 's the worst that happens they audit you say yeah i could probably have claimed these deductions but i did n't want to is that a problem they decide and either nothing happens or they issue you the unwanted they are n't going to fine you for overpaying unless this would expose something criminal or you 're a public figure and it would be this strikes me as falling firmly within the bounds of no harm no foul

there are many people who have deductions far above the standard deduction but still do n't itemize that 's their option even though it comes at a cost it may be foolish but it 's not illegal   if @littleadv citation is correct the under penalty of perjury type issue what of those filers who file a schedule a but purposely leave off their donations i 've seen many people discuss charity and write that they do not want to benefit in any way from their donation yet still schedule a their mortgage and property tax their returns are therefore fraudulent   i am curious to find a situation in which the taxpayer benefits from such a oversight or better still a cited case where they were charged with doing so i 've offered advice on filings return that was n't truthful when you own a stock and can not find cost basis there are times that you might realize the basis is so low that just entering zero will cost you less than $ 100 in extra tax you are not truthful of course but this kind of false statement is n't going to lead to any issue if it gets noticed within an audit no agent is going to give it more than a moment of time and perhaps suggest you did n't even know the year it was bought but there would be no consequence   my answer is for personal returns i 'm sure for business accuracy to the dollar is actually important

but it goes both ways why should the people care about your business and if it 's sustainable the market will deem it unprofitable if he ca n't support paying his workers living wages    if there are no minimum wages that a person can scrape by on then you have companies taking advantage of people or the business offsetting the cost to the public like tips the public would be subsidizing the business    i think you need to dig deeper into that logic

in your case i think you are doing just fine   index funds by their nature have lower transaction costs and fewer taxable events than actively managed funds good work    index funds do not preclude the generation of dividends and by their nature they probably generate slightly more than actively managed funds    you could take capital gain or dividend or both distributions rather than reinvest them if paying the taxes are a hardship   otherwise look at the taxes you pay as your contributions to these funds   it stinks but this is why 401k ira were rather revolutionary when they were formed   it was a really good deal to not have people 's capital gains eaten by taxes when they occurred   now its old hat but it was pretty darn cool at the time should you prefer rather than vfiax   we ca n't really make the call on that one   which one will perform better after taxes   its anyone 's guess it is kind of a good problem to have

the main reason is that you move from the linear payoff structure to a non linear one this is called convexity in finance with options you can design a payoff structure in almost any way to want it to be for example you can say that you only want the upside but not the downside so you buy a call option it is obvious that this comes at a price the option premium or equivalently you buy the underlying and for risk management reasons buy a put option on top of it as an insurance the price of the put could be seen as the insurance premium you can of course combine options in more complicated ways so that you e.g. profit as long as the underlying moves strongly enough in either direction this is called a straddle

basically what you describe exists in many countries not in the usa though in europe people have checking accounts with allowed overdraft typically three month net salaries you can just this money any day as you like and pay it back completely or partially any day as you like interest is calculated for each day on the amount used that day and the collateral is future income predicted expected from previous income in the usa credit cards have taken its place with stricter different rules and limitations in addition many of the extra rules in loans were invented to take advantage of the ignorance or situation of the borrower to make even more money for example applying extra payments to future due payments instead of to the principal makes that principal produce more interest while the extra payments just sit around

the main point of the article from my perspective was that uber should have fought the laws rather than blatantly ignore them and operate illegally and it 's too late for them to do that   that 's why the author mentioned how the uber ceo initial attack on lyft was a claim that they were operating illegally   although i think the author is wrong for claiming all the tech was coming to the taxi industry anyway yeah right i think the primary conclusion is that uber 's competitive advantage was mainly operating illegally

the first loan looks like it did not have its interest subsidized while you were in school so interest was accruing you did n't have to start making payments on it yet with the $ 73 payment you made the bank is allocating the funds in a pre determined split that is in their best interest not yours while you do need to pay them down and eventually off at the current rate it will take months with no more interest accruing to do so most likely with interest continuing to accrue you 're looking more in the neighborhood of 17 years rather than 14 these are back of the envelope numbers the payoff balance listed is the current principle plus interest that will accrue before the next processing date so it is usually a little higher than the actual balance because the interest is accruing daily albeit in very small percentages of the loan 's percentage

if you were making that large of a payment via a cashiers check or other    withdrawal means from a cash account    to a credit card would the payment    generate a cash transaction report probably yes if it does require the bank to make a ctr then is there any harm in    that or anything to be concerned about    like that transaction appearing    suspicious personal reporting    implications etc are there any    other reasons why one might want to    make sure payments to a credit card    are broken up made in amounts smaller    than $ 10 k you should be concerned if you can not explain the source of the money legally if you withdrew cash from your own account and paid your credit card with it in case of questions asked you can show the account statement with the matching withdrawal and you 're done the point in this report is to point at people who move around large amounts of cash usually people pay credit cards with checks or ach transactions but if you want cash it 's your right as long as the cash was obtained legally but if you 're paying your credit cards off with the cash you got as a bribe or by selling cocaine on the streets then you should be worried by the way breaking into smaller payments may not save you from being reported to the money laundering detection agencies the report is per transaction not per payment so if the credit card statement is $ 11 k and you pay $ 5 k and $ 6 k the transaction is still $ 11k. also the bank can file a report even if it is not required it was clarified in the other answer to the same question you 're referring to if the clerk thinks the transaction is suspicious this leaves the decision on filing a report solely on the banks common sense and internal policies which you do n't know so even paying $ 10 in cash may trigger a report if the bank suspects wrongdoing

your wealth will go up if your effective rate after taxes is less than the inflation rate   that is if your interest rate is r and marginal tax rate is t then you need to be less than inflation to make a loan worth it   lately inflation has been bouncing around between 1 and 1.8   let 's assume a 25 tax rate   is your interest rate lower than between 1.3 and 2.4   if not do n't take out a loan another thing to consider when you take out a loan you have to do a ton of extra stuff to make the lender happy inspections appraisals origination charges etc   these really add up and are part of the closing costs as well as the time trouble of buying a house   i recently bought my house using 100 cash   it was 2 weeks between when i agreed to a price to when the deal was sealed and my realtor said i probably saved about $ 10,000 in closing costs   i think she was exaggerating but it was a lot of time and money i saved   my final closing costs were only a few hundred not thousands of dollars tl;dr loans are for suckers avoid if possible

gt so i asked this question in /r and got some interesting answers mostly about how banks exist to make money out of nowhere and to fool people what do y all have to say   that is n't what they said nobody mentioned fooling people from what i can see from a cursory glance and if they did they 're being facetious   also they did n't mean make money from thin air in the sense of it being a magical trick they make money from a sort of market inefficiency they broker between people who want to invest money and those who want to borrow it   the top two answers are about right a bank borrows money from investors who deposit money in checking and savings accounts and lends it to borrowers in the form of loans or mortgages the difference between the interest rates is their profit   you deposit $ 1000 with me at 2 for 20 years i give you $ at the end of that term where did i get the extra five hundred books well i lent it out in mortgages over the same terms at 6 and received $ over the same period of time your $ 1000 made you $ and made me $ which i keep for the purposes of providing you with atms dealing with bad debts and staffing the place simple eh   of course they also provide other services in addition to this and the way in which they do it is regulated but that 's all a bank is at its core   a central bank is slightly different they issue money i.e. print it and supply it at a headline interest rate to the commercial banks and of course banks borrow amongst themselves but then we get ourselves down the rabbit hole of grown up economics and libor and the like there are whole textbooks used to explain exactly how that mechanism works and what 's going on there   but if you want to get rich find a way to start a bank seriously doing it to the old school way is seriously profitable if you can be trusted

can is fine and other answered that i 'd suggest that you consider the should does your employer offer a matched retirement account typically a 401(k are you depositing up to the match   do you have any higher interest short term debt credit cards car loan student loan etc   do you have 6 months worth of living expenses in liquid funds   one point i like to beat a dead horse over is this for most normal mortgages the extra you pay goes to principal but regardless of how much extra you pay the next payment is still due next month so it 's possible that you are feeling pretty good that for 5 years you pay so much that you have just 10 left on the 30 year loan but if you lose your job you still risk losing the house to foreclosure it 's not like you can ask the bank for that money back   if you are as disciplined as you sound put the extra money aside and only when you have well over the recommended 6 months then make those prepayments if you choose   to pull my comment to into my answer i avoided this aspect of the discussion but here i 'll suggest that a 4 mortgage costs 3 after tax in 25 bracket and i 'd bet cap gain rates will stay 15 for so with the break even return of 3.5 to return 3 after tax and dvy yielding 3.33 the questions becomes do you think the dvy top will be flat over the next 15 years any return over is profit that said the truly risk averse should heed the advise in original answer then pre pay update when asked in april 2012 the dvy i suggested as an example of an investment that beats the mortgage cost traded at $ 56 it 's now $ 83 and still yields to put numbers to this a lump sum $ 100 k would be worth $ k this does n't include dividends and giving off $ in dividends for an after tax $ we happened to have a good 4 years overall the time horizon 15 years makes the strategy low risk if one sticks to it

on your end of the deal the biggest risk is probably counterfeiting that said i 'd think that most of the downside would be for the buyer since they would have no way to prove that they paid you   perhaps a better alternative is to send the items cod collect on delivery aka cash on delivery the usps and some other carriers offer this service which can be an effective way to remotely negotiate a cash sale i double checked the usps site and they do accept cash for cod deliveries recipient may pay by cash or check or money order made out to    sender sender may not specify payment method you might want to double check this if you go with usps or

you did n't answer my questions above but the biggest factor if the two interest rates are similar is what it will cost you for mortgage insurance if you do not include a 20 down payment on your next house purchase i would take the extra money from the proceeds of the other sale to get to a 15-year loan on your next house then put all of your extra money into paying down the student loans ahead of the 7 year schedule

since 2007 the world has seen a period of striking economic and financial volatility featuring the deepest recession since the 1930s despite this gold has performed strongly with its price roughly doubling since the global financial crisis began in 1 gold and real interest rates one of the factor that influences gold prices is real interest rate which is to some extent related to inflation since gold lacks a yield of its own the opportunity cost of holding gold increases with a real interest rate increase and decreases with a fall in real interest rates 2 gold and the us dollar the external value of the us dollar has been a significant influence on short term gold price movements the imf in 2008 that 40 50 of the moves in the gold price    since 2002 were dollar related with a 1 change in the effective    external value of the dollar leading to a more than 1 change in the    gold price source   3 gold and financial stress it is a significant and commonly observed influence on the short term price of gold in periods of financial stress gold demand may rise for a number of    reasons   4 gold and political instability it is another factor that can boost gold prices investor concerns about wars civil conflicts and international    tensions can boost demand for gold for similar reasons to those noted    above for periods of financial stress potential function as a    currency of last in case of serious system collapse provides    a particular incentive to hold it in case the political situation is    especially severe source 5 gold and official sector activity the behaviour of central banks and other parts of the official sector can have an important impact on gold prices   one reason for this is that central banks are big holders of gold    possessing some metric tons in 2010 which is approximately 15    of all above ground gold stocks as a result central bank policies on    gold sales and purchases can have significant effects and these    policies have been subject to considerable shifts over the decades source    source of above graphs

congratulations on earning a great income however you have a lot of debt and very high living expenses this will eat all of your income if you do n't get a hold of it now i have a few recommendations for you   at the beginning of each month write down your income and write down all your expenses for the month include everything rent food utilities entertainment transportation loan payments etc   after you 've made this plan for the month do n't spend any money that 's not in the plan you are allowed to change the plan but you ca n't spend more than your income budgeting software such as ynab will make this easier   you are $ in debt that is a lot a large portion of your monthly budget is loan payments i recommend that you knock those out as fast as possible the interest on these loans makes the debt continue to grow the longer you hold them which means that if you take your time paying these off you 'll be spending much more than $ on your debt minimize that number and get rid of them as fast as possible because you want to get rid of the debt emergency as fast as possible you should reduce your spending as much as you can and pay as much as you can toward the debt pay off that furniture first the interest rate on that free money is going to skyrocket the first time you are late with a payment then attack the student loans stay home and cook your own meals as much as possible you may want to consider moving someplace cheaper   the rent you are paying is not out of line with your income but new york is a very expensive place to live in general   moving might help you reduce your expenses i hope you realize at this point that it was pretty silly of you to borrow $ 4k for a new bedroom set while you were $ in debt you referred to your low interest loans as free money but they really are n't they all need to be paid back ask yourself if you had forced yourself to save up $ 4k before buying the furniture would you still have purchased the furniture or would you have instead bought a used set on craigslist for $ 200 this is the reason that furniture stores offer 0 interest loans they got you to buy something that you could n't afford do n't take the bait again   you did n't mention credit cards so i hope that means that you do n't owe any money on credit cards if you do then you need to start thinking of that as debt and add that to your debt emergency if you do use a credit card commit to only charging what you already have in the bank and paying off the card in full every month ynab can make this easier   $ and $ 90k per year are fairly close to each other when you factor in vacation and holidays that is not including other benefits so any other benefits put the salaried position ahead you said that you have a few more years on your parents health coverage but there is no need to wait until the last minute to get your own coverage health insurance is a huge benefit also in general i would say that salaried positions have better job security this is no guarantee of course anyone can get laid off but as a contractor they could tell you not to come in tomorrow and you 'd be done salaried employees are usually given notice severance pay etc if i were you i would take the salaried position   investing is important but so is eliminating this debt emergency if you take the salaried position one of your new benefits will be a retirement program you can take advantage of that especially if the company is kicking in some money this actually is free money but in my opinion if you treat the debt as an emergency and commit to eliminating it as fast as possible you should minimize your investing at this point if it helps you get out of debt faster after you get out of debt investing should be one of your major goals   now while you are young and have few commitments is the best time to learn to live on a budget and eliminate your debt this will set you up for success in the future

with a $ 40,000 payment there is a 100 chance that the owner will be claiming this as a business expense on their taxes   the irs and the state will definitely know about it and the risk of interest and penalties if it is not claimed as income make the best course of action to see a tax adviser because taxes will not be taken out by the property owner the tax payer should also make sure that the estimated $ 10,000 in federal taxes if they are in the 25 tax bracket does n't trigger other tax issues that could result in penalties or the need to file quarterly taxes next year this kind of extra income could also result in a change or an elimination of a health care subsidy a unexpected mid year   change could trigger the need to refund the subsidy received this year via the tax form next april

so you 're making $ 150,000 per year and you have $ in debts you 're in your late 30s and have $ or less than 1/3 of a year 's pay put away for retirement that 's a bad situation but not disastrous lots of people have recovered from far worse but like the old joke goes when you realize that you 're deep in a hole stop digging the worst thing you could do right now is liquidate the few assets you have and go deeper into debt i do n't know where you live or what the housing market is there but the easy answer is find a cheaper house   i 'm not sure what you mean about affect the resale value yes if you buy a cheaper house it will have a lower resale value so what the days when a house was an investment that would skyrocket in value are over and even in those days it did n't help most people so when you move you get a big profit on the sale of your house but the house you 're moving to probably went up by a similar percentage so you really did n't gain anything even if your house did increase in value unless you sell it that does n't help you make the mortgage payments it 's a paper profit get yourself out of debt step 1 is to stop taking on new debts and if at all possible you should be putting bare minimum 6 into your retirement plan i do n't know where you work but most employers match some percentage of the first 6 you put in if you do n't take advantage of that you 're giving up free money

i 'm sorry you are going through this but what you are dealing with is exactly is how cosigning works   it is among other reasons why you should never cosign a loan for someone unless you are 100 prepared to pay the loan on their behalf unfortunately the main benefit to cosigning a loan is to the bank they do n't care who makes payments only that someone does it is not in their interest to educate purchasers who can easily get themselves into the situation you are in what your options are depends a fair bit on the type of loan it is the biggest problem is that normally as cosigner you can not force your friend to do anything if it is for a car your best bet is to convince them to sell the car and hopefully recoup more than the cost of the loan many workplaces have some sort of free service to provide counseling guidance on this sort of thing look into your employee benefits as you may have some free services there you can sue your friend in small claims court but keep in mind it also depends on how big the loan is relative to your income while it might feel good to sue your friend in small claims court if it 's for $ 500 it probably is n't worthwhile but if your friend just stopped paying off their $ 30k vehicle assuming you will pay for it even though they can pay for it themselves

i 'm having a difficult time understanding how chevron is avoiding taxes through party related loans from my understanding chevron is providing loans to its australian subsidiary at interest rates higher than market benchmarks does this shift profits from australia to the u.s. and how does it help chevron avoid taxes even though the corporate tax rate is higher in the u.s. than in australia they want to be taxed at the the lower tax rate in australia than in the u.s. the more description the better thanks edit i think i understand that chevron is giving out large loans with high interest rates to its subsidiary in australia and i think the australian subsidiary is converting its revenues to pay back the loan thus looking like profit in the corporation 's books in delaware how is the money to pay back interest being raised if not from revenue and how is that revenue not being taxed

unless you are a client with of money i do n't think service like you are asking about is very common and i kind of assume that if you did have the of money you would already have had such a relationship with a brokerage or accountant or similar financial professional when i have taken money from brokerage accounts i have had to call them to ask for it or requested it online for both the only option was to receive a check in the mail made out to the account holder me this usually takes about a week although that does include waiting for the funds to settle after a stock sale which itself is about 3 business days i know a lot of brokerages do have banks affiliated with them and one of the benefits of having a bank account with that affiliated bank is quicker transfers in and out of your bank account but if you are n't willing to do that i do n't think you have many other choices other than receive a check in the mail

it may have been the standard practice for a long time and indeed it still is the common practice for my credit union to apply all excess payment directly to the principal at the risk of sounding a little cynical i will suggest that there is a profit motive in the move to not applying excess payments to principal unless directly instructed to do so interest accrued is n't reduced until the principal is reduced so it benefits the creditor to both have the money in advance and to not apply it to the principal you should probably move forward with the expectation that all of your creditors are even if only in a passive aggressive manner

gt;we should expect the courts to be less corruptible because their proceedings take place in public       why would we expect that reality does n't really suggest that you also completely ignore how money can without actually the court win you a case   money allows you to bury a in the law itself you see it time and time again in environmental lawsuits   sheer wealth alone is enough to win many cases and avoid prosecution to begin with in many other cases dragging it out for years the average person will have little chance as they already do in tackling the larger issues via the court system and in fact many of the larger cases in this country do n't happen completely in public   and removing the government wo n't change that        as for the banks and the banks may have been broke by now without government involvement   the bankers themselves would still be wealthier than most of humanity       government that debates everything in the open        it 's the transparency that 's the issue a big government that debated everything in the open would have most of the same positives and negatives so would a medium government

cart 's answer describes well one aspects of puts protective puts which means using puts as insurance against a decline in the price of shares that you own   that 's a popular use of puts   but i think the wording of your question is for another strategy writing puts consider cart 's strategy refers to the buyer of a put   but on the transaction 's other side is a seller of the put and ultimately somebody created or wrote that put contract in the first place   that first seller of the put that is the seller that is n't just selling one they themselves bought is the put writer when you write a put you are taking on the obligation to buy the other side 's stock at the put exercise price if the stock price falls below that exercise price by the expiry date   for taking on the obligation you receive a premium like how an insurance company charges a premium to insure against a loss example   imagine abc co. stock is trading at $ 25.00   you write a put contract agreeing to buy 100 shares of abc at $ 20.00 per share the exercise price by a given expiration date   say you receive $ premium from the put buyer   you now have the obligation to purchase the shares from the put buyer in the event they are below $ 20.00 per share when the option expires or technically any time before then if the buyer chooses to exercise the option early assuming no early assignment one of two things will happen at the option expiration date abc trades at or above $ 20.00 per share in this case the put option will expire worthless in the hands of the put buyer   you will have pocketed the $ 200 and be from your obligation   this case where abc trades above the exercise price is the maximum profit potential abc trades below $ 20.00 per share   in this case the put option will be assigned and you 'll need to fork over $ 2000 to the put buyer in exchange for his 100 abc shares   if those shares are worth less than $ in the market then you 've suffered a loss to the extent they are below that price times 100 because remember you pocketed $ 200 premium in the first place   if the shares are between $ to $ 20.00 you 're still profitable but not to the full extent of the premium received you can see that by having written a put it 's possible to acquire abc stock at a price lower than the market price because you received some premium in the process of writing your put   if you do n't succeed in acquiring shares on your first write because the shares did n't get below the exercise price you can continue to write puts and collect premium until you do get assigned i have read the book money for nothing and your stocks for free by canadian author derek foster   despite the flashy title the book essentially describes derek 's strategy for writing puts against dividend paying value stocks he would love to own   derek picks quality companies that pay a dividend and uses put writing to get in at lower than market prices   four pillars reviewed the book and interviewed derek foster money for nothing book review and interview with derek foster writing puts entails risk   if the stock price drops to zero then you 'll end up paying the put exercise price to acquire worthless shares   so your down side can easily be multiples of the premium collected   do n't do this until and unless you understand exactly how this works   it 's advanced note also that your broker is n't likely to permit you to write puts without having sufficient cash or margin in your account to cover the case where you are forced to buy the stock   you 're better off having cash to secure your put buys otherwise you may be forced into leverage borrowing when assigned   additional resources the montreal exchange options guide pdf that cart already linked to is an excellent free resource for learning about options   refer to page 39 writing secured put options for the strategy above other major options exchanges and organizations also provide high quality free learning material

a fascinating view on this the math of a 10 deposit and projected 10 return lead to an inevitable point when the account is worth 10x your income nice and the deposit 10 of income only represents 1 of the account balance   the use of an ira is neither here nor there as your proposed deposit is still just 1 of your retirement account total pay off debt for one with this level of savings it should be assumed you are n't carrying any high interest debt   it really depends on your age and retirement budget our number was our final income so at 10x we were still saving for you if you project hitting your number soon enough i 'd still deposit to the match but maybe no more it might be time to just enjoy the extra money for others their goal may be much higher and those extra years deposits are still needed i 'd play with a spreadsheet and see the impact of reduced retirement account deposits note the question asks about funding the 401(k vs paying down debt i 'd always advise to deposit to the match but beyond that one should focus on their high interest debt especially by their 50 's

the product itself is a derivative as it derives its value from another stock or commodity   it 's similar to a us option which offers in the case of a call the right but not the obligation to buy a stock at a predetermined price before a certain date but unlike the us option instead of buying the stock the contract is only closed out in cash i 've made the analogy to betting so i believe it to be a fair comparison i hope this question is theoretical you should never buy a financial instrument with no clue how it works

you could consider turning your current place into a rental property this is more easily done with a fixed rate loan and you said you have an arm the way it would work if you can charge enough rent to cover your current mortgage plus the interest difference on your new mortgage then the income from your rental property can effectively lower the interest rate on your new home    by keeping your current low rate month after month you 'll pay the market rate on your new home but you 'll also receive rental income from your previous home to offset the increased cost granted a lot of your value will be locked up in equity in your former home and not be easily accessible except through a heloc or similar but if you can afford it it is a good possibility

so are you only sexist once you do something about it if you looked at a black applicant and thought the word are you not racist just because you did n't say it and still hires him   and this is n't me trying to be thought police or a sjw despite a few accusations of that in this thread but if you automatically assume that a woman will behave a certain way just because she 's a woman how are you not sexist hiring her does n't change that    but again i find it odd that people state beliefs that are objectively discriminatory but shy away from admitting that they happen to be if you truly feel that men are better workers less prone to gossip and drama then do n't say i 'm not sexist but say i 'm sexist and this is why

have a bank account here you need to have a credit history that is wrong whoever informed you that you do n't need a credit history to open a bank account some banks allow you to open no frills accounts without a credit history i myself opened an account with barclays with my ni card job contract and probably my passport too and i from the eu also the bank that allowed me to open the account does n't allow me to wire transfer my money to another uk account and claims that ll the bank have the same policy for cash accounts is that true i mean is there an actual law that for some reason allow you to transfer your funds why did you read the t&cs chances are that other the account is with a different bank and it always is fishy atleast for banks because of heightened money laundering regulations for people opening accounts and starting to transfer money to accounts with other banks after you have banked with them for certain time you can ask them to upgrade you to a current account which allow these services secondly because it might be a no frills account and they are n't allowed to charge fees they might disallow transfers to other banks and banks generally do n't charge fees for no frills accounts so certain services are disallowed which cost them money i have had a cash account for 4 5 years with barclays and i used to transfer money to other banks but i probably never tried transferring money just after opening an account

you were probably not given stock but stock options   those options have a strike price and you can do some more research on them if needed   lets assume that you were given 5 k shares at a strike of 20 and they vest 20 per year   assume the same thing in your second year and you are going to leave in year three you would have 2 k shares from your year 1 grant and 1 k shares from your year 2 grant so 2 k total if you leave no more shares would be vested if you leave you have one of two options to complicate matters subsequent grants may have different strike prices so perhaps year two grant is at $ 22 per share   however in pre public companies that is not likely the case for a bit of history i worked at a pre ipo company and we were all going to get rich   i was given generous grants but decided to leave   i really wanted to buy my options but simply did n't have the money   shortly after i left the company folded so the money would have been thrown away anyway   when a company is private the motivate their employees with tales of riches but they are not required to disclose financial data   this company did a very good job of convincing employees that all was fine when it was n't also i received options in a publicly traded company   myself and other employees received options that were underwater or worth far less than the strike price   you could let them expire so one did not owe money but they were worthless hopefully that answers your question

so my question is is my credit score going to be hit   yes it will affect your credit   not as much as missing payments on the debt which remains even if the credit line is closed and not as much as missing payments on other bills    if so what can i do about it   not very much   nothing worth the time it would take   like you mentioned the account or opening another would likely require a credit check and the inquiry will add another negative factor    in this situation consider the impact on your credit as fact and the best way to correct it is to move forward and pay all your bills on time   this is the number one key to improving credit score    so right now the key task is finding a new job this will enable you to make all payments on time   if you pay on time and do not overspend your credit score will be fine can i contact the creditors to appeal the decision and get them to not affect my score at the very least i know they wo n't restore the account without another credit check is there anything that can be done directly with the credit score companies depending on how they characterize the closing of the account it may be mostly a neutral event that has a negative impact than a negative event   by negative events i 'm referring to bankruptcy charge offs and collections   so the best way to recover is to keep credit utilization below 30 and pay all your bills and debt payments on time you seem to be asking how to replace this line of credit to help you through your unemployment as for the missing credit line and your current finances you have to find a way forward   opening new credit account while you 're not employed is going to be very difficult if not impossible   you might find yourself in a situation where you need to take whatever part time gig you can find in order to make ends meet until your job search is complete   grocery store fast food wait staff delivery driver etc and once you get past this period of unemployment you 'll need to catch up on all bills then you 'll want to build your emergency fund   you do n't mention one but eating paying rent mortgage keeping current on bills and paying debt payments are the reasons behind the emergency fund and the reason you need it in a liquid account    source   i 'm a veteran of decades of bad choices when it comes to money of being unemployed for periods of time of credit cards and generally being irresponsible with my income and savings   i 've done all those things and am now paying the price   in order to rebuild my credit and provide for my retirement i 'm having to work very hard to save   my focus being financial health not credit score i 've brought my bottom line from approximately 25k in the red up to about 5k in the red   the first step was getting my payments under control    i have also been watching my credit score   two years of on time mortgage payments gradual growth of score   paid off student loans uptick in score   opened new credit card with 0 intro rate to consolidate a couple of store line of credit accounts   transferred those balances   big uptick   next month when utilization on that card hits 90 that took back a year 's worth of gains   however financially i 'm not losing 50 100 a month to interest tldr at certain times you have to ignore the credit score and focus on the important things   this is one of those times for you   find a job   get back on your feet   then look into living debt free or working to achieve financial independence

bush tax cuts and similarly we no longer believe that the wealthy have to play by the rules we perpetuate this notion because too many believe they too will be of great wealth    the wealthy in turn have invested in emerging markets like china or commodities like gold basically its being by the wealthy and banks    in a fixed money system like monopoly what happens someone wins and gets all the money with inflation at least they are making more money so that eventually a huge withdrawl of cash from the system is because monopoly was meant to be a cautionary tale of oligarchy

inflows to the us equity market can come from a variety of sources for instance you were paid a year end bonus and decided to invest it in us equities instead of foreign equities bonds savings or debt reduction you sold foreign equities bonds or other non us equities and decided to invest in us equities you decided a better use of cash in a savings account cd or money market fund was to invest in us equities if for every buyer there 's a seller does n't that also mean that    there were $ in outflows in the same time period not necessarily generally the mentions we see of inflows and outflows are net that is the gross investment in us equities minus gross sales of us equities equals net inflows or outflows the mere fact that i sold my position in say caterpillar does n't mean that i had to re invest in us equities i may have bought a bond or a cd or a house because of fluctuations in existing stocks market value bankruptcies and new issues us equities never are and never will be a zero sum game

i 'm not entirely sure about some of the details in your question since i think you meant to use $ 10,000 as the value of the futures contract and $ 3 as the value of the underlying stock those numbers would make more sense that being said i can give you a simple example of how to calculate the profit and loss from a leveraged futures contract for the sake of simplicity i 'll use a well known futures contract the e mini s&p500 contract each e mini is worth $ 50 times the value of the s&p 500 index and has a tick size of 0.25 so the minimum price change is 0.25 $ 50 = $ 12.50   here 's an example say the current value of the s&p500 is 1,600 the value of each contract is therefore $ 50 1,600 = $ 80,000 you purchase one contract on margin with an initial margin of 5 or $ 4,000 if the s&p 500 index rises to the value of your futures contract increases to $ 50 = $ once you return the 80,000 4,000 = $ that you borrowed as leverage your profit is = $ 4,500   since you used $ 4,000 of your own funds as an initial margin your profit excluding commissions is 4,500 4,000 = $ 500 which is a = 12.5 return if the index dropped to the value of your futures contract decreases to $ 50 = $ after you return the $ in leverage you 're left with $ 3,000 or a net loss of 3,000 = the math illustrates why using leverage increases your risk but also increases your potential for return consider the first scenario in which the index increases to if you had forgone using margin and spent $ 80,000 of your own funds your profit would be 80,000 = this is smaller than your leveraged profit by a factor of 20 the inverse of the margin requirement .05 = 12.5 in this case the use of leverage dramatically increased your rate of return   however in the case of a decrease you spent $ 80,000 but gained $ for a loss of only 1.25 this is 20 times smaller in magnitude than your negative return when using leverage by forgoing leverage you 've decreased your opportunity for upside but also decreased your downside risk 1 for futures contracts the margin requirements are set by the exchange which is cme group in the case of the e mini the 5 in my example is higher than the actual margin requirement which is currently $ usd per contract but it keeps the numbers simple also note that cme group refers to the initial margin as the performance bond instead

most financial advisors are actually financial product salesmen   their job is to sweet talk you into parting with as much money as possible either in management fees or in commissions kickbacks on high fee investment products which come from fees charged to you inside the investment   this is a cutthroat business for the salesmen themselves   realistically that is how they feed their family and i empathize but i ca n't afford to buy their product   i wish they would sell something else these people prey on people 's financial lack of knowledge   for instance you put too much importance on returns   why   because the salesman told you that 's important   it 's not   the market goes up and down that 's normal   the question is how much of your investment is being consumed by fees   how do you tell that and generally if you 're invested well   you compare your money 's performance to an index that 's relevant to you   you 've heard of   the s&p 500 that 's an index relevant to us investors   take 2015 the s&p 500 was $ on january 2 2015   it was $ on december 31 2015   so it was flat   it dropped 0.7 if your us investments dropped 0.7 you broke even   if you made less that was lost to the expenses within the investment or the investment performing worse than the s&p 500 index   i lost 0.8 in 2015 the extra 0.1 being expenses of the investment try 2013 s&p 500 was $ on december 28 2012 and $ on dec. 27 2013 that 's growth   that 's amazing but it also means is holding even with the market   if your salesman proudly announced that you made 18 problem all this to say when you say the investments performed poorly do n't go by absolute numbers find a suitable index and compare to the index   a lot of markets were down in 2015 16 and that is not your investment 's fault   you want to know if were down compared to your index    because that reflects either a lousy funds manager or high fees    this may leave you wondering where can i invest that is safe and has sensible fees   i do n't know your market but here we have discount brokers which allow self selection of investments charge no custodial fees and simply charge by the trade commonly $ 10   many mutual funds and etfs are index funds with very low annual fees 0.20 1 in 500 or even less     how do you pick investments look at any of numerous books starting with john bogle 's classic common sense on mutual funds book which is the seminal work on the value of keeping fees low   if you need the cool confident professional to hand hold you through the process a fee only advisor is a true financial advisor who actually acts in your best interest   they honestly recommend what 's best for you but beware many commission driven salespeople pretend to be fee only advisors   the good advisor will be happy to advise investment types and let you pick the brand fidelity vs vanguard and buy it in your own discount brokerage account with a password you do n't share frankly finance is not that hard   but it 's made hard by impossibly complex products that do n't need to exist and are designed to confuse people to conceal hidden fees   avoid those products   you just do n't need them   now you really need to take a harder look at what this investment is like i say they make these things unnecessarily complex specifically to make them confusing and i am confused   although it does n't seem like much of a question to me   1.5 a quarter is 6 a year or 60 in 10 years to ignore compounding if the market grows 6 a year on average so growth just pays the fees they will consume 60 of the $ 220,000 or $   as far as the $ 60,000 for that kind of money it 's definitely worth talking to a good lawyer because it sounds like they misrepresented something to get your friend to sign up in the first place   put some legal pressure on them that $ 60k penalty might get a lot smaller    for instance they 'll recommend which has a 5.25 buy in fee front end load and a 1.23 per year fee expense ratio compare to with zero load and a 0.20 fee   that front end load is kicked back to your broker as commission so he literally ca n't recommend there 's no commission his company would and should fire him for doing so

just from my own experience i am not an accountant in addition to counting as business income 1040 line 12 1 your $ 3000 or whatever will be subject to ~15 self employment tax on schedule se   this carries to your 1040 line which is after all your adjustments to income exemptions and deductions so those do n't reduce it   half of the 15 is deductible on line if you have enough taxable income for it to matter but in any case you will owe at least 1/2 of the 15 on top of your regular income tax your husband could deduct this payment as a business expense on schedule c but if aiui he will have a loss already he 'll get no benefit from this in the current year    if you do count this as income to you it will be fica income so it will be credited to your social security account things outside my experience that might bear looking into   i suspect the irs has criteria to determine whether spousal payments are legit or just gaming the tax system   even if your husband ca n't use the loss this year he may be able to apply it in the future when if he has net business income 1 nb any tax form line numbers are as of the last i looked they may be off by one or two

for now we can pay off our debt in united states dollars if we lose our reserve currency status we would have to pay it off with a different currency if we continued printing money we would be our currency against the new reserve currency which would mean that after we took on too much debt we would n't really be able to pay our creditors back after exchanging our devalued currency for the new one on the international markets we are lucky enough not to have to worry about this now but i think op was referring to all countries in these situations other countries do n't have the luxury of just printing out massive amounts of money to pay off their debts that is why i am saying that america has a very view of reality when it comes to deficit spending we would n't have that any more if the un followed through with its suggestion to create a global reserve currency or reverted back to the gold standard i do n't think the second option is nearly as realistic but we never know

my dad owned a steel drum barrel recycling company where we would get barrel from food companies and them sometimes we would get drums from one company for free and they would call us to buy drums many times we would sell them the same drums that we got from them for free that 's the beauty of recycling    after some time we started doing plastic drums and we had to find a way to salvage the plastic drums that we were not able to refurbish so we started contacting plastic companies and started talking to a company in middle tennessee     he was a huge plastic processor that was shipping hundreds of thousands tons of plastic every week he was from india and had a huge plant about 70 miles from memphis were i was living he would process the plastic rods or here in the u.s. and ship them too be made into products in india i was in the process of securing a processing machine from him one from a company in northern california and one from a company in florida all three where going to place a processing machine in my dads plant in memphis and create a coast to coast pipeline with memphis as the center point they where going to let us pay for the machinery by paying us to process a percentage of their plastic since much of it was coming through memphis that way all they had to do was ship the material once it arrived from our plant since memphis is the gateway to the west and a main truck route it was perfect    this type of arrangement is easy to make if you can convince the major players that you can deliver their product as promised i also made arrangements with the processor close to me to relocate 2 of his employees to memphis to manage the equipment until we got failure with the equipment and act as for him he was agreeing to everything i asked because it would have relieve production pressure off his employees and help him with his bottom line    make sure you investigate the type of machines you need to process the many types of plastics your processor needs or wants there are different types of plastics and different ways of processing it    1 pet polyethylene 2 high density polyethylene 3 pvc 4 low density polyethylene 5 pp 6 ps   i also know that california has a lot of air quality laws what i would do is get to know your local epa reps and run your plans by them they will be able to tell you all you can and ca n't do also you processor is going to want to see your feasibility study and business plan before he does this type of arrangement once you let me know if this is something that you are still interested in doing i will send you my old business plan      here is a video to really get an idea of what 's involved

you can technically initiate an ach transaction debit or credit with just the routing number and the account number as a consumer most banks will not allow you doing this without some sort of verification of authority but if you have a direct ach access like many do you can do that and nothing will stop you you can also print checks with the account routing info on them and use them that said these actions are illegal and reversible people who do this are usually making sting operations where they deposit forged checks and withdraw the money in cash quickly before the check bounces back as a fake the loss is then on the bank that allowed them depositing the checks that 's why new accounts usually have much longer holds on deposits than older established ones

we considered similar big renovations when putting our house on the market the answer turns out to be pretty simple unless you do renovation type work as your day job or have really good friends in the residential contracting business sell as is you will virtually never get back the full price of bringing in a gen con to renovate any space in your home you do that when you want to spend the extra to make your home exactly what you wanted so you can live in it for decades and get the enjoyment out of it if you 're trying to turn a profit with the renovation like house flippers do professionally you look for easy repairs buy good looking but inexpensive materials and do the labor yourself whether you sell to the market or to a specifically interested buyer is your call but i will caution you that a specifically interested buyer is going to be looking for a deal or a steal   when marketing our house we met with three different realtors the first one was very about what we could list for basically assuming that we could get the same price as a fully upgraded version of our same floor plan with a pool out back she also had a to do list a mile long and my wife and i both noticed that she looked very apprehensive about the house when looking around even as she us that selling it would be no trouble we eventually realized why she was so apprehensive and fired her before we got even halfway through her to dos which included major landscaping new kitchen floors and etc which would have cost us thousands and would not have gotten the house price even close to the target the second one took a look at our half finished and told us to stop everything we were doing to update the minor stuff like paint and fixtures saying we were putting on a pig she would market the house to some cash buyers she knew personally for about 80 of the list price our first realtor quoted and implied that we should be kissing her boots for finding us a buyer willing to take the house off our hands at all during the tour she pointed out problems with the house that were n't even there like foundation issues such as sloping floors in an attempt to scare us into going with her strategy we that out pretty quickly showed her the door at the end of the initial consult and never called back this by the way is the kind of thing you want to avoid unless your home is really dilapidated or torn apart with unfinished major it should have decent value on the market and you should n't have to resort to a cash buyer looking for a flip or a rental property on the cheap just like our third choice was just right he saw all the same comparables our house and recommended that we offer about $ 20k less than the fully upgraded version but still about $ 20k more than the second realtor was estimating targeting a real buyer and not an investor or flipper but at a price that would make the lack of upgrades more acceptable we finished the paint and finish projects we started brought in a weekend 's worth of scheduled and our house was under contract for full price within 3 days giving us the extra $ 20k worth of down payment to put into our new house in summary i highly recommend a realtor because the one we eventually listed with worked his butt off on the business side while we fixed up the house however make sure you find the right one realtors are ultimately in business for themselves and their ultimate interest is in getting your house sold and getting you into a new one that is what gets them paid some of them will do it the right way working the deal with other realtors and their prospective buyers to get you what you need others will take the easy way out at your expense either giving you bad advice about how to present and price your home so that you end up on the market for 6 months with no offers or handing your house to their business buddies at a discount

does it mean uncontrolled severe deflation inflation is more likely to    occur compared to normal currencies such as usd eur etc look at the chart referenced in the link in your question   it took approximately 50 years for annual production of gold to double from 500 tons to 1000 tons   it took approximately 40 years for annual production to double from 1000 tons to 2000 tons compare that to the production of us dollars by the federal reserve see chart below obtained from here   us dollar production doubled in days   which one do you think will lead to uncontrolled inflation deflation update why did i include a chart of the fed 's balance sheet   because this is the way newly printed money is introduced the fed will purchase something from banks mortgage backed securities us treasuries etc with newly printed money   the banks can then loan this money to people who then deposit the money into other banks who loan those deposits to other people and so on   this is how the fractional reserve process expands the money supply   this is why i did not include a chart of the money supply since that is counting the same money multiple times   if i deposited 100 newly minted coins into a bank and that bank proceeded to loan out 80 of my coins where 80 are deposited into another bank who then proceeds to loan out 60 of the coins and so on the production of coins only changed by the initial 100 that i minted not by the fractional reserve multiple there are historical examples of inflation with gold and silver as duff has pointed out   none of them come close in magnitude to the inflation experienced with government fiat money

i think you may be drawing the wrong conclusion about why you put what type of investment in a taxable vs. tax advantaged account it is not so much about risk but type of return if you 're investing both tax advantaged and taxable accounts you can benefit by putting more tax inefficient investments inside your tax advantaged accounts some aggressive asset types like real estate can throw off a lot of taxable income if your asset allocation calls for investing in real estate holding it in a 401k or ira can allow more of your money to remain invested rather than having to use it to pay for taxes and if you 're holding in a roth ira you get that tax free but bonds a decidedly non aggressive asset also throw off a lot of taxable income you 're able to hold them in a tax advantaged account and not pay taxes on the income until you withdraw it from the account or tax free in the case of a roth account an aggressive stock fund that is primarily expected to provide returns via price appreciation would do well in a taxable account because there 's likely little tax consequence to you until it is sold

the number one rule of thumb that will generally answer the is it taxable question for any money you may have or receive did you pay taxes on it already pretty much any money you actually get in your paycheck dd has already been taxed or at least the projected amount of tax has been withheld is your money to dispense with as you will or according to your pre arranged obligations for most of it deposits paid are one such example if you wrote a check or obtained a money order that they then cashed that 's still your money until it is n't the contract states that it is being held effectively in escrow though the landlord has free use of it so long as he can pony up according to the contract anything not used to pay for damages is yours and you get it back the atm fee refund is trickier but basically this is a benefit offered to you as a service by your bank you front for the atm fees incurred when withdrawing and then those fees are refunded to you by your bank effectively increasing the number of atms you can withdraw from for free as long as there is no net income it 's treated like a mail in rebate you did n't gain any money so there 's nothing new to tax there are a couple of specific exceptions to this otherwise overarching rule of thumb one is roth iras typically on investments you either pay income tax on the money going in and capital gains tax on the money coming out or you pay nothing going in and income tax coming out with a roth however you pay income tax going in and nothing coming out even though you 're eventually getting back more than you put in   another is gifts whoever gave you the gift paid the taxes on it or the money to buy it however if they give you a gift valued more than a certain limit changes every year and there 's a lifetime limit they have to pay an additional gift tax of 35 on any amount over the limit that 's taxing taxed income usually   there are other examples but for the overwhelming majority of situations if it 's money you already had after any and all applicable taxes it 's not taxable even if you have n't seen that money for a while

see publication 505 specifically the section on annualized income installment method which says if you do not receive your income evenly throughout the year for example your income from a repair shop you operate is much larger in the summer than it is during the rest of the year your required estimated tax payment for one or more periods may be less than the amount figured using the regular installment method the publication includes a worksheet and explanation of how to calculate the estimated tax due for each period when you have unequal income   if you had no freelance income during a period you should n't owe any estimated tax for that period however the process for calculating the estimated tax using this method is a good bit more complex and confusing than using the short method in which you just estimate how much tax you will owe for the year and divide it into four equal pieces   therefore in future years you might want to still use the equal payments method if you can swing it   it 's too late for this year since you missed the april deadline for the first payment   if you can estimate the total amount of freelance income you 'll receive even though you might not be able to estimate when you 'll receive it you can probably still use the simpler method   if you really have no idea how much money you 'll make over the year you could either use the more complex computation or you could use a very high estimate to ensure you pay enough tax and you 'll get a refund if you pay too much

the answer is in your question derivatives are contracts so are enforced in the same way as any other contract   if the counterparty refuses to pay immediately they will in the first instance be billed by any intermediary prime broker etc that facilitated the contract if they still refuse to pay the contract may stipulate that a broker can net off any outstanding payments against it or pay out using deposited cash or posted margins the contract will usually include the broker as an interested party and so they can but do n't need to report a default such that this is to credit agencies in some jurisdictions they are required to by law any parties to the trade and the courts may use a debt collection agency to collect payments or seize assets to cover payment if there is no broker or the counterparty still has not paid the bill then the parties involved the party to the trade and any intermediaries can sue for breach of contract if they win which would be expected the counterparty will be made to pay by the legal system including but not limited to seizure of assets enforced bankruptcy and prison terms for any of court rulings all of this holds for governments who refuse to pay derivatives losses as argentina did in the early 20th century but in that case it may escalate as far as war it has never done so for derivatives contracts as far as i know but other breaches of contract between countries have resulted in armed conflict as well as the hard results of failing to pay there are soft implications including a guaranteed fall in credit ratings that will result in parties refusing to do business with the counterparty and a separate loss of reputation that will reduce business even further potential employees and will be unwilling to become involved with such a party and suppliers will be unwilling to supply on credit the end result in almost every way would be bankruptcy and prison sentences for the party or their senior employees most jurisdictions allow for board members at companies in material breach of contract to be banned from running any company for a set period as well edit netting off cash flows netting off is a process whereby all of a party 's cash flows positive and negative are used to pay each other off so that only the net change is reflected in account balances for example company 1 cash flows netting off the total outgoings are 3 m + 500k = 3.5 m and total are 1.2 m + 1.1 m + 1.2 m = 3.5 m so the incoming cash flows can be used to pay the outgoing cash flows leaving a net payment into 's account of 0

it is normally a bad idea to cash in retirement accounts to buy a house in your case it is a horrible idea because you are way behind on saving for retirement other fallacies in your reasoning    my advice increase the amount you are saving for retirement considerably and also put some money aside to save for a down payment on a house buy the house when you have enough non retirement money to afford the down payment if you ca n't wait that long buy a house you can afford it may help to think of it this way visualize yourself as a 65 year old retired person with very little income and living on your retirement account would you as a 39 year old ask that person to give you $ the amount you are talking about withdrawing compounded annually at 6 interest for 25 years with no additional contributions so that you could put a down payment on a house because that is what you would be doing when you hit retirement age would you kick yourself for making such a decision because unless you die young that person is sitting out there in your future needing that money to live off of do n't take this the wrong way but the tone of your question seems like you are looking for support to make what you already know is a bad financial decision

what do you think is a reasonable rate of return a reasonable rate really breaks down into three things opportunity cost what you need and risk appetite opportunity cost comes into play because whatever returns you make should at least exceed after expenses the next best option   typically the next best option is the risk free return you can get somewhere else which is typically a savings account or some other safe investment vehicle e.g. a guaranteed investment certificate gic bonds etc   but this opportunity cost could also be an alternative investment e.g. an index etf which is not necessarily risk free but it may represent the next best option risk appetite comes down to the amount of risk you are willing to take on any investment and is completely subjective   this is typically how much can you sleep with losing amount what you need is the most subjective element   all things being equal e.g. identical risk profiles access to same next best thing to invest in if your cost of living expenses are only expected to go up 2 per year but mine are expected to go up 3 per year then my reasonable rate of return must exceed 3 but yours must only exceed 2 that said an appropriate return is whatever works for you period   nobody can tell you otherwise for your own investing what you can do is measure yourself against a benchmark   e.g. if your benchmark is the s&p 500 then the s&p 500 spdr etf is your opportunity cost e.g. what you would have made if you did n't do your own investing    in that way you are guaranteed the market return caveat the market return is not guaranteed to be positive as an aside do n't ever ever ever let someone else handle your money unless you want somebody else have your money there is nothing wrong with letting someone else handle your money provided you can live with the triple constraint above   investing takes time and effort and time and effort equals opportunity   if you can do something better with the time and effort you would spend to do your own investing then by all means do it   think about it if you have to spend 1 day a month managing your own investments but that day costs you $ 100 in foregone income e.g. you are a sole proprietor so every day is a working day that is $ 1,200 per year   but if you can find an investment advisor who will manage your books for you and costs you only $ 500 per year what is the better investment   if you do it yourself you are losing $ 1,200   if you pay someone you are losing $ 500   clearly it is cheaper to outsource despite what everyone says not everyone can be an investor   not everyone wants to live with the psychological emotional and mental effort of looking up stocks buying them and then second guessing themselves they are more than happy to pay someone to do that which also lets them point the finger at that person later if things go sideways

yes as you are indian resident for tax purposes you have to pay tax in india for the amount you have earned in singapore so essentially add the income from 1st april to mid 2014 with the eq sgd earned in singapore till 31st march 2015 apply the tax brackets like you normally do claim the exemptions you would normally do 80 c etc as india and singapore has a dual tax avoidance treaty you can claim the portion the tax already paid in singapore and pay only the balance for example if the tax works out to be rs 30 you have already paid rs 20 in singapore you would have to pay only rs 10 in india and mention that you have already paid rs 20 to singapore irs it is irrelevant whether you transfer the funds to india or not the tax is applicable in the financial year you have earned more on dtaa

well if 's scenario comes to pass it wo n't be rewarded   or at least i wo n't have to watch it there being ^ 23 other shows to queue up instead   i think a large part of the reason reality shows persist is that there are a limited number of channels so if you are n't watching sports etc you have to settle for this garbage sooner or later   also it may be true that they save them money but i ca n't imagine that they command the advertiser money that a real good popular show does so they really do n't want to shift to them full time   thus we have this crap situation try a show idea then pull the plug and substitute something else   when gravity fails was shaping up finally when they pulled it   boy was my wife ever mad   personally i have gone out of my way to avoid anything that starting w/ the first season of survivor   i feel the same way about the plethora of cop doctor lawyer other formula shows too

what he said was   term returns show fat tails in their distribution   this means that in the short run rare events in the stock market like huge up and downswings happen much more often than you would expect given the circumstances   term returns converge towards a gaussian distribution    this means that long term changes in stock prices show about the level of swings you would expect to see   gt;the authors think there 's a connection between this and the long memory of i.e. that the of absolute volatilities also has a fat tail   auto correlation is the idea that an event is closely related or depends upon a previous event   it should n't be a surprise that prices can depend on previous prices   contrast this with a coin toss   each time you toss the coin the result is independent of any previous result   normally you would use an estimate of auto correlation to test the randomness of your time series   unless you have good reason to do otherwise you use the standard normal or gaussian distribution to do so   some previous study or perhaps this one may have found that the distribution of their auto correlation estimates for volatility change in prices   is not normally distributed but rather that extreme values happen more often than would be expected fat tail   these guys find a correlation between the short term return fat tails the normally   distributed long term returns and a previous finding that the auto correlation of volatility may have fat tails and they think that these things could be more than simply coincidence

to be honest i do n't know how any of this work in the us so my answer will be of very limited value to yourself i suspect but when it comes to the uk if you 're going to get the same pay gross either way than being independent makes very little sense   running your own business is hassle is generally more risky although possibly not in your case and costs money some of the most obvious costs are the added ni probably the need for an accountant at around £ 1200 p a for basic accountancy service you are obliged by law to have liability insurance and you probably want professional indemnity insurance this will be around £ 600 p a and so on and so forth   on top of that anyway as a contractor you really should n't be getting any benefits from the client and so health insurance company car even parking are all meant to be arranged by and paid by your company and ca n't or rather should n't be charged to the client so i would say if you 're seriously thinking about setting up a consultancy company and this client is first of many set up a company but take into account the sums you need to earn if you 're really thinking about employment be an employee

generally if you are trend trading and if the market as a hole is going up strongly and an individual stock is falling sharply on the same day i would tend to stay away from buying that stock at the moment the market is showing strength whilst at the same time the stock is showing weakness the general rule of thumb for trend trading is to buy rising stocks in a rising market or you could look to short sell falling stocks in a falling market

in practice most maybe all stock indices are constructed by taking a weighted average of stock prices denominated in a single currency and so the index implicitly does have that currency as you suggest us dollars for the s&p 500 in principle you can buy one unit of the s&p 500 for $ or whatever by buying an appropriate quantity of each of its constituent stocks also in a more realistic scenario where you buy an index via a tracker fund you would typically need to buy using the underlying currency of the index and your returns will be relative to that currency if the index goes up by 10 your original investment in dollars is up by 10

regarding interest on idle cash   brokerage firms must maintain a segregated account on the brokerage firm 's books to make sure that the client 's money and the firm 's money is not intermingled and clients funds are not used for operational purposes source    thus brokerage firms do not earn interest on cash that is held unused in client accounts regarding exchanges pay firm for liquidity i am not aware of any circumstances under which an exchange will pay a brokerage any such fee   in fact the opposite is the case   exchanges charge participants to transact business see how the nyse makes money similarly market makers do not pay a broker to transact business on their behalf   they charge the broker a commission just like the broker charges their client a commission   of course a large broker may also be acting as market maker or deal directly with the exchange in which case no such commission will be incurred by the broker   in any case the broker will pay a commission to the clearing house

there is really much simpler explanation for the interest rate differences in different countries it is the interest rate arbitrage it is a very well explored economic concept so you can look it up on the internet in case you want to know more 1 interest rates for the same currency in different countries basically as one smart person here pointed out there is only one price of money in free market economy it happens because investors can move their money anywhere in the world to capitalize on the local interest rates advantage for instance if i can take a loan in the usa at 3 4 annual interest and receive 5 6 annual income on my dollar deposit in russia i would take a loan in the us and open a deposit in russia to enjoy a risk free interest rate differential income of 2 5 6 3 4 ~ 2 so would any reasonable person however in real world very few banks in russia or anywhere would pay you an an interest rate higher than it can borrow money at it 'd probably lose money if it 'd do so anyways the difference between the risk free rate and interest rate on the dollar deposit can be attributed to the risk premium of this particular bank the higher expected return the greater risk premium if there is a positive difference in the interest rates on the dollar deposits in different countries it will almost entirely accounted for the risk premium it is generally much riskier to keep money in say russian bank than american that 's why investors want greater return on their dollar deposits in russian banks than in american of course if you 'd want to park your usd in russian bank you 'd also have to consider transaction costs so as you may have already guessed there is no free lunch 2 interest rates in different currencies for different countries if we are talking about the interest rates in different sovereign currencies it is a somewhat similar concept only there is more risk if you keep money in local currency risk premium is much higher probably the biggest component of this risk is inflation that is only attributed to the prices in local currency for that reason current interest rates on deposits in russian rubles are at 10 12 but only 1 3 in the us dollars an economic concept that discusses this phenomenon in great detail is interest rate parity   hope this was helpful p.s. it does n't look quite realistic that you can get an 8 annual income for usd deposit in russia with the interest rates in the u.s. being at 1 2 at present moment a 30-year mortgage annual interest rate in the us is at ~2 3 and an annual interest rates for dollar deposits in one of the safest russian banks = very little risk premium is at 1 3 so arbitrage is impossible

for all stocks expected dividends are a part of the price it is traded for consider that originally the whole idea of stocks was to participate in the earnings of the company = get dividends the day the dividend is paid that expectation is of course removed and thereby the stock value reduced by just the amount of dividend paid you will see that behavior for all stocks everywhere the dividend in your example is just high relative to the stock price but that is a company decision they can decide whatever amount they want as a dividend in other words the day before dividend payments investors value the stock at $ plus an expected dividend payment of 12 $ which adds to 26 $ the day after the dividend payment investors still value the stock at $ plus no more dividend payment = 0 $ nothing changed really in the valuation

mostly ditto to sarwate let me just add i do n't know how you 're making your payments whether through the biller 's web site your bank 's web site by mail in person etc but whatever the mechanism if there is a chance that waiting until the due date to pay may mean that you will miss the due date do n't the cost of a late payment charge is likely to far exceed any interest you would collect on your savings bear in mind that we are talking pennies here i do n't know how much the monthly bills that we are discussing here come to say it 's $ 3,000 i think that would be a lot for most people you say you 're getting 3.6 on your savings so if on the average you pay a bill 2 weeks later than you might have you 're getting an extra 2 52 x 3.6 x $ 3,000 in interest or $ 4 per month i think the last time i paid a late fee on a credit card it was $ 35 so if you make one mistake every 8 months and end up getting a late fee it will outweigh any savings   personally i pay most of my bills through either my bank 's web site or the biller 's web site i schedule all payments when i get a paycheck and i generally try to schedule them for 1 week before the due date so there 's plenty of breathing room

do you have a separate bank account for your business   that is generally highly recommended i have a credit card for my single member llc   i prefer it this way because it makes the separation of personal and business expenses very clear using a personal credit card but using it for only business expenses seems to be a reasonable practice   you may be able to do one better though for your sole proprietorship you can file a dba which establishes the business name   the details of this depend on your state   with a dba i believe you can open a bank account in the name of your business and you may also be able to open a credit card account in the name of the business   i 'm not sure what practical difference it makes but it does make the personal business distinction clearer   though at that point you might as well just do the llc

specific stock advice is n't permitted on these boards i 'm discussing the process of a call spread with the apple jan 13 calls as an example   in effect you have $ 10 to bet each bet you 'd construct offers a different return odds for example if you bought the $ 750 call at $ you 'd need to look to find what strike has a bid of $ 27 or higher the $ is bid $ so this particular spread is a 4 to 1 bet the stock will close in january over $ with a $ 760 break even   you can pull the number from yahoo to a spreadsheet to make your own chart of spread costs but i 'll give one more example   you think it will go over $ 850 and that strike is now ask $ the highest strike currently listed is $ and it 's bid $ so this spread cost is $ 850 and a close over $ returns $ 8000 or over 9 to 1   again this is not advice just an analysis of how spreads work note any anomalies in the pricing above is the effect of a particular strike having no trades today not every strike is active so last trade can be days old    note my answer adds to 's response in that once you used the word bet and showed a desire to make a risky move options are the answer you acknowledged you understand the basic concept but given the contract size of 100 shares these suggestions are ways to bet under your $ 1000 limit and profit from the gain in the underlying stock you hope to see

assuming united states rules may be wildly different elsewhere the family loan trick essentially lets you amortize a gift over multiple years of gift allowance and hopefully dodge gift tax at the cost of having to pay income tax on the interest you must charge on the loan the main advantage is that it lets you transfer all the money up front rather than in $ year per person per person chunks let 's take the normal case first any one person can give any one person up to a specified amount currently $ 17k i believe without incurring gift tax note that this is counted per person not per household you and your spouse could each give $ 17k per year to each of your son and his spouse under this rule adding up to $ per year total   the family loan dodge consists of making them a loan of the money at the mandated minimum interest rate to make it a legal loan something like 0.3 apr last time i looked setting the repayment schedule so their payments each year including interest come out to less than you can gift them with tax free and then making that gift by paying yourself those payments on their behalf you do need to pay income tax on the portion of those payments that represents interest income but at that low rate this is a minor cost for the convenience you 'd also want to set up your will to cover what happens if you die with them still owing money on the loan and this i believe is where you will really need expert advice if you go this route to minimize the government 's cut at that time there may be better answers if you are talking about this much money you owe it to yourself to purchase expert advice from someone who has training and experience n this area rather than taking free advice from the internet that is likely to cost you much more in the long run this is a situation where you ca n't afford not to hire a pro for example i have no idea how trusts might or might not fit your needs

there are way too many details missing to be able to give you an accurate answer and it would be too localized in terms of time location anyway the rules change every year and your local taxes make the answer useless to other people instead here 's how to figure out the answer for yourself use a tax estimate calculator to get a ballpark figure and keep in mind that these only provide estimates because there are still a lot of variables that are only considered when you 're actually filling out your real tax return there are a number of calculators if you search for something like tax estimator calculator some are more sophisticated than others fair warning i used several of these and they told me a range of $ 2k $ 25k worth of taxes owed for a situation like yours here 's an estimator from turbotax it 's handy because it lets you enter business income when i plug in $ 140 k $ 70 40 hours 50 weeks for business income in 2010 married filing jointly no spouse income and 4 dependents i get $ 30 k owed in federal taxes that does n't include local taxes any itemized deductions you might be eligible for ira deductions etc you may also be able to claim some expenses as business deductions that will reduce your taxable business income so you 'd net $ 110 k after taxes or about $ $ 110k 50 40 of course you could get an answer from the calculator and congress could change the rules through the year you might come out better or worse depending on the nature of the rule changes that 's why i stress that it 's an estimate if you take the job do n't forget to make estimated tax payments edit some additional info if you plan on doing this on an ongoing basis i.e. you are going into business as a contractor for this line of work there are some tax shelters that you can take advantage of most of these wo n't be worth doing if you are only going to be doing contract work for a short period of time 1 2 years these may or may not all be applicable to you and do your research into these areas before diving in i 'm just scratching the surface in the notes below

as a thought experiment i suppose we can ask where dividends came from and what would be different if they never existed the or dutch east india the first to ipo sell shares and also have a dividend    there had been trade before the the bulk type of sea going ship trade in the league but the innovation was to pool capital to build giant more expensive than a merchant partnership could likely finance and stand to lose at sea on their own but more efficient than the cogs and focused on a trade good with more value   the dutch republic became rich by this capital formed to pursue high value trade without dividends this would n't have been an innovation in century europe and enterprises would be only as large as say the contemporary merchant family networks of could finance   so there could be large partnerships family businesses and debt financed ventures but no corporations as such

an llc does not pay taxes on profits as regards tax a llc is treated as a partnership but instead of partners they are called members the llc is a passthrough entity as in partnerships members can have a different percentage ownership to the share of profits the llc reports the share of the profits of the members then the members pay the tax as an individual the profit of the llc is deemed to have been transferred to the members regardless of any funds transferred this is often the case as the llc may need to retain the profits for use in the business late paying customers may mean there is less cash in the llc than is available to distribute   the first answer is wrong only a c corporation files a tax return all other corporate structures are passthrough entities the c corporation pays corporation tax and is not required to pass any funds to the shareholders if the c corporation passes funds to the shareholders this is a dividend and taxable to the shareholder hence double taxation

this would inevitably lead to a few gatekeepers from which everyone trusts the bonds ibm ge etc and millions of small businesses which will have absolutely no access to capital once this happens you will quickly end up with a shadow banking system where companies like ge switch from making stuff to basically being banks giving loans to other small businesses with no access to capital etc    this is basically done in china in a slightly different way but the core state owned enterprises have near unlimited access to capital and they use this advantage to invest in and buy up any and all interesting companies simply because they 're the only organizations that can essentially print money whether you agree with it being printing money or not the fact is ge ibm would be able to issue bonds almost whenever they want similar to the treasury 's monthly bond auctions and other firms simply unable to    so then you have a few key companies with nearly unlimited right to print used loosely cash they use this advantage to push on other businesses buy them up or control them in many ways and then they use this position to eventually take over anything that looks interesting    what you 're imagining as being an open market where everyone 's bonds have full information will quickly devolve into information overload and people choosing the well known brands as their trusted source once that happens the whole idea falls apart and those few firms will find a way to control not only the money supply but also who gets to use their money    you will also have situations where some mom and pop takes john llc bonds as payment for dinner and when they try to give john llc bonds to their suppliers their suppliers say no thanks we only deal in ibm bonds    mom and pop will find themselves stuck with paper that nobody wants to accept and mom and pop will quickly find themselves in a cash flow crisis as they have tons of paper but none of their suppliers will accept that paper    the only way to get out of this situation would be to convince ibm or ge to give mom and pop some ge bonds in exchange for the john llc they have that nobody will accept of course ge and ibm being in the position as some of the few trusted money printers can refuse to accept john llc bonds except at a severe discount we know john gave you john llc bonds to pay for his dinner worth $ 100 but we 'll only give you $ 40 worth of ge bonds for it   mom and pop will quickly be fucked and go out of business due to having no hard currency aka trusted currency that they can use to purchase their raw materials   demand for ge bonds will skyrocket as everyone seeks a safe haven a trusted currency almost everyone will accept adn ge will find the entire market begging them to print bonds even at no interest just so that the money supply can increase to hold the full amount of trade occurring in the territory    this is then no different from the fed during the recession a few years ago and up until now where they sell tons of bonds at rock bottom interest rates because all the world is looking for a safe place to put their cash    the difference of course is that ge ibm can take all this money and issue themselves huge bonuses either on the cash directly or on the profit they 've amassed by being the only trusted money issuer whereas government officials can not

i believe that article provides some good reasons though it may be a bit light on technical details and there are likely other reasons a company would do it so if they can finance for less then they would lose to taxes by bringing the money home and they do not take on too much debt this will likely work just fine and increase share holder value hopefully someone else can provide some other reasonable scenarios the bottom line is that it does not matter how they finance the share buybacks and/or dividend payments as long as they do not shoot themselves in the foot while doing it

for starters if you 're not making any money doing something it 's a hobby it sounds like you want to work for the current owners making them money as a hobby if that floats your boat go crazy    show enough motivation and they may offer to sell you the business for $ 1 or some other surprisingly low dollar figure this will seem like a gift worth dropping out of school for but be extremely careful before getting excited    odds are when you take over the business you end up assuming their debts too mortgages rent payments back payroll equipment loans leases and possibly any back late payments from before your takeover     use your first few weeks as an academic study for a school project get a copy of their books find out where the consistent money is and see how to grow that they may be selling games at a loss because their crowd consistently buys enough beer to cover expenses or maybe the money from that stupid crane game covers the electric bill for the whole place because bill has a problem    learn study and ask more for information as payment than cash the only way it make real money is to actually take over ownership of the place so take the long view and build toward that instead of a salaried manager gig or something

similar to what adam f says above except instead of just transfering the amount you spend on the credit card into the high interest account why not keep the majority of your funds apart from a small amount say a couple of hundred for emergencies in the high interest account until the credit card needs to be paid off even better if you have a mortgage with an 100 offset account keep all your funds in this and pay off your credit card in full from it on or before the due date being a 100 offset to your mortgage interest rate you will be saving at a higher rate than a high interest rate savings account and you will be able to do all your normal banking from it unlike a high interest account which you usually have to link to an additional account to deposit and withdrawl money to and from if you are to use a credit card keep these simple rules in mind hope this has helped regards victor

several people here have highlighted the incentive agency problems that tend to naturally arise when mortgages however the market for mortgage backed securities has existed for decades and during most of that time these agency problems were held in check moreover academics knew about this problem even before the credit crisis and actually recommended the use of in order to avoid the moral hazard problems associated with securitization see 2005   so to give a compelling historical explanation for why the crisis happened when it did you need to explain what changed in the mortgage securitization market to enable these previously agency relationships to breakdown   so what changed in short the growth of the market for cdos collateralized debt obligations composed of mortgage backed securities and not the mbs market itself this market grew so rapidly in the because the ratings agencies created an opportunity for banks to take low rated mbs debt and give it a higher rating by merely it into a cdo it was ratings arbitrage through and through explanations that place the brunt of the blame on the i.e. fannie and freddie can not adequately explain why the majority of mortgage related losses during the credit crisis were concentrated in cdos of mbss and not in the vanilla mbs market   here 's what happened back in the day say pre early 2000s the agency incentive problems that naturally arise in mortgage securitization were held in check by careful institutional investors who would rigorously assess the default risk of the higher risk mbs tranches they had a deep knowledge of the mortgage business sometimes they would even go so far as manually examining the loan documentation the profile of the borrowers the quality of the collateral and so on there were a lot of buyers who were happy to purchase the aaa and aa tranches but they could afford to be because the banks who were mbss knew that without selling to the discriminating buyers of higher risk debt they would n't be able to break even    it worked a bit like a market for fine wines i do n't know much about wine but when i walk into a shop that sells fine wines i can be reasonably certain that there will be a reasonably strong relationship between price and the quality of the wine basically i get to free ride off the superior discrimination of the wine who regularly visit the shop   once the ratings agencies created the now infamous ratings arbitrage between the mbs and cdo markets the market for cdos on mbss expanded as this market grew these discriminating buyers became a proportionally smaller part of the mbs market the folks building cdos of mbss did n't know very much about the mortgage business itself instead they tended to rely on statistical default models provided by the ratings agencies that predicted the probability of mortgage default based on quantitative variables such as borrowers credit scores loan to value ratios etc    the problem is that these models used historical data that was collected back when the discriminating institutional investors kept the agency problems in the mbs market in check the growth of the cdo market spurred even more mortgage securitization which led lending standards to deteriorate because firms like countrywide knew that the cdo buyers only cared about credit scores ltv ratios etc however buyers of mbs were unable to detect these changes in default risk because the models they were using to see those changes were becoming invalidated by the growth of the cdo market itself   if you want to read more about this i 'd highly recommend 's 2011 paper in the american journal of sociology see here it 's a detailed historical account of the changes in valuation practices models used within the mbs and cdo markets and how these practices became invalidated as the cdo market grew in size   tl;dr the credit ratings created a ratings arbitrage that the banks took advantage of they are as much if not more at fault as the   for more info on the deterioration in mortgage quality in the check out    keys benjamin and 2008 did securitization lead to lax screening evidence from subprime loans   and 2008 the failure of models that predict failure distance incentives and defaults december   also the citation i mentioned above   p. 2005 the pooling and of securities a model of informed review of economic studies 35 2005

each company has x shares valued at $ y share when deals like dragon 's den in canada and britain or shark tank in the us are done this is where the company is issuing shares valued at $ z total to the investor so that the company has the funds to do whatever it was that they came to the show to get funding to do though some deals may be loans or royalties instead of equity in the company the total value of the shares may include intangible assets of course but part of the point is that the company is doing an equity financing where the company continues to operate the shareholders of the company have their stake which may be rewarded when the company is acquired or starts paying dividends but that is a call for the management of the company to make while there is a cash infusion into the company usually there is more being done as the dragon or shark can also bring contacts and expertise to the company to help it grow if the investor provides the entrepreneur with or offers suggestions on corporate strategy this is more than just buying shares in the company if you look at the updates that exist on dragon 's den or shark tank at least in north america i 've seen you will see how there are more than a few non monetary contributions that the dragon or shark can provide

there are several ways to protect against or even profit from a market correction hedge funds do this by hedging that is buying a stock that they think is strong and selling short a paired stock that is weak if you hold say a strong retail company in your portfolio you might sell short an equal weight of a weak retail company   these are like buying insurance on your portfolio if you own 300 shares of xyz currently trading at $ 68 you buy puts at a level at a strike price that lets you sleep at night for example you might buy 3 xyz 6-month puts with a strike price of $ 60 a disadvantage is that the puts are wasting assets that is their time premium which you paid for at the outset becomes zero at expiration this is why it is like insurance you would n't complain that your insurance premium was lost when you purchase insurance on your house and the house does n't burn down would you of course not the purpose of the insurance is to protect your investment note that as these puts are married they only protect your portfolio instead of profiting from a correction you would merely protect your portfolio during a correction no small feat if your portfolio is similar to the market you can buy s&p index puts if your market reflects a lot of technology you can buy technology sector puts   say you have a portfolio of $ 80 k that reflects the market you could buy out of the market puts again reflecting your tolerance for loss any losses in your portfolio after the puts go in the money would be more or less offset by gains in the puts   an advantage is that the bid ask spread is smaller for the s&p. you would pay less for the protection also the s&p puts are cash settled meaning you get money put in your account on the business day after expiration day a disadvantage is that the puts do not linearly go up as the market drops delta hedging is a big deal in and of itself another disadvantage is that they are wasting assets see the married puts section previous while the s&p puts can be used to maintain your market portfolio in the midst of a correction you could purchase more puts than needed if you had correctly timed the market then your portfolio with puts would increase your mileage may vary some have predicted an imminent market crash way too often collars involve selling out of the money calls and using the premiums to buy out of the money puts there are many varieties of collars but the most straightforward is to sell 1 call and buy 1 put for every 100 shares this can also be done for index puts and calls this has the effect of simultaneously you get your insurance for almost free but again it is protecting your portfolio   as the name implies you make money when the market goes bearish   bear put spreads involve buying puts at a close strike price and selling an equal number of puts at a lower strike price than the first you have a defined maximum loss the premium you paid for the higher put minus the premium you received for the lower put you have a defined maximum gain the difference between strikes minus the defined maximum loss   buy s&p 500 index puts if you buy deep out of the money puts it wo n't cost much but you have little probability of it paying off but if they go in the money there could be a sizable payoff this is similar to putting one chip on red 18 on the roulette wheel but rather than paying off it is a variable payoff if you 're $ 1 in the money you just get $ 100 if you 're $ 12 in the money you have a $ 1200 payoff   if you buy at the money puts it will cost a lot and your probability will be about 1 in 2 that you will pay off in our roulette analogy this is like putting 30 chips on the even bet of the roulette wheel the variable payoff is as in the previous paragraph but you 're more likely to get a payoff and you will lose it all of the roulette ball lands on an odd number 0 or 00 that is the underlying of your put goes up or stays the same if your research shows you what good stocks to buy it may also tell you which stocks are ripe for a fall you could short sell these stocks or buy puts on them   similar to short selling stocks or buying puts you could sell short overpriced sectors or buy puts on them there are etfs that will allow you benefit from falling prices without needing to have a margin agreement or options agreement in place   sorry to have a lengthy answer many other answers emphasize that one should n't try to time the market but that is not the op 's question provided here are both

debits and credits are terms used in double entry bookkeeping each transaction is entered in two different places to be able to double check accuracy the total debits and total credits being equal is what makes the balance sheet balance for explaining debits and credits has a good example using eggs that i found helpful as a student   debits and credits   when a financial transaction is recorded the debits dr and credits cr need to balance in order to keep the accounts in balance   an easy rule to remember is debit the asset that increases   for example if you want to practice accounting for cooking a simple breakfast you might proceed as follows   to record breaking the eggs and putting the eggs in the pan   in this transaction an asset the egg is split into parts and some of the asset goes in the pan and some in the trash a debit dr is used to show that the assets in the pan and the trash both increase a balancing credit cr is used to show that the amount of assets whole eggs in the egg has decreased   this transaction is in balance because the total credits equal the total debits everything that is covered by the debits white and shell is also covered by the credits one whole egg

these government mandates of minimum wage will cause more problems than they will solve i do n't know how many of you own a small business but i can give you a real world example here in the city of chicago on july 1st 2017 the minimum wage will increase to $ while at the same time they 're introducing a .01 per oz sugar tax   the amount of additional work needed to keep track of sugar consumption will be burdensome for small businesses who will have to raise prices to accommodate the new labor costs and tax customers are price sensitive so they will usually go for the cheaper option which can be provided only by corporate big business who have the ability to automate certain positions in the labor supply chain which is currently happening i would n't be surprised if the timeline for kiosks self service robot implementation is on par with the $ 15.00 minimum wage deadline in 2019 to sum up big business wins and labor loses but i guess results do n't matter when your intentions are good

while it is a true loss as you 've determined is not a cash cost per se a cash cost would be a decrease in cash holdings   inflation does not take your cash balance it devalues it so it is an accrued loss central banks are extremely lazy in determining inflation so the highest resolution available at a public level is monthly   in the united states there is a small project that tries to calculate daily inflation rates and seems to do a decent job but unless if you are a customer of a particular financial institution you will suffer a lag   the small project refuses to make the data public in real time or even allow outside analysis in the uk the office for national statistics is responsible for consumer inflation statistics   the methodology is not readily available but considering the name it is most likely an inferior index instead of the optimal fisher index as it is in the us to calculate the accrued cost due to inflation simply multiply the amount of money held by the price index value at the beginning of the time held and divide by the price index value at the end of the time held for example to determine the amount of value lost since march 2014 multiply the money held by the price index value for march 2014 and divide by june 2014

flipping usually refers to real estate transaction you buy a property improve renovate it and resell it quickly the distinction between flipper and investor is similar to the distinction between trader and investor even though the tax code does n't explicitly refer to house flipping gains on house flipping can be considered as active business gain or passive activity income which are treated differently passive income goes on schedule e and schedule d active income goes on schedule c. the distinction between passive and active is based on the characteristics of the activity hours you spent on it among other things trading income can similarly be considered as either passive schedule d e treatment or active schedule c treatment here 's what the irs has to say about traders special rules apply if you are a trader in securities in the business    of buying and selling securities for your own account this is    considered a business even though you do not maintain an inventory    and do not have customers to be engaged in business as a trader in    securities you must meet all of the following conditions the following facts and circumstances should be considered in    determining if your activity is a securities trading business if the nature of your trading activities does not qualify as a    business you are considered an investor investor in this context means passive income treatment schedule d e however even if your income is considered active schedule c stock sale proceeds are not subject to the self employment tax as you can see there 's no specific definition but the facts and circumstances matter you may be considered a trader by the irs or you may not you may want to be considered a trader for example to be able to make a mark to market election or you may not you should talk to a professional tax adviser ea cpa licensed in your state for more details and suggestions

in simplest terms when a company creates new shares and sells them it 's true that existing shareholders now own a smaller percentage of the company   however as the company is now more valuable since it made money by selling the new shares the real dollar value of the previous shares is unchanged that said the decision to issue new shares can be interpreted by investors as a signal of the company 's strategy and thereby alter the market price   this may well affect the real dollar value of the previous shares   but the simple act of creating new shares does not alter the value in and of itself

gt;i appreciate the detailed responses truthfully however i feel like at least half of your points are either just for its sake alone display a deep lack of understanding of unions collective bargaining and the histories of both or ignore and cling to an and ultimately self defeating ideology   i feel the same way about your arguments but i still try to respond to the content of your arguments rather than my assumptions about them   gt;the law forces the two parties to sit at a table the law forces the two parties to discuss a few core things like wages    the law should not force any party to sit at any table that violates a party 's contract liberty   gt;the idea is since these worker employer disputes exist naturally making them at least sit at a table together and talking is helpful in avoiding ego and fueled disruptions where no one benefits   that 's nice that you think you know what 's better for other people than they do for themselves but that does n't give you a right to force them to any table a right to contract freedom means the right to dismiss any offer or refuse to even negotiate with a party   gt;if this you see this as a violation of one 's liberty i really do n't know what to say to that   then i guess we have fundamentally different ideas about what is freedom and what is not you seem to think that forcing someone to negotiate with a party against their will is not a violation of any of their rights   gt;i'm not saying i do n't believe you but citation needed   sorry i do n't have time to dig up citations now if i have time later i 'd be happy to do so all i could find now is an inverse correlation between the state of a country 's credit market and the rate of child labor     is an abundance of indirect empirical evidence discussed below concerning   the role of credit constraints and educational   however and   2002 test the hypothesis directly   they estimate a basic model of child labor determination for a panel of countries for the years 1950 60 1970 1980 and 1995     gt;&gt;the credit constraint variable is by the share in gdp of private credit issued by 10 deposit money banks   they find that a one standard deviation increase in the share of credit in gdp is associated with a 10 percent standard deviation decrease in child labor they conclude that families with access to credit are considerably less likely to put   children to work during a period of economic volatility than parents without access to credit   educating children first lead to an increase in productivity also what if the owners of the means of production only a few in an given area have incomes 100x greater than the workers    if there are efficient financial markets that allow parents to borrow money against the expected future increase in earnings from their children being educated then yes   in less developed economies these markets have not developed and the choice is often between death and child labor    gt;they seem to be producing enough wealth to support themselves only they 're not the beneficiaries    studies have shown that by and large parents act towards their children and only put them to work if it is in the children 's best interest e.g. page 32     together the evidence so far presented it   appears that the data are consistent with a model where the returns from child   labor do not accrue to the parents parents redistribute entirely these returns to their children in the form of lower labor supply and higher schooling plus possibly increased consumption 47   laws against child labor therefore will generally do more harm than good   gt;what 's the solution here   the solution is to let the process of economic development run its course until child labor is not necessary   gt;this is typical anti union propaganda and it 's funny you pull it out since it ignores your own ideology what interest would a union have in destroying the very industry it needs to exist answer none   a union is not a self interested party a union represents self interested parties who are not directly affected by the destruction of their industry 30 years into the future since they would have retired by then   many of the laws and union backed agreements that ended up destroying many of america 's industries took decades to have their full effect it was n't a case of a law being passed and the next year the industry going bankrupt   gt;i have no idea how one could come to this conclusion i can only assume it stems from the same old idea that employers are always paying out the most that they can afford   why should employers pay out the most they can afford and why should laws be passed to force employers to do so   the only reason people invest is to profit if all profits had to be paid to employees there would be no incentive to invest and therefore no increase in capital productivity   gt;i happen to have first hand knowledge that it 's false however when my workplace unionized recently one of around a dozen locations nationally and the only one to organize the company responded by increasing wages and benefits to all locations have any locations closed no has anyone been laid off no is the company still mad profitable yes   a general effect happens gradually over a course of decades and happens in the aggregate not in every case it will not be apparent in the short run and will not be manifested in every case in other words that unionization did not result in immediate bankruptcy of your industry does not prove that unionization does not have a negative effect over the average long term performance of industries and average long term increase in wages

that number may be based on a long term historical view of the stock market   if you look at some long term charts for the dow   or the s&p500 you 'll see that overall the upward trend is pretty good   however there are some pretty huge flat spots in those charts and if the majority of your have been made during one of those periods you may not have seen a lot of growth if you look at periods between 10 17 years or so you can find places where it would have really sucked to be you look at the s&p chart and imagine 66 to 83 ouch and places where things were stellar    if you expand to about say 30 years or so then it 's hard to find a period without at least some good growth in there somewhere   if you panicked during a downturn and sold on the low things of course get much worse   how your own portfolio has done will depend a lot on how the funds you chose have done how much you put into equity vs fixed income and if the fixed income was in actual bonds or a bond fund    bond funds are subject to a lot more as interest rates rise or fall than something like a t bill or i bond that you own outright and plan to hold to maturity

you seem to have a little confusion over terminology that should be cleared up you are calling this day trading day trading is the term for performing multiple trading actions in a single day while it appears that the coo has performed a buy and a sell on the same day most people would consider this a single trade in reality it seems that the coo had stock options a contract providing the option for the holder to buy stock at a specific price at some point in the future provided as part of his compensation package he decided or was required to exercise those options today this means he bought the shares using his special option price it is extremely common for employees who exercise stock options to sell all of the resulting stock immediately this is very different from usual day trading which implies that he would have bought stock in the morning at a low price and then sold it later at a high price you are calling this insider trading that term specifically often implies some level of unethical behavior in general stock options offered to executive employees are strictly limited in how they can be exercised for example most stock option plans require employees to wait x number of years before they can exercise them this gives the employee incentive to stay longer and for a high level executive with the ability to strongly impact company performance it gives incentive to do well technically you are correct this is likely considered an insider trade but given that it seems to have been a stock option exercise it does not necessarily imply that there was any special reasoning for why he did the trade today it could simply be that today was the first day the stock option rules allowed him to exercise as to your final question no these profits are the coo 's to do with as he likes

the price is moving higher so by the time you enter your order and press buy a new buyer has already come in at that time and taken out the lowest ask price so you end up chasing the market as the prices keep moving higher the solution if you really want to be sure that you buy it and do n't want to keep chasing the market higher and higher you should put in a market order instead of a limit order with a market order you may pay a few cents higher than the last traded price but you will be sure to have your order filled if you keep placing limit orders you may miss out altogether especially if the price keeps moving higher and higher in a fast moving market a market order is always best if your aim is to be certain to buy the stock

in the u.s. it is typical that a stock brokerage account can be set up to buy stock with up to half the cost being borrowed from the broker   this is called a margin account   the stock purchased must remain in the account until sold or the loan is paid off as it serves as built in collateral for the loan   if the market price for the stock goes down too much you will be required to add money or the stock will be sold to cover the loan see this question for some more information

this is potentially a real risk to google the odds of such a huge success it decreases google 's profits are tiny i think but there is a real risk that the increase in google 's profits going forward are materially affected by a well done competitor to adsense   if amazon took away 10 of what google 's adsense business 4 years from now would have been that is likely material to google 's earning not huge but real   even losing the ads on amazon 's web site is likely noticeable though not a huge deal i would guess to google though to most companies it would be a huge lose   there is even the potential google has to reduce their profitability on adsense to compete giving web sites a better cut of revenue   that said i think amazon has plenty of challenges to making it an effective competitor to google but they have a chance and there is even a small chance very small i think that amazon could create a competitor that actually results in noticeably say over 15 declining revenue to google via adsense likely even in this case google continues to grow profit as a company overall   google revenue from ads from their own websites are the most important earnings and likely to continue to be so also new business non web ad income is growing and i think will continue to do so this is likely an area some might find more questionable

both states will want to tax you your tax home is where you maintain a domicile are registered to vote etc and you will probably want to keep this as ma since you state that ma is your permanent residence and you are staying in a rented place in pa but be careful about voter registration that is one of the items that can be used to determine your state of residence   ok so if you and your spouse are ma residents   you should file jointly as residents in ma and as nonresidents in pa do the calculations on the nonresident return first and then the calculations on the resident   return typically on a nonresident tax return the calculations are effectively the following report all your income usually agi from the federal return   call this $ x. compute the pa state tax due on $ x.   note that you follow the rules for nonresidents in doing this not the calculations used by pa residents call the amount of tax you computed as $ y. what part of the total income $ x is attributable to pa sources if this amount is $ z then you owe pa $ y times z x on the resident return in ma you will likely get some credit for the taxes paid to pa and this will reduce your ma tax burden usually the maximum credit is limited to the lesser of actual tax paid to pa and what you would have had to pay ma for the same income as far as withholding is concerned your employer in pa will withhold pa taxes as if you are a pa resident but you can adjust the amount via the pa equivalent of irs form w4 so as to account for any additional   tax that might be due because you will be filing as a nonresident   else you can pay estimated taxes via the pa equivalent of irs form 1040es similarly your wife can adjust her withholding to account for the ma taxes that you will owe on the joint income or you can pay estimated taxes to ma too note that it is unlikely that your employer in pennsylvania will withhold   massachusetts taxes and send them to massachusetts for you e.g. if it is a ma and pa store but there may be special deals available if   your employer does business in both states i.e. is a ma and pa store

this is wrong   it should be   or   now to get back to self employment tax   self employment tax is weird   it 's a business tax   from the irs perspective any self employed person is a business   so take your income x and divide by 6.2 social security and 1.45 medicare   this gives your personal income   now to calculate the tax that you have to pay multiply that by since you have to pay both the worker and employer shares of the tax    so new calculation   or they actually let you do   which is better for you smaller    and your other calculations change    and like i said you can simplify to   and your payment would be   now to get to the second quarter   like i said i 'd calculate the income through the second quarter   so recalculate a based on your new numbers and use that to calculate    or   note that this includes income from both the first and second quarters   we 'll reduce to just the second quarter later   this also has you paying for all of june even though you may not have been paid when you make the withholding payment   that 's what they want you to do    but we are n't done yet   your actual payment should be   or   because q2 ft and are what you owe for the year so far   q1 ft + is what you 've already paid   so you subtract those from what you need to pay in the second quarter   in future quarters this would be   all that said do n't stress about it   as a practical matter so long as you do n't owe $ 1000 or more when you file your actual tax return they are n't going to care   so just make sure that your total payments match by the payment you make january 15th    i 'm not going to try to calculate for the state   for one thing i do n't know if your state uses or as its base   different states may have different rules on that   if you ca n't figure it out just use as that 's the bigger one   fix it when you file your annual return   the difference in withholding is going to be relatively small anyway less than 1 of your income

ah i got ya i partially agree with you but it 's far more complex i think that is simplifying the debate a bit too much when people go passive you are making the assumption that they are able to stay fully invested the full time period say 30 40 years until retirement when you might change the asset allocation this is not a fair assumption because many studies on behavioral finance have shown that people 90 plus are not able to sit tight through a full market cycle and often sell out during a bear market i 'm not debating you 're point that passive often outperforms due to the fees although there are many managers that do outperform but the main issue with self managing and passive investing is people usually make emotional decisions which then hurts their long term performance this would be the reason to hire an adviser assuming that people are able to stay passive the entire time and not make a single active decision is a very unfair assumption there was a good study on this referenced in forbes article below   another issue is that there are a lot active managers that really just replicate their benchmarks and do n't actually actively manage if you look at active managers who really do have huge under weights and over weights relative to their benchmarks they actually tend to outperform them look at the study below by martin he 's one of the most highly respected researchers when it comes to investment performance research and the active vs passive debate     i guess what i 'm trying to say is that for most people having an adviser and paying them a 1 fee is usually better than going it alone where they are going to a. chase heat i bet they always choose the hottest benchmark from the past few years and b. make poor emotional decisions relating their finances

this is a super contentious topic but we have to have a floor wage because we do n't have a free labor market   in order for the labor market to come up with a fair wage the market must be as close to de regulated as possible but we 've already seen what happens in an unregulated or low regulation market safety problems child labor abysmal wages   just ready a history book to see how the us down on sweat shops child labor and the rise of the unions    no one wants to work like that so we put regulations in place to fix those things this is why we have safety laws and rules to prevent our employers from stealing wages due to filing a report late or other stupid excuse    so we make the work places safer and put protections in to make sure people get paid but now we created a wage floor businesses are literally designed to make profit and you make profit by trimming all your expenses as much as necessary skilled employees have an easier time negotiating wages and they can band together in unions but low skilled and unskilled workers do n't have this ability   so they work for minimum wage    now regardless of a company 's ability to pay their workers $ 15/hr or not if you create a wage floor than do n't account for yearly cola inflation workers get left behind why does this matter there is a strong relationship between crime and poverty so we decide to create social programs to keep crime down but as the wage floor is not increased min wage workers require more government subsidy    either companies pay their employees enough where full time workers do n't qualify for government subsidy or the government tax payer ends up picking up the tab on behalf of these companies    you ca n't actually quantify the relationship between min wage and labor because it 's not just a labor issue it impacts crime health who has the ability to pay a $ 30 co pay if you 're chronically ill on min wage and government social welfare on local state and federal levels    we ca n't just demand that unskilled labors get skills so they get more money because that will end up devaluing skilled positions right now people argue that skilled positions are devalued when min wage increases and that 's true only if your employer fails to provide a like increase

a 529 plan is set up in a specific beneficiary 's name but the money can be rolled over or transferred into another 529 plan in the same beneficiary 's name or the beneficiary can be changed by the owner of the account   i mistakenly believed that the new beneficiary could be anyone else but as mhoran_psprep has   pointed out in the comment below the new beneficiary must be related to   the previous one in specific ways as detailed in publication 970 2011 tax benefits for education in order for the change to occur without any tax consequences   so my original statement that distributions can be used for anyone 's educational expense without tax consequences was incorrect if the new beneficiary is not related to the original beneficiary tax consequences will indeed occur   note also that unlike iras where the entire amount can be withdrawn by the owner without incurring a 10 penalty after a certain period or after reaching a certain age distributions from a 529 plan for nonqualified expenses including as a special case a withdrawal of funds by the owner will incur the 10 penalty tax regardless of when this occurs the problem with ugma accounts is that you have to turn the money over to the beneficiary when that beneficiary becomes an adult 18 years old in most cases regardless of your current opinion of that beneficiary and the beneficiary is free to use the money to buy a motorcycle with it if she chooses instead of using it for her education   in this sense i agree with mhoran_psprep 's answer that it is best to put away the money in an ordinary account without seeking tax benefits and deal with the matter as you see fit when the niece is filling out her college paperwork

firstly you mean resistance not support as a support is below the current price and resistance is above the price secondly using a ma as support or resistance would mean that that support or resistance level would move up or down as the price moved up or down and would not be static at $ 25 generally stocks will range trade more often than they will be trending either up or down so a stock can be range trading between a support and resistance levels for months and even years and usually the longer it range trades for the bigger the outbreak either up or down will be when it does happen using a ma especially shorter dated ones as support or resistance or as a up or down trend line works better when a stock is already trending up or down when a stock is moving sideways it will tend to keep crossing above and below the ma and you will be if you try to use them as your trigger for entry in these situations compare the two charts below   in the first chart the stock is up trending for over 6 months and the ema is being used as a support or up trending line as long as the price does not break through and close under the ema then the uptrend continues you could use this ema line as a means of entering the stock when prices move towards the ema and bounce off it back up again or you could use it as your stop loss level so if price closes below the ema line you would sell your position   in the second chart the stock has been range trading between the support line at about $ and the resistance line at about $ for 10 months in this case the price has been moving above and below the ema during these 10 months and you may have been many times if you were trading each break above or below the ema a better strategy here would be to buy the stock as it approached the support line and bounces up off it and then close and reverse your position go short when the price approached the resistance line and bounces down off it   edit when range trading you would have your stops just below the support line when going long and just above the resistance line when going short that way if it does break through support or resistance and starts trending you will be covered so this shows that different strategies should be used when a stock is trending to when it is range trading mas are better used as entry signal during an established uptrend or downtrend than when a stock is range trading

has provided a good answer i 'm only addressing my comment about the data quality the portfolio optimization technique you employed is very sensitive to the inputs in particular it relies entirely on the mean and assumptions i.e. the first two moments and the results could change drastically with very small amount of change in the inputs to see that you can make up some inputs for the solver you have and try adjusting the inputs a little bit and see the results therefore if you decide to take this approach data quality is very crucial edit what i meant by data quality i have no experience with this website but this should be easy to spot check the answer is usually yes for liquid assets illiquid assets can often be priced at a level with no volume and the bid ask spread could be huge   should i close my eyes on the fact that these are n't perfectly priced in my currency and use another one such as the dollar you seem to have concern about data quality in at least the price quoted in your currency and are thinking about using data quoted in usd but would it be any better the law of one price tells us that there should n't be any discrepancy between prices in different currencies otherwise there would be arbitrage in addition when compared to traditional assets cryptocurrency price data has a shorter data history and with lower liquidity in the market the short history means you have less data to infer the characteristics of the price behavior low liquidity means the volatility may well be underestimated so we have an input sensitive technique combined with not so perfect data i would n't allocate my money solely based on the result of this exercise edit i have quite some reservation about doing portfolio optimization for cryptocurrency personally i 'm not a fan of the technique as is the optimization has an underlying assumption that returns follow a certain distribution and correlation is fixed i do n't know if you can make such assumption for cryptocurrencies from what i read about btc for example it seems to have a high risk exposure concerning chinese monetary policy for that kind of assets perhaps a fundamental analysis approach is a better one   also if you would like to learn more about portfolio optimization try quant se

while i certainly agree with the principle of paying down debt there is some value in having a healthy cash cushion   if an emergency expense were to come up and your credit has been cut off or reduced to the point where you have no excess credit then having real cash on hand is critical i would perform the following thought experiment   what if my available credit had been cut off   how much would i need in cash to survive for 1 month 3 months 5 months etc   consider what time period you 'd be comfortable with and set that amount as your minimum desired cash on hand while it may seem extreme to not have access to credit at all during the credit crisis many banks and lenders tightened their lending reducing credit limits closing lines of credit calling loans raising rates etc suze orman recommends cash savings equivalent to 8 months living expenses that does n't mean 8 months salary but 8 months of what it would take to live on   at one point in the midst of the economic crisis i thought that made sense the simple dollar blog considers suze 's recommendation and the idea of emergency fund vs. debt repayment   worth reading is suze right do emergency funds now trump debt repayment

that would have been a good idea   they do n't charge interest on a $ 0 balance but if you payoff your account after the cycle date there is a hidden balance and that balance will accrue interest it is only a few cents a day   i just do n't think it is legal for them to refuse to provide you a payoff quote mid cycle i 'm almost certain when i worked for discover it was a key point in training to not give the wrong amount and to make sure to use the calculator in the system to quote a daily balance how much it goes up per day and how much they should send if they were mailing the payment giving consideration for the time it takes to receive process the payment

yes i know this is a seven year old question does this only apply to debts that were taken on during marriage   yes or to all debts of both partners no the important thing to remember is that it 's both debts and assets acquired during the marriage which are shared this comes from the reality that men in the olden times were the ones in business accumulating wealth etc while the woman made the home   the working assumption was that the woman who made the home was an equal partner with the man since he benefited from a good home and she benefited from his income the fact that pre marriage debts and assets were not community property also protected the woman because she was able to then take back her and use that to support herself i live in a cp state

typically as an individual you ca n't just decide you want to lend out some securities there is a lot of legalities that must take place in order to engage in such a transaction it 's a regulated industry and the contractual obligations that exist between borrower and seller are taken care of ahead of time by the broker with their client prior to any actual transaction taking place i say typically becuase i 'm guessing that if you are a large enough client and own a substantial block of shares i really mean a lot you may be in the unique position of being able to lend out i 'm not sure what the logistics of this would look like but i think the brokerage house would approach you and negotiate a borrowing rate in that situation you may negotiate lending to the the brokerage house and not necessarily directly to the borrower

if i have a asset a with expected return of 100 and by standard deviation 1 and asset b with expected return of 1 and risk 100 would it be rational to put asset b into the portfolio no because modern portfolio theory would say that if there is another asset b2 with the same or higher return but less risk which you already have in asset a you should invest in that if those are the only two assets you can choose from you would invest completely in asset a. the point of diversification is that so long as two assets are n't perfectly positively correlated meaning that if one moves up the other always moves up then losses in one asset will sometimes be offset by gains in another reducing the overall risk

others have already commented on the impact of anything which merchants from raising possible breaches so i wo n't dwell on that maybe we need stronger legislation maybe we do n't but it does n't change today 's answer often it works the other way around to what you might expect rather than the merchant noticing and notifying visa mc others visa mc others spot patterns of suspicious activity example 1 i do n't have any data on the relative numbers of who is being notified notifying between merchants and payment processors but at the point when your card is identified as compromised there 's no reason to suppose that an individual merchant in the traditional sense has been compromised let alone identified in fact because there 's a fast moving investigation it could even be a false alarm that led to your card getting cancelled conversely it could be a hugely complex multinational investigation which would be it 's simply not safe to assume that simply brand x has been compromised therefore everything brand x knows about you is also compromised furthermore there 's no reason to assume the merchant has even admitted to or discovered the root cause mc visa banks at the point at which they 're cancelling cards simply ca n't say at least not in a way that might backfire involving lots of lawyers because the standard of proof needed to go on record blaming someone is simply not yet met so yes it 's common that you are n't told anything for all of the above reasons and of course if you really want to find out more you may have some success with your local data protection legislation and formally make a subject access request or local equivalent to see what that brings back be sure to do it in writing to the official address of both mastercard and your bank

yes you should incorporate if you plan on seriously investing in real estate this not only limits liability in terms of paying back the debt but also in case your tenants sue you   pass through entities typically an llc but it depends on the state if they have good or bad llc laws pennsylvania is a state where you would not want to incorporate as an llc other options include s corps and   loans are taken out by corporations against the property typically mortgage loans are non recourse if you set up a company for each property this further insulates you against the bank capturing other properties within the pool however recourse can still end up getting you on the hook personally for the loans these typically include voluntary bankruptcy you would very rarely have to file for bankruptcy anyway for your real estate investments at worst it will end in foreclosure but banks typically would prefer deed in lieu just because it is faster and easier for them too you just turn over the keys and walk away it will have very little impact on your personal finances or record everyone in real estate walks away from properties and leaves them with the bank it 's a fact of doing business and your lender should have been comfortable owning your property at the basis they lent money to you if they were n't they were just stupid   yes every real estate investment requires equity in the property typically it 's a 20 equity check but if the lender the property to a lower value than what you purchased it for you may have to line up more expensive financing

if the cash flow information is complete the valuation can be determined with relative accuracy and precision assuming the monthly rent is correct the annual revenue is $ 1,600 per year $ 12 months $ in taxes real estate is best valued as a perpetuity where p is the price i is the income and r is the rate of interest   would suggest that the best available rate of interest would be the risk free rate a 30 year treasury rate but the competition ca n't get these rates so it is probably unrealistic no expenses the value of the property is $ 1,600 at most $ this is the general formula and it should definitely be adjusted for expenses and a more realistic interest rate now with a better understanding of interest rates and expenses this will predict the most likely market value however it should be known that whatever interest rate is applied to the formula will be the most likely rate of return received from the investment a graham buffett value investor would suggest using a valuation no less than 15 since to a value investor there 's no point in bidding unless if the profits can be above average   with a 15 interest rate and no expenses $ 1,600 .15 is $   on average it is unlikely that a bid this low will be successful nevertheless if multiple bids are placed using this similar methodology by the law of small numbers it is likely to hit the lottery on at most one bid

value is one area where economic theories tend to diverge and the very basic schools of thought both have excellent points in their favor you 've identified both here one being that economic value can always be determined by net labor or at least cost of inputs and the other being that economic value does not exist in and of itself and that only a market can determine value in some ways it is just a question of world view as much as anything but the concepts of natural prices or innate worth are difficult to argue against at the same time without exchange the concept of value has little meaning so as usual it is some mixed with some sense   both have elements of truth and both are considerably more complex than they seem at first interestingly though neither seems to work very well as predictive models despite providing the basis for some incredibly complex and interesting mathematical        note that net labor is the sum of all labor involved and is incredibly difficult to quantify accurately

two typical responses to articles surveys making such claims   1 people use other forms of asset for emergency savings because interest rates are low clearly false   2 people use other forms of saving than a saving account therefore such surveys as the x% ca n't handle a $ 500 emergency are wrong on their face this is false the vast majority use a savings account   i 've chosen a topic that absolutely annoys the shit out of me every time it comes up how people save their money every time this topic comes up about x% of americans ca n't come up with $ y dollars in an emergency or have less than $ z in savings someone inevitably in with the linked response i have never seen anyone attempt to source their hand waving response beyond their own anecdote which is usually a thinly veiled brag about how financially savvy they are with their wealth perhaps people who have no assets or crippling debt do n't go out of their way to brag about it   i could link multiple reddit posts making a similar response which i address with my own stock response about once every 1 2 months instead i 've decided to expand with data from several other sources this is the good bad research problem if you 're asserting something but qualify your statement with sure we 'd find if we looked into then you 're doing it wrong a good researcher or journalist does n't put bullshit like that in their work because it 's their job to actually look for sources of data data which should exist with multiple government and independent groups so let 's get started all data as recent as i could find oldest source is for 2010   most americans do n't invest in the stock pubs   about of americans owned publicly traded stock directly or indirectly with a much smaller percent owning stock directly   pages 18 and 16 respectively it 's important to note the of indirect ownership which suggests this is mostly retirement accounts it 's entirely possible people are irresponsible with their emergency savings but i think it safe to say we should not expect people to dip into their retirement accounts for relatively minor emergency expenses the reason is obvious even if it covers the expense they now have to make up the shortfall for their retirement savings this is further supported by the same source   gt;"the value of assets held within iras and dc plans are among the most significant of many balance sheets and are a significant determinant of their future retirement security   page 20 pdf page 20 of 41   there is also a break down of holdings by asset type on page 16 pdf page 16 of 41   this data is skewed by the top 10 who keep more of their wealth in different asset power for a breakdown between the 1st 10th and percentiles see table 3   so far it seems pretty hard to maintain a large percent of americans have their wealth stored outside of savings accounts mattresses aside   here 's my original reply as to the breakdown of americans assets by type and percent a note this assumes people have assets source for images people wealth data   most people use savings accounts with runner up falling to checking accounts this will into our next topic which is the problem of unbanked underbanked households   a large number of individuals have no assets breaking down by asset types assumes people have assets in the first   to quote the fdic   from the 2015 survey indicate that percent of households in the united states were unbanked in 2015 this proportion represents approximately million households an additional 19.9 percent of u.s. households million were underbanked meaning that the household had a checking or savings account but also obtained financial products and services outside of the banking system   that 's right there are millions of households so finance savvy they do n't even have banks accounts obviously it 's because of low interest rates also most people have a checking account as well as savings account the percent with checking and savings was while those with checking only were page 25 pdf page 31 of 88 it 's possible in some surveys people keep all their money in checking but given other data sources and the original claim this fails to hold up if the concern was interest rates it makes no sense to keep money in checking which seldom pays interest   this survey also directly addresses the issue of emergency savings   gt overall percent of households saved for unexpected   expenses or emergencies in the past 12 months page 37 pdf page 43 of 88   furthermore   7.2 shows that among all households that saved for   unexpected expenses or emergencies savings accounts   were the most used savings method followed by checking   accounts more than four in five percent kept savings   in one of these accounts about one in ten 10.5 percent   households that saved maintained savings in the home or   with family or friends    emphasis added   why do n't people have wealth in different asset classes well they do n't save wp content rates by wealth   this is further supported by the oecd data   americans currency and deposits are 13 vs 5.8 for securities and other shares as of total financial household financial   additionally   interest earning checking accounts of american households second a   among all households that saved for unexpected expenses or emergencies savings accounts were the most used   savings method followed by checking accounts page 7 pdf page 13 of   saved for an emergency with a savings account vs who used checking   in fairness the fdic link does state banked americans were more likely to hold checking accounts than savings accounts 98 vs respectively but that does n't mean they 're earning interest in their checking account it 's also worth noting median transaction account value was for 2013 this is the federal reserve data $ 4100

the question states our insurance company is offering a 30 discount on an $    commercial policy if we install the insurance is paid in    two installments this appears to mean six monthly payments so i 'll make some comparison calculations using six monthly loan repayments to keep things simple without the loan or the insurance costs $ 4100 every six months using this loan payment formula the calculation below shows with the 30 discounted insurance maintenance and loan repayment you would be paying $ every six months   the discount required to break even is   i.e. rearranging the equation   alternatively with the discount of 30 you would break even if the six monthly repayment amount was $   solving the payment equation for s gives an equation for the loan   so with the 30 discount you would break even if the loan required was $ checking by back calculating the periodic payment amount a   likewise we can keep the loan at $ 40000 and solve for t to find the break even loan term   note in this formula log denotes the natural logarithm   now we can set some values   so with break even payments the $ 40000 loan is paid off in just under years   i.e. checking   this just beats the $ 4100 cost of proceeding without the notes if your loan repayment was monthly it would reduce the cost of the loan slightly   the periodic interest rate is calculated from the apr according to the method used in the eu and in some cases in us   the calculations above were run using mathematica

all of the other answers here are accurate but i think are missing the point as to the question which rests on how bonds work in the first place the bond specifies a payback amount and date let 's say it is $ 10,000 and one year from today if you buy that today for $ your yield will be 1 if you buy it today for $ 11,000 your yield will be less than 0 please do n't make me do the math it 's just under negative 1 you might be willing to pay that 1 rather than receive 1 for the certainty that you will definitely get your money back the combined actions of all the people who may be willing to pay a little more or a little less for the safety of a us treasury bond is what people call the market   market forces generally investor confidence will drive the price up and down which affects the yield all the other stuff coupons and inflation and whatnot all of that only makes sense if you understand that you are n't buying a rate of return you are buying a payback amount and date

10 seems to be a little bit too optimistic but annually on average is doable 1 is way too little you 're doing something wrong unless you mean real return i.e. after adjustment for inflation and even then it 's not too high at any given year it may be easy or difficult but the point is that we 're talking about long term averages for example if you look at the dji for the last 30 years you 'll see a rise of 1300 give or take which annually is ~40 in the last 3 years the rise is even steeper but in the last week it is negative so it depends on your time line and the way you manage your investments you 've got to balance between stocks and bonds and cash but even if you park your money in cash you can get more than 1 right now capitol one on line savings is 1.15 and that 's with the lowest rates ever so getting 1 over time does mean that you 're doing something wrong imho

there are 2 main types of brokers full service and online or discount basically the full service can provide you with advice in the form of recommendations on what to buy and sell and when you call them up when you want to put an order in and the commissions are usually higher whilst an online broker usually does n't provide advice unless you ask for it at a specified fee you place your orders online through the brokers website or trading platform and the commissions are usually much lower the best thing to do when starting off is to go to your country 's stock exchange for example the asx in sydney australia and they should have a list of available brokers some of the online brokers may have a practice or simulation account you can practice on and they usually provide good educational material to help you get started if you went with an online broker and wanted to buy facebook on the secondary market that is on the stock exchange after the ipo closes you would log onto your brokers website or platform and go to the orders section you would place a new order to buy say 100 facebook shares at a certain price you can use a market order meaning the order will be immediately executed at the current market price and you will own the shares or a limit price order where you select a price below the current market price and wait for the price to come down and hit your limit price before your order is executed and you get your shares there are other types of orders available with different brokers which you will learn about when you log onto their website you also need to be careful that you have the funds available to pay for the share at settlement which is 3 business days after your order was executed some brokers may require you to have the funds deposited into an account which is linked to your trading account with them to sell your shares you do the same thing except this time you choose a sell order instead of a buy order it becomes quite simple once you have done it a couple of times the best thing is to do some research and get started good luck

i think they gave you the answer you have n't previously shown that you can run that particular card up to near its existing maximum and then pay it off so they do n't have a strong indication that you can handle that large an unsecured loan generally requests to have the limits raised when there is n't evidence that the customer is finding the current limit inconvenient are going to be considered suspicious remember a great credit rating does not require that they consider you a good risk it 's just one of the things they consider why do you need the limit raised have you tried contacting the bank 's credit department directly and discussing what they will or wo n't let you do re paying off the card every month remember they do get a processing fee from the vendor they 'd prefer that we paid interest i 'm told the term of art for those of us who do n't is deadbeats but they certainly do n't lose money when we do n't and they 'd generally rather have us be loyal customers who might someday pay interest and who are bringing in fees than have us go elsewhere

a loan with modest interest is better than paying by cash if there are better alternatives for investment for example suppose you are buying a house consider two extremes a you pay the house entirely by cash b the entire buy is financed by the bank   historically real subtracting inflation house prices at least in the u.s. have not risen at all in the long run and investing all of your own capital in this way may not be optimal notice that we are looking at a situation where one is buying a house and living in it in any case rent savings are equal in cases a and b if instead you were buying a house not for yourself but as a separate investment for renting out then you would receive rent in the case a the real return on your capital will be zero whereas in case b you can invest the cash in e.g. the stock market and get on average 7 the stock market has yielded a 7 real return annually including dividends   annually minus the bank 's interest rate if the interest is lower than 7 it may be profitable to take the loan of course the final decision depends on your risk preferences

using fundamental and technical analysis together is actually a good idea for longer term trading of up to 6 months or longer   the whole idea behind trading with technical analysis is to increase the probabilities of a trade going in the desired direction by using uncorrelated indicators that produce the same signal to buy or sell at the same time for example you might use a moving average ma as a buy signal when the price falls for a few days hits the ma and then reverses and starts moving back up if however you also include a stochastic oscillator so to indicate when the stock is oversold under 20 and if the price rebounds from the ma average at the same time as the stochastic is crossing over in the oversold position then this may be a higher probability trade if you also only trade stocks that are fundamentally healthy as fundamentally good stocks are more likely to go up than fundamentally bad stocks then this might increase the probabilities again then if you only buy when the market as a whole is moving up then this will increase your chances again a few weeks ago at a seminar the the men in the room to be 76 and the women in the room to be 8 he then asked what will most likely be the next person to walk in the room a man or a woman the statistics are on the side of a wan walking in next this is what we try to do with technical analysis increase our chances when we take a trade of course a woman could be the next person to walk in the room just like any trade can go against you and this is why we use money management and risk management and take a small loss when a trade does go against you lets look at an example where you could incorporate fa with ta to increase your chances of profits   above is a candlestick chart of select harvest the green line above the price is the perceived value the pink line is the 40 day ma the blue line is the eps and the white lines is the stochastic oscillator above 80 being overbought and below 20 is oversold from feb 2015 to start of aug 2015 the stock was uptrending since then the price reversed and started to downtrend the stock was determined to be fundamentally good early in 2015 with the perceived value gradually increasing and greater than the share price and the eps starting to increase regularly from mid april thus as the stock is seen as fundamentally healthy any price reversal in the vicinity of the ma could be seen as a buy opportunity in fact there where 2 such opportunities on 31st march and 11th june where price had reversed and rebounded off the ma the so crossed over in or near the oversold area the price did reverse and then rebounded off the ma again on 9th july however the so was not in or near the oversold area on this occasion so not as high in probability terms the price still rebounded and went up again however another momentum indicator not shown here shows some bearish divergence in this case so another reason to possibly keep away at this point in time a good signal to get out of the trade that is your stop loss has not already taken you out is when the price breaks and closes below the ma line this occurred on 7th august so if we had bought on the first signal on 31st march for $ and sold when the priced broke through the ma on 7th august for $ we would have made a profit of approx 59 in just over 4 months if bought on the second signal on 11th june for $ 9.98 and again sold on 7th august for $ we would have made about 18 in under 2 months so the fundamentals the price in relation to ma and the so where all lining up to provide two high probability trades of course you would need to incorporate you risk management including stops in case the price did not continue upwards after you bought if the market is also moving up on the day of the signal this will further increase your chances   unless you day trade which i would avoid a good way to enter your trades after a signal is to enter a stop buy order after market close to buy if the price moves above the high of the signal day that way if the market and the stock open and move lower during the day after the signal you avoid entering the trade altogether this can be incorporated as part of your risk management and trading rules after the price broke down through the ma we can see that a downtrend which is still current today in fact i just took a short trade on this stock yesterday we can also see that the perceived value whilst still above the price has reached a peak and is currently moving downwards and the eps after being flat for a few months has just moved down for the first time in 10 months so maybe the fundamentals are starting to a bit on this stock it may be a good stock to continue shorting into the future so basically you can continue using fundamental analysis to select which stocks to buy place them in a watch list and then use technical analysis to determine when these stocks are starting to uptrend and use a combination of uncorrelated indicators to produce higher probability signals for when to enter your trades

a $ 1 note and four quarters are both real money but how and when they become real money is different the important thing is that the fed 's stockpile of cash that it gets from the bureau of engraving and printing is n't real money i.e. yet that cash is only used for fulfilling withdrawals from reserve accounts you ca n't use it to buy a car or a house or to pay janet yellen 's salary no one not even janet can use even a single dollar to buy a diet coke in other words it 's not really an asset or a liability or anything but a stack of paper in the fed 's vaults that looks astonishingly like money but is n't the upside to this is that when the makes a delivery of fresh bills to the fed or when the fed destroys old bills that are n't usable anymore the fed 's balance sheet does n't change that 's good those are practical considerations not financial ones the downside is that there 's nothing on the asset side of the sheet to explain how the fed 's liability to a bank is reduced when the bank makes a cash withdrawal from its reserve account so the fed balances it 's balance sheet by recording an increase in a different liability the cash in circulation kinda like transferring the balance on a credit card you 're paying down one liability by increasing another one it looks a bit silly but less silly than recording the destruction of old bills as an expense of the face value of the bills coins on the other hand become money as soon as the treasury gets them from the mint if they wanted to they could pay their employees salaries by ordering coins from the mint for cheap giving them to their employees at face value and reaping fat profits as a result in fact that 's pretty much exactly what they do when someone wants quarters the treasury mints them at less than face value and then sells them at face value in practice the fed does all of this buying and then distributes the coins according to demand the important thing is that this bunch of coins is not like the fed 's stockpile of bills it 's already real money and therefore shows up as an asset not much if the fed bought coins at the cheaper price from the mint instead them like they stockpile bills then distributed them as usual the extra profit just goes to the treasury anyway like all the fed 's profit does however as things are the fed 's purchases of coins are recorded on the fed 's balance sheet at face value which is kinda silly

at first this seems like it makes sense assuming like you say in your question that you are perfectly confident in your ability to repay even if you need to pay the balance in full if you lose your job then this seems like a guaranteed 4 return and a reasonable part of your retirement portfolio where it falls apart though is that you 're paying yourself you 're just taking the money out of one pocket and putting it in another so really you 're getting a guaranteed 0 return you 're losing the compounding growth of the loan amount while it 's out of your accounts and the fact that you can afford the 4 interest means you could have been putting that into a requirement account as well aside from the loan so it does n't really count as interest in the sense that your money is passively making money for you so ultimately no it should n't count as part of your bond allocation
