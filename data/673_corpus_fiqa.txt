you report it as an expense against the 1099 income when you do your taxes you will only be taxed on the amount after the lawyers fees but if it cost you more in lawyers fees than you recover in damages the loss is not deductible be sure to keep documentation of the lawyers bill and the contract damages are generally not taxable at all you can see here for more information on that

kinda i 'd   be interested in seeing broader studies because minimum wage also influences other pay as well   i work in the medical field and most insurances base their rates off of what medicare medicaid pay in each geographic area by artificially setting the min wage too high you 're going to influence the jobs that require marginally more skills and experience than min wage jobs   obviously this influence has less effect the higher skilled and experience the position is but nonetheless influences them    moreover there are other things that minimum wage influences such as here in california the government thought it was a bright idea to require servers be paid the regular minimum wage plus tips instead of the lower federally legal server min wage this has had the effect that there are significantly more servers than low to mid skilled workers in ca because you can easily earn $ 20 30   or more per hour   not to mention they get ot for every minute over 8 hours they work   not to mention iirc cali requires that salaried employees must be paid twice min wage    so yeah while it does n't directly affect a lot of people but it indirectly affects a lot    but ask me if i think raising the min wage is a good idea fuck no

one reason why you may have gotten this advice is that stocks have an expected real return over time while commodities do not therefore when gambling on individual stocks odds are in your favor that they will ultimately go up over time you may do better or worse than the market as a whole but they will likely go up as the whole market on average rises over time commodities on the other hand have no expected real return it is more zero sum in fact after costs a real loss should be expected on average making gambling in here more risky

the classic definition of inflation is too much money chasing too few goods   within a tight range say 1 3 inflation is somewhat benign   there 's a nice inflation widget at the inflation calculator which helps me see that an item costing $ 1000 in 1975 would now 2010 be about $ 4000 and $ 1000 from 1984 till now just over $ 2000 i chose those two years to make a point first i am 48 i graduated college in 1984 so in my working life i 've seen the value of the dollar drop by half on the other hand it only took 9 years from 75 84 to see a similar amount of inflation occur   i 'd suggest that the 26 year period is far more acceptable than the 9 savers should be aware of their real return vs what was a result of inflation i 'm not either way but logically have to acknowledge the invisible tax of inflation i get a say 6 return pay 2 in tax but i 'm not ahead by 4 3 may be lost to inflation on the flip side my mortgage is 3.5 after taxes that 's but less than 0 after long term inflation so as a debtor i am benefiting by the effect of inflation on what i owe   interesting also to hear about deflation as we 've grown used to it in the case of electronics but little else perhaps the ipad wo n't drop in price but every year it will gain features and competitors will keep the tablet market moving yet people still buy these items   right now there 's not enough spending i 'd suggest that good financial advice aside people as a whole need to start spending to get the economy moving the return of some inflation would be a barometer of that spending starting to occur

the obvious advantage is turning your biggest liability into an income generating asset the downside are 1 you have to find tenants postings time to show the place credit background check and etc 2 you have to deal with tenants collection of rent repairs of things that broke by itself complaints from neighbors termination and etc 3 you have to deal with the repairs in many ways it 's no different from running another small business so it all boils down to how much time you are willing to invest and how handy you are in doing reno 's and/or small repairs around the house for profitability roi analysis you want to assume collection of 11 months of rent per year i.e. assume tenant does n't renew after year so you have the worst case scenario and factor in all the associated expense be honest   renting out a second property is a bit tricky as you often have to deal with a large operating expense i.e. mortgage and renting a basement apartment is not bad financially and you will have to get used to have strangers downstairs

everyone else seems to have focused rightly so on the negatives of credit cards high interest rates and why it is important to pay them off before interest starts accruing only 's answer briefly touched on rewards   to me this is the real purpose of credit cards in today 's age   most good rewards cards can get you anywhere from 1 2 cash back on all purchases and sometimes more on other categories   again assuming you can pay the balance in full each month and you are good at budgeting money using a credit card is an easy way to basically discount 1 2 of all of the spending you put on your card   again this only works to your advantage if you pay off the credit card in full using the above example of 20 interest that 's about 1.6 interest if the interest compounds monthly which wipes out your return on rewards if you just go one month without paying off the balance

the fed sets the overnight borrowing costs by setting its overnight target rate   the markets determine the rates at which the treasury can borrow through the issuance of bonds the fed 's actions will certainly influence the price of very short term bonds but the fed 's influence on anything other than very short term bonds in the current environment is very muted currently the most influential factor keeping bond prices high and yields low is the high demand for us treasuries coming from overseas governments and institutions   this is being caused by two factors sluggish growth in overseas economies and the ongoing strength of the us dollar   with many european government bonds offering negative redemption yields income investors see us yields as relatively attractive   those non us economies which do not have negative bond yields either have near zero yields or large currency risks or both   political issues such as the survival of the euro also weigh heavily on market perceptions of the current attractiveness of the us dollar   italian banks may be about to deliver a shock to the eurozone and the spanish and french banks may not be far behind another factor is the continued threat of deflation   growth is slowing around the world which negatively effects demand   commodity prices remain depressed low growth and recession outside of the us translate into a prolonged period of near zero interest rates elsewhere together with renewed qe programmes in europe japan and possibly elsewhere   this makes the us look relatively attractive and so there is huge demand for us dollars and bonds   any significant move in us interest rates risks driving to dollar ever higher which would be very negative for the future earning of us companies which rely on exports and foreign income   all of this makes the market believe that the fed 's hands are tied and low bond yields are here for the foreseeable future     of course even in the us growth is relatively slow and vulnerable to a loss of steam following a move in interest rates

your question is unclear about whether you are moving from bi weekly payments or to bi weekly payments let 's calculate each case bi weekly pay means you will be paid every two weeks the amount for each payment will be your annual salary divided by 26 possibly with a small decrease around 0.3 to account for the fact that years are slightly longer than 52 weeks i.e. there are slightly more than 26 two week periods in a year and possibly an even smaller adjustment to take account of the fact that some years are a day longer than that you will be paid literally every 14 days with some adjustments if a payday falls on a holiday if you are going to be paid twice a month then each payment will be your annual salary divided by 24 typically you are paid on the same days of each month for example the 1st and the or the last business day before those

futures contracts are a member of a larger class of financial assets called derivatives derivatives are called such because their payoffs depend on the price of other assets financial or real other kinds of derivatives are call options put options fixed income assets that mimic the behavior of derivatives are callable bonds bonds etc   a futures contract is a contract that specifies the following just like with any other contract there are two parties involved one party commits to delivering the underlying asset to the other party on expiration date in exchange for the futures price the other party commits to paying the futures price in exchange for the asset there is no price that any of the two parties pay upfront to engage in the contract the language used is so that the agent committing to receiving the delivery of the underlying asset is said to have bought the contract the agent that commits to make the delivery is said to have sold the contract   so answer your question buying on june 1 a futures contract at the futures price of $ 100 with a maturity date on august 1 means you commit to paying $ 100 for the underlying asset on august 1 you do n't have to pay anything upfront futures price is simply what the contract the underlying asset will exchange hands for

you might want to read about about the coase theorem   in law and economics the coase theorem attributed to ronald coase describes the economic efficiency of an economic allocation or outcome in the presence of externalities the theorem states that if trade in an externality is possible and there are no transaction costs bargaining will lead to an efficient outcome regardless of the initial allocation of property rights in practice obstacles to bargaining or poorly defined property rights can prevent bargaining this is similar to what you are asking each country has an endowment of gold and they must create a set amount of money to represent their endowment of gold this will establish an exchange rate if i have 5 tons of gold and you have 5 tons and i print 10 dollars and you print 20 then one of my dollars is worth two of your dollars   thus the amount of money is not   it 's the exchange rate between the countries if all the nations know each other 's gold endowment then we will have a perfect exchange rate if we do n't then currency printing will vary but arbitrage should drive it to an accurate price   gold and diamonds are both valuable in part due to scarcity but gold has been used as a measure of value because it 's been historically used as a medium of exchange people just realized that swapping paper was safer and cheaper than physically transporting gold but the idea of gold as a measure of value is present because that 's how it 's always been nobody creates these procedures but organizations like the imf ecb fed reserve etc implement monetary policy to regulate the money supply and arbitrage drives exchange rates to fair values

pay off your highest interest debt first credit card car maybe even mortgage pay minimums on all else student loans are typically low interest so pay off anything else first but double check your rate of course   even if you have no other debt you may still want to hang on to your savings instead of paying down your student loans if getting rid of your savings causes you to accrue debt for example if you have a low income and no savings you may accrue credit card debt high interest or you may want to buy a car with cash instead of getting a loan even if this is not an issue consider what you can do with your savings that others who lack them can not do you can put it into mutual funds which may offer higher rate of return albeit with risk than your student loan interest or you may pay a down payment on a home the very low interest rates of student loans are to a person with savings essentially a source of cheap money that does n't need to be justified to a bank you can use it as seed money to start a business as funds for travel for living expenses while in the peace corps or whatever else but if you pay down that principal you bind yourself in short pay down your student loans when there is no better use for the money

keep in mind there are a couple of points to ponder here rates are really low with rates being so low unless there is deflation it is pretty easy to see even moderate inflation of 1 2 being enough to eat the yield completely which would be why the returns are negative inflation is still relatively contained with inflation low there is no reason for the central banks to raise rates which would give new bonds a better rate thus this changes in cpi are still in the range where central banks want to be with their policy which means rates are low which if lower than inflation rates would give a negative real return which would be seen as a way to trigger more spending since putting the money into treasury debt will lose money to inflation in terms of purchasing power a good question to ponder is has this happened before in the history of the world and what could we learn from that point in time the idea for investors would be to find alternative holdings for their cash and bonds if they want to beat inflation though there are some inflation indexed bonds that are n't likely appearing in the chart that could also be something to add to the picture here

generally speaking   1 take the position size average daily volume   2 multiply that number by 10 or whatever of volume you think you can execute you can at best acct for 10 percent of traded volume on a day   3 you now have days until liquidation x   4 take the days until liquidation sample the return over   time x. i.e. if days until liquidation is 10 you would sample 10 day returns   5 calculate the distribution characteristics of this window mean var skew and calculate var based on some confidence   you can now have a liquidity risk expected loss and a   if position is on margin do n't forget to add the interest cost   note instead of taking 10 day return you can take the 10 day vwap and calculate return between open and 10 day vwap

thinking about the business overall your profit would be since this is a sole proprietorship the taxes are going to depend on your marginal tax rate if you file jointly your income will determine what your marginal tax rate is   if you file separately there likely would n't be any tax on that income since it 's less than the standard deduction but you lose benefits of filing jointly combined exemptions etc so think about how much she would charge what expenses are involved before taxes what the taxes would be on that profit and what the opportunity costs are is it worth time away from the kids hobbies etc for that hobby how much should a hobby business make to make it worth the effort of charging for such services that would fall in the expense section   are you talking about the actual costs tax prep etc or just the hassle of collecting accounting etc   certainly those are a consideration but it 's harder to quantify that   if you can come up with some sort of cost then certainly it would fit in the overall value equation i 'm not sure using additional social security benefits as a gauge is helpful since you would n't see those benefits until you 're of retirement age according to ss and a lot can happen between now and then

i know of at least one case where a person was convicted of structuring   the person was depositing his own money into his own bank account and was found guilty of structuring since he made several deposits under $ 10k.   the man did nothing illegal   he just felt it was safer to make several small deposits instead of one large deposit from the article prosecutors did not offer evidence of any other motive for behavior they said at trial that should have known better the point of the law is to make sure we do n't have people who try to fool the bank federal prosecutor told last week the fact that he was trying is against the law the law states the bank has to report any transactions over $ 10 k so the government can investigate any monetary activity   of course if you make several deposits under $ 10 k you 'll also be investigated and you could actually be breaking intent of the law for depositing your own money into your own bank account

be very careful about buying property because it has been going up quickly in recent years   there are some fundamental factors that limit the amount real estate can appreciate over time   in a nutshell the general real estate market growth is supported by the entry level property market   that is when values are appreciating people can sell and use the capital gains to buy more valuable property   this drives up the prices in higher value properties whose owners can use that to purchase more expensive properties and so on and so forth at some point in a rising market the entry level properties start to become hard for entry level buyers to afford   the machine of rising prices throughout the market starts grinding to a halt   this price level can be calculated by looking at average incomes in an area   at some percentage of income people can not buy into the market without crazy loans and if those become popular watch out because things can get really ugly   if you want an example just look back to the us in 2007 2009 and the nearly apocalyptic financial crisis that as with most investing you want to buy low and sell high   buying into a hot market is generally not very profitable   buying when the market is abnormally low tends to be a more effective strategy

correct by putting expenses on to a credit card which does not charge interest during the grace period and paying that balance every month in effect you earn interest on money you 've already spent however first savings account interest is something like .05 right now depending on your bank yeah it 's money but seriously that 's 4 cents per month on $ 1000   second two things can make this very wrong if you carry a balance you 'll pay much more in interest than you 'd get from practically any investment you could make with the cash in the meantime second a debit card can be used to get cash you already have from an atm not everyone takes credit you know and it 'll cost you little or nothing use a credit card for the same purpose and you 're paying 40 from the second the money comes out of the machine also correct rewards cards earn you more the more they 're used that 's because the card issuer makes money based on usage they get 3 of each transaction they 're happy to turn 1 of that up to a limit or subject to a spending floor back around to you again check the terms and conditions most cards have a limit on total rewards many of them also have fees either while you hold the card or when you try to redeem the rewards look for a card with high limits or no limits on rewards from spending and with no annual fee or reward redemption fee in addition to the above you build good credit history with good spending patterns however your credit score can fluctuate wildly because on one day you have very low leverage percent of credit limit used and on the next you 've bought $ 200 in groceries and so your leverage went up 20 on a card with a $ 1000 limit leverage under 10 is good leverage under 40 is ok and leverage over that starts looking bad with a $ 1000 limit with you maxing it out and then paying it off your credit score can fluctuate by 30 points on any given day

the stock market is no different in this respect to anything that 's bought or sold the price of a stock like many other things reflects what the seller is prepared to sell it at and what the buyer is prepared to offer for it if those things match then a transaction can take place the seller loses money but gains stocks they feel represent equivalent value the reverse happens for the buyer take buying a house for example did the buyer lose money when they bought a house sure they did but they gained a house the seller gained money but lost a house new money is created in the sense that companies can and do make profits those profits together with the expected profits from future years increase the value that is put on the company if we take something simple like a mining company then its value represents a lot of things and numerous other lesser things too the value of shares in the mining company will reflect all of these things it likely rises and falls in line with the price of the raw materials it mines and those change based on the overall supply and demand for those raw materials stocks do have an inherent value they are ownership of a part of a company you own part of the asset value profits and losses made by that company betting on things is different in that you 've no ownership of the thing you bet on you 're only dependent on the outcome of the bet

well what you said about money is the reason people say things are only worth what people are willing to pay for them there is plenty of economic reasons to for instance conserve and the environment because deforestation and destruction have negative externalities associated with that have to paid out in the future by who ever suffers from those externalities however there is n't a market for eco bonds or a way to value that effectively which is a real issue for ecological conservation   there are people trying to do what and there is an interesting article this week in the new scientist about such nexus between and economics but while there is clear value somewhere assigning it a price only works if people are willing to buy or invest in it    its quite sad how many of the critics of modern banking do n't really appreciate what they do and what finance does or more commonly confusion arises about what finance even is let alone what it does

in general there are two types of futures contract a put and call   both contract types have both common sides of a transaction a buyer and a seller   you can sell a put contract or sell a call contract also you 're just taking the other side of the agreement   if you 're selling it would commonly be called a sell to open meaning you 're opening your position by selling a contract which is different from simply selling an option that you currently own to close your position a put contract gives the buyer the right to sell shares or some asset commodity for a specified price on a specified date the buyer of the contract gets to put the shares on someone else    a call contract gives the buyer the right to buy shares or some asset commodity for a specified price on a specified date the buyer of the contract gets to call on someone for shares american options contracts allow the buyer can exercise their rights under the contract on or before the expiration date while european type contracts can only be exercised on the expiration date to address your example   typically for stock an option contract involves 100 shares of a stock   the value of these contracts fluctuates the same way other assets do   typically retail investors do n't actually exercise their contracts they just close a profitable position before the exercise deadline and let unprofitable positions expire worthless   if you were to buy a single call contract with an exercise price of $ 100 with a maturity date of august 1 for $ 1 per share the contract will have cost you $ 100   let 's say on august 1 the underlying shares are now available for $ 110 per share   you have two options option 1 on august 1 you can exercise your contract to buy 100 shares for $ 100 per share   you would exercise for $ 10,000 $ 100 times 100 shares then sell the shares for $ 10 profit per share less the cost of the contract and transaction costs option 2 your contract is now worth something closer to $ 10 per share up from $ 1 per share when you bought it   you can just sell your contract without ever exercising it to someone with an account large enough to exercise and/or an actual desire to receive the asset or commodity

people who choose not to work in which case they have no business receiving anything but basic food and shelter from society   but currently they do n't even receive that   the actual effect of the lack of housing food and basic income programs is that the living wage the minimum necessary wage necessary to make it worth working is much higher than we need it to be if we really want to compete   gt;the only reason unemployment is so bad today is because america is losing many jobs to technology and globalization and not finding ways to compete and our work force ca n't handle many of the new jobs anyways    the systematic transfer of wealth from labor to capital nowadays plays no part   come on

this arrangement is a scam to get around certain tax and benefits laws both state and federal i know they ca n't get away with this with a person as contractor but this he 's not a contractor he 's a business owner may move it into a gray area i used to know this stuff cold but i 've been retired for a while the fact that they asked you to do this is at all is a red flag ® they think that this way they wo n't be paying 1/2 your fica your 's comp health insurance overtime sick leave or vacation time you will a somewhat simplistic rule of thumb for setting contracting rates is to take your targeted annual salary as a full time full benefits employee and double it so $ 50,000 becomes $ 100,000 a year $ becomes $ you can tell them that driving to their workplace from your company 's location is now a site visit and charge them your hourly rate for the one way commute time you could also tell them that your company charges 150 for hours worked over 40 hours week plus 150 on saturdays and 200 on your company may also have a minimum 30 days notice of termination with a penalty kicker get it all in writing and signed by someone who has the authority to sign it also get a lawyer the most expensive contracts i 've ever signed were ones i thought i was smart enough to draw up myself

i do n't want to hate on those other comments but as a college student having a 4.0 and going to a target school are not realistic goals for everyone the best advice i would give you is to be passionate about the field it sounds dumb on its face but being involved in student investment clubs funds or competing in investment competitions are great ways to get exposure and meet people in the field while building your resume internships are incredibly important because that 's where you prove to yourself and others that you are a capable person    you also have a lot of options ahead of you you can do research client facing roles cfp and even corporate finance i was n't a finance major but i spent 3 years in college working in our student managed investment fund and it absolutely paid off now doing corporate finance you have to want to learn and grow it 's not realistic for a college student with limited resources to get your cfa level 1 or series exams especially if it does n't suit your field be open to different types of jobs and build relationships with your professors who are well connected it does help to have stellar grades and it helps to be at a top school but our state school has put kids on the street you just have to be hungry and realistic about your talents and passion    good luck to you

since all the other answers thus far seem to the risk likelihood of the money being seized i figure i may as well make my comment an answer unless you happen to have your legal team travelling with you and your suitcase of cash you should expect that you 'll be questioned extensively so that any sign of in your answers or anything you say that does n't make sense to the officer will be used as an excuse to seize your money and you 'll learn an expensive lesson in civil asset forfeiture the government will file a complaint against your money leading to a ridiculously named case such as united states v. $ in u.s. currency worth noting that while the outcome in this case was not in the government 's favor in the vast majority of cases the government keeps the cash between 9/11 and 2014 u.s police forces have seized over 2.5 billion dollars in cash without search warrants or and returned the money in less than 10 of cases   that last link is kind of a long read but contains cases where people with completely legitimate money and documentation for their money had it seized anyway and were only able to recover it after months or years in court

the intention of making the charitable contributions tax deductible is to provide an economic incentive to contribute to organizations which tend to improve the general welfare of the community deductibility impacts government revenue generation but has positive impacts that probably offset that loss by encouraging more giving by folks subject to high income tax particularly small business owners   unless you own a home and have a mortgage you may not have enough deductions to get any financial benefit from charitable contributions charitable contributions are only deductible when your deductions exceed the standard deduction   for most people charitable contributions are a way to support something that you care about and the tax benefits are a secondary benefit or a way to enhance their own giving

this scheme does n't work because the combination of corporation tax even the lower tax plus the personal income tax does n't give you a tax advantage not on any realistic income i 've ever worked it out on anyway   prior to the 2014 tax year on lower incomes you could scrape a bit of an advantage but the 2013 budget changed the calculation for the tax credit on non eligible dividends so there should n't be an advantage anymore moreover if you were to do it this way by paying corporation tax instead of cpp you are n't eligible for cpp if you sit with a calculator for long enough you may figure out a way of saving $ 200 or something small but it 's a lot of paperwork for little if any benefit and you would n't get cpp i understand the money multiplier effect described above but the tax system is designed in a way that it makes more sense to take it as salary and put it in a tax deferred saving account i.e. an rrsp so there 's no limit on the multiplier effect like i said sit with a calculator if you 're earning a really large amount and are still under the small business limit it may make more sense to use a but that is the case regardless of using it as a tax shelter because if you 're earning a lot you 're probably running a business of some size the main benefit i think is that if you use a you can carry forward your losses but you have to be aware of the definition of an allowable business investment loss

what are pivot points pivot points indicate price levels that are of significance in technical analysis of securities pivot points are used to provide clarity for a trader as they are a predictive indicator of where a security might go there are at least 6 different types of pivot points pivot point fibonacci pivot etc and they are different based on their formulas but generally serve the same concept i will be answering your question using the pivot point formula pivot point formula generally any pivot point formula uses a combination of the open high low and close of the previous timeframe since you are technically a swing trader indicated by   say between a couple of days to a couple of weeks as i do n't want to    do day trading you should use a weekly 5 to 30 minute chart but you can also use a daily chart as well so for example if you use a daily chart you would use the open high low and close of the previous day example of fictitious stock money stack exchange open high low close 11.50 on level level r2 level level pivot point s1 level s2 level s3 level s4 level r = resistance s = support   how to identify these pivot points most charting software already have built in that will identify the pivot points for you but you can always find and draw them yourself with an tool since we are using the pivot point formula the important pivot point levels are the which is considered as the breakout pivot the s4 which is considered as the breakdown pivot and s3 are reversal pivot points once identify the pivot points how should you proceed in a trade this is the million dollar question and without spoon feeding you requires you to come up with your own strategy to distinguish yourself from being a novice and pro trader is to have a strategy in a trade now i do n't really have the time to look for actual charts to provide examples with but generally this is what you should look for to proceed in a trade potential buy short signals potential sell signals if a stock moves above the level but then crosses below it this would be a sell signal this is confirmed when their is a lower lower then the candle that first crosses below it sell a stock when s4 level is confirmed see above for the confirmation other useful tips use the pivot point as your support or resistance the pivot point levels can be used for your stop loss for example with an s3 reversal buy signal the s4 should be used as a stop loss conversely the pivot point levels can also be used for your target prices for example with an s3 reversal buy signal you should take some profits at level you should also use a combination of other indicators to give you more information to confirm if a signal is correct examples of a good combination is the rsi macd and moving averages read that book in my comment above

for big values the loss becomes negligible say you have a 10 chance to get 10 million $ expected value 1 m you sell that chance for which loses you 10k of expected income why would you throw away 10k because in the face of getting almost 1 m the 10k are insignificant 1 m and will make you roughly equally rich also the increase from 1 m to 10 m is less than 10x since 1 m gives you maybe 90 of the freedom that 10 m does depending on how well you can make 10 m work for you most people will just let it rot in the bank another way to look at it is to look at bankruptcy risk say i have 10k in the bank which is nice those 10k can not pay for a new house or 2 cars mine and the one i hit so i have a small risk of significant loss if i buy an insurance i reduce my chance of going bankrupt from maybe 0.001 to 0 for a fairly small price usually you can buy insurance fairly cheap if you raise your deductible to maybe 5k both for the house and the car so that you shoulder the risk you can risk = gaining money and paying an insurance to shoulder the rest for you that way you minimize the cost to remove the risk of bankruptcy it makes sense to shoulder as much risk as you can unless a fixed fee of the insurance makes in before paying others to do it for you so you can optimize your income while removing fatal risks

in your case i think you are doing just fine   index funds by their nature have lower transaction costs and fewer taxable events than actively managed funds good work    index funds do not preclude the generation of dividends and by their nature they probably generate slightly more than actively managed funds    you could take capital gain or dividend or both distributions rather than reinvest them if paying the taxes are a hardship   otherwise look at the taxes you pay as your contributions to these funds   it stinks but this is why 401k ira were rather revolutionary when they were formed   it was a really good deal to not have people 's capital gains eaten by taxes when they occurred   now its old hat but it was pretty darn cool at the time should you prefer rather than vfiax   we ca n't really make the call on that one   which one will perform better after taxes   its anyone 's guess it is kind of a good problem to have

the first thing i would try is to take out a loan from a local credit union if you do n't know of any that you 're eligible for start looking at the national credit union administration 's credit union locator you should be able to get a good rate since your credit is so good if for whatever reason you ca n't get the credit union loan i would open another credit card try hard to get the loan though because using a credit card will most likely be significantly more expensive if you ca n't cover your cash only expenses with cash you already have make sure that you can get cash from the card for example one of my cards regularly sends me checks that i could write to myself to get cash but be careful with this strategy usually the interest is much higher than normal purchases either way until you 've paid off this emergency debt and built up an emergency fund of 3 6 months of expenses cut your expenses as much as possible this experian article has some good tips

in general you can do whatever you 'd like with the money many perhaps most banks offer different ways to receive the money with the two most popular options being direct payment to other debts or direct deposit into your bank account if you choose the latter you can do whatever you 'd like with that money once you receive it even in the case when you have the bank make direct payments to other credit cards i 'm guessing they will not care if it 's someone else 's name on the account but that could be bank specific some tips

indeed there 's no short term long term issue trading inside the ira and in fact no reporting if you have a large ira balance and trade 100 for example times per year there 's no reporting at all   as you note long term gains outside the ira are treated favorably in the tax code as of now 2012 but that 's subject to change also to consider the worst thing i did was to buy apple in my ira a huge gain that will be taxed as ordinary income when i withdraw it had this been in my regular account i could sell and pay the long term cap gain rate this year   last there 's no concept of wash sale in one 's ira as there 's no taking a loss for shares sold below cost to clarify trading solely within an ira wo n't trigger wash sale rules a realized loss in a taxable account combined with a purchase inside an ira can trigger the wash sale rule if the stock is purchased inside the ira 30 days before or after the sale at a loss thank you dilip for the comment aside from the warnings of trading too much or running afoul of frequency restrictions your observation is correct

are you in the us because if so there are tax discrepancies gains from sale of stocks held for less than one year are subject to ordinary income tax so probably around 30 if you hold those stocks for a year or more gains will be taxed as capital gains tax 15   for forex taxes on your earnings will be split 60/40 60 will be traded at the lower 15 rate while the remaining 40 will be taxed at a higher rate approximately 30   so purely short term there is a tax advantage to in forex however these are both incredibly risky things to do with your money i never would recommend anyone invest short term looking to make quick cash in fact the tax code discourages people from short term investments

if it 's feasible try to get one card down to zero balance and preferably one of your cash back cards   then keep that at zero every month pay it off in full and use it for your purchases as you describe above the idea would be to get it so that you are not paying interest on your month to month purchases   this not only reduces the 20 or whatever that you 're paying on that balance but also the 20 or whatever you 're paying on those purchases remember a card you carry a balance on charges you interest on those purchases from the current month if this is n't feasible if these are all very high balance cards then i suppose the way you 're currently doing it would be okay though i think you 're overthinking things to some extent but with 80 interest if that 's a significant pile of money you may need to as clearly that needs to be tackled first   i think it 's mostly better for you to pay your day to day stuff out of pocket and not use your cards the way you are suggesting but with the 80 you may need to the reason i say it 's better not to use your card the way you suggest is that it is difficult to do properly and never get it wrong i.e. never go over a balance and it 's also leaving you in the habit of using credit   it does n't help you budget necessarily either   instead set up a fully developed budget that includes all of those minimum payments and pay them   certainly once you have the > 50 debt handled i would switch to this method not using credit cards at all

as chris pointed out if your expenses are covered by the income exactly as you have said to assume then you are basically starting with a $ 40 k asset your starting equity and ending with a $ 200 k asset a paid for home at the same value since you have said to ignore any appreciation so to determine what you have earned on the $ 40 k you leveraged 5x would n't it be a matter of computing a cagr that gets you from $ 40 k to $ 200 k in 30 years the result would be a nominal return not a real return so if i set up the problem correctly it should be $ 40,000 1 + = $ 200,000 then solve for return it works out to be about or so

the market can stay irrational longer than you can remain solvent maynard keynes the stocks could stagnate and trade in a thin range or decline in value you assume that your stocks will offer you any positive return for every month over 24 months just one month of negative returns puts you underwater that s what s wrong with it   even if you identified any stock that has been up every month for a consecutive 24 months in the past there is nothing that says it will be so in the future and a broad market selloff will effect both indexes as well as individual stocks   literally any adverse macroeconomic event in the next two years will put you underwater on your loan no matter how much research you do on individual stocks

i think the part of your question about not wanting to mess up more is the most important element you say you know someone with good credit who is willing to co sign for you but let 's be honest your credit is n't bad for no reason   your credit 's bad because you have a history of not paying on your obligations putting someone else 's credit at risk even though they may be willing to try and help could be doing exactly what you said you 're trying to avoid messing up more   this person 's heart is in the right place but you really have to ask yourself if you should put them in jeopardy by agreeing to guarantee your debts so the vehicle you bought is older and has a lot of miles you knew that when you bought it   so you 're paying a high interest rate because of your bad credit history you knew that when you bought it   why you think the vehicle 's only going to last another year is what confuses me   there are many vehicles out there with much higher mileage that are still on the road and with proper preventative maintenance there 's no reason your truck ca n't do the same the fact is you just do n't like what you 're paying or what you 're driving even though you were good with both when someone was willing to extend you credit so now you see this other person 's willingness to co sign for you as your ticket out of a situation you no longer want to be in my suggestion is that you stay with the loan you have take care of the vehicle to make it last and prove that you can pay your obligations   hopping from loan to loan is n't going to do your credit any favors   one of the big factors for your credit score is the average age of accounts   going and signing a new loan now will only drag that number down and hurt your score not help it   and there 's no guarantee the next car you buy with your friend 's help is going to last the length of that loan either i would be careful about this grass is greener on the other side attitude and just bear through your situation if only to prove to yourself that you can do it    there 's nothing saying your friend wo n't still be willing to co sign for you later on down the line of something does happen to the truck but you can show them that you 're trying to be responsible in the meantime by following through on what you already agreed to

your biggest concern will be what happens during the transition period in the past when my employer made a switch there has been a lockout period where you could n't move money between funds then over a weekend the money moved from investment company a to investment company b. all the moves were mapped so that you knew which funds your money would be invested in then staring monday morning you could switch them if you did n't like the mapping no money is lost because the transfer is actually done in $ 's imagine both investment companies had the same s&p 500 fund and that the transfer takes a week if when the first accounts are closed the s&p500 fund has a share value of $ 100 your 10 account has a value of $ 1000 if the dividend capital gains are distributed during that week the price per share when the money arrives in the second investment company will now be $ 99 so that instead of 10 shares $ 100 you now will buy shares $ 99 no money was lost you want that lookout period to be small and you want the number of days you are not invested in the market to be zero the lockout limits your ability to make investment changes if for instance the central bank raises rates the number of days out of the market is important if during that period of time there is a big price increase you would n't want to miss it of course the market could also go lower during that time

as well as paying 8 interest on your loan i.e. $ you 're also wasting money on the car depreciation insurance etc so it 's worth a lot to you to get out of it set against that is the risk of having to borrow the $ 3000 you 'll be taking from your emergency fund at a higher interest rate say 30 for at most 6 months which would only cost you $ 300-$400 even if it happens you 'll also be giving up a small amount of interest on the $ 3000 but at current interest rates that pretty much negligible there is a small chance that an emergency would also cause the available credit on your credit cards to disappear but in the short term that should be pretty unlikely so i think the balance is overwhelmingly in favour of getting out of the loan as soon as you can

you 're not being over taxed the withholding is just aggressive   employer 's do n't know your whole tax situation all they can go on is the amount they pay you minus deductions then extrapolate that to an annual number and withhold according to your w4 you could ratchet up your w4 exemptions and this will help your current withholding   when you do your taxes next april this will all shake out and you will likely receive a large refund    it 's also worth noting that your federal withholding given the numbers above is just about 19 not 27 which does match the federal tax table if your annual income was $ 72,000 as your semi monthly paycheck indicates   that should be closer to 14 at an annual income of $ 36,000   the medicare related taxes are flat amounts   so really you 're talking about an approximately 5 discrepancy on the $ 18,000 you 'll earn during this internship or about $ 900 if you feel like you 're being welcome to paying taxes

i think your question is the reason why generics are cheaper part of what you 're paying for in a brand is consistency   depending on what you buy and where you shop it may be a no brainer to buy the generic brand of certain products buying generic otc drugs is in that category it 's amazing to me that anyone purchases tylenol when the generics deliver superior quality at half the cost but for other products subtle differences can be significant my wife would never purchase generic flour which seems like it would be a commodity product for baking as she 's a serious baker and there are qualitative differences and consistency issues between brands if i were just making gravy the those differences do n't really matter

if you are just trying to curb impulse spending i 'd suggest the following   1 set up a separate bank account for your savings do not order checks or a debit card for this account 2 get your employer to split your paycheck to put the saving amount in the new account most employers will do this the trick to avoid impulse spending is to make it a chore to get at the money with the above arrangement you would have to physically go to the bank fill out a withdrawal slip and get cash this way you still can access the money in an emergency but it forces you to plan things out better

a rule of thumb i like to follow when purchasing things from cl listed well below value is this assess the level of of the seller people living in poor neighborhoods are much more likely to try and hide things that would deter buyers as they are more likely to need the money i find that when i go to a big house with 4 cars in the driveway the seller is more likely to be honest because she likely does n't need the money from the sale   edit i seem to have the pc police with this answer this is based on facts and statistics not my opinion i have no bias against poor people

to build a us credit record you need a social security number ssn which is now not available for most non residents    an alternative is an itin number which is now available to non residents only if they have us income giving a reason to file a us tax return do you really want to get into all that assuming you did have a reason to get a itin one reason would be if you sold some ebooks via amazon us and need a withholding refund under the tax treaty then recent reports on give mixed results on whether it 's possible to get a credit card with an itin and whether that would build a credit record   it does sound possible in some cases    a credit record in any other country would not help   you would certainly need a us address and banks are increasingly asking for a physical address rather than just a mailbox regardless building this history would be of limited benefit to you if you later became a us resident at that point you would be eligible for a new ssn different from the itin and have to largely start again if getting a card is the aim rather than the credit record you may find some banks that will offer a secured card or a debit card to non residents especially in areas with lots of canadian visitors border florida arizona   you 'd find it a lot easier with a us address though and you 'd need to shop around a lot of banks in person until you find one with the right rules   most will simply avoid anyone without an ssn

i believe your statement is mostly correct   all the expert recommendations are based on an inflexible conventional wisdom that presumes that all renters are relatively resource poor when you purchase a $ 50 electronic item at the store and are offered an extended warranty for $ 3 most people turn it down not only because they do n't think it 's worth it but also because in the event that the item fails between say years 1 and 3 they do n't worry enough about that $ 50 to care if they have to buy a new one or live without it the percentage of your net worth also matters for example if you had an entire loss tomorrow you 'd be out $ 20 k if you needed to re purchase your possessions 30 k minus 10 k in current coverage $ 20 k is approximately or 2.3 of your net worth if a catastrophe occurs and you only lose 2.3 of your net worth some might consider that lucky so from that point of view it is n't really a big deal but on the flip side if the extra insurance only costs you $ 50 more per year you may not even notice that dent in your net worth either i think for most people the value of items in their home may be their net worth or at least a much larger percentage of it in which case the insurance makes more sense for someone in your position it probably does n't make much difference either way if you had $ 300 k in valuables in your house perhaps your point of view would be different

assuming you are referring to macro corrections and crashes as opposed to technical crashes like the flash crash it is certainly possible to sell stocks during a market drop by definition the market is dropping not only because there are a larger number of sellers but more importantly because there are a large number of transactions that are driving prices down in fact volumes are strongly correlated with volatility so volumes are actually higher when the market is going down dramatically you can verify this on yahoo or google finance pick a liquid stock like spy and look at 2008 vs recent years that does n't say anything about the kind of selling that occurs though with respect to your question what s the best strategy for selling stocks during a drop it really depends on your objective you can generally always sell at some price that price will be worse during market crashes beyond the obvious fact that prices are declining spreads in the market will be wider due to heightened volatility many people are forced to sell during crashes due to external and or psychological pressures and sometimes selling is the right thing to do but the best strategy for long term investors is often to just hold on

generically like noted in the other answer you will only come ahead in dollar terms when you are significantly riskier than the average otherwise the insurance company would have higher rates to make a profit in the case of apple care there can arguably be other factors involved if you did not insure your $ 2000 laptop and it broke just after the warranty period would you replace it with a new apple product maybe not so apple could lose a customer that means they have an incentive to keep you happy if your product breaks but insurance replaces it you are a happier customer and more likely to buy other apple products this is not an incentive for traditional insurance companies that only do business in insurance now with the profit margins apple likes in general i do n't know if they 've underpriced their insurance i sort of doubt it even but their margins on it are probably not high meaning it 's a closer call even if you are only risky

your question is based on incorrect assumptions generally there 's no penalty per se to make a withdrawal from your rrsp even if you make a withdrawal earlier than retirement however you define it a precise meaning for retirement with respect to rrsps is largely irrelevant our u.s. neighbours have a 10 penalty on non hardship early withdrawals before age 59 half from retirement accounts like the 401k and ira it 's an additional measure designed to discourage early withdrawals and raise more tax   yet in canada there is no similar penalty individual investments inside your rrsp may have associated penalties such as the dreaded deferred sales charge of some back end loaded mutual funds or such as funds that generated additional special tax credits that could get clawed back   yet these early withdrawal penalties are distinct from the rrsp nature of your account   choose your investments carefully to avoid these kinds of surprises rather an rrsp is a tax deferred account and it works like this   the government allows you to claim a nice juicy tax deduction which can reduce your income tax at your marginal rate in the year you make a contribution or later if you should choose to defer the deduction the resulting pre tax money accumulated in your rrsp benefits from further tax deferral assets can grow without attracting annual income tax on earned interest dividends or capital gains you do n't need to declare on your income tax return any of the income earned inside your rrsp unlike a regular investment account here 's the rub once you decide to withdraw money from your rrsp the entire amount withdrawn is considered regular income in the year in which you make the withdrawal   thus your withdrawals are subject to income tax and yes at your marginal rate   this is always the case whether before or after retirement you mentioned two special programs the home buyers plan hbp and the lifelong learning plan llp   neither the hbp nor the llp permit tax free withdrawals   rather each of these programs are special kinds of loans that you can borrow from your own rrsp hbp and llp loan money is n't taxed when you get it because you are required to pay it back and you pay it back into your own rrsp you always pay income tax at your marginal rate on your rrsp withdrawals above i said a precise meaning for retirement with respect to rrsps is largely irrelevant   yet there are ages that matter   by the end of the year in which you turn 71 you are required to convert your rrsp to a it 's similar but you can no longer contribute and you must withdraw a minimum amount each year other circumstances related to age may qualify for minor tax relief intended for retirees such as the age amount or the pension income credit   generally such measures do n't significantly change the fact that you pay income tax on rrsp withdrawals at your marginal rate these measures raise the minimum you can take out without attracting tax but most do nothing at the margin exception one might split eligible pension income with a spouse or common law partner which may reduce tax at the margin

so i see that you replied again despite i am done with you thanks we will resolve this debate one day   gt when you say something is maybe it is factual but when i say something is maybe it 's fiction i had assumed something else   you really try very hard to not understand simple things and it seems that you succeed in that   again my maybe is about how trump will reduce drug prices as he said and says he would your maybe"(s are about how trump does not want and will not reduce drug prices despite him saying he would so you have a maybe facts that trump will not reduce drug prices while i have a maybe on how he would do it    any additional questions objections or misunderstanding on your side in regards to this subject    gt i did give you a possibility which is a maybe so that means i am wrong and global warming is no risk at all yes what you say is starting to make sense   if there are clear proofs that global warming very slight rise in temperature is or will cause instability or expenses then i ca n't argue back   so all you can come up with are possibilities and more maybe"(s to tell us about and expenses and you think this will convince anyone except members of the church of    for god sake i even asks for specifics and you did not and can not name any will we have wars will we have diseases and will we have hunger    of course not wars will not start because it 's slightly more hot disease will not spread because it 's a bit more hot hunger will not occur because warmer weather and more rain is just even more food   what on earth are you talking about what are the terrible things that will happen if it 's a bit hotter    are you going to be al gore again who in his an inconvenient truth truth movie in 2006 predicted there will be no more and other catastrophes well an inconvenient truth the will come out and sorry we have and nothing from the first movie became true nothing i loved how he said in the first movie stronger storms will kill and destroy the last few years had less storms than ever   gt;&gt how could a person like you who seek truth vote for democrats   gt it can only be because i have serious mental health problems there is no other explanation   yes i believe you   blind belief in a religion far left liberalism and/or make any person blind to truth logic facts and even moderate views   gt;&gt you are trying to convince me that russia knew he trump would win the gop debate against 13 others and colluded with him between july until the elections november to make him win   gt that is totally it i am so impressed that even though i never mentioned russia at all you were able to see through my facade an my actual goal in this discussion   yes you did not mention russians but you see i easily figure out people like you   you actually also believe that russians are responsible for trump in addition to all the terrible things you believe about trump    but the dnc and hillary oh no they are fine despite hillary selling and getting for selling 20 of usa uranium to russia making $ 500,000 for a speech to russian bankers etc   so i will not stop and demand if you can to tell me about one action by trump you oppose to   also tell me why i it would be better if voted hillary dnc what would they do better for us that trump does not do

fwiw i do n't actually put much credit in the laffer curve but just like to point out that the argument that it justifies tax cuts is predicated on being above the peak rather than below   i 'll also point out that the biggest expansions of the us economy happened under a top marginal rate of 90 that rate was basically only on income higher than what 99.9 make of course explaining marginal tax rates to most people fails if you say were lowering rates but adding more brackets at the top end 90 99 99.9 99.99 ile for instance or even doing something like lowering tax rates but all personal income is taxed the same and possibly dividends are taxed at the income tax rate of the individual but are deductible from the corporate income

the financial reasons beyond simply owning your home outright are you 're no longer paying interest yes the interest is tax deductible in the u.s. though not in canada but the tax savings is a percentage of a percentage if you paid say $ 8000 in interest last year at the 25 marginal rate you effectively save $ 2000 off your taxes but if you paid off your home and had that $ 8000 in your pocket you 'd pay the $ 2000 in taxes but you 'd have $ 6000 left over which is the better deal in canada the decision gets even easier you pay taxes on the interest money either way so you 're either spending the $ 8000 in interest lost forever as cost of capital or on other things whatever you 're earning is going into your own pocket not the bank 's similar to the interest but also including principal a home you own outright is a mortgage payment you do n't have to make you can now use that money principal and interest for other things whether these advantages outweigh those of anything else you could do with a few hundred grand depends primarily on the rate of return if you got in at the bottom of the mortgage crisis which is pretty much right now and got a rate in the 3 4 range with no mip or other payment on top then almost anything you can do with the amount you 'd need to pay off a mortgage principal would get you a better rate of return however you 'll need some market savvy to avoid risks   in most cases when someone has pretty much any debt and a big wad of cash they 're considering how to spend i usually recommend paying off the debt because that is in effect a risk free way to increase the net rate of return on your total wealth and income balancing debt with investments always carries with it the risk that the investment will fail leaving you stuck with the debt paying the debt on the other hand will guarantee that you do n't have to pay interest on that outstanding amount anymore so it 's no longer offsetting whatever gains you are making in the market on your savings or future investments

i would suggest the following rationale this appears to be a most unsatisfactory state of affairs however you can bet that this is how things are handled as to who receives the dividend you have payed this will be whoever the counter party or counter parties are that were assigned the exercise edit looking at the spy options we see that the expiry date is 23 dec.   therefore your options have been exercised prior to expiry   the time stamp is probably due to the overnight batch processing of your brokers computer system   the party exercising the options will have chosen to exercise on the day prior to ex dividend in order to receive the dividends

from paul and mike of the 101 years of global investment returns princeton princeton university press 2002 the small firm effect has not proved the road to    great riches since soon after its discovery the us size premium went    into reverse this was repeated in the united kingdom and virtually    all other markets around the world despite their disappointing performance in recent years the very    long run record of small caps remains one of outperformance in both    the united states and the united kingdom furthermore and    small size companies are still an important asset class their    differential performance over long periods of history shows that there    is useful scope for investors to reduce risk by diversifying across    the large and the small capitalization sectors of the market    furthermore given the of the size effect across the    entire size spectrum it is important to all investors since the    size tilt of any portfolio will strongly influence its short- and    long run performance this holds true whether there is a size premium    or a size discount the size effect has certainly proved persistent    and robust what is at issue is whether we should continue to expect a    size premium over the longer haul and accompanying charts     and one chart from blackrock

let 's say today you buy the bond issued by at let 's say morning the tv says that is going towards default if it happens it wo n't give you back not even the 18 $ you invested you and others that bought the same bond like you will get scared and try to sell the bond but a potential buyer wo n't buy it for 18 $ anymore they will risk maximum couple of bucks therefor the price of your bond tomorrow is worth 2 $ and not 18 anymore bond prices even zero coupon ones do fluctuate like shares but with less i.e. on the same period of time ups and downs are smaller in percentage compared to shares edit geo asked in the comment below what happens to the bond the fed rises the interest it very similar to what i explained above let 's say today you buy the bond just issued by us treasury at today the fed rewards money at 2 and the bond you bought promised you a reward of 2 per year for 10 years even if it 's zero coupon it will give you almost the same reward of one with coupons the only difference is that it will give you all the money back at once that is when the bond expires let 's say morning the tv says that fed decided to rise the interest rates and now on it lends money rewarding a wonderful 4 to investors us treasury will also have to issue bonds at 4 you can obviously keep your bond until expiration and unless us goes default you will get back all your money until the last cent but if you decide to sell your bond you will find out that people wo n't be willing to pay 50 $ anymore because on the market they can now buy the same type of bond for the same period of time 10 years that give them 4 per year and not a poor 2 like yours so people will be willing to pay maximum 40 $ for your bond or less

i notice that a lot happened four months ago you were denied credit twice your income went up from $ 20k to $ 60k i 'm wondering if you were denied credit based on your $ 20k income since you could n't provide proof of your income i wonder if they used $ 0 for your income   debt to income ratio is one significant factor included in the credit score calculation you may not have a lot of debt but if you do n't have any income even a few hundred dollars on a credit card would throw your debt to income ratio into a panic i 'm assuming that your change from $ 20k to $ 60k income involved a change of jobs perhaps now you can provide proof of income you would certainly need to do that before being approved for a mortgage   well that 's my two cents about what may or may not have gone wrong last time as for what to do next i would agree that the most helpful thing you could do is check your credit score and fix any errors that might negatively impact your credit score there might also be non errors that need addressed such as open credit accounts that you thought you had closed when building credit history time is on your side if you just go on living your life and paying your bills promptly your credit will slowly climb to an acceptable level unfortunately in the time frame you mentioned ~1 year there is n't really enough time to build it significantly   you bring up a valid point about credit applications reducing your credit score of course that effect is somewhat minimal and temporary 2 yrs according to the thread linked to above but again 1 year is not enough to recover if you 're considering applying for additional credit as a means to improve your credit score it may be too late to reap the benefits before your mortgage application of course if you could pay off any debts that would help your debt to income ratio but it would also reduce any house down payment you could save up and thereby increase the amount of your mortgage   better just save those pennies or preferably and to put toward a down payment

as others have pointed out there are often many factors that are contributing to a stock 's movement other than the latest news   in particular the overall market sentiment and price movement very often is the primary driver in any stock 's change on a given day    but in this case i 'd say your anecdotal observation is correct all else equal announcements of layoffs tend to drive stock prices upwards here 's why to the public layoffs are almost always a sign that a company is willing to do whatever is needed to fix an already known and serious problem mass layoffs are brutally hard decisions   even at companies that go through cycles of them pretty regularly they 're still painful every time   there 's a strong personal drain on the chain of executives that has to decide who loses their livelihood   and even if you think most execs do n't care and i think you 'd be wrong it 's still incredibly distracting    the process takes many weeks during which productivity plummets and it 's to everyone when it happens so companies very rarely do it until they think they have to   by that point they are likely struggling with some very publicly known problems usually contracting or negative margins    so the market 's view of the company at the time just before layoffs occur is almost always this company has problems but is unable or unwilling to solve them   layoffs signal that both of those possibilities are incorrect   they suggest that the company believes that layoffs will fix the problem and that they 're willing to make hard calls to do so and that 's why they usually drive prices up

i 'm 39 and have been investing since my very early 20 's and the advice i 'd like to go back and give myself is the following 1 time is your friend compounding interest is a powerful force and is probably the most important factor to how much money you are going to wind up with in the end save as much as you possibly can as early as you can you have to run twice as hard to catch up if you start late and you will still probably wind up with less in the end for the extra effort 2 do n't invest 100 of your investment money it always me to let my cash sit idle in an investment account because the   notion of inflation eating up my money and i felt i was wasting opportunity cost by not being fully invested in something however not having enough investable cash around to buy into the fire sale dips in the market made me miss out on opportunities 3 diversify the bubble taught me this in a big hairy painful way i had this idea that as a i really understood the tech bubble and over invested in tech stocks i just knew that i was on top of things as an industry insider and would know when to jump yeah that did n't work out so well i lost more than 6 figures at least on paper diversification will the ups and downs somewhat and make the market a lot less scary in the long run 4 mind your expenses it took me years of paying huge full service broker fees to realize that those clowns do n't seem to do any better than anyone else at picking stocks even when they do the transaction costs are a lead weight on your returns the same holds true for mutual funds etfs shop for low expense ratios aggressively it is really hard for a fund manager to consistently beat the indexes especially when you burden the returns with expense ratios that skim an extra 1 or so off the top the expense ratio broker fees are among the very few things that you can predict reliably when it comes to investments take advantage of this knowledge 5 have an exit strategy for every investment people are emotional creatures it is hard to be logical when you have skin in the game and most people are n't disciplined enough to just admit when they have a loser and bail out while they are in the red or conversely admit when they have a winner and take profits before the party is over it helps to counteract this instinct to have an exit strategy for each investment you buy that is you will get out if it drops by x% or grows by y% in fact it is probably a good idea to just enter those sell limit orders right after you buy the investment so you do n't have to convince yourself to press the button in the heat of a big move in the price of that investment do n't try to predict tops or bottoms they are extremely hard to guess and things often turn so fast that you ca n't act on them in time anyway get out of an investment when it has met your goal or is going to far in the wrong direction if you find yourself saying it has to come back eventually slap yourself   when you are trying to decide whether to stay in the investment or bail the most important question is if i had the current cash value of the stock instead of shares would i buy it today because essentially that is what you are doing when you stick with an investment 6 do n't invest in fads when you are investing you become sensitive to everyone 's opinions on what investment is hot and what is not if everyone is talking about a particular investment avoid it the more enthusiastic people are about it even experts the more you should avoid it when everyone starts forming investment clubs at work and the stock market seems to be the preferred topic of conversation at every party you go to get out   i 'm a big fan of contrarian investing take profits when it feels like all the momentum is going into the market and buy in when everyone seems to be running for the doors

paypal is free for buyers taking their profit from the sellers in much the same way that credit cards take a percentage from the seller though they will also charge you interest if you do n't pay off the entire balance every month as far as i know there 's nothing that keeps a vendor from having a different price for paypal customers than cash customers but that would show up in the number displayed by paypal before you authorize the purchase so if you 're paying attention it should n't be possible to sneak it by you paypal has several modes of operation i 'm not aware of one where they hold your balance normally you either give them your credit card info or you give them information about one of your bank account(s and authorize them to do electronic funds transfer from and to that account on your behalf i 've always stuck with the credit card approach i trust paypal but i do n't trust them that far on principle if i was going to link them to an account it would be a small account i 'd create for that purpose not my main savings checking accounts hm actually i do have one account which normally floats around $ 500 it 's the one i dump accumulated pocket change into and i could use that if i ever feel a need to do so paypal does reduce the risk of credit card numbers being abused by reducing how many people you 've given the number to depending on what kinds of purchases you make that may be a security advantage it certainly does n't hurt personally i have no problem with giving my card number directly to a serious business but on ebay or sites of that sort where i 'm dealing with individuals who are complete strangers i do like the isolation that paypal provides in other words ebay is exactly the environment where i do use paypal after all that 's exactly what paypal was created for

another great bbc article   gt but he said the uk 's recovery was no longer being led by consumer     gt professor miles added so the recovery very welcome as it is has been a bit dependant on consumer   then the rest of the article has a load of from the boe who are consistent only in being wrong   finishing up with   gt professor miles said most members of the believed this because the degree of slack in the economy was being used up it was quite likely that as we go into next year wage settlements will be a bit higher and wages will start to rise at a rate that outstrips inflation   even though they were wrong on this all before thanks bbc

i 'm assuming you mean 4 6 annually over 10 15 years   if you mean total return over 10 years then this question is easy just find your local country 's 10y bond and that should likely cover it though barely if you are german so annually is not a big stretch but it does require some risk and at least a bit of work   a fire and forget good mix would include using index mutual funds or etfs some internet research and a one time meeting with a financial adviser who is paid by you not paid on commission should help you set the right balance of these index funds and be a good check on what i 'm advising if you are willing to do a tiny bit more work it 's well worth starting with a heavier weight on the riskier stocks and ex european funds more currency risk and then every 2 3 years slowly move into safer stocks and euro based funds   with that tiny amount of extra work there you can make it much more likely that you will end within your 4 6 range while taking significantly less risk overall

it 's impossibly difficult to time the market generally speaking you should buy low and sell high picking 25 as an arbitrary ceiling on your gains seems incorrect to me because sometimes you 'll want to hold a stock for longer or sell it sooner and those decisions should be based on your research or if you need the money not an arbitrary number to answer your questions if the reasons you still bought a stock in the first place are still valid then you should hold and/or buy more if something has changed and you ca n't find a reason to buy more then consider selling keep in mind you 'll pay capital gains taxes on anything you sell that is not in a tax deferred e.g. retirement account no it does not make sense to do a wash sale where you sell and buy the same stock capital gains taxes are one reason i 'm not sure why you would ever want to do this what reasons were you considering you can always sell just some of the shares see above and link regarding wash sales buying more of a stock you already own is called dollar cost averaging it 's an effective method when the reasons are right dca minimizes variance due to buying or selling a large amount of shares at an arbitrary single day price and instead spreads the cost or sale basis out over time all that said there 's nothing wrong with locking in a gain by selling all or some shares of a winner buy low sell high

assuming you 've got no significant prepayment penalty i would think about getting a longer mortgage but making payments like it was a shorter mortgage this will get the mortgage paid off in a shorter time period but if you run into financial difficulties and/or find a better use for your money you can drop back to paying the minimum necessary to retire the loan in 30 years without needing to refinance if you need to reduce your payments because you 're between jobs you do n't have a very good negotiating position   for the most part there 's nothing that says you can only make one payment per month or that it must be in the amount printed on the statement if you want to you can make payments weekly or biweekly or every 4 weeks which typically means that you 'll pay more every year if your mortgage payments are $ 1000/month that 's $ 12,000 per year if you tell yourself that 1000/month = $ 250 weekly and make yourself send a payment every week or 500 every 2 weeks you 'll end up paying 250 52 = $ 13,000 per year without particularly feeling the difference especially if you get paid on a weekly biweekly schedule instead of monthly or semi monthly also by paying more often you 're borrowing a tiny bit less money over the course of the year because the money did n't sit in your account waiting until the 1st of the month to make a payment so you save a little in interest there too   think of 30 years or 10 years as the basis for a minimum payment schedule not necessarily the length of time that you or the lender really intend to keep the loan

when using time value of money equations you need to know when the flow starts a mortgage for example has a first payment at the end of the first time period usually 1 month   for savings one can start the account with a deposit of course or start by saying i will deposit $ xxx at the end of each month   the answer really depends on the exact details of the situation in your example i 'm inclined to suggest first flow is 1 year out

most people carry a diversity of stock bond and commodities in their portfolio   the ratio and types of these investments should be based on your goals and risk tolerance   i personally choose to manage mine through mutual funds which combine the three but etfs are also becoming popular as for where you keep your portfolio it depends on what you 're investing for   if you 're investing for retirement you are definitely best to keep as much of your investment as possible in 401k or iras preferably roth iras   many advisers suggest contributing as much to your 401k as your company matches then the rest to ira and if you over contribute for the ira back to the 401k   you may choose to skip the 401k if you are not comfortable with the choices your company offers in it such as only investing in company stock if you are investing for a point closer than retirement and you still want the risk and reward potential of stock i would suggest investing in low tax mutual funds or eating the tax and investing in regular mutual funds   if you are going to take money out before retirement the penalties of a 401k or ira make it not worth doing technically a savings account is n't investing but rather a place to store money

former employee so i have a little insight they are very scared of unionization and also losing their exemption in the railway act this fedex as an airline railway company where ups is a ground shipping company what that means is that fedex has protections against unions fedex ground drivers are not employees they are contractors some of these guys are not happy and the states were changing laws to benefit the workers in some way i 'm not entirely sure how it works but fedex is smart so they are these people as independent service providers they are forcing single route drivers to sell to multi route isp owners when you have an owner that owns multiple routes they ar likely to be pro union and it also puts another barrier between the driver and fedex

smartphones really   how about a lack of work and a scarcity of disposable income   currently the us unemployment rate is at 4.2 below the mark for full employment and well below where upwards wage pressure should be forming   at the same time the participation rate is also around the 60 mark   at this point there should be so much wage pressure that an argument over minimum wage should be moot as even the corner mcd 's should be offering $ 15 an hour just to get people to notice the help wanted sign and yet it is n't happening   why because there are no jobs   but the bls says there are 6.2 million jobs available you say   yes and they 've said so since july   this is called churn and it 's the same jobs being offered over and over again to people who stay for a month and move on   the low inflation is due to one thing normal everyday people have no money to spend there is no real economic growth there is no wage pressure   all the money is locked up in financial markets making more wealth but producing nothing   but look at all the smartphones that exist today that replaced flip phones that replaced wall phones   sure everything is cheaper it has to be or else no one could afford it

the statistics are misleading the german do not make $ that is basically a $ 140k job back in 2009 some sensationalist articles said that the average worker made $ sitting in the jobs bank that is taking the total labor cost and dividing it by the number of existing employees the most obvious example of why this number is so lopsided is through health care benefits and pensions you get the illusion that the auto worker gets paid very high when labor cost per employee is very high but the labor cost actually includes the current worker 's cost as well as some past worker 's costs so it gets double counted   so yes gm went bankrupt because labor costs were $ no the auto worker did not make $ 75 per hour and yes labor costs for the german workforce is a lot higher than the us workforce but no they do n't actually get paid 2 3x more

sure for starters you can put it in a savings account do n't laugh they used to pay noticeable interest you know back in the olden days   you could buy an i bond from treasury direct they 're a government savings bond that pays a specified amount of interest currently 0 i believe plus the amount of the inflation rate something like 3.5 currently i believe you do n't get paid the money the i bond grows in value till you sell it you can open a discount brokerage account and buy 1 or more shares of stock in a company you like discount brokerages generally have a minimum of $ 500 or so but will waive that if you set the account up as an ira trade for instance an ira in case you did n't know is a type of account that 's tax free but you ca n't touch it till you turn 59 1/2 it 's meant to help you save for retirement incidentally watch out of small account fees that some brokerages might charge you generally they 're annual or monthly charges they 'd charge you to cover their costs on your account since they 're certainly not going to make it in commissions that ira at trade is no fee speaking of commissions those will be a big chunk of that $ 100 it 'll be like $ to buy that stock a pretty big bite however many of these discount brokerages also offer some mutual funds for no commission those mutual funds in turn have minimums too but once again if your account 's an ira many will waive the minimum or set it low like $ 100

cfd 's are highly speculative so they should represent a very small proportion of your asset or less if you need the 100 for food or rent then definitely not   however if you have some money spare that you could afford to will definitely need more than 100 and you are prepared to put the time and effort it to learn and manage your risks carefully then there is no reason why you should n't try it   i would advise against trading on a demo account for learning most of what you need to learn is how to stick to your plan while under emotional pressure i also would n't call it gambling but managing risk the best traders only win half of their trades so they might have a losing streak of 5 10 or 20 trades if they are trading 5 of their capital with each trade then poof they 're out their winning trades might make 10 100 times the amount risked so they know that it is more profitable to always only risk around 1 sticking to that requires discipline    this page has a pretty comprehensive introduction

i ’m going to answer this because accounting books only reflect the dollar value of inventories which means if you look at the balance sheet of mcdonalds you will not see how many bags of french fries are remaining at their storage facility you will only see the total value at cost basis   your requirement for noting the number of shares purchased is not part of the double entry accounting system   when you transfer $ 10000 from bank to broker the entries would be   the bank ’s name and the broker ’s name will not appear on the balance sheet   when you purchase 50 shares at $ 40 per share the accounting system does not care about the number of shares or the price all it cares is the $ 2000 total cost and the commission of $ 10   you have two choices either place $ 10 to an expense account or incorporate it into the total cost making it $ 2010   the entries for the second method would be now your balance sheet would reflect what happens if the price increases from $ 40 per share to $ 50 per share tomorrow do nothing your balance sheet will show the cost of $ 2010 until the shares are sold or the accounting period ends it will not show the market value of $ 2500   instead the portfolio tracker would show $ 2500 the most basic tracker is   later if you finally sell the shares at $ 50 per share with $ 10 commission again the number of shares will not be reflected anywhere in the accounting system only the total proceeds from the sale matters

from although pharmacy coverage is an optional benefit under federal medicaid law all states currently provide coverage for outpatient prescription drugs to all categorically eligible individuals and most other within their medicaid programs this is related to the medicaid drug rebate program which offsets the federal and state costs of most outpatient prescription drugs to medicaid patients approximately 600 drug manufacturers currently participate in this program all fifty states and the district of columbia cover prescription drugs under the medicaid drug rebate program i ca n't give you any specific details about patient assistance programs but links to information about various patient assistance programs and general information about medicaid 's and medicare 's prescription drug offerings it 's conceivable that you may be eligible for a patient assistance program but not medicaid for all i know the reverse may be true but it 's difficult to tell without contacting the specific company some patient assistance programs only apply to generic versions of the drug while some state medicaid programs will pay for brand names obviously this varies from state to state

while joetaxpayer gave a very insightful answer and clearly the best answer let me break it down really simple for you talk with a good to great property management company given that you will be out of state you will need one anyway   a good one is worth their cost a great one even better    they will tell you what the market will bear on renting your place and the expected costs   from there you can make an intelligent decision    have you had any experience in running rental properties   i am going to assume not and as such you should have professionals as part of your team    more than likely you will have to put money in to sustain this property as a rental   it is just how the numbers tend to work out

the article best stock fund of the decade focus from the wall street journal in 2009 describe the highest performing mutual fund in the usa between 2000 and 2009 the investor return in the fund what the shareholders actually earned was abysmal why because the fund was so volatile that investors panicked and bailed out locking in losses instead of waiting them out the reality is that almost any strategy will lead to success in investing so long as it is actually followed a strategy keeps you from making emotional or knee jerk decisions btw beware of anyone selling you a strategy by telling you that everyone in the world is a failure except for the few special people who have the privilege of knowing their secrets link removed as it 's gone dead

the question should be do you need a debit card   other than american express i have to tell my other credit card issuers to not make my cards dual debit credit using a debit card card can be summed up easily it creates a risk of fraud errors theft over draft and more while providing absolutely no benefit    it was simply a marketing scheme for card companies to reduce risk that has lost favor although they are still used   that is why banks put it on credit cards by default if they can i am talking about logical people who can control not overspending because of debit vs. credit as it is completely illogical that you would spend more based on what kind of card you have

i do n't use pre authorized automatic payment methods because there is no control and it is impossible to get it back once you have authorized a firm to withdraw funds from your account there is no realistic way to revoke that control save closing down your bank account entirely and moving to another institution i once had automatic payments set up for my apartment rent and then one month they withdrew twice on one day overdrawing my account it was very difficult to dispute the charge and get it back the bank was little help as i had authorized them to withdraw funds it did n't make any difference that they had done it twice because i had given them permission to withdraw that amount   the property management company was large and difficult to contact and at first denied any wrongdoing tl;dr version it 's more pain than it 's worth and i will never do it again

one key point that other answers have n't covered is that many credit cards have a provision where if you pay it off every month you get a grace period on the interest   interest does n't accrue at all unless you rollover a non zero balance   but if you do you pay interest on the average balance not the rolled over balance for the entire month you have to ask yourself what you are trying to accomplish with your credit history are you trying to maximize your buying power really leverage   or are you trying to make sure that you get the best terms on a moderately sized loan house mortgage car note as johnfx and already noted it 's in the banker 's best interest to maximize the profit they make off of you   of course that is not in your best interest keeping a credit card balance from month to month definitely feeds the greedy nature of the financing beast   and makes them willing to take more risks because the returns are also higher   but those returns cost you if you are planning to get sensible loans in the future that you can comfortably afford you wo n't need a maxed credit score   you wo n't get the largest loan amounts but because you are doing the sensible thing and making a large down payment the risk is also very low and you 'll find lenders willing to give you a low interest rate   because even though the reward is lower than the compulsive purchaser who pays an order of magnitude more in financing fees the return risk ratio is still very favorable to the bank do n't play the game that maximizes their return   that happens when you have a loan of maximum size high interest rate and struggle to make payments end up missing a couple and paying late fees or request forbearance which compounds the interest play to minimize risk

the lottery is not a scam   it really does what it says it does the odds are just tremendously not in your favor   mlms promise a business opportunity where there is n't one and the only real money comes from signing up new people   i 've been dragged to a number of these things   the last one was maybe ten years ago it was a acn meeting at a co worker 's house   the invitation was vague a number of other co workers were going and there was free food   i immediately knew what it was when they started the presentation   i listened as they went on about the untold riches and working for yourself and all of the usual crap   then they told us that we could ask questions   anything we wanted   well ok   thing is they do n't get many people showing up to these things who are both lawyers and accountants   like me   i started asking for financial documents tax returns verified audits the form of the contract between acn and you and a few federal regulations   that did not go over so well   i pointed out that it was all standard due diligence   i added that i would be happy to sign a non disclosure agreement before showing me the books   as you might guess they did n't have any real answers and the guy doing the presentation looked like he wanted to punch me in the face   nobody signed up   if you end up in at one of these meetings start asking questions about the books   you want to see them   you want to see tax returns   you want to see audits from cpa firms   offer to sign a non disclosure agreement   these are all very normal things in the business world   say you had a factory that makes widgets and you decide to sell the factory for $ 100,000   i 'm an interested buyer   i would ask to see your books returns and a statement from your cpa verifying these things   a non disclosure agreement is common and totally fair   that way i could verify the financials   if someone wants you to sign up for a mlm ask to see the books   you 'll shut it down almost immediately   if they get upset use the phrase due diligence and say that it is standard business procedure   because it is

the rebate amount is a non qualified distribution irs pub 969 describes how the hsa works reporting distributions on your return how you report your distributions depends on whether or not you use the distribution for qualified medical expenses defined earlier if you use a distribution from your hsa for qualified medical expenses you do not pay tax on the distribution but you have to report the distribution on form 8889 however the distribution of an excess contribution taken out after the due date including extensions of your return is subject to tax even if used for qualified medical expenses follow the instructions for the form and file it with your form 1040 or form 1040nr if you do not use a distribution from your hsa for qualified medical expenses you must pay tax on the distribution report the amount on form 8889 and file it with your form 1040 or form 1040nr if you have a taxable hsa distribution include it in the total on form 1040 or form 1040nr line 21 and enter hsa and the amount on the dotted line next to line 21 you may have to pay an additional 20 tax on your taxable distribution i looked at several plans regarding how to handle mistaken distributions example a what if i accidentally use my hsa visa debit card for a non qualified expense    to fix this problem just bring that same amount into any local branch and tell us it was a mistaken distribution we can then put the funds back into your hsa and correct the problem   example b   you ’re allowed to correct mistaken    hsa withdrawals when there is clear and convincing    evidence that amounts were distributed from an hsa    because of a mistake of fact due to reasonable cause you    can correct the mistake by repaying the withdrawal    no later than april 15 following the first year that you    knew or should have known that the withdrawal was    a mistake when a correction is made the mistaken    withdrawal does not have to be included in gross    income or be subject to the 6 percent additional tax and    the repayment does not count as an excess contribution    if an error is made by in its role as the    administrator will be responsible for    taking appropriate action check with your plan trustee on their procedure to fix the mistaken withdrawal

stock options represent an option to buy a share at a given price   what you have been offered is the option to buy the company share at a given price $ 5 starting a given date your golden handcuffs aka vesting schedule if the company 's value doubles in 1 year and the shares are liquid i.e. you can sell them then you 've just made $ 125k of profit   if the company 's value has gone to zero in 1 year then you 've lost nothing other than your hopes of getting rich as others have mentioned the mechanics of exercising the option and selling the shares can typically be accomplished without any cash involved   the broker will do both in a single transaction and use the proceeds of the sale to pay the cost of buying the shares   you should always at least cover the taxable portion of the transaction and typically the broker will withhold that tax anyways   otherwise you could find yourself in a position where you have actually lost money due to tax being owed while the shares decline in value below that tax   you do n't have to worry about that right now again as people have mentioned options will typically expire 10 years from vesting or 90 days from leaving your employment with the company   i 'm sure there are some variations on the theme   make sure you ask and all this should be part of some written contract   i 'm sure you can ask to see it if you wish   also typical is that stock option grants have to be approved by the board which is normally a technicality some general advice

i tried automation and it did n't work as well automation is great if you want to sell or buy when a stock drops or rises however automation is terrible for day trading specifically because it is impossible to automate a program to scan every news feed even then automation is only if you want to be the effect of a rise or drop in the market a stock rises or drops and you sell or buy the problem that arises is that it is nearly impossible to make money off of automating trades you need to buy the stock before it rises and sell it before it drops there is no way any program will ever be able to do that accurately

the purpose is to go public but also to generate more wealth the real money comes when market values you at a price more than your cash flow if a company brings in $ 1000 of cash flow then that is what the employees and owners have to distribute among themselves but if they are likely to increase to $ 2000 next and $ 4000 next year and they go public then the stock will do well in this case the promoters and employees with options rsus will benefit as well the increased visibility is also very useful look at google or fb they did n't need the ipo proceed when they went public they had enough cash from their business but then they would only have $ 1 10 billion a year but due to the ipo their investors and employees have a huge net worth   basically with just a small of shares in the public you can value the company at a high price valuing in the future cash flows with a discount rate etc so instead of realizing the profit over the next 15 years you get to enjoy it right away

if this matters to you a lot i agree you should leave my primary bank account raised chequing account and transaction fees i left when i was closing my account the teller asked for the reason they needed to fill out a form and i explained it was the monthly fees eventually if a bank gets enough of these they will change i want to get back those features for the same price it cost when i opened it they are in their rights to cancel features or raise prices just as you are in your rights to withdraw if they do n't give you a deal the reason why i mention this is that this approach is comical in some instances a grocery store may raise the price of carrots typically you either deal with it or change stores prices rise occasionally thus they will lose a lot of money from my savings from my understanding a bank makes a large chunk of their money from fees very little is from the floating kitty they can have because of your savings if you have an investment account with your bank not recommended or your mortgage that would matter more i 've had friends who have left banks and moved their mortgages because of the bank not giving them a better rate does the manager have any pressure into keeping the account to the point of giving away free products to keep the or they do n't really care depends i 've probably say no one data point is an anecdote it is expected in a client base of thousands that a few will leave for seemingly random reasons only if mass amounts of clients leave or complain will the manager or company care a note some banks waive monthly account or service fees if you keep a minimal account balance i have one friend who keeps x thousand in his bank account to save the account fee he budgets a month ahead of time and savings account rates are 0 so this costs him nothing

a simplistic answer would be that it 's a multiplier on how much money per paycheck to subtract from your tax withholding taxes per paycheck then at the end of the year you will have paid taxes on your income minus the amount of your withholding allowances if you get a decent roughly 3 or more of your gross annual salary refund you are letting the government withhold too much and should increase your allowances if you have to pay a decent amount of taxes at the end of the year then the amount withheld is not high enough and should decrease your allowances   i definitely recommend using the calculator that stephen mentions but i think it 's just as easy to adjust it up or down by 1 or 2 each year based on whether you got a large refund no refund or paid taxes if you are disciplined with your money many experts advise to increase withholding allowances save the extra in a safe short term interest account so that you earn money on your money and not the government

to add to jason 's answer a further mechanism is that of monopoly rents which you mention in your question   movie theatres are often in shopping complexes which themselves may offer a particular cinema exclusivity or physically remote from each other making price comparison more difficult   different companies may not offer the same movies similar to the way phone companies offer difficult to compare contract pricing once you 've paid for your movie ticket if you 're suddenly or the theatre is the only place selling snacks   many theatres including film theatres discourage or refuse patrons from consuming products purchased elsewhere on site a sense of capture is reinforced with ticket collection at the entrance or some form of barrier inside vs outside the a theatre can thus capture their patrons and then leverage that access in order to discriminate amongst the higher paying consumers mentioned by jason

well it is a negative point of view but nobody in the history of money has ever loaned money because they like you   i suppose you could paint it as an honest point of view all money lending is for profit   if you have a high score you are very likely to repay your loan because you are lower risk   we always hear lower risk but the risk is that they wo n't make money off of you i think that just like we buy previously owned vehicles cars instead of used cars and we banks call them service fees instead of junk fees our credit score discusses our credit worthiness instead of profitability but none of that means you ca n't benefit from it   it is n't a fear tactic it is a way to judge each other   you probably pay interest and fees to keep it high but that is price of lending i think the questioner has a negative view of credit which i suppose is fine and is their right i will defend their right to an opinion but the way we do and judge credit is neither evil or benevolent i could certainly agree that more transparency would be good but only for honest folks   if the credit bureaus made it public how they judged us there would be a new industry for people who want to game the system update since it always will cost to use credit and using credit is the only way to prove your a low credit risk it will therefore always cost money to raise your credit score however the return on investment is in this question   a person with no credit was able to get a loan but at serious out of pocket cost   later after establishing credit at a price of real money he was able to secure a nearly identical loan for considerably less cost in terms of interest paid because he had proven himself worthy   when i say proven i mean paid interest there is nothing wrong with questioning the system change only occurs when people question the status quo   and for sure our current system is not perfect but like many employed systems while it is terrible but there is nothing better

given those assumptions which i happen to think are reasonable it seems to me the obvious place is to buy non australian assets such as the vanguard total us share market and veu world ex us etfs and perhaps also some international fixed interest etfs    i think keeping a certain amount of cash would be prudent anyhow if you felt very sure this was going to happen you could borrow in australia and buy foreign assets expecting that as the aud falls the relative cost of the borrowing will also fall   this is obviously fairly risky not least because australian interest rates are already high and may go much higher and while the rates go up the exchange rate will also likely go up as i mentioned on another answer i think buying gold or other commodity instruments is a poor choice here because the australian economy and the aud is so tied to those prices already

you 'd have to consult a lawyer in the state that the transaction took place to get a definitive answer   and also provide the details of the contract or settlement agreement that said if you clearly presented the check as payment verbally or otherwise and they accepted and cashed the check and it cleared you should have good legal standing to force them to finalize the payment    while they had every right to refuse the payment and also every right to place a hold on the credit until the transaction cleared their bank they do n't have the right to simply claim the payment as a gift just because it came in a different form than they specified in the contract   obviously this is a lesson learned on reading the fine print though   and to be frank it sounds like someone wants to make life difficult for you for whatever reason and if that is the case i would refer back to my initial comment about contacting a lawyer in that state

first what 's your risk tolerance how long is your investment going to last if it 's a short term investment a few years and you expect to break even or better then your risk tolerance is low you should not invest much money in stocks even index funds and defensive stocks if however you 're looking for a long term investment which you will put money into continually over the next 30 years the amount of stock you purchase at any given time is pretty small so the money you might lose by timing the market wrong will also be rather small also you probably do a remarkably poor job of knowing when to buy stocks if you actually knew how to time the market to materially improve your risk adjusted returns you 've missed your calling you should be making six figures or more on wall street

i use 10-k and to understand to read the disclosed risk factors related to a business sometimes they are very comical but when you see that risk factor you can understand how it will effect the company for example one company 's risk factor stated that if elizabeth warren becomes head of the consumer financial protection bureau we will have a hard time so we are expanding in mexico and taking our politically unfavorable lending practices there i like seeing how many authorized shares there are or if there are plans to issue more an example was where i heard from former employees of a company how gullible the other employees at that company were and how they all thought they were going to get rich or were being told so by upper management poor questionable misleading management is one of my favorite things to look for in a company so i started digging into their sec filings and saw that they were going to do a reverse split which would make the share prices trade higher while experiencing no change in market cap but then digging further i saw that they were only changing the already issued shares but keeping the authorized shares at the much larger amount of shares and that they planned to do financing by issuing more of the authorized shares i that this would mean the share prices would drop by after the reverse split and you mean to tell me that nobody realizes this employees or the broad market i was almost tempted to stand outside their office and ask employees if i could borrow their shares to short because there was n't enough liquidity on the stock market this was almost the perfect short but it was n't liquid or have any options so not perfect after all it traded from $ 20 after the reverse split to $ i like understanding how much debt a company is in and the structure of that debt like if a loan shark has large payments coming up soon this is generally what i use those particular forms for but they contain a lot of information a lot of companies are able to act they way they do because people do not read

since as you say an llc is a pass through entity you will be making income in the u.s. when you sell to u.s. customers   and so you will need to file the appropriate personal tax forms in the us   as well as potentially in one or more states   the us government does not register llcs   the various states do   so you 'll be dealing with oregon wisconsin wyoming one of those for the llc registration   you will also need to have a registered agent in the state   that is a big deal since the entire point of forming an llc is to add a liability shield   you would lose the liability shield by not maintaining the business formalities    generally nations aim to tax income made in their nation and many decline to tax income that you 've already paid taxes on in another nation   a key exception if money is taxed by the u.s. it may also be taxed by one of the states   two states wo n't tax the same dollar registering an llc in one state does not mean you 'll pay state taxes there   generally states tax income made in their state   it 's common to have a wyoming llc that never pays a penny of tax in wyoming   officially an llc doing business in a state it did not form in must register in that state as a foreign llc even though it 's still in the usa   the fee is usually the same as for a domestic llc   doing business means something more than incidental sales it means having a presence specifically in the state somehow   it gets complicated quick   if you are thinking of working in someone 's app ecosystem like the apple store google play steam etc obviously they want their developers coding not wrestling with legalities so some of them make a priority out of clearing and simplifying legal for you   find out what they do for you

the most important number on your credit card statement is not your available credit the number you should be focusing on is your account balance   before the refund you had a balance of $ 0 that means that you did not owe the bank anything   you then got a $ 400 refund this put your account balance at + $ 400 sometimes shown on your statement as $ 400 cr   this means that you have a credit of $ 400 or the bank owes you $ 400   if you now spend $ 400 at a store your balance will go back to $ 0

i 'd recommend you use an online tax calculator to see the effect it will have to your comment with @littleadv there 's fmv agreed but there 's also a rate below that one that 's a bit lower than fmv but it 's a discount for a tenant who will handle certain things on their own i had an arm 's length tenant who was below fmv i literally never met him but our agreement through a realtor was that for any repairs i was not required to arrange or meet fmv is not a fixed number but a bit of a range   if this is your first rental you need to be aware of the requirement to take depreciation simply put you separate your cost into land and house the house value gets depreciated by i.e. you divide the value by 27.5 and that 's taken as depreciation each year you may break even on cash flow the rent paying the mortgage property tax etc but the depreciation might still produce a loss this is n't optional it flows to your tax return and is limited to $ 25k yr further if your adjusted gross income   is over $ 100 k the allowed loss is phased out over the next $ 50 k of income i.e. each $ 1000 of agi reduces the allowed loss by $ 500 the losses you ca n't take are carried forward until you use them to offset profit each year or sell the property   if you offer numbers you 'll get a more detailed answer but this is the general overview in general if you are paying tax you are doing well running a profit even after depreciation

just to clarify things the net working capital is the funds the capital that will finance the everyday the short term operations of a company like buying raw materials paying wages so net working capital does n't have a negative impact and you should not see the liabilities as beneficial per se it 's rather the fact that with smaller capital to finance the short term operations the company is able to make this ebit you can see it as the efficiency of the company the smaller the net working capital the more efficient the company is given the ebit i hope you find it helpful it 's my first here edit why do you say the net working capital has a negative impact

quote from the article the banks achieved this gigantic rip off by secretly colluding to rig the public bids on municipal bonds a business worth $ 3.7 trillion   please explain to me how you read that and why you think it is correct does it read as the banks made 3.7 t are the values of the banks 3.7 t did they steal 3.7 t did the bonds return 3.7 t or is it just that the total value of the bonds over many many more years than this entire fraud took place total to 3.7 including the value that really was owned by bond holders and had nothing to do with the profits or theft   hint 1 3.7 trillion is not the worth of any of those businesses not even the sum of all their market caps probably reaches that value hint 2 matt taibbi is smart enough to know this yet writes it that way anyways because sloppy thinkers will buy his crap find that the value of an entire class of assets is 3.7 t even though it is not the value of any business it 's like saying citibank is worth the sum of all the deposits it holds when that is nonsense

lets imagine two scenarios 1 you make 40 of total income yearly contributions to a savings account that earns 1 interest for 10 years in this scenario you put in and earned in interest for a total of 2 you make the same yearly contribution to an index fund that earns 7 on average for 10 years in this scenario you put in the same but earned in interest for a total of the main advantage is option 1 has more liquidity you can get the money out faster option 2 requires time to divest any stocks bonds so you need enough savings to get you through that period imagine another two scenarios where you stop earning income you stop working and have only your principal amount in a 1 savings account if you withdraw yearly for your current cost of living you will run through your savings in 7 years you stop working and have only 20k 2 years of savings in savings that earns 1 with in stocks that earns 7 if you withdraw your cost of living currently at you will run through your investments in 15 years and your savings in 2 years for a total of 17 years the two years of income in savings is extremely generous for how long it starts the process   in summary invest your money it was n't specified what currency we are talking about but you can easily find access to an investment company no matter where you are in the world keep a small amount for a rainy day

i agree they are able to reduce prices in store to thin margins and rely on on a large amount of sales my point is that the cost increase on product from wages is proportionally smaller than the increase in pay the worker is taking home so yes a big mac would cost about 17 cents more at a minimum wage of $ 15 an hour to maintain the same margins but the workers wage is doubled

an actual discussion question i just wanna push fluff to get traffic on my blog the millenials did it   in all seriousness the housing market is all about supply and demand namely there are nt many housing being built across the us right now so that s driving prices up cheap loans also helped diminish the supply because those who could bought up a lot of rental properties since 08 so these things have caused home prices to steadily climb especially in desirable places to live such as large college towns boston san fran etc   but keeping demand in check are a few too rates are now going up and few millenials can afford starter homes due to student debt and relatively lower income in their late 20s than their parents plus they re having less kids at the moment so that s all pushing demand down especially in rural areas   the wild card imo will be the impending recession and the huge sell off in 10 15 years when all the boomers start hitting their late 70s and early 80s so there s your major volatility

a bona fide company never needs your credit card details certainly not your on back of card to issue a refund   on an older charge they might have to work with their merchant provider   but they should be able to do it within the credit card handling system and in fact are required to   asking for details via email does n't pass the sniff test either   to get a credit card merchant account a company needs to go through a security assessment process called pci security gets into you pretty good   of course they could be using one of the dumbed down services like square but those services make refunds ridiculously easy    how did you come to be corresponding on this email address   did they initially contact you   did you find it on a third party website   some of those are fraudulent and many others like yelp it 's very easy to insert false contact information for a business consumer forums even moreso   you might take another swing at finding a proper contact for the company   stop asking for a cheque   that also the credit card system   and obviously a scammer wo n't send a check at least not one you 'd want   if all else fails call your bank and tell them you want to do a chargeback on that transaction   this is where the bank to reverse the charge   it 's rather straightforward especially if the merchant has agreed in principle to a refund but requires some paperwork or e paperwork    do n't chargeback lightly   do n't use it casually or out of laziness or unwillingness to speak with the merchant e.g. to cancel an order   the bank charges the merchant a $ 20 or larger investigation fee separate from the refund   each chargeback is also a strike too many strikes and the merchant is barred from taking credit cards it 's serious business    as a merchant i would never send a cheque to an angry customer   because if i did they 'd cash the cheque and still do a chargeback so then i 'd be out the money twice plus the investigation fee to boot

i think it 's a silly statement if you are prepared from the start that you might lose it then you should n't invest you invest to earn not to lose most often losses are a result of fear   remember you only lose when you sell lower than you bought for   so if you have the patience you will probably regain i ask my clients many times how much do they want to earn and they all say as much as possible last time i checked that 's not an objective and therefore a strategy ca n't be built for that   if there is   a strategy then exiting a stock is easy   without a strategy you never know when to exit and then you are exposed to   losses i 've successfully traded for many years with large amounts of money i made money in the fc and in the bubble both times it was n't because i was prepared to lose but because i had an entry and exit strategy if you have both the idea of investing what u are prepared to lose has little value

i think the issue here is you 're starting with a criteria that does n't actually exist in reality   a very small amount of research will uncover a plethora of options for savings accounts that pay far more interest than your basic checking account and do n't require you to spend on the balance to earn the interest    the point of saving is to have a pot of money that you can dip in to when you need it or when you 're ready to spend it for it 's intended purpose   that pot of money is not supposed to experience a lot of transactions   it should n't be commingled with funds that come and go on a daily basis   it does n't make sense to have checks or a debit card attached to your savings account because you should n't need access to that money that way not to mention that those two things open the door to fraud on the money that 's supposed to be there for you when you need it could you put your savings funds in to a checking account sure   if we lived in a world where savings accounts that do n't force you to jump through hoops to avoid fees did n't pay 10x more interest than interest bearing checking accounts that have similar ease of administration more people may choose to house savings funds in checking accounts but that 's not the world we live in    thanks to the back and forth in the comments below i 'm now more certain of my position that if you want a high yielding checking account you 'll have pay fees or initiate a certain number of debit card transactions or both   no one wants fees and you should n't be spending on your savings in order to earn interest on the balance it is very easy to juice your savings account to the best rates available

i 'm not sure what the situation is in canada but in the us the irs does not look kindly on people donations of used goods the rule is obviously abused quite a bit but that does n't mean it 's legal different used books have different values usually depending on supply and demand and there are online databases that make it easy to check the value of a book using a barcode scanner if you took a book to a used bookstore and they did n't want to buy it that 's because supply greatly exceeds demand it might be last year 's for example in this situation donating the book to charity and claiming that the book is worth more than it 's actually worth is really nothing more than cheating on your taxes you may or may not get caught but it 's certainly not the intent of any tax code to give people a break on their taxes for donating worthless books to a charity which will inevitably just have to recycle or shred them

not that i everyone 's assumption but i wanted to see the math so i did some spreadsheet hacking i assumed a monthly payments for 30 years which left us with total payments of   i then assumed we 'd pay an extra $ 200/month in one of two scenarios   scenario 1 we just paid that $ 200 directly to the lender   in scenario 2 we set the extra $ 200 aside every month until we were able to pay off the $ 10k at 7   i assumed that the minimum payments were allocated proportionately and the overpayments were allocated evenly   that meant we paid off loan 5 at about month 77 loan 4 in month 88 loan 3 in month 120 loan 2 in month 165 and loan 1 in month 170 getting over to scenario 2 where we pay $ to lender and save $ 200 separately   in month 48 we 've saved $ relative to the principle remaining in loan 3 of $   we pay that off and we 're left with loan with a combined principle of about $   at this point we are now going to make payments of instead of saving towards principle   now our weighted average interest rate is instead of   we can calculate the number of payments left given a principle of interest of 6.8 and payment of to be months left for a total of months conclusion scenario 1 pays off the debt 3 months sooner with the same monthly expenditure as scenario 2

the country from which you purchase stock can not charge you tax on either income or capital gains taxation is based on residency so even when you purchase foreign stock its the tax laws of malaysia as your country of residence that matter at the time of writing malaysia does not levy any capital gains tax and there is no income tax charged on dividends so you wo n't have to declare or pay any tax on your stocks regardless of where you buy them from the only exception to this is dividend withholding tax which is a special tax taken by the government of the country you bought the stock from before it is paid to your account you do not need to declare this tax as it his already been taken by the time you receive your dividend the us withholding tax rate on dividends is 30 although this can be reduced to 15 if there as a tax treaty in place between the us and your country of residence malaysia does have a double taxation agreement with the us see here but it is flagged as a limited agreement   you 'd need to find the full text of the agreement to see whether a reduced rate of dividend withholding tax would be available in the malaysia us treaty see my other answer for more details on withholding taxes and how to partially reclaim under a double tax treaty what is the dividend tax rate for uk stock note although the taxation rules of both countries are similar i am a resident of singapore not malaysia so i ca n't speak from first hand experience but current malaysia tax rates are easy to find online the rest of this information is common to any non us uk resident investor as long as you 're not a us person

besides the ex mil not coming up with the monthly payments and the ex wife destroying the car there are other problems   a lease generally limits you you a specific number of miles over the term of the lease you may be limited to 1,000 miles a month for a total of 36,000 over the 3 year time of the lease your ex wife could drive all 36 k miles in her 24 months which means every mile your son drives will be at a penalty rate driving 1000 mile a month at 15 cents a mile is $ 150 a month in penalties plus the original monthly cost of the lease   you need to understand if the lease contract will allow this sort of transaction you will need to name the principal drivers they will require specific levels of insurance if you do n't name your ex wife on the policy and she is in an accident the damages might not be covered the leasing company could also pursue you for fraud

this article is hilariously wrong   they studied companies that are already structured in such a way that they pay far less than rates   the vast majority of companies do not have sprawling international operations and can not benefit from these types of structures thus they are paying tax rates far closer to rates   the study is looking at the wrong companies and drawing a false conclusion from them   it ’s simple math   reducing tax rates makes companies more profitable providing more capital for expand and grow   growth requires adding employees   only a moron would argue that companies are better off and will grow faster when more of their profits are taken from them via taxation

it 's easiest to get your payment from the pmt function in excel or google sheets   so a $ 100,000 30 year mortgage at 3 looks like this the basic calculation is pretty simple   you take the annual interest rate say 3 divided by 12 times the existing principal balance the idea is that borrowers would like to have a predictable payment   the earlier payments are proportionally more interest than principal than later payments are but that 's because there is much more principal outstanding on month 1 than on month 200

yes it should come out tax free however you should have reported it   to the irs at the time currently it is done on form 8606 if you have n't done it the irs may disagree with you on that and require taxes if you have proper documentation of the contribution then when you withdraw from your ira you use that same form 8606 to calculate the non taxable portion note that you can not just take $ 2 k out of the 1099-r the non taxable portion will be prorated through all of your ira withdrawals also keep in mind that only the actual after tax portion will be tax free the gains will be taxable i.e. if you deposited $ 2 k after tax and nothing else and they have now grown to $ 100 k you will only have 2 of your distribution tax free k distributed amount

comparing retirement savings to ordinary investment is not an apples to apples comparison retirement savings are savings for retirement if you want to invest in things now and live off of or reinvest those earnings then retirement accounts are not the right vehicle    that said here are some benefits of the main types of retirement accounts benefits of a 401(k benefits of a ira benefits of a roth 401(k benefits of a roth ira the benefits above are not exhaustive there are other benefits such as using a roth ira for higher ed expenses etc but those are the highlights if you have a plan for how you hope to use the money now rather than later does it make sense to hold onto it if your plan is meant to provide income at retirement and earns returns higher than the returns plus matches and tax benefits you get from retirement accounts then yes it may make more sense but those benefits are generally very hard to beat   plus having the money locked away in an account that is painful to tap can be a good thing you 're less tempted to use that money for foolish decisions which everyone makes at some point

update here is a message the seller just sent me does this make sense   i spoke with my bank again and they explained it a little better for me i guess how it works is they will print out something for you that is called an affidavit in lieu of title that states they are no longer the holder and to release it to you you then take that to the dol and they get it put in your name he says that 's how they do it all the time when we get to the bank the teller just verifies the check and i deposit it and they release the funds to pay off the account and that 's when you would get the paperwork you would be there for the whole process so nothing is sketchy sorry it 's such a pain i did n't understand how that worked we 've never sold a car with a loan on it before

i might be missing something but i always understood that leasing is about managing cash flow in a business you have a fixed monthly out going as opposed to an up front payment my accountant here in germany recommended pay cash take a loan often the manufactures offer good rates or lease in that order the leasing company has to raise the cash from somewhere and they do n't want to make a loss on the deal they will probably know better than i how to manage that and will therefore be calculating in the projected resale value at the end of the leasing period i ca n't see how an electric car would make any difference here these people are probably better informed about the resale value of any type of car than i am my feeling is to buy using a loan from the manufacturer the rates are often good and i have also got good deals on insurance as a part of that package here in germany the sales tax vat can be immediately claimed back in full when the loan deal is signed

it 's a problem from hell because all solutions have drawbacks unintended consequences and because they are all pretty complex to implement in practice   breaking up the big banks so that no bank is enough to bring down the economy with it is the strongest move but is riddled with problems when you start looking at it practically how do you determine the maximum size a bank should have should it be based on assets systemic importance i.e. interconnectedness with other banks how do you enforce it banks will find ways to offload assets etc into special purpose corporations to get around the laws somehow how do you compensate for the fact that size does help financial efficiency in some ways   imposing higher capital requirements is the next solution but that too is not so easy to implement with full success in practice what should be classified as a low risk asset how much capital do you require against a cdo vs a mexican government bond how often do you need to revise these standards at what point does the cost of higher capital requirements start to strangle lending and financial flows   the weaker maneuvers are things like constant government imposed stress tests orderly resolution mechanisms higher standards for internal risk management practices etc but those may not be adequate and also have their implementation problems
