sales taxes are charged at the point of purchase while a vat is assessed during the production process of the item in the end the amount paid by the consumer is the same but with the vat the tax was collected from the manufacturer instead of the consumer one of the big arguments for vat is that it prevents lost revenue due to things like smuggling if sales tax increases past 10 smuggling spikes so the vat is a good mechanism if you 're looking to implement large taxes on goods it also keeps the tax burden away from and other tiers of the production process that do n't change the intrinsic value of the item

for instance and to give a comparison to the us in austria almost everybody gets a credit card without a credit history e.g. a young person with a bad credit history with a good credit history   the credit history is in the usa much more important than in austria in future the way to assess a credit history will change due to analysis of social networks for instance this can be considered in addition to traditional scoring procedures is your credit history score like a criminal record nope i mean is it always with you   not really cause a criminal record will be retained on a central storage to state it abstract and a credit history can be calculated by private companies also are there other ways to get credit cards besides with a bank that depends on the country in austria yes

what effort did you exactly put into this lawsuit   the lawyers spent years working and millions of their own money pursuing a massive case on behalf of the general public   class actions are insanely complicated and fee like this ought to put large companies like ticketmaster on alert to ensure their policies are legal and fair   why does it bother you that people are paid for the work they do   maybe you 'd rather companies include small fees and charges in their transactions   by the time you realize you 'd been screwed out of $ 5 $ 10 $ 50 it would be gone   you could go to court and probably get it back but that requires time and probably cost you more than it would be worth   that is exactly why these types of cases are as class actions the individual wrong is too small to pursue but grouped together make a big impact

first you are not exactly giving the brokerage $ 2000 that money is the margin requirement to protect them in the case the stock price rises if you short 200 shares as in your example and they are holding $ 6000 from you then they are protected in the event of the stock price increasing to $ 30/share sometime before it gets there the brokerage will require you to deposit more money or they will cover your position by repurchasing the shares for your account the way you make money on the short sale is if the stock price declines it is a buy low sell high idea but in reverse if you believe that prices are going to drop then you could sell now when it is high and buy back later when it is lower in your example you are selling 200 shares at $ 20 and later buying those at $ 19 thus your profit is $ 200 not counting any interest or fees you have paid it 's a bit confusing because you are selling something you 'll buy in the future selling short is usually considered quite risky as your gain is limited to the amount that you sold at initially if i sell at $ 20/share the most i can make is if the stock declines to $ 0   your potential to lose is unlimited in theory there is no limit to how high the stock could go in theory so i could end up buying it back at an infinitely high price neither of these extremes are likely but they do show the limits of your potential gain and loss   i used $ 20/share for simplicity assuming you are shorting with a market order vs a limit order if you are shorting it would be better for you to sell at 20 instead of 19 anyway if someone says i would like to give you $ 20 for that item you are selling you are n't likely to tell them no i 'd really only like $ 19 for it

in addition to the excellent answers here i might suggest a reason for investing in leveraged funds and the original purpose for their existence   lets say you run a mutual fund that is supposed to track the performance of the s&p 500    if you have cash inflows and outflows from your fund due to people investing and selling shares of your fund you may have periods where not all funds are invested appropriately because some of the funds are in cash   lets say 98 of your funds are invested in the securities that reflect the stocks in the s&p 500   you will will miss matching the s&p 500 because you have 2 not invested in some money market account    if you take 1/3 of the cash balance and invest in a triple leveraged fund or take 1/2 of the funds and invest in a double leveraged fund you will more accurately track the index to which your fund is supposed to track   i am not sure what percentage mutual fund owners keep in cash but this is one use that i know these etfs are used for the difference over time that compounding effects have on leveraged funds is called beta slippage there are many fine articles explaining it at you can find one located at this link

gt without welfare to keep it alive tesla would've gone under they had a few near death experiences   the near death experience was saved by mercedes not the government   any other prior near death experiences were saved by private financing rounds from various vc firms and musk himself   the government loan accelerated release and production ramp of the model s it did not save the company   by the way nissan took a loan almost 10x the size of tesla 's i believe ford took almost as much as well   i do not blame either nor do i blame the government because the point of these loans is to improve advanced to get us off of gasoline which is a plague on the world and thus these were a fantastic way to spend a small amount of our resources to make a big result and produce a profit for the country at the same time   gt;on top of that if you 're wealthy enough to buy a model s in california you qualify for nearly $ 10,000 in state and federal subsidies the government is all up in there making it happen   the model s has routinely destroyed every competitor in just about every way has won top marks in nearly every review and just about every award it 's eligible for has received the best customer satisfaction numbers recorded and has the competition despite being new and constrained in many ways and even blocked from selling in multiple states   and is selling at a price point where $ 10,000 is nice but hardly breaks the bank especially considering the amount of people who buy the upgraded battery pack which costs them $ 10,000 even though they do n't need it   so you really think a car which is so much better than anything else anywhere near its price point is going to sell solely because of the tax credit   if so i suspect you have n't driven one because if you had you would know that it sells because of the driving experience not the tax credit   rich people are n't sitting down with their friends accountants to tell them to buy one they 're giving their friends test drives and blowing their freaking minds   further the oil industry has accepted subsidies for over 100 years as have many other automakers and as referenced before there are some states where the government blocks tesla from selling cars   so i suppose the is all up in there making it happen for everyone else as well are n't they

a cfd broker will let you open a trade on margin as long as your account balance is more than the margin required on all your open trades if the required margin increases within a certain percentage of your account balance you will get a margin call if you then do n't deposit more funds or close losing trades out the broker will close all your trades note your account balance is the remaining funds you have left to open new trades with i always use stop loss orders with all my open trades and because of this my broker reduces the amount of margin required on each trade this allows me to have more open trades at the one time without increasing my funds effects of a losing trade on margin say i have an account balance of $ 2,000 and open a long trade in a share cfd of 1,000 cfds with a share price of $ 10 and margin of 10 the face value of the shares would be $ 10,000 but my initial margin would be $ 1,000 10 of $ 10,000   if i do n't place a stop loss and the price falls to $ 9 i would have lost $ 1,000 and my remaining margin would now be $ 900 10 of $ 9,000 so i would have $ 100 balance remaining in my account i would probably receive a margin call to deposit more funds in or close out my trade if i do n't respond the broker will close out my position before my balance gets to $ 0 if instead i placed a stop loss at say $ 9.50 my initial margin might be reduced to $ 500 as the price drops to $ i would have lost $ 400 and my remaining margin would now only be $ 100 with my account balance at $ 1,500 when the price drops to $ 9.50 i will get stopped out my trade will be closed and i would have lost $ 500 with my account balance still at $ 1,500 effects of a winning trade on margin say i have the same account balance as before and open the same trade but this time the price moves up if i do n't place a stop loss and the price goes up to $ 11 i would have made a $ 1,000 profit and my remaining margin will now be $ 1,100 10 of $ 11,000 so my account balance would now be $ 2,000 + $ 1,000 $ 1,100 = $ 1,900 if i had placed a stop loss at say $ 9.50 again and the price moves up to $ 10.50 i would have made a profit of $ 500 and my margin would now be $ 1,000 my account balance would be $ 2,000 + $ 500 $ 1,000 = $ 1,500 however if after the price went up to $ 10.50 i also moved my stop loss up to $ 10 then i would have $ 500 profit and only $ 500 margin so my balance in this case would be $ 2,000 + $ 500 $ 500 = $ 2,000 so by using stop losses as part of your risk management you can reduce the margin used from your balance which will allow you to open more trades without any extra funds deposited into your account

in my opinion every person regardless of his or her situation should be keeping track of their personal finances   in addition i believe that everyone regardless of their situation should have some sort of budget spending plan for many people it is tempting to ignore the details of their finances and not worry about it   after all the bank knows how much money i have right   i get a statement from them each month that shows what i have spent and i can always go to the bank 's website and find out how much money i have right   unfortunately this type of thinking can lead to several different problems overspending   in olden days it was difficult to spend more money than you had   most purchases were made in cash so if your wallet had cash in it you could spend it and when your wallet was empty you were required to stop spending   in this age of credit and electronic transactions this is no longer the case   it is extremely easy to spend money that you do n't yet have and find yourself in debt   debt of course leads to interest charges and future burdens for the future   without a plan it is difficult to know if you have saved up enough for large future expenses   will you have enough money to pay the water bill that only shows up once every three months or the property tax bill that only shows up once a year   will you have enough money to pay to fix your car when it breaks   will you have enough money to replace your car when it is time   how about helping out your kids with college tuition or funding your retirement   without a plan all of these are very difficult to manage without proper accounting    anxiety   not having a clear picture of your finances can lead to anxiety   this can happen whether or not you are actually overspending and whether or not you have enough saved up to cover future expenses because you simply do n't know if you have adequately covered your situation or not   making a plan and doing the accounting necessary to ensure you are following your plan can take the worry out of your finances fear of spending   there was an interesting question from a user last year who was not at all in trouble with his finances yet was always afraid to spend any money because he did n't have a budget spending plan in place   if you spend money on a vacation are you putting your property tax bill in jeopardy   with a good budget in place you can know for sure whether or not you will have enough money to pay your future expenses and can spend on something else today this can all be done with or without the aid of software but like many things a computer makes the job easier   a good personal finance program will do two things keeps track of your spending and balances apart from your bank   the bank can only show you things that have cleared the bank   if you set up future payments outside of the bank or you write a check that has not been cashed yet or you spend money on a credit card and have not paid the bill yet these will not be reflected in your bank balance online   however if you manually enter these things into your own personal finance program you can see how much money you actually have available to spend lets you plan for future spending   the spending plan or budget lets you assign a job to every dollar that you own   by doing this you wo n't spend rent money at the bar and you wo n't spend the car insurance money on a vacation i 've written before about the details on how some of these software packages work   to answer your question about double entry accounting some software packages do use true double entry accounting gnucash ledger and some do not ynab everydollar mvelopes   in my opinion double entry accounting is an unnecessary complication for personal finances   if you do n't already know what double entry accounting is stick with one of the simpler solutions

your title question who could afford a higher premium who could n't afford a higher monthly payment contrasts premium with monthly payment but those are the same thing   in the body of your question you list monthly payment and deductible which is entirely different the deductible is paid only if you need that much medical care in any one year   most years a person in good health pays little because of the deductible   thus the higher deductible options offer catastrophic health insurance without giving much in the way of reimbursement for regular medical expenses note the original question has been edited since

things are generally fine   a credit balance is not a horrible thing    the argument against maintaining a credit balance is that you are essentially loaning the credit card issuer money at 0 interest   you probably have alternative investments that would pay better interest so it 's usually better to park your money there   all that said it 's unlikely that the interest on whatever balance you have is enough to be more than pennies    the way that a credit card works you run up a balance in one period   then there is a grace period   if you do n't pay off the balance during the grace period they start charging you interest   you also may have a minimum payment to make   if you do n't make that payment they 'll charge you a late fee    the typical period to rack up charges is from the first to the last day of a month   the typical grace period is through the 20th or 25th of the next month   your card may be different   so check the documentation user agreement for your card if you want the real data    it sounds like you paid off some purchases while you were still in the period where you rack up charges   while those purchases were posted to the account they may not be counted in the balance calculation   if your credit balance exactly matches the payment you made that 's probably what happened   it 's also possible that you overpaid the balance   if your credit balance is just a small amount that 's probably what happened    if you really want to be sure you should call the credit card issuer and ask them   at best we can tell you how it normally works   since this is your first month you could just wait for your first bill and respond to that   so long as you pay off the entire balance shown there by the deadline everything should be fine    do n't wait until the last day to pay   it 's usually best to pay a week or so early so as to leave time for the mail to deliver the check and for them to process it   you can wait longer for an online payment but a few business days early to give you a chance to handle potential problems is still good

are you sure the question even makes sense in the present day world economy it 's unlikely that someone young who just started working has the means to put away any significant amount of money as savings and attempting to do so might actually preclude making the financial choices that actually lead to stability things like purchasing the right types and amounts of insurance buying outright rather than using credit to compensate for the fact that you committed to keep some portion of your income as savings spending money in ways that enrich your experience and expand your professional opportunities etc there 's also the ethical question of how viable sustainable saving is the mechanism by which saving ensures financial stability is by everyone hoarding enough resources to deal with some level of worst case scenario that might happen in their future this worked for past generations in the us because we had massive amounts relative to the population of stolen natural resources infrastructure built on enslaved labor etc it does n't scale with modern changes the world is undergoing and it inherently only works for some people when it 's not working for others from my perspective much more valuable financial skills for the next generation are

stock has value to the buyer even if it does not currently pay dividends since it is part ownership of the company and the company 's assets the owners of which you are now a part hire managers to make a dividend policy decision   if the company can reinvest the profits into a project that would earn more than the minimum acceptable rate of return then they should do so if the company has no internal investment opportunities at or above this desired rate then the company has an obligation to declare a dividend   paying out a dividend returns this portion of profit to the owners who can then invest their money elsewhere and earn more for example the stock market currently has say a 5 rate of return company a has a $ 1 m profit and can invest it in a project with an expected 10 rate of return so they should do so company b has a $ 1 m profit but their best internal project only has an expected 2 rate of return   it is in the owners best interest to receive their portion of their company 's profit as a dividend and re invest it in other stocks others have pointed out the tax portion of dividend policy so i skipped that

i would say people are generally talking about the prime lending rate i have heard the prime lending rate defined as the rate that banks charge each other when they borrow money overnight but it often defined as the rate at which banks lend their most creditworthy customers that definition comes with the caveat that it is not always held to strictly either definition has the same idea it 's the lowest rate at which anyone could currently borrow money the rate for many types of lending is based upon the prime rate a variable rate loan might have an interest rate of prime + x the prime rate is in turn based upon the federal funds rate which is the rate that the fed sets manually when the news breaks that the fed is raising interest rates by a quarter of a point   or similar it is the federal funds rate that they control lending institutions then fall in line and adjust the rates at which they lend money so to summarize when people refer to high or low or rising interest rates they are conceptually referring to the prime lending rate when people talk about the fed raising lowering interest rates in the u.s. they are referring specifically to the federal funds rate which ultimately sets other lending rates

the only way you will incur underpayment penalties is if you withhold less than 90 of the current year 's tax liability or 100 of last years tax liability whichever is smaller   so as long as your total tax liability last year not what you paid at filing but what you paid for the whole year was more than $ you should not have any penalty what you pay or get back when you file will be your total tax liability less what was withheld for example you had $ withheld from your pay for taxes   if after deduction and other factors your tax liability is $ you will owe $ 111 when you file   on the other hand if your tax liability is only $ 1,000 you 'll get a refund of $ when you file since you 've had more withheld that what you owe since your income was only for part of the year and tax tables assume that you make that much for the whole year i would suspect that you over withheld during your internship which would offset the lack of withholding on the other $ 6,000 in income

if you 're willing to do a little more work and bookkeeping than just putting money into the 401(k i would recommend the following i note that you said you chose some funds based on performance since the expense ratios are all high i would recommend against chasing performance because active funds will almost always falter honor the old saw   past performance is no guarantee of future returns assuming the cash in your ally account is an emergency fund i would use it to pay off your credit card debt to avoid the interest payments use free cash flow in the coming months to bring the emergency fund balance back up to an acceptable level if the ally account is not an emergency fund i would make it one with no debt and an emergency fund for 3 12 months of living expenses pick your risk tolerance then you can concentrate on investing your 401(k options are unfortunately pretty poor with those choices i would invest this way once you fill up your choice of ira then you have the tougher decision of where to put any extra money you have to invest if any a brokerage account gives you the freedom of investment choices and the ability to easily pull out money in the case of a dire emergency the 401(k will give you tax benefits but high fund expenses the tax benefits are considerable so if i were at a job where i plan on moving on in a few years i 'd fund the 401(k up to the max with the knowledge that i 'd roll the 401(k into a rollover ira in the relatively short term if i saw myself staying at the employer for a long time 5 + years i 'd probably take the taxable account route since those high fund fees will add up over time one you start building up a solid base then i might look into having a small allocation in one of my accounts for play money to pick individual stocks or start making sector bets

it depends on how much equity you have in your home scenario 1 your home is worth $ 100 k and your current mortgage is for $ 100 k or more which means you are underwater in this case you ca n't get a 2nd mortgage because that being said you can use different portions of equity in your home as collateral for multiple mortgages as long as none of the equity overlaps but you may need permission from the primary mortgage bank first for example scenario 2 your home is worth $ 100 k and your current mortgage is for $ 80 k meaning you currently have $ 20 k in equity it is possible to get a 2nd mortgage or home equity line of credit for $ 20k. as a side note if your loan agent is telling you to use a different bank it sounds like she is trying and willing to do something shady if you are in scenario 1 i 'd find a new agent

the actual physical act of obtaining the sequence data is n't the cause of the delay   the current estimates of 8 10 weeks for tumor genome sequencing are mainly due to the data processing     pooling data and processing power would actually be a huge advantage in this   after you have all the sequencing data you need to identify changes in the tumor and then determine what exactly they mean the really difficult part   if centers around the world pool their data and correlate it to clinical information the data set expands exponentially which helps everyone   otherwise each center will have their own data set which will probably get published eventually but there will be a huge delay before this information gets to the appropriate people where it can help   data pooling of this sort is already done in a lot of other cases newborn screening etc

what   said mortgage servicing companies do not get to unilaterally change the terms of a mortgage   although i 'm inclined to guess it was a simple coding error on boa 's part wrong processing box got checked when mortgage was acquired that was never caught in which case boa should be falling all over themselves to fix the situation on their dime   if they do n't fix it in a hurry then i 'd hope they get their head handed to them in court in a hurry

just for clarification my perspective on education background is from a front office associate at a bb that interacts with the traders and analysts at other bb 's and hf 's daily many of whom have become good friends   take it for what you will   it 's not my role to tell you which is right for you but i can definitely give an honest perspective of which is far more common    gt there were people who passed l3 last year    does n't take into account the number of these that were already mba holders quite a larger percent as mba has become less competitive and a cfa is required to demonstrate the quantitative capacity of a mba holder   this is a huge factor in the skew of your numbers as mba 's have become dime a dozen mba holders are now being expected to hold a ms or get a cfa to establish that their quantitative skills are qualified for working on modern day wall st front office roles   gt and became charter holders   wrong   passing l3 does n't automatically make you a charterholder   you need the 48 months of approved experience in portfolio management investment analysis or market research   these roles are becoming more and more exclusive to target graduates and mba holders so the likelihood of a cfa charterholder already having a mba is actually increasing   gt now lets just take the top 25 mba programs that 'd be 460 people class graduating to reach this number actual numbers are much lower than this   clearly you do n't realize the graduate enrollment levels at target schools   lets take a look at full time enrollment meaning 1/2 graduates each year for the top 10 for finance   wharton     nyu   columbia mit   stanford   harvard   uc   ucla   750 northwestern     that 's averaging graduates year per school at the top 10 schools for finance   to argue that there are no graduates from unc duke usc cornell dartmouth yale rice etc on wall st would be ignorance in its form   gt trust me i 'm a big fan of the cfa    you might be a fan but clearly you do n't know much about the exam keep reading and you 'll see why   gt but i know some really dumb people who are charter holders because they learned to memorize a test   memorize a test   you can def argue that for l1 not for l2 or l3   there 's a reason there 's such a collective failure amongst candidates that pass 1 and move on to l2 and l3   l2 requires critical scenario understanding of the concepts more than the formulas itself   it tests your ability to understand complex and unique fra such as repatriated foreign delta 's on cash flows not just memorizing a formula and regurgitating   l3 is even more removed from just formulas as requiring detailed essay responses   3 hour section with 10 15 essay questions yeah sounds like formula memorizing /s   gt these same people would never get admitted to a top 10 no less 25 mba program   this is an irrelevant point   there are plenty of top 10 and top 25 mba program grad 's that would n't pass the cfa either   both emphasize different skillsets   front office wall st is becoming more and more geared towards ms holders and cfa charters many mba 's holders and mba programs lack the quantitative focus to take these roles and are being denied   gt;one thing i will give you there are way too many mbas in general partially because of all the part time night time executive ones but an mba is very different then a cfa in that its banded by school and category   absolutely   that reinforces my entire point that mba 's are dime a dozen   what are we arguing about again   mba 's are very different than a cfa in that even within target schools they each emphasize on entirely different skills   mit finance mba grads are far more likely to possess strong quantitative than say a harvard mba   the reason is that the cfa is a standard qualification that focuses entirely on quantitative capacity it is like a ms in the sense that its a mile deep and a foot wide whereas mba 's are a foot deep and a mile wide   gt everyone with a cfa has the same cfa however a wharton degrees sure carries a lot more clout than a one   you 're right   but a cfa is n't meant to be comparable and interchangeable with a wharton degree   the cfa 's closest comparison is a ms in quantitative computational finance   so if you 're trying to say cfa is less valuable than a mba it 's apples and oranges   you never will see a job require a mba or cfa the cfa will always be listed on a job role as preferred ms cfa   try comparing cfa against a ms from columbia or carnegie mellon grad and you might have valid results

if you live and work in the euro zone then even after a crash all of your income and most of your expenses will still be in euros   the only portion of your worth you need to worry about protecting is the portion you intend to spend on goods from outside the euro zone i.e. imports   in that case you may want to consider parking some of your money in short term government bonds issued by other countries such as the uk switzerland and usa or wherever else your favorite goods tend to come from   if the euro actually massively devalues an extremely unlikely scenario then you can expect foreign goods to cost a lot more than they do now   inflation might also pick up so you might also want to purchase some

if you get counterfeit money then you 're dealing with the criminal who is going to be punished by the law for doing that the portion of the total sum that was paid with the counterfeit currency is considered unpaid and you can claim the money from the criminal and sue him while he 's in jail he 'll work hard on those license plates to pay you off however making false statements and assisting in a tax evasion scheme compromises your ability to go to the law enforcement in case of any wrongdoing and then you should worry about the counterfeit money because the law wo n't be on your side to help you and you do n't even get anything out of it why on earth are you willing to take this risk just so you know it may also be money laundering which may get you in trouble even more with the law

your wife could open a non registered margin trading account with a canadian full service or discount broker an account at one of the top canadian brokers should provide access to trade u.s listed options i 've traded both canadian and u.s listed options with my own broker on the application you 'd need to indicate an interest in trading options and more specifically what kind of option trades e.g. long puts and calls only covered writing combination trades etc and yes part of the application approval process at least when i went through it is to answer a few questions to prove that the applicant is aware of the types of risks with trading options be sure to do some research on the fees and currency fx aspects before you choose a broker   if you plan to exercise any options purchased or expect to be assigned for any you write be aware that those fees are often different from the headline cost per trade advertised by brokers for instance i pay in excess of $ 40 when a call option i write gets assigned vs. ~$10 that i 'd pay if i just plain sold the stock one other thing to investigate is what kind of online option trading research and order entry tools are available not every broker has the same set of features with respect to options especially if it is n't a big part of their business

our current economic situation is a mess and our current tax system is the problem but the problem is too little wealth taxation not too much     you are correct in asserting that land value tax is not the solution since we do n't live in a society where farmland is the primary source of ownership based income   if you want to look at what you can own to earn money these days look at the holdings of apple google microsoft amazon exxon mobile verizon etc it 's not farmland anymore it 's ip and it goes entirely untaxed   taxing property is completely appropriate but the problem is that we live in a world where the taxes even taxes designed to tax wealth like property taxes fall almost entirely on the individual since high value capital can move jurisdictions to dodge taxes and thus taxing wealth like we should creates a competitive disadvantage     when you push back on real estate property taxes you do n't make things better for most people   property values rise since the value of an asset is proportional to how much money it can earn for it 's owner driving affordability down rent up homeownership rates down and generally worsening the quality of life for everyone   pushed to the extreme you get a 2 class system where land ownership is for the entitled and everyone else are worthless   history is littered with examples which is why we know the word serf   for a modern day cautionary tale look at what happened in california since the reagan property tax changes   they still seem convinced it was a great change but the california real estate market is pure insanity

my big gripe with the ico name and corresponding mania is that it has no similarity to an ipo   at best an ico is a seed stage investment in a wholly unproven technology idea theoretical use a developer team gets together to write a fancy whitepaper then build out a nifty website to display the idea they are working on   generally this idea has no practical immediate use   generally this idea is still nothing more than an idea   at best the idea will be realized by substantially the open source of a different coin with slight tweaks   the developers then go get an exchange or two involved to begin trading the tokens   one exchange even goes so far as to begin trading ious for the tokens before the ico takes place   it 's shear insanity driven by this mania to have the next bitcoin for $ each when a real organization goes through the real regulated ipo process it has already had its seed funding then subsequent equity financing rounds then once the company has demonstrated that it has a valuable product or service and a competent management team shares are allowed to be sold to the public   by us law seed stage companies are forbidden from seeking investment from unaccredited investors this does n't mean unaccredited investors are forbidden from investing   an accredited investor is someone with over $ 200,000 per year of income or a net worth of over $ 1,000,000   seed stage organizations have an exceptionally high rate of failure no matter the proposed business    these icos are little more than developers fleecing naive investors by selling them the pipe dream of being on the ground floor of the next bitcoin   it 's really appalling   you should stay away from them everyone should stay away from them and the people running them should be punished

for personal investing and highly risky securities wasting assets which is exactly what options are it is better to think in terms of sunk costs do n't chase this trade trying to make your money back you should minimize your loss unwind the position now while there is still some remaining value in those call options and take a short term loss or you could try this   let 's say you own an exchange traded call option on a listed stock very general case i do n't know how much time remains before the option 's expiration date be that as it may i could suggest this to effect a recovery   you 'll be long the call and short the stock this is called a delta hedge as you would be delta trading the stock delta refers to short term price volatility   in other words you 'll short a single large block of the stock then buy shares in small increments whenever the market drops slightly on an intra day basis when the market price of the stock rises incrementally you 'll sell a few shares back and forth in response to short term market price moves while maintaining a static hedge ratio as your original call option gets closer to maturity roll it over into the next available contract either one month or preferably three month time to expiration if you do n't want to or ca n't borrow the underlying stock to short you could do a synthetic short a synthetic short is a combination of a long put and a short call whose pay off replicates the short stock payoff   i personally would never purchase an unhedged option or warrant but since that is what you own right now you have two choices get out or dig in deeper with the realization that you are doing a lot of work just to trade your way back to a net zero   while you can make a profit using this sort of strategy i 'm not certain if that is within the scope of the website

the purpose is to go public but also to generate more wealth the real money comes when market values you at a price more than your cash flow if a company brings in $ 1000 of cash flow then that is what the employees and owners have to distribute among themselves but if they are likely to increase to $ 2000 next and $ 4000 next year and they go public then the stock will do well in this case the promoters and employees with options rsus will benefit as well the increased visibility is also very useful look at google or fb they did n't need the ipo proceed when they went public they had enough cash from their business but then they would only have $ 1 10 billion a year but due to the ipo their investors and employees have a huge net worth   basically with just a small of shares in the public you can value the company at a high price valuing in the future cash flows with a discount rate etc so instead of realizing the profit over the next 15 years you get to enjoy it right away

their income is from the two sources you mentioned they charge the merchants for each use and they make interest money on people who carry a balance this is one reason a lot of merchants will be willing to give you a discount if you pay cash they do n't have to give a portion to visa or mastercard    i would n't be able to speak to the relative proportions between the two income sources but when many cards are at 30 interest for balances carried and many people have tens of thousands of dollars owed on their cards the interest income is not insignificant   they 'll also charge interest immediately on cash advances a few cards also make money off of annual fees although i 'd suspect this is not very much in the full scheme of things the way to get the most out of a card is to always pay it off fully at the end of each month

when the strike price $ 25 in this case is in the money even by $ 0.01 your shares will be sold the day after expiration if you take no action if you want to let your shares go allow assignment rather than close the short position and sell the long position it will be cheaper that way if you want to keep your shares you must buy back the option prior to 4pm est on expiration friday first ask yourself why you want to keep the shares is it to write another option is it to hold for a longer term strategy assuming this is a covered call writing account you should consider rolling the option this involves buying back the near term option and selling the later date option of a similar or higher strike make sure to check to see if there is an upcoming earnings report in the latter month because you may want to avoid writing a call in that situation i never write a call when there 's an upcoming er prior to expiration good luck alan

use other currencies if available i 'm not familiar with the banking system in south africa if they have n't placed any currency freezes or restrictions you might want to do this sooner than later   in full crises like russian and ukraine once the crisis worsened they started limiting purchases of foreign currencies paypal might allow currency swaps it implies that it does at the bottom of this page if not i know uphold does short the currency brokerage in the us allow us to short the us dollar   if banks allow you to short the you can always use that for protection   i looked at the interest rates in the to see how the central bank is offsetting this currency crisis wow i 'd be running not walking toward the nearest exit   a usa analogy during the late 70s early 80s would be paul volcker holding interest rates at 2.5 thinking that would contain 10 inflation bitcoin comes with significant risks itself but if you use it as a temporary medium of exchange for swaps like uphold or with some bitcoin exchanges like btc e you can get other currencies by converting to bitcoin then swapping for other assets   bitcoin 's strength is remitting and swapping holding on to it is high risk commodities i think these are higher risk right now as part of the 's problem is that it 's heavily reliant on commodities   i looked at your stock market to see how well it 's done and i also see that it 's done poorly too and i think the commodity has something to do with that   if you know of any commodity that can stay stable during uncertainty like food that does n't expire you can at least buy without worrying about costs rising in the future   i always joke that if hyperinflation happened in the united states everyone would wish they lived in utah

you are very young you make a huge amount of money and you have from what information you provide very little debt if you simply want to buy a house for whatever reason sure but be honest with yourself about why you want to buy it i see a lot of people who think they 're doing it for smart financial reasons but then when i ask them about their pension savings and credit card debts and so on there is no evidence that they are actually the kind of person who makes decisions for smart financial reasons if you want a house because that seems like the thing that people do maybe you could think more about what you actually want if your concern is putting your money to work for you you seem to dislike that you pay rent each month and after that month you do n't have anything to show for your money except of course that you did n't spent the last month living on the streets you can do a lot better than getting a mortgage for example living frugally you should be able to dump 50k a year into investments if you did that for a few years you could reasonably expect the return to cover your rent and bills in a surprisingly small number of years a lot less than a 25 year mortgage your question seems to be starting from the position that you should buy a house you 're asking if you should buy it now or wait you are rich enough now and if your earnings keep going up will be even more rich in a few years that you should perhaps question your need to buy a house with your kind of money at this stage of your life you can do a lot better

if your friend is loaning you krw which you are then converting to usd then there are tax implications   this would be a section transaction so gains or losses made during repayment partial or complete due to fluctuations in exchange rate would be treated as ordinary gains or losses for example imagine you borrow 100,000 krw and at the time you borrow it this is worth exactly 100,000 usd   at some future point you repay 20,000 krw   if the exchange rate at that point is such that 20,000 krw is worth 15,000 usd then the irs sees that you have gained 5,000 usd in ordinary income   this is a particular concern if the loan is a mortgage and you refinance the mortgage at a moment in time with a more favorable exchange rate than the exchange rate when you first got the mortgage see for some additional discussion

i 'm not sure i am fully understanding the nuance of your question but based on your answer in the comments you and your business are not separate legal entities so your income is the full $ 70 k there is no distinct business to have income if you clarify your question to include why you want to know this i might be able to give a more meaningful answer for your situation

maximizing income could mean a lot of things   what you really want is to maximize wealth   does n't matter if it comes from your bond appreciating in value or as dividends in order to maximize your wealth that 's today 's wealth you need to make decisions based on the net present value of these bonds the market is fairly priced especially for a tight market like government bonds   that means if your bond falls in price it has fallen by precisely the amount necessary so that an investor would be indifferent between purchasing it now at its current price and purchasing a new bond with a higher dividend   the bonds with higher dividends will simply have a higher price so more of the money comes as dividends than as price appreciation at maturity it will sell for face value   in other words the animals are out of the barn and you have lost or made money already   changing from one bond to another will not change your wealth one way or the other the only potential effect of changing bonds will be changing the risk of your portfolio   if you buy a bond that matures later or has a lower dividend than your current bond you will be adding additional interest rate risk to your portfolio   that risk should be compensated so you will have a higher expected return as well   but regardless of your choice you will not be made wealthier or less wealthy by changing from one bond to another should you buy bonds that will earn you the most possible   sure if you are below your risk tolerance   even among default free bonds the longer the maturity and the lower the dividend the greater the effect of future changes in interest rates on your bond   that makes them riskier but also makes them earn more money on average tl;dr in terms of your wealth which is what matters it does n't matter whether you hold your bond or buy a new one

echoing the others never lend money to a friend or family member just give it to them    if you must have a contract in place then consider it a pay it forward type contract where the friend simply gives the same amount to someone in need at a future date    the value of the friendship can never be measured but it surely will be diminished by the amount of the loan between the two of you

gt if you went somewhat into debt say $ 30k for a major with good job prospects and a high salary it will probably be a good decision which is exactly what i did and it worked out very well for me   there is still the opportunity cost i mentioned though the average person makes $ 30 k out of high school so that is more than a million dollars in opportunity costs if you go to school for four years instead of going to work far more than that if you can earn more than $ 30 k which there is a good chance you can if you have the talent to get into college   additionally if a career has good job prospects and high salaries employers are n't really going to be concerned about your education save where the law mandates it you can not be a doctor without the education by law for instance it is the lack of capable workers that drives the salaries up and it is that same lack of capable workers that force employers to consider just about anyone   there may be an argument to be made that an education can help as a signal in jobs where competition of fierce but that same competition will drive the market rate of the job way down which does n't exactly seem like a win to me   that 's awesome that it worked out for you i 'm just not sure it should be considered a safe or even good investment while the returns can be there in some cases it seems like the stakes are pretty high

  and and are the leading sites to check vehicle values also great how to at where to sell you could sell it in your local newspaper classified small auto publications craigslist ebay or just put a sign in the window the advertising method is up to you   you could also trade the car in to a dealer if you purchase another vehicle from a dealer if they offer that option trade in 's generally bring in less money than private sales as a general rule   some car places will do consignment requests to help you sell your car   however they will normally take a percentage of the sale as payment for this service what paperwork if you own your car you should have the title in hand   there are instructions on title on how to sign it over to another person   if you have a loan through a bank the bank would have this title and you would need to express your interest in selling the property to the bank and work out the details with them you do not hand over a title to anyone until full payment is made and the property will become theirs beyond the title you will need to fill out a release of liability or report of sale form for the state titles have a portion you can mail in or you can fill it out online this is to report the sale to the state to release liability from your name you will also need to create a bill of sale between you and the buyer   there are many examples online or you can just create your own   you really need just a statement saying i release all interest of the vehicle and no warranty implied to this person with the vin of the car model make year the buyers name and signature and the sellers name and signature   this is your contract with the seller and they use this when they go to register the car in their name maintenance disclosure this is completely up to the seller on what they want to disclose   you are selling a used car and the buyer should know that   vehicles with detailed records sell for more money and buyers are more interested in cars that have history records   this is where buyers should be the most careful so the more records and history you can show the better they will feel about the purchase   i believe you should share everything you know and any information about the history of the car   the more positive information you can prove share the more money or chance of sale you could have most money first clean the car out   i am amazed at the amount of people that try to sell a car and do n't even bother to clean it out   a detail job would be great to get   you are trying to sell it so you want it to look the best   next   i would fix anything minor and cheap to fix   the less things wrong can mean more money   back to your maintenance question you will want to show how you have maintained the car   people might also ask for a report to prove its clean history   irresponsible and deceiving people tend to leave out important details in a car history like accidents flood damage or having re built titles   you want to give the most information you can   do not lie about any detail   though this can be a little tough when you are a 2nd or 3rd owner of a car and do not know about the original owners

you 're calculating it exactly right i wrote about this one on my blog a while ago lesson learned is that nothing comes for free and you can take the saying there are no free meals quite literally in this case edit to address the comments about tips i do n't believe tips should be compulsory its my reward to the server for outstanding service not part of the cost of the meal if its part of the server 's salary then i prefer not to dine in such a place and at least in some places its illegal to consider tips as part of the salary the coupon in question explicitly requests tipping the server thus the tips with or without the coupon are still expected and that 's why i 'm not taking them into the consideration according to the laws of the state of california where i live mandatory charges such as the 18 gratuity charge required by the coupon are not tips and do n't have to be passed on to the employees thus employees will still expect my tips on the bill so i 'm basically required to tip twice when using the coupon

tl;dr summary 0 balance transfer offers and free checks usable anywhere    rarely are a good deal for the customer 0 rate balance transfer offers and the checks usable anywhere including payment of taxes come with a transaction fee because the credit card company is paying off the balance on the other card or the tax or the electric bill in the full amount of $ x as stated on the other card statement or on the tax electric bill this is in contrast to a purchase transaction where if you buy something for $ x you pay the card company $ x but the card company pays the merchant something less than $ of course the merchant has jacked up the sale price of the item to pass on the charge to you can you get the credit card company to waive the transaction fee you can try asking them but it is unlikely that you will succeed if your credit score is good i have seen balance transfer offers with no transaction fees made to people who have do n't have good credit scores and are used to carrying a balance   on their credit cards i assume that the company making the offer knows that it will make up the transaction fee from future interest payments a few other points to keep in mind with respect to using a 0 balance transfer offer to pay off a student loan or anything else for that matter

the question states our insurance company is offering a 30 discount on an $    commercial policy if we install the insurance is paid in    two installments this appears to mean six monthly payments so i 'll make some comparison calculations using six monthly loan repayments to keep things simple without the loan or the insurance costs $ 4100 every six months using this loan payment formula the calculation below shows with the 30 discounted insurance maintenance and loan repayment you would be paying $ every six months   the discount required to break even is   i.e. rearranging the equation   alternatively with the discount of 30 you would break even if the six monthly repayment amount was $   solving the payment equation for s gives an equation for the loan   so with the 30 discount you would break even if the loan required was $ checking by back calculating the periodic payment amount a   likewise we can keep the loan at $ 40000 and solve for t to find the break even loan term   note in this formula log denotes the natural logarithm   now we can set some values   so with break even payments the $ 40000 loan is paid off in just under years   i.e. checking   this just beats the $ 4100 cost of proceeding without the notes if your loan repayment was monthly it would reduce the cost of the loan slightly   the periodic interest rate is calculated from the apr according to the method used in the eu and in some cases in us   the calculations above were run using mathematica

typically preferred shares come with one or both different benefits a disproportionate share of votes say 10 votes per share vs the normal 1 or a preferred dividend   the vote preference is great for the owner(s looking to go public but not lose control of the company say i am a walton of walmart fame and when i went public i sold 80 of the 1000 share total company but in creating the share structure 20 of shares were assigned 10 votes each 800 shares now trade with 800 votes 200 shares have 10 votes each or 2000 votes so there are still the 1000 shares but 2800 votes the 20 of shares now have or 71 of the total votes so my shares are just less than half ownership but over 78 of votes   preferred dividend is as simple as that buy stock a for ownership or same company stock a preferred shares which have ownership and $ dividend   edited to show a bit more math i use a simple example to call out a total 1000 shares the percentages would be the same for a million or billion shares if 20 were a 10 vote preferred

a couple of thoughts and experiences germany italy first of all i recommend talking to the belgian bank and possibly to a dutch bank of your choice i have similar conditions for my german bank accounts but even though they talk about it as salary account all they really ask for is a monthly inflow of more than xxxx € which can be satisfied with an automatic direct transfer i have some money automatically circulating for this reason which earns about 4 p.a by saving fees in that case it may be a feasible way to have a belgian and a dutch bank account and set up some money circulation   experiences working in italy some years ago sepa payments were kind of new and the debits were n't implemented then   my guess with your service providers is that they are allowed to offer you contracts that are bound to rather arbitrary payment conditions after all you probably can also get a prepaid phone or a contract with a bill that you can then pay by wire transfer however afaik they are allowed to offer discounts ask fees for different payment methods just like there is no law that forces the store around your corner to accept credit cards or even large eur denominations as long as they tell you so beforehand    afaik there is eu regulation saying your bank is n't allowed to charge you more for wire to foreign country within the sepa zone than a national wire transfer

i got started by reading the following two books you could probably get by with just the first of those two i have n't been a big fan of the for dummies series in the past but i found both of these were quite good particularly for people who have little understanding of investing i also rather like the site canadian couch potato that has a wealth of information on passive investing using mutual funds and etfs it 's a good next step after reading one or the other of the books above in your specific case you are investing for the fairly short term and your tolerance for risk seems to be quite low gold is a high risk investment and in my opinion is ill suited to your investment goals i 'd say you are looking at a money market account very low risk low return such as e.g. the td canadian money market fund you may also want to take a look at e.g. the td canadian bond index which is only slightly higher risk however for someone just starting out and without a whack of knowledge i rather like pointing people at the ing direct funds they offer three options balancing risk vs reward you can fill in their online fund and it 'll point you in the right direction you can pay less by buying individual stock and bond funds through your bank following e.g. one of the canadian couch potato 's model portfolios but ing direct makes things nice and simple and is a good option for people who do n't care to spend a lot of time on this note that i am not a financial adviser and i have only a limited understanding of your needs you may want to consult one though you 'll want to be careful when doing so to avoid just talking to a salesperson also note that i am biased toward passive index investing other people may recommend that you invest in gold or real estate or specific stocks i think that 's a bad idea and believe i have the science to back this up but i may be wrong

you can keep the cash in your account as long as you want but you have to pay a tax on what 's called capital gains to quote from wikipedia a capital gain is a profit that results from investments into a capital asset such as stocks bonds or real estate which exceeds the purchase price it is the difference between a higher selling price and a lower purchase price resulting in a financial gain for the conversely a capital loss arises if the proceeds from the sale of a capital asset are less than the purchase price thus buying selling stock counts as investment income which would be a capital gain loss when you are filing taxes you have to report net capital gain loss so you do n't pay taxes on an individual stock sale or purchase you pay tax on the sum of all your transactions   note you do not pay any tax if you have a net capital loss taxes are only on capital gains   the amount you are taxed depends on your tax bracket and your holding period a short term capital gain is gain on an investment held for less than one year these gains are taxed at your ordinary income tax rate a long term capital gain is gain on an investment held for more than one year these gains are taxed at a special rate if your income tax rate is 10 or 15 then long term gains are taxed at 0 i.e. no tax otherwise the tax rate is 15 so you 're not taxed on specific stock sales you 're taxed on your total gain there is no tax for a capital loss and investors sometimes take profits from good investments and take losses from bad investments to lower their total capital gain so they wo n't be taxed as much the tax rate is expected to change in 2013 but the current ratios could be extended until then however the rate is as is   of course this all applies if you live in the united states other countries have different measures hope it helps   wikipedia has a great chart to refer to

for starting with zero knowledge you certainly did a great job on research as you hit on most of the important points with your question   it seems like you have already saved up around six months of expenses in savings so it is a great time to look into investing the hardest part of your question is actually one of the most important details   investing in a way that minimizes your taxes is generally more important in the end than what assets you actually invest in as long as you invest even semi reasonably   the problem is that the interaction between your home country 's tax system and the u.s. tax system can be complex   it 's probably likely still worth maxing out your 401(k ira sep 529 accounts if you qualify to avoid taxes but like this question from an indian investor it may be worth seeing an investment professional about this   if you do see a fee based professional preferably one familiar with your country    if tax advantaged accounts are not a good deal for you or if you max them out a discount broker is probably a good second option for someone willing to do a bit of research like you with this money investing in broadly diversified low fee index mutual funds or exchange traded funds is generally recommended   among other benefits diversified funds make sure that if any particular company fails you do n't feel too much pain   the advantages of low fees are fairly obvious and one very good reason why so many people recommend vanguard on this site   a common mix for someone your age is mostly stocks local and international and some bonds   though with how you talk about risk you may prefer more bonds some people recommend this up a bit with a small amount of real estate reits sometimes even other assets   the right portfolio of the above can change a lot given the person   the above mentioned adviser and/or more research can help here if in the future you start to believe you will go back to your home country soon that may throw much of this advice out the window and you should definitely reevaluate then   also if you are interested in the math stats behind the above advice a random walk down wall street is a light read and a good place to start   investing makes for a very interesting and reasonably profitable math stats problem

i think that assuming that you 're not looking to trade the fund an index mutual fund is a better overall value than an etf the cost difference is negligible and the ability to dollar cost average future contributions with no transaction costs you also have to be careful with etfs the spreads are wide on a low volume fund and some etfs are going more exotic things that can burn a novice investor track two similar funds say vanguard total stock market vtsmx and vanguard total stock market etf vti you 'll see that they track similarly   if you are a more sophisticated investor etfs give you the ability to use options to hedge against declines in value without having to incur capital gains from the sale of the fund ie 20 years from now can use puts to make up for short term losses instead of selling shares to avoid losses   for most retail investors i think you really need to justify using etfs versus mutual funds if anything the limitations of mutual funds no intra day trading no options etc discourage speculative behavior that is ultimately not in your best interest edit since this answer was written many brokers have begun offering a suite of etfs with no transaction fees that may push the cost equation over to support index etfs over index mutual funds particularly if it 's a big etf with narrow spreads

etfs are a type of investment not a specific choice in other words there are good etfs and bad what you see is the general statement that etfs are preferable to most mutual funds if only for the fact that they are low cost an index etf such as spy which reflects the s&p 500 index has a annual expense vs a mutual fund which average a full percent or more   is n't wrong i just have a different spin to offer you given a long term return of say even 8 note this question is not a debate of the long term return and i purposely chose a low number compared to the long term average closer to 10 and the current cd rate of < 1 a 1 hit for the commission on the buy side does n't bother me the sell wo n't occur for a long time and $ 8 on a $ 10 k sale is no big deal i 'd not expect you to save $ 1k yr in cash cds for the years it would take to make that $ 8 fee look tiny not when over time the growth will this   one day you will be in a position where the swings in the market will produce the random increase or decrease to your net worth in the $ 10s of thousands do you know why you wo n't lose a night 's sleep over this because when you invested your first $ 1 k and started to pay attention to the market you saw how some days had swings of 3 or 4 and you built up an immunity to the day to day noise you stayed invested and as you gained wealth you stuck to the right rebalancing each year so a market crash which took others down by 30 only impacted you by 15 20 and you were ready for the next move to the upside and you also saw that since mutual funds with their 1 fees never beat the index over time you were happy to say you lagged the s&p by or 1 over 11 year 's time vs those whose funds had some great years but lost it all in the bad years   and by the way right until you are in the 25 bracket roth is the way to go when you are at 25 that 's the time to use pre tax accounts to get just below the   last welcome to se     edit see 's answer below i agree i missed the cost of the bid ask spread going with the lowest cost index funds may make better sense for you   to clarify points out that etfs trade like a stock a commission and a bid ask both add to transaction cost so agreeing this is the case an indexed based mutual fund can provide the best of possible options reflecting the s&p for example less a small expense .1 or less

some of the other answers recommended peer to peer lending and property markets i would not invest in either of these firstly peer to peer lending is not a traditional investment and we may not have enough historical data for the risk to return ratio secondly property investments have a great risk unless you diversify which requires a huge portfolio crowd funding for one property is not a traditional investment and may have drawbacks for example what if you disagree with other crowd about the required repairs for the property if you invest in the property market i recommend a well diversified fund that owns many properties beware of high debt leverage used to enhance returns and at the same time risk and high fees when selecting a fund however traditionally it has been a better choice to invest in stocks than to invest in property market beware of anyone who says that the property market is too good to not get into without specifying which part of the world is meant note also that many companies invest in properties so if you invest only in a well diversified stock index fund you may already have property investments in your portfolio however in your case i would keep the money in risk free assets i.e. bank savings or a genuine low cost money market fund i.e. one that does n't invest in corporate debt or in variable rate loans which have short duration but long maturity the reason is that you 're going to be unemployed soon and thus you may need the money soon if you have an investment horizon of say 10 years then i would throw stocks into the mix and if you 're saving for retirement then i would go all in to stocks in the part of the world where i live in money market funds generally have better return than bank savings and better diversification too however your 2.8 interest sounds rather high the money market fund i have in the past invested in currently yields at 0.02 but then again i live in the eurozone so be sure to get estimates for the yields of different risk free assets so my advice for investing is simple risk free assets for short time horizon a mixture of stocks and risk free assets for medium time horizon and only stocks for long time horizon in any case you need a small emergency fund too which you should consider a thing separate from your investments my emergency fund is 20 000 eur your 50 000 aud is bit more than 30 000 eur so you do n't really have that much money to invest only a bit more than a reasonably sized emergency fund but then again i live in rental property so my expenses are probably higher than yours if you can foresee a very long time horizon for part of your investment you could perhaps invest 50 of your money to stocks preference being a geographically diversified index fund or a number of index funds but i would n't invest more because of the need for an emergency fund

there are two issues here arithmetic and psychology scenario 1 you are presently paying an extra $ 500 per month on your student loan above the minimum payments your credit card company offers a $ 4000 cash advance at 0 for 8 months so you take the cash advance pay it toward the student loan and then instead of paying the extra $ 500 per month toward the student loan you use that $ 500 for 8 months to repay the cash advance net result you pay 0 interest on the loan and save roughly 8 months times $ 4000 times the interest on the student loan divided by two i say divided by two because it 's not the difference between $ 4000 and zero but between $ 4000 and the $ 500 you would have been paying off each month clearly you are better off if you are not presently paying an extra $ 500 on the student loan or even if you are but it is a struggle to come up with the money then the question becomes can you reasonably expect to be able to pay off the credit card before the grace period runs out interest rates on credit cards are normally much higher than interest rates on student loans if you get the cash advance and then ca n't repay it after 8 months you are paying a very steep interest rate and anything you saved on the student loan will quickly be lost what i mean by psychological is that you have to have the discipline to really repay the credit card within the grace period if you 're not very that you can do that this plan could go bad very quickly personally i 've thought about doing things like this many times cash advances against credit cards home equity loans etc all give low interest money that could be used to pay off a higher interest debt but it 's easy to get into trouble doing things like this it 's easy to say to yourself well i do n't need to put all the money toward that other debt i could keep a thousand or so to buy that big screen tv i really need or to fail to pay back the low interest loan on schedule because other things keep coming up that you spend your money on instead whether frivolous luxuries or true emergencies and there 's always the possibility that something will happen to mess up your finances from a big car repair bill to losing your job you do n't want to paint yourself into a corner finally maxing out your credit cards hurts your credit rating the formulas are secret but i understand that if you use more than half your available credit that 's a minus how much it hurts you depends on lots of factors

the first method is the correct one you bought an asset worth of $ 1000 and you put it on your depreciation schedule what it means is that you get to write off the $ 1000 over a certain period of time and not at once as you do with expenses but the value you 're writing off is the $ 1000 regardless of how much you 've written off already assume you depreciate in straight line over 5 years that 's how you depreciate computers for federal tax purposes most states follow for the simplicity of the calculation assume you depreciate each year as a whole year no mid year mid quarter conventions the calculation is like this if you sell the computer the proceeds above the adjusted basis amount are taxed as depreciation recapture up to the accumulated depreciation amount and as capital gains above that so in your case book value is the adjusted basis at the end of the year depreciation this year is the amount you depreciate in the year in question out of the total of the original cost and the accumulated depreciation is the total depreciation including the current year in maryland they do not allow depreciating to $ 0 but rather down to 25 of the original cost so if you bought a $ 1000 computer you depreciate until your adjusted basis is $ 250 depreciation rates are described here page 5 for computers except for large you get 30 depreciation with the last year probably a bit less due to the $ 250 adjusted basis limitation

bonds provide protections against stock market crashes diversity and returns as the other posters have said but the primary reason to invest in bonds is to receive relatively guaranteed income by that i mean you receive regular payments as long as the debtor does n't go bankrupt and stop paying even when this happens bondholders are the first in line to get paid from the sale of the business 's assets this also makes them less risky stocks do n't guarantee income and shareholders are last in line to get paid when a stock goes to zero you lose everything where as a bondholder will get some face value redemption to the notes issue price and still keep all the previous income payments in addition you can use your bond income to buy more shares of stock and increase your gains there

best is indeed subjective you could for example get a universal life policy that pays a guaranteed interest on all monies even those in excess of what you need to pay to cover the policy most people will tell you probably correctly that using life insurance as an investment vehicle is a bad idea however   the growth of the money in a policy however is usually tax deductible and grows at a guaranteed rate here in the u.s. pays a guaranteed unless they go broke i suppose 4 per year historically however they 've been paying 6 per year that 's pretty good except a lot of your money goes into buying the policy the first few years

you make several good points   i 'll start with black scholes the arbitrage argument in black scholes is between the option and a hypothetical and portfolio with identical cash flows the replicating portfolio   we then value the replicating portfolio via an equilibrium model   when you use bs there is n't necessarily any observed security whose is guaranteed not imply some arbitrage opportunity because bs makes no reference to observed prices   a no arbitrage modification might look like this i observe the prices and implied volatilities of some options and use the implied volatilities to price another option maybe with a different strike   doing so ensures that there is no arbitrage between my price and the market prices implied by my model   realistically the problem arbitrage free models are addressing is that our models and assumptions are wrong even though they 're reasonable a lot of the time   a no arbitrage model removes some set of obvious deficiencies but at the cost of not being able to explain why things are priced as they are   so for instance wo n't reproduce the observed term structure and hull white fixes this but hull white does n't explain where the term structure comes from i.e. what the term structure should be

i suggest rolling it over to the 401(k with your new employer   particularly if they match any percentage of your contribution it would be in your interest to take as much of that money as possible when it comes to borrowing money from your 401(k it looks like the issues mentioned only apply if you do n't pay back the money   the reasonable argument against taking money out of your 401(k to buy a home is that it leaves a dent in your retirement nest egg and its earning power during key earning years   on the plus side for borrowing from your 401(k it 's very low interest and it 's interest you 're paying back to yourself over a 5-year period   at its current value the most you could borrow from your 401(k is $   if you 're fortunate in where you live that could be most or all of the downpayment in my own experience my wife borrowed against her 401(k balance for the earnest money when we purchased a new home   fortunately for us an investor snapped up my previous home within 4 days of us listing it so she was able to pay back her loan in full right away

i buy a lot of lumber in japan i grew up in the us so i used feet and inches and home depot lumber for a long time it is not illegal it is just fucking stupid that we will buy wood when we are unsure of the dimensions and home depot does n't label what it actually is    i really really like system here in japan they have a mix of traditional metric and imperial size lumber but it is easy to use it all the key is that everything is converted to and displayed on the signage in store    the other key point is that the wood actually matches that mm dimension a pack of mm wood is exactly those dimensions     they have a lot of 2x4 lumber with imperial labels feet marked in f but it is also marked in so a standard 2x4 plank is mm there is no question as to the exact dimensions of the boards    i buy metric mm lumber which is roughly the size of a mm and roofing panels 1 is mm and is very close to 1 foot so since everything is reduced to it is easy to buy and cut the lumber to exact dimensions without worrying about how they will actually fit together something that is a horrible pain in the ass with us lumber

they could have different quotes as there are more than a few pieces here   are you talking a real time level ii quote or just a delayed quote   delayed quotes could vary as different companies would be using different time points in their data   you are n't specifying exactly what kind of quote from which system are you using here the key to this question is how much of a answer do you want and how prepared are you to pay for that kind of access to the automated trades happening   remember that there could well be more than a few trades happening each millisecond and thus latency is something to be very careful here regardless of the exchange as long as we are talking about first world stock exchanges where there are various automated systems being used for trading different market makers is just a possible piece of the equation here   one could have the same market maker but if the are different e.g if one quote is at and the other is at there could be a difference given all the trades processed within that second thus the question is how well can you get that split second total view of bids and asks for a stock   you want to get all the outstanding orders which could be a non trivial task

yes the price of a stock is what investors think the value of a stock is which is not tied to profits or dividends by any rigid formula but to say that therefore the price could be high even though the company is doing very poorly is hypothetically true but unlikely in practice consider any other product there is no fixed formula for the value of a used car either if everyone agreed that a 20-year old car that does n't run is worth $ 100,000 then that 's what it would sell for but that 's a pretty big if at the beginning of that sentence   if the car had been used in some hit tv show 20 years ago or if it was owned by a celebrity or some such special case maybe a old car really would sell for $ 100,000 likewise a stock might have a price higher than what one would predict from its dividends if some rich person wanted to buy that company because the brand name brings back memories from his youth and so he drives the price up etc but the normal case is that in the long term the price of a stock tends to settle on a value proportional to the dividends that it pays or rather and this is a big caveat the dividends that investors expect it to pay in the future and then adjusted for all sorts of other factors and special situations like the value of the company if it was to be liquidated etc

it is a great advice   i would suggest going to the companies house it 's in london somewhere picking up all of their regarding requirements for different forms of corporate entity and deciding if you want to have that burden   it is not a lot of work you can essentially claim vat on all business purchases the way roughly it works is that your company invoices your client your client has to pay the fee + vat usually that vat is then deducted by your client from it 's vat so no loss there and you pay the vat on the difference between the service sales price and your costs computers etc you have to be careful to avoid excessive double taxation paying income tax on both corporate income and then your personal income off said company but it usually comes off in your favor essentially if you 're making more than 50 of your income from services rendered it is to your advantage to render such services as a business entity

i am neither a lawyer nor a tax accountant and if you 're dealing with serious money i suggest you consult a professional but my understanding is if you make a loan at zero interest or at below market rates the irs will consider the difference between the interest that you do charge and the market rate to be a gift that is if someone could get a loan from a bank and he 'd pay $ 1000 in interest for the year but instead you loan him the money as a friend interest free than as far as the irs is concerned you have given him a $ 1000 gift and you could potentially have to pay gift tax or they might the interest to you and tax you on $ 1000 of additional income if you have no agreement on repayment terms if it 's all hey joe just pay me back when you can then the irs is likely to consider the entire loan to be a gift there 's an annual exclusion on gifts i think it 's now $ 13,000 so if you loan your buddy fifty bucks to tide him over until next pay day the irs is n't going to get involved in that they 're worried about more serious money and yes the irs does police loan rates the irs examines exact numbers for all sorts of things if say you go on a overnight business trip and the company gives you $ 10,000 for travel expenses the irs is likely to say that this is not a tax deductible travel expense at all but a sham to hide part of your salary from taxes or if you donate a pair of old socks to charity and declare a $ 500 charitable contribution deduction the irs will say that that is not a realistic value for a pair of old socks and disallow the deduction etc a small discrepancy from market rates can be justified for any number of reasons if the book value of a used car is $ 5000 and you sell it to your neighbor for $ 4900 the irs is unlikely to question it there are any number of legitimate business reasons why you had to give a discount to make the sale but if you sell it to him for $ 50 they may declare that this is not a sale but a gift etc

$ 33 k $ payment is but is that right you 're also stretching out the remaining loan back to 30 years   now if the bank just let you do the stretch you 'd owe $ 95 k 4.75 360 mo pmt = $ this would be a neutral move same rate you now have $ 128 k 360 pmt = $ 737 so to my thinking the delta is $ 33 k x rate 360 pmt = $ and the rate is if you have enough equity to refi you have enough to take that in a heloc and pay it off aggressively why give up the great rate the $ you will pay the heloc off in 22 years even at 6 my heloc is 2.5 i 'd use any raise or bonus to hack away at it   i tried to spell out my thought process on the math if any savvy reader you all are i know wants to look at this and offer a better method i 'm open minded there 's a fallacy that comes with refinancing certainly money appears in the payment stream as a result of extending the term somewhere that needs to be accounted for else a higher rate at a longer term appears favorable so my approach is to normalize the numbers one way or another here producing that first step of calculating the payment on the extended term an interim step that 's a mental process only that loan is hypothetical   comments welcome

congratulations on a solid start here are my thoughts based on your situation asset classes i would recommend against a long term savings account as an investment vehicle while very safe the yields will almost always be well below inflation since you have a long time horizon most likely at least 30 years to retirement you have enough time to take on more risk as long as it 's not more than you can live with if you are looking for safer alternatives to stocks for part of your investments you can also consider investment grade bonds bond funds or even a stable value fund later when you are much closer to retirement you may also want to consider an annuity depending on the interest rate on your loan you may also be able to get a better return from paying down your loan than from putting more in a savings account i would recommend that you only keep in a savings account what you expect to need in the next few years cushion for regular expenses emergency fund etc on stocks stocks are riskier but have the best chance to outperform versus inflation over the long term i tend to favor funds over individual stocks mostly for a few practical reasons first one of the goals of investing is to diversify your risk which produces a more efficient risk reward ratio than a group of stocks that are highly correlated diversification is easier to achieve via an index fund but it is possible for a well educated investor to stay diversified via individual stocks also since most investors do n't actually want to take physical possession of their shares funds will manage the shares for you as well as offering additional services such as the automatic of dividends and tax management asset allocation it 's very important that you are comfortable with the amount of risk you take on investment salespeople will prefer to sell you stocks as they make more commission on stocks than bonds or other investments but unless you 're able to stay in the market for the long term it 's unlikely you 'll be able to get the market return over the long term make sure to take one or more risk tolerance assessments to understand how often you 're willing to accept significant losses as well as what the optimal asset allocation is for you given the level of risk you can live with generally speaking for someone with a long investment horizon and a medium risk tolerance even the most conservative allocations will have at least 60 in stocks total of us and international with the rest in bonds other and up to 80 or even 100 for a more aggressive investor owning more bonds will result in a lower expected return but will also dramatically reduce your portfolio 's risk and volatility pension with so many companies deciding that they do n't feel like keeping the promises they made to yesterday 's workers or simply ca n't afford to the pension is nice but like social security i would n't bank on all of this money being there for you in the future this is where a fee only financial planner can really be helpful they can run a bunch of scenarios in planning software that will show you different retirement scenarios based on a variety of assumptions ie what if you only get 60 of the promised pension etc   this is probably not as much of an issue if you are an equity partner or if the company fully funds the pension in a segregated account or if the pension is defined contribution but most corporate pensions are just a general promise to pay you later in the future with no real money actually set aside for that purpose so i 'd discount this in my planning somewhat fund stock selection generally speaking most investment literature agrees that you 're most likely to get the best risk adjusted returns over the long term by owning the entire market rather than betting on individual winners and losers since no one can predict the future including professional money managers as such i 'd recommend owning a low cost index fund over holding specific sectors or specific companies only remember that even if one sector is more profitable than another the stock prices already tend to reflect this concentration in it consultancy i am concerned that one third of your investable assets are currently in one company the it consultancy it 's very possible that you are right that it will continue to do well that is not my concern my concern is the risk you 're carrying that things will not go well again you are taking on risks not just over the next few years but over the next 30 or so years until you retire and even if it seems unlikely that this company will experience a downturn in the next few years it 's very possible that could change over a longer period of time please just be aware that there is a risk one way to mitigate that risk would be to work with an advisor or a fund to structure and investment plan where you invest in a variety of sector funds except for technology that way your overall portfolio including the single company will be closer to the market as a whole rather than over weighted in it tech however if this it consultancy happens to be the company that you work for i would strongly recommend yourself of those shares as soon as reasonably possible in my opinion the risk of having your salary pension and much of your investments tied up in the fortunes of one company would simply be a much larger risk than i 'd be comfortable with last make sure to keep learning so that you are making decisions that you 're comfortable with with the amount of savings you have most investment firms will consider you a high net worth client so make sure you are making decisions that are in your best financial interests not theirs again this is where a fee only financial advisor may be helpful you can find a local advisor at best of luck with your decisions

i 've done exactly what you say at one of my brokers   with the restriction that i have to deposit the money in the right way and i do n't do it too often   the broker is meant to be a trading firm and not a currency exchange house after all   i usually do the exchange the opposite of you so i do usd > gbp but that should n't make any difference i put right in quotes not to indicate there is anything illegal going on but to indicate the broker does put restrictions on transferring out for some forms of deposits     so the key is to not ach the money in nor send a check nor bill pay it but rather to wire it in   a wire deposit with them has no holds and no time limits on withdrawal locations   my us bank originates a wire i trade at spot in the opposite direction of you usd > gbp wait 2 days for the trade to settle then wire the money out to my uk bank   commissions and fees for this process are low   all told i pay about $ 20 usd per and get spot rates though it does take approx 3 trading days for the whole process assuming you do n't try to wait for a target rate but rather take market rate

it seems that counting your father as your dependent should n't in itself cause him to be ineligible for snap eligibility requirements for snap can be found on this page there are upper limits on the resources such as a bank account that the beneficiary 's household may have and on that household 's income there are some other requirements too from what i can tell from your question your father should n't be part of your household for snap purposes because everyone who lives together and purchases and prepares meals together is grouped together as one household if you 're transferring him money i assume he 's living and eating somewhere else so it seems you are not part of his household according to the irs 's publication 501 your father is not required to be part of your household for irs purposes to be your dependent the test to qualify is that a non child dependent must either live with you all year as a member of your household or be related to you in one of the ways listed under relatives who do not have to live with you however by the special rule for parent you may be able to use your father as your qualifying person dependent to be able to file as head of household so long as you pay more than half their support and more than half the cost of keeping up a home that was the main home for the entire year for your father i do n't know if in this case the irs would consider your father part of your household or not even if the irs considered your father part of your household based on the way you filed your taxes i think it 's possible as the irs and are two different entities that the definition of your father 's household for snap purposes could be different from the irs 's

most of the recommendations are just total market allocations   within domestic stocks the performance sometimes large cap outperform sometimes small cap outperform you can see the chart here examine year by year   conventional wisdom is to buy the entire market if large cap currently make up 80 of the market you would allocate 80 of domestic stocks to large cap   same case with international stocks developed if japan and uk make up the largest market internationally then so be it   similar case with domestic bonds it is usually total bond market allocation in the beginning   then there is the question of when you want to withdraw the money if you are withdrawing in a couple years you do not want to expose too much to currency risks thus you would allocate less to international markets if you are investing for retirement you will get the total world market   then there is the question of risk tolerance bonds are somewhat negatively correlated with stocks when stock dips by 5 in a month bonds might go up by 2 under normal circumstances they both go upward bond stock allocation ratio is by age i ’m sure you knew that already   then there is the case of modern portfolio theory there will be slight adjustments to the etf weights if it is found that adjusting them would give a smaller portfolio variance while sacrificing small gains you can try it yourself using excel solver   there is a strategy called sector rotation google it and you will find examples of the winners periodically it is difficult to time the rotation but healthcare has somehow consistently outperformed nonetheless those recommendations you mentioned are likely to be market allocations again   the robo advisors list out every asset allocation in detail to make you feel overwhelmed and resort to using their service in extreme cases they can even break down the holdings to digit standard industrial classification codes or break down the bond duration etc   some robo advisors would suggest you as many etf as possible to increase trade commissions if it is n’t commission free for example suggesting you to buy vb instead a vti

what you 're pretty systematically failing to appreciate is the pain felt by people during structural unemployment   yes they should get an education but guess what they 're probably too old for it to be worth or so far behind on the education ladder that it 'd be a real struggle   maybe they should move to a city where there are jobs but moving is expensive and so is living in a city   the libertarian arguments here have the same problem as the more extreme arguments about civil rights   yes the equilibrium will converge to a society without discrimination where people get educated because low skilled jobs do n't pay much anymore etc   but those arguments completely neglect the pain of getting from here to there   maybe you think the government always screws things up despite pretty glaring arguments to the contrary and maybe you think the free market always ends up with the most efficient solution despite some pretty glaring examples to the contrary but that still does n't mean that inefficient government programs that cost the future gdp whatever that means ca n't be an appropriate means of reducing the overall suffering of the populace in both the short and long term

this is an excellent topic as it impacts so many in so many different ways here are some thoughts on how the accounts are used which is almost as important as the as calculating the income or tax the roth is the best bang for the buck once you have taken full advantage of employer matched 401k.   yes you pay taxes upfront   all income earned is n't taxed under current tax rules   this money can be passed on to family and can continue forever   contributions can be funded past age 70.5   once account is active for over 5 years contributions can be withdrawn and used ie house down payment college medical bills without any penalties   all income earned must be left in the account to avoid penalties   for younger workers without an employer match this is idea given the income tax savings over the longer term and they are most likely in the lowest tax bracket the 401k is great for retirement which is made better if employer matches contributions   this is like getting paid for retirement saving   these funds are locked up until age 59.5 with exceptions   all contributed funds and all earnings are untaxed until withdrawn the idea here is that at the time contributions are added you are at a higher tax rate then when you expect to withdrawn funds trade accounts investments as stated before are the used of taxed dollars   the biggest advantage of these are the liquidity

first of all insurance never covers the cost of the item it is almost always a partial payout at best for example a typical house in the northeast us where i live that costs $ 300,000 will have the actual house valued at maybe $ and rest of the value will be in the land therefore the insured value will typically be $ 100,000 the only problem is that to actually rebuild the house might easily cost $ 250,000 so your idea that some kinds of insurance allows the beneficiary to recoup their loss is usually never true as you say from an actuarial point of view insurance is a sheer waste of money for example a typical house has maybe a 0.5 chance of burning down every year in other words out of 2000 houses maybe 1 will burn down every year so lets say you got $ 100,000 of insurance on your house then the value of that policy would be $ 100,000 2000 = $ 50 per year an insurance company will charge around $ 700 per year for the policy that means you are basically $ 650 down the toilet every year to maintain that policy the reason why they do this is what says above they are buying peace of mind a psychological product in other they imagine they are somehow safe so even though they are losing money paying it makes them feel as though they are not losing money it 's delusional but then again most people have a lot of delusions of which insurance is just one of many

a paycheck is simply a check for your salary   it 's just like a rent check or a birthday check or a grocery check   i 've had paychecks that were personal checks from the owner of the business i 've had ones that are printed in the office i worked in and signed right there and i 've had paychecks that are printed through a third party company and mailed to me my favorite of course is to forgo the paycheck entirely and get direct deposit   really they 're all just checks although that 's a little disingenuous because banks are often slightly more trusting of paychecks   however this has little to do with it being a paycheck per se and more to do with the fact that they see you getting the same check for roughly the same amount on a regular basis having seen you get a paycheck for the same amount from the same company for the last 12 months there is less risk of the check bouncing or being returned unpaid so you can often get banks to waive their hold policy and just give you the money

i think you can do it as long as those money do n't come from illegal activities money laundering etc the only taxes you should pay are on the interest generated by those money while sitting in the uk bank account since i suppose you already paid taxes on those money in greece while you were earning those money about being audited in my own experience banks do n't ask you much where your money are coming from when you bring money to them they are very willing to help and happy it 's a story when you ask to borrow money when i opened a bank account in us i did not even have an ssn but they did n't care much they just took my passport and used the passport number for registering the account obviously on the interest generated by the money in the us bank account i had to pay taxes but it was easy because i simply let the irs via the bank to the 27 on the interest generated not on the capital deposited i did n't put a huge amount of money there i had to live there for 1 year or some more maybe if i deposited a huge amount of money someone would have come to ask me how did i make all those money but those money were legally generated by me working in italy before so i did n't have anything to be afraid about btw in italy i was thinking to move money to a german bank in germany the risk of default is a nightmare something of new now in compared to the past where each state had its own currency according to muro history says that in case of default it happened that some government prevented people from withdrawing money form bank accounts yes historically governments have    shut down banks to prevent people from    withdrawing their money in times of    crisis see argentina circa 2001 or us    during great depression the    government prevented people from    withdrawing their money and people    could do nothing while their money    rapidly lost value but in case greece prevents people from money those money are still in euro so i 'm wondering what would be the effect i mean would it be fair that a greek guy can not withdraw is euro money an italian guy can withdraw the same currency money in italy

my theory is that for every stock you buy you should have an exit strategy and follow it   it is too hard to let emotions rule if you let your default strategy be let 's see what happens and emotional investing will almost never serve you well   so before buying a stock set a maximum loss and maximum gain that you will watch for on the stock and when it hits that number sell   at the very least when it hits one of your numbers consciously make a decision that you are effectively buying it again at the current price if you decide to stay in when you do this set a new high and low price and repeat the above strategy

the best answer i can give is be prepared for change there 's no perfect question you can ask or assurance you can get prior to accepting the offer that will give you any particularly perfect security or sense of stability here   the company itself is going through a change of identity that can change how it will do business and even what the business is and how revenue is acquired   in the time of the acquisition your role within the company could change radically for better or worse it could even be eliminated entirely if that type of uncertainty does n't appeal to you do n't take the position if you are absolutely about this job the best thing you can do is to learn more about the business itself and see if you can make any educated bets about how your role will play into the changes in business strategy that will come with the acquisition

what you are looking for is travel insurance i have never heard of this being offered as a credit card perk but there might be something out there   you can buy this separately but only you can decide if it is worth the costs to me it would seem to only be worth it for something quite expensive like a cruise that costs thousands of dollars the more you travel the less likely it is to be worth it since at some point the cost of one canceled trip is less than the insurance paid on the rest of the trips that went through fine as a frequent i recommend that you build some flexibility into your plans especially during the winter it is not always possible but try not to need to be somewhere the day of or the day after your flight   try to book flights early in the day as they are less likely to be delayed by problems in flights before them and you have more options for flight delays due to weather and mechanical problems are not uncommon and with generally full flights it is sometimes hard to be in a reasonable amount of time   finally be nice to the gate agents and other airline   in general they are n't any happier about delays than you are flight crews want to get home too and do n't have any power over weather or mechanical delays   being rude to them will not help and will make them less likely to go out of their way to find a solution be in asking for what you want but a smile and a kind word goes a long way

how will your employer treat your pay and benefits status while you 're on leave    disability income coverage and leave policies work in tandem to solve very different problems   disability income coverage covers your income leave policies guarantee your status as an employee    typically std coverage requires an actual loss of income and will offset it 's stated benefit for any income you 're receiving   in general you ca n't begin a std claim after the 7 day waiting period and also draw income from vacation or sick time   also typically std will cover some percentage of your covered pay sometimes including commission bonus income up to some weekly maximum requires employers to allow certain amounts of time for certain types of leave   is not necessarily an income replacement tool like std coverage    contrary to your post it 's my understanding that if sick and vacation time accrue in to a single pto bucket your employer is prohibited from requiring employees to exhaust accrued time prior to beginning leave in general you 're not missing anything because the point of is to guarantee your job and status as an employee from a benefits perspective benefits language from the department of labor website a covered employer is required to maintain group health insurance coverage including family coverage for an employee on leave on the same terms as if the employee continued to work

you can have a positive expected return on a lottery ticket purchase but only if the lottery requires all players to pick their own numbers and does n't have an option to buy a ticket with a randomly generated set of numbers this is because people are very bad at picking random numbers and will tend to pick numbers that are fairly evenly spaced or based on dates rather than genuinely random numbers for example in january 1995 the uk national lottery happened to have fairly well spaced numbers 7 17 23 32 38 42 and there were 133 winners with all six numbers so they way to win is to wait for a draw where a rollover jackpot is high enough that your expected winnings are positive if you are the only winner and pick a set of numbers that looks stupidly non random but is not so very non random that people will have picked it anyway like 1 2 3 4 5 6 for a pick 6 in the range from 1 49 lottery you might pick something like 3 42 43 44 48 49 but it does n't work if there 's a random option since a significant number of players will use it and get genuinely random numbers and so your chances of being the only winner get much smaller

nothing beats statistics like that found on morning star yahoo or google finance   when you are starting out there is no need to reinvent the wheel   pick a couple of mutual funds with good track records and start there    keep in mind the financial press to some degree has a vested interest in having their chase the next hot thing   so while sites like seeking alpha or money do provide some good advice there is also an element that their advertisers    the only peer to peer lending i would consider is lending club   however you are probably better off in the long run investing in mutual funds   one way to get involved in individual stocks without getting burned is to participate in dividend reinvestment plans drips   companies that have them tend to be very well established and they are structured to discourage trading   buying is easy dividend reinvestment is easy dividend payouts are easy but starting and selling   is kind of a pain   that is a good thing

i do n't think airbnb should be regulated in that way and look there are far fewer problems with airbnb than with hotels and and without the need of government intrusion why because airbnb 's reputation model works far better than the government will make everyone okay model i 've stayed at a lot of hotels and i would take any airbnb i 've stayed at over a hotel any day    airbnb is a perfect example of the free market working just fine the government is only wanting to get involved because of the hotel lobby hotels are a multi billion dollar industry and if anyone thinks that they are just going to bend over and take it from airbnb they they 're a fool they are fighting back with the use of native ads like this along with support from politicians who will sell out to any industry associations willing to line their campaign coffers    this is an industry fight it 's about old dying industries fighting the new economy and entrepreneurs    its nasty underhanded and full of lies cracked just totally lost me with this fake news

the answer is yes according to multiple online sources and my local bank this approach is a common technique to building your own home you finance the land build the simplest possible dwelling say a garage with 1 bathroom bedroom refi into a mortgage and get cash back and then build your real house or add on etc this eliminates the banks demands that come with a construction loan and saves you 10s of thousands in the process fees contractors scheduling design etc

does it mean uncontrolled severe deflation inflation is more likely to    occur compared to normal currencies such as usd eur etc look at the chart referenced in the link in your question   it took approximately 50 years for annual production of gold to double from 500 tons to 1000 tons   it took approximately 40 years for annual production to double from 1000 tons to 2000 tons compare that to the production of us dollars by the federal reserve see chart below obtained from here   us dollar production doubled in days   which one do you think will lead to uncontrolled inflation deflation update why did i include a chart of the fed 's balance sheet   because this is the way newly printed money is introduced the fed will purchase something from banks mortgage backed securities us treasuries etc with newly printed money   the banks can then loan this money to people who then deposit the money into other banks who loan those deposits to other people and so on   this is how the fractional reserve process expands the money supply   this is why i did not include a chart of the money supply since that is counting the same money multiple times   if i deposited 100 newly minted coins into a bank and that bank proceeded to loan out 80 of my coins where 80 are deposited into another bank who then proceeds to loan out 60 of the coins and so on the production of coins only changed by the initial 100 that i minted not by the fractional reserve multiple there are historical examples of inflation with gold and silver as duff has pointed out   none of them come close in magnitude to the inflation experienced with government fiat money

all new loans must be originated from the direct loan program in most cases the stafford loan is better as the rate is lower 6.8 vs. 7.9 for the plus loan there are n't many viable alternatives for most people   private student loans exist but carry significantly higher rates and worse payment terms the exceptions are programs that exist for professions like medicine and dentistry credit cards usually carry higher rates and limited credit lines but you have the option of negotiating the balance down or declaring bankruptcy to discharge the debt if you are unable to repay

i think the answer to your question is no in theory by screening out funds you must actively manage the investments to then try to ensure you track the index closely enough you have to do further management either you spend your own time to do this or you pay someone else   this is ok but it seems contrary to the primary reasons most people choose an index fund and why the product exists you want a specific type of ethical that has lower fees and performs well i think you can get close it just wo n't be like an index fund do n't expect equal results

whether it 's wise or not depends on what you think and what you should consider are the risks both ways what are the risks for let 's say that the company produces great value and its current price and initial price are well below what it 's worth   by investing some of your money in the company you can take advantage of this value and capitalize off of it if the market recognizes this value too or when the market does if it 's a successful company it will be a matter of when other reasons to be for it are that the tech industry is considered a solid industry and a lot of money is flowing into it   therefore if this assumption is correct you may assume that your job is safe even if your investment does n't pay off meaning you do n't lose income but your investment may not be a great move against let 's say that you dump a lot of money into your company and invest in the stock   you 're being paid by the company you 're taking some of that money and investing it in the company meaning that depending on how much you make outside the company you are increasing your risk of loss if something negative happens to the company ie it fails other reasons to be against it are just the opposite as above due to the nsa some analysts like mish zerohedge and others think that the world will cut back on doing it business with the united states thus the tech industry will take a major hit over the next decade   in addition to that jesse colombo on twitter is predicting that there 's another tech bubble and it will make a mess when it pops to be fair to colombo he was one of analysts who predicted the housing bubble and his predictions on trading are often right finally there is a risk of lost money and there is also a risk of lost opportunity   looking at your past investments which generally hurt more   that might give you a clue what to do

how do you know the shares will go up after you buy the ultimate risk in your scenario is that you buy at a peak and then that peak is never reached again over time stock markets go up more or less because there is a net increase in the overall production of the economy as time goes on however you wo n't experience much of that gain because you will be selling only after tiny amounts of profit have been achieved so your upside is low your plan is capital expensive because it requires you to have significant amount of cash available to make the initial purchase and your downside though unlikely has massive risk

well first off i would advice you to do this research yourself you should not base your selection off someone 's opinion such as mines   with that being said these are some factors i suggest you consider and research before talking to an offshore bank account now when opening an offshore account most offshore banks do not require you to be present at all you can open an account simply by calling them or filling out their application online however be prepared to provide them with some information to verify who you are and the nature of your business such as a notarized passport along with other various forms of information that they may require just think of what your local bank requires is generally what they will ask as well here is a compiled list of offshore bank accounts to consider these banks overall have a range between $ 0 $ 1 million domestic currency minimum deposits most of them ranging from $ it all depends on the type of account the nature of the account and the business associated with the account

with your windfall you 've been given a second chance you 've become debt free again and get to start over here is what i would recommend from this point on decide that you want to remain debt free it sounds like you 've already done this since you are asking this question commit to never borrowing money again it sounds overly simplistic but if you stop using your credit cards to spend money you do n't have and you do n't take out any loans you wo n't be in debt   learn to budget here is what is going to make being debt free possible at the beginning of each month you are going to write down your income for the month then write down your expenses for the month make sure you include everything you 'll have fixed monthly expenses like rent and variable monthly expenses like electricity and phone you 'll also have ongoing expenses like food transportation and entertainment you 'll have some expenses like tuition which does n't come up every month but is predictable and needs to be paid for these you 'll can set aside part of the money for the expense each month and when the bill comes you 'll have the funds to pay it ready to go using budgeting software such as ynab which i recommend will make this whole process much easier you are allowed to change your plan if you need to at any time but do not allow yourself to spend any money that is not in the plan   take action to address any issues that become apparent from your budget as you do your budget you will probably struggle at first you will find that you do n't have enough income to cover your expenses fortunately you are now armed with data to be able to tackle this problem there are two causes either your expenses are too high or your income is too low   cut your expenses if necessary before you had a written budget it was hard to know where your money went each month now that you have a budget it might be apparent that you are spending too much on food or that you are spending too much on entertainment or even that a roommate is stealing money do what you need to do to cut back the expenses that need cutting   increase your income if necessary you might find from your budget that your expenses are n't out of line you live in as cheap a place as possible you eat you do n't go out to eat etc in this case the problem is n't your spending it is your income in order to stay out of debt you 'll need to increase your income get a job i know that you said that this will slow your studies but because you are now budgeting you have an advantage you did n't have before you now know how short you are each month you can take a part time job that will earn you just enough income to remain debt free while maximizing your study time   build up a small emergency fund emergencies that you did n't plan for in your budget happen to remain debt free you should have some money set aside to cover something like this so you do n't have to borrow when it comes up the general rule of thumb is 3 to 6 months of expenses but as a college kid with low expenses and no family to take care of you wo n't need a huge fund $ 500 to $ 1000 extra in the bank to cover an unexpected emergency expense could be all it takes to keep you debt free

short answer go to the bank and ask them about your options for opening a business account talk to an attorney about the paperwork and company structure and taxes long answer you and your buddies jointly own an unincorporated business this is called a partnership yes there is paperwork involved in doing it properly and the fact that you guys are minors might complicate that paperwork a little bit in terms of what type of account to open a business account running a business through a personal account joint or otherwise is a sure way to get that account shut down your bank will want to know the structure of the business and will require documentation to support that for a partnership they will probably want a copy of the partnership agreement for an llc they 'll probably want a copy of the filing with ohio secretary of state as well as the operating agreement etc that said pop into a local bank and ask a business banker directly what you should do they deal with new businesses all the time and would probably be best qualified to help you figure out the bank account aspect of it regarding business structure this really impacts a lot more than just the type of bank account to open and how you file your taxes it is something you guys should really discuss with an attorney what happens if down the road one of you quits what happens if you want to bring in a new partner later   what if there is a disagreement about something   these are all things that the attorney can help you address ahead of time which is a heck of a lot easier and cheaper than trying to figure it out later you 're in enough that you should certainly be able to buy a couple hours of a lawyer 's time getting the formation stuff right could save all of you a lot of money and later

the problem i have with gold is that it 's only worth what someone will pay you for it   to a degree that 's true with any equity but with a company there are other capital resources etc that provide a base value for the company and generally a business model that generates income gold just sits there it does n't make products it does n't perform services you ca n't eat it and the main people making money off of it are the folks charging a not commission to sell it to you or buy it back   sure it 's used in small quantities for things like plating electrical contacts dental work shielding etc but industrial uses account for only 10 of consumption   mostly it 's just hoarded either in the form of jewelry 50 or investment bullion coins 40   its value derives largely from rarity and other than the last few years there 's no track record of steady growth over time like the stock market or real estate just look at what gold prices did between 10 to 30 years ago i 'm not sure it came anywhere near close to keeping pace with inflation during that time   if you look at the chart you see a steady price until the us went off the gold standard in 1971 and rules regarding ownership and trading of gold were relaxed   there was a brief run up for a few years after that as the market found its level as it were and you really need to look from about 74 forward which it experienced its first test and demonstration of a supporting price around inflation adjusted   then the price fluctuated largely between 800 to 400 per ounce adjusted for inflation for the next 30 years other than a brief sympathetic silver tuesday spike due to the hunt brothers manipulation of silver prices in 1980   not sure if there is any causality but it is interesting to note that the recent in price starts in 2000 at almost the same time the last country the swiss went off the gold standard and gold was no longer tied to any currency or versa    if you bought in 75 as a hedge against inflation you were down as much as 50 during much of the next 33 years   if you managed to buy at a low the couple of times that gold was going down and found support around adjusted then you were on average up slightly as much as a little over 50 throwing out silver tuesday but then from about 98 through 05 had barely broken even   i personally view investments in gold at this time as a speculation   look at the history below and ask yourself if buying today would more likely end up as buying in 1972   or 1975 or gods forbid 1980   would you be taking advantage of a buying opportunity or piling onto a bubble and end up buying at the high   note from joe the article demand and supply adds to the discussion and supports chuck 's answer

with trillion dollar plus deficits it 's not like we 're running an austerity program here   when you say sacrifice compared to what   two trillion dollar deficits    your observation of constant predictions of imminent doom is valid the timeline has been extended by a series of market housing fiscal deficits   the shortcoming of doom is that they underestimate the willingness of those in power to do whatever it takes to prolong the status quo regardless of the long term consequences    the game is perpetuated by ever increasing debt and government became the borrower of last resort once the rest of the economy was tapped out   the govt 's ability to continue along this course in the open market is questionable as the fed appears to be monetizing a large portion of newly issued debt   the end game is a currency crisis   it 's nice to have a timeline accompanying a prediction and critical for investing but it is often very difficult to do and in this case it has been extremely difficult because the policy decisions have been rational from the perspective of elites maintaining their status but not optimal from the standpoint of solving the problem   that does n't mean the predictions are useless though   you could live in a flood zone and not be able to predict with accuracy when the next flood will occur but that does n't mean you should n't prepare   given the uncertainty with timing this it seems to me the best course of action is not to try to time it especially with respect to investing based on market timing but to prepare the best you can for what will inevitably eventually occur

since most developed countries view a low but positive inflation rate as ideal it is very likely that we will end up with positive inflation   however modern societies such as japan have experienced extraordinarily long periods of deflation   in their case however it is mostly due to a political unwillingness to impose the costs on savers as savers are politically in control as to your point about things being so much cheaper in our grandparents days this is actually completely untrue for the vast majority of goods when measured in real terms e.g. relative to the median workers wages   today a decent bicycle can be bought with the average worker 's earnings over a few days whereas our grandparents would have had to work over a month   a modern radio can be bought for perhaps an hours worth of work $ 10 on amazon.com but our grandparents may have had to spend months working to buy their first radio   there is no reason for this trend not to continue point is inflation is not such a bad thing so long as wage growth keeps up or exceeds it

what are sick days what if you 're sick beyond those 10 days you do n't get paid what about those 10 sick days you do have to hand in a doctors note or something is there any compensation if you do n't take any sick days   europe here we have no such thing as sick days you can be ill as much as you want and many people take multiple weeks eventually you will get fired i guess but as a person who has n't taken a single sick day in the past year the whole thing kinda bothers me as i am doing the work of the sick people every time

rule of thumb is always buy never lease unless you plan to use it for a business where you can expense the lease payments leasing is the biggest scam   lease is just a fancy word for renting and the dealerships pray that people like us lease as for new or old new cars have better warranty but you may get a great deal on a 1 3 year old used car

a tax liability account is a common thing in my own books i track us based social insurance medicare and social security using such an account   at the time i pay an employee a tax liability is incurred increasing my tax liability account at the same time on the other end of the double entry i increase a tax expense account notably though the us irs does not necessarily require that the tax is paid at the time it is incurred   in my case i incur a liability twice a month but i only have to pay the taxes quarterly   so between the time of incurring and the time of remitting paying the amount is held in the tax liability account   at the time that i remit payment to the irs the transaction will decrease both my checking account and also on the other end of the double entry my liability account to answer your question in short use an expense account for your other side account

this is not an end all answer but it 'll get you started i have been through accounting courses in college as well as worked as a contractor files as sole proprietor for a few years but i am not an accountant following 's answer if you 're making that much money you should hire a bean counter to at least overlook your bookkeeping what type of business first if you 're the sole owner of the business you will most likely file as a sole proprietorship if you do n't have an official business entity you should get it registered officially asap and file under that name the problem with sole proprietorships is liability if you get sued not only are your business assets vulnerable but they can go after your personal assets too including house cars etc legally you and your business are considered one and the same to avoid liability issues you could setup a s corporation basically the business is considered it 's own entity and legal matters can only take as much as the business owns you gain more protection but if you do n't explicitly keep your business finances separate from your personal finances you can get into a lot of trouble also corporations generally pay out more in taxes technically since the business is it 's own entity you 'll need to pay yourself a reasonable salary if you skip the salary and pay yourself the profits directly ie evade being taxed on income salary the irs will shut you down that 's one of the leading causes of corporations being shut down you can also pay distribute bonuses on top of that but it would be wise to burn the words within reason into your memory first the tax man gets mad if you short him on payroll taxes   s corporations are complicated if you go that route definitely seek help from an accountant bookkeeping if you 're not willing to pay a full time accountant you 'll need to do a lot of studying about how this works generally even if you have a sole proprietorship it 's best to have a separate bank account for all of your business transactions every source drain of money will fall into one of 3 categories assets what your business owns assets can be categorized by liquidity meaning how fast you can transform them directly into cash just because a company is worth a lot does n't necessarily mean it has a lot of cash some assets depreciate lose value over time whereas some are very hard to transform back into cash based on the value and/or market fluctuations like property liabilities what you owe others and what others owe you everything you owe and everything that is owed to you gets tracked just like credit cards it 's completely possible to owe more than you own as long as you can pay the interest to maintain the loans equity the net worth of the company the approach they commonly teach in schools is called double entry bookkeeping where they use the equation in practice i prefer the following because it makes more sense basically if you account for everything correctly both sides of the equation should match up if you choose to go the sole proprietorship route it 's smart to track everything i 've mentioned above but you can choose to keep things simple by just looking at your equity equity the heart of your business basically every transaction you make having to do with your business can be simplified down to debits money value increasing and credits money value decreasing for a very simple company you can assess this by looking at net profits which can be calculated with revenues are made up of money earned by services performed and goods sold expenses are made up of operating costs materials payroll consumables interest on liabilities etc basically if you brought in 250 k but it cost you 100 k to make that happen you 've made 150 k for the year in profit so for your taxes you can count up all the money you 've made revenues subtract all of the money you 've paid out expenses and you 'll know how much profit you 've made the profit is what you pay taxes on the kicker is there are gray areas when it comes to deducting expenses for instance you can deduct the expense of using your car for business but you need to keep a log and can only expense the miles you traveled explicitly for business same goes for deducting dedicated in your house basically do the research if you 're not 100 sure about a deduction if you do n't keep detailed books and try to expense stuff without proof you can get in trouble if the irs comes knocking there are always mythical stories about that one guy who wrote off his boat on his taxes but in reality you can go to jail for tax fraud if you do that it comes down to this at the end of the year if your business took in a ton of money you 'll owe a lot in taxes the better you can justify your expenses the more you can reduce that debt one last thing you 'll also have to pay your personal federal state taxes including self employment tax that means medicare social security etc if this is your first into self employment you 're probably not familiar with the fact that 1099 employers pick up 1/2 of the 15 medicare social security bill typically if you have an idea of what you make annually you should be paying this out throughout the year my pay as a contractor was always erratic so i usually paid it out once twice a year it 's better to pay too much than too little because the gov't will give you back the money you overpaid at the end of the day paying taxed sucks more if you 're self employed but it balances out because you can make a lot more money if as you said you 've broken six figures hire a damn accountant adviser to help you out and start reading when people say a business degree will help you advance in any field it 's subjects like accounting are core requirements to become a business undergrad if you do n't have time for more school and do n't want to pay somebody else to take care of it there 's plenty of written material to learn it on your own it 's not rocket surgery just basic arithmetic and a lot of business jargon ie almost as much as technology

i gather that while it is not illegal for a merchant to pass their payment card processing fees on to their customers directly in the form of a surcharge doing so is a violation of their merchant agreements with the payment card processor at least for visa mc it 's not has been permissible since 2013 as a result of a class action lawsuit against visa and mc it 's still prohibited by state law in 9 states   if you 're in one of those 9 states you can contact your state attorney general to report it if you 're not you can check to see if the business is complying with the rules set forth by the card brands which include signage at the point of sale a separate line item for the surcharge on the receipt a surcharge that does n't exceed 4 of the transaction etc and if they 're in violation contact the card company however some of those rules seem to matter to the card companies more than others and it 's entirely possible they wo n't do anything in which case there 's nothing you can really do

venezuela is a command economy and one that is n't doing terribly well right now with rampant inflation in the several hundred percent range   as such they 've tried to limit or eliminate exchanges between their currency and foreign currencies currently they allow a limited amount of exchange at fixed rates according to a bloomberg article those vary between 6.3 13.5 and 200 for certain purchases and then otherwise disallow exchange between the currencies   however there is a black market illegal in venezuela but legal in the us which allows the price to float and is much higher 800 or so according to that article from last year   a recent article lists the black market rate at closer to 900 and slightly different official rates   it 's worth a read as it explains the different official rates in detail currently there are four exchange rates first is the official one    called and which charges to the dollar it is    only intended for the of food and medicine the next two exchange rates are i 12 per dollar and    2 50 per dollar they assign dollars to enterprises    that import all other types of goods because of the fact that us    dollars are limited coupons are auctioned only usually    weekly in the case of 1 and daily for 2 however due to    the economic crisis no dollars have been allocated for these foreign    exchange transactions and there has n’t been an auction since august    18 2015 as of november 2015 the venezuelan government held only $ 16    billion in foreign exchange reserves the lowest level in over ten    years and an amount that will dry up completely in four years time at    the current rate of the last and newest exchange rate is the currently at 200    per dollar this rate is reserved for the purchase and sale    of foreign currency to individuals and businesses

everything that i 'm saying presumes that you 're young and wo n't need your money back for 20 + years and that you 're going to invest additional money in the future your first investments should never be individual stocks that is far too risky until you have a lot more experience in the market once you absolutely ca n't resist keep it to under 5 of your total investments that lets you experiment without damaging your returns too much instead you would want to invest in one or more mutual funds of some sort which spreads out your investment across many companies with only $ 50 avoiding a trading commission is paramount if you were in the us i would recommend opening a free online brokerage account and then purchasing a no load commission free mutual fund td ameritrade for example publishes a list of the funds that you can purchase without commission the lists generally include the type of fund index growth value etc and its record of return i do n't know if europe has the same kind of discount brokerages mutual funds the us has but i 'd be a little surprised if it did n't you may or may not be able to invest until you first scrape together a $ 500 minimum but the brokerages often have special programs accounts for people just starting out it should be possible to ask one more thing on picking a fund most charge about a 1 annual expense ratio that means that a $ 100 investment that had a 100 gain after one year would net you $ instead of $ 200 because 1 of the value of your asset $ 200 is $ 2 the math is much more complicated and depends on the value of your investment at every given point during the year but that 's the basic idea however there are index funds that track the market automatically and they can have much lower expense fees 0.05 vs 1 for the same quality of performance over 40 years the expense ratio can have a surprisingly large impact on your net return even 20 or more you 'll want to google separately about the right way to pick a low expense index fund your online brokerage may also be able to help finally ask friends or family what mutual funds they 've invested in how they chose those funds and what their experience has been the point is not to have them tell you what to do but for you to learn from the mistakes and successes of other experienced investors with whom you can follow up

yes there is regulation in place see here quote from the page instant access savings accounts    as with current accounts if a bank is to reduce the interest rate on an instant access savings account it generally has to give two notice other savings accounts    to change the interest rate on other savings    accounts such as those with a notice period and cash isas a bank    should give you reasonable notice that it intends to make a material    a reduction is consider to be if you have £ 500 or more in    your account and the interest rate falls by more than 0.25 at one    time or by 0.5 or more over 12 months this should give you enough time to move your money to another    account without penalty if you are not happy with the reduced rate

with a match the 401(k becomes the priority up to that match often ahead of other high interest debt   without the match the analysis is more about the cost within the 401(k the 401(k is a tax deferred account let 's not go on a tangent to roth 401(k so ideally you 'd be skimming off money at 25 and saving it till you retire so some of it is taxed at 0 10 15 if the fees in the 401(k are say 1.5 between the underlying funds and management fee it does n't take long to wipe out the potential 10 or 15 you are trying to gain   yes there 's a risk that cap gain rates go away but with today 's tax law the long term rate is 15 so that money put into a long term low cost etf will have reinvested dividends taxed at 15 and upon sale a 15 rate on the gains there are great index etfs with sub .1 annual cost   my simple answer is if the total cost in that 401(k is .5 or higher i 'd pass save the money in an outside account using iras as best you can   the exact situation needs to be looked at very carefully in personal finance there 's a lot of grey for example a frequent job changer can view the 401(k as a way of saving pretax knowing the fee will only last 2 years and will end with a transfer to the ira

companies with existing borrowings where borrowings are on variable interest rates or in the case with fixed interest rates companies that get new borrowings would pay less interest on these borrowings so their cost will go down and profits up making them more attractive to investors   so in general lower interest rates will make the share market a more attractive investment than some alternatives as investors are willing to take on more risk for potentially higher returns this will usually result in the stock market rising as it is currently in the us edit the case for rising interest rates a central bank 's purpose when raising interest rates is to slow down an economy that is booming as interest rates rise consumers will tighten up their spending and companies will thus have less revenue on top of higher costs for maintaining existing borrowing with variable rates or new borrowing with fixed rates if rates are higher companies may also defer new borrowings to expand their business this will eventually lead to lower profits and lower valuation for these companies another thing that happens is that as banks start increasing interest for saving accounts investors will look for safety where they can get a higher return than before without the risk of the stock market   with lowering profits and valuations and investor 's money flowing out of shares and into the money market so will company share prices drop although this may lag a bit with the share market still booming due to greed but once the boom stops for the crash

there is no fundamental good reason i think that 's just how it 's done which is what all the other answers seem to be saying w/o coming out and admitting it just guessing but i 'll bet most of the reason is historical before up to the moment quotes were readily available that was a bit tedious to calculate update the fund 's value so enacted laws let it be done just once per day   quotes the security act of 1940 which certainly has been updated but also still might contain the results of like this there are genuinely different issues between funds and stocks though one share of a fund is fundamentally different from one share of stock there is a finite supply of company x stock and people are trading that piece of ownership around and barter to find an mutually agreeable price   but when you buy into a mutual fund the mutual fund suddenly has more shares it takes your money and uses it to buy shares of the underlying stocks in a ratio equal to its current holdings   as a consequence the mutual fund 's price is n't determined by two people bartering and agreeing on a price like stock there is exactly one sane way to price a mutual fund and that 's the weighted total of its underlying stock   if you wanted to sell your ownership of mutual fund z to a friend at there would n't be any bartering you 'd just calculate the value based on the stated value of the underlying stock at that exact moment so there 's no inherent reason you ca n't instantaneously price a mutual fund   but people do n't really buy sell funds to each other they go to the fund manager and essentially make a deposit or withdraw   the fund manager is only required by law to do it once a day and perhaps even forbidden from doing it more often so that 's all they do disclaimer i know very little about markets and finance but i recognize answers that are just because

i love john 's answer but i just ca n't help myself from adding my 2 cents even though it 's over 5 years later i sold cars for a while in the late 90s and i mostly agree with john 's answer where i disagree though is that where i worked the salesperson did not have any authority to make a sale a sales manager was required to sign off on every sale that does n't mean that the manager had to interact with the buyer that could all be handled behind the scenes but the pricing and even much of the negotiating strategies were dictated by the sales managers some of the seasoned salespeople would estimate numbers on their own but occasionally you 'd hear the managers still chew them out with i wish you would n't have said that of course every dealership is different additional purchase advice there is a strategy that can work well for the buyer but only in scenarios where the salesperson is trying to prevent you from leaving they may start you as you are packing up or blocking your path to the door or even begging if this happens they are obviously desperate for whatever reason in this case if you came prepared with research on a good price that you are comfortable with then shoot lower and hold firm to the point of near exhaustion not so low that that they realize you 're too far they will let you leave at that point it needs to be within a reasonable amount perhaps at most 1 2 of the purchase price once you detect the salesperson is desperate you finally move up to your goal number or possibly a little lower typically the salesperson will be so happy to have gotten you to move at all that they 'll accept and if the managers are fed up too like 45 minutes after close they 'll accept too i saw this happen multiple times in a high pressure scenario i also used it once myself as a buyer if you are planning to purchase options that can be added at the dealer rather than from the factory keep them up your sleeve at first get your negotiations down to where you are a little further apart than the invoice price of the option then make your move for example suppose the option you want for $ 350 with an invoice of $ 300 get within about $ 400 of the dealer then offer to pay their price but only if they throw in the option you want this will throw them completely off guard because they did n't expect it and all of their calculations were based on without it if they say yes you effectively moved $ 100 and they moved $ 300 it 's much more likely that they 'll agree to this than taking $ 300 off the price of the car i 'm guessing the reason for this is partially due to how their accounting works with sticker price vs aftermarket price and partially psychological note this works best with new cars and make sure you only do this if it 's for items they can add after the fact even if they do n't have the part in stock it 's ok they can give you an iou but if the option requires a car change to something they do n't have on the lot it will probably just make them mad

as @mbhunter says make sure you pay off any debt you have first   then it 's a good idea to keep some or all of your savings as an emergency fund   if you use every last dime to pay for a house you 'll have no cushion available when something breaks down   the most common recommendation i 've seen is to have 3 6 months worth of expenses as an emergency fund   once you have that then you can start saving for your down payment    as @victor says try to find the best interest rate you can for that money but i would n't invest it in any kind of stock or bond product because your need for it is too short term   safety is more important than growth given your time frame when you 're ready to invest make sure you learn all you can   you do n't want to invest in something you do n't understand because that 's how you get ripped off   you can be reading and talking to people while you 're saving for your house so that when the time comes you 'll have a pretty good idea of what you want to do for investments

there is no distribution limit only a contribution limit   you can empty your hsa completely without tax or penalty as long as the expenses are used for eligible medical expenses in addition you can reimburse yourself in the future for expenses that you have now as long as you have an hsa account in place   for example you said that your dental bill was $ 3500 and you only had $ 3300 in your hsa so you emptied your hsa and paid the rest from your checking account   when you do get more money in the hsa even if it is n't until next year you can reimburse yourself for the $ 200 that you had to pay out of pocket on your dental bill   and if you do n't have enough money in your hsa this year to cover all of your birth expenses congrats by the way you can reimburse yourself in a future year just make sure you keep good records on what the distributions were used for in case you get audited

you have to read some appeals court cases see as well as sec enforcement actions on to get an understanding of how the sec operates there are court created guidelines for how insider trading would be proven there is no clear line but it is the emergency asset freezing your assets if you nailed a lucrative trade you really want to avoid and this is often times enforced reported by the brokers themselves since the sec does not have the resources to monitor every account 's trading activities there are some thin lines such as having your lawyer file a lawsuit and as soon as it is filed it is technically public so you short the recipient 's stock or having someone in a court room updating you on case developments as soon as possible so you can make trades although this may just be actually public depending on the court but the rules create the opportunities also consider that the united states is the most strict country in this regard there are tons of capital markets and the ideals or views of illegal insider trading compared to having reached a level of society where you are privileged to obtain this information vary across the board contains charts of countries where an existing insider trading prohibition is actually enforced finally consider some markets that do n't include equities as trading on an information advantage is only applicable to things the sec regulates and there are plenty of things that agency does n't regulate so trying to reverse engineer the sec may not be the most optimal use of energy

if you 're looking for some formula i do n't think one exists people talk about this all the time and give conflicting advice if there was a proven accurate formula they would n't be debating it there are basically 3 reasons to do a home improvement project a correct a problem so that you prevent on going damage to your home for example have a leaking roof or replaced or such a job is worthwhile if the cost of fixing the problem is less than the cost of future damage in the case of my termite and leaking roof examples this is almost always worth doing lesser maintenance problems might be more debatable similarly some improvements may reduce expenses like replacing an old furnace with a newer model may cut your heating bills here the question is how long does it take to repay the investment compared to other things you might invest your money in just to make up numbers suppose you find that a new furnace will save you $ 500 per year if the new furnace costs $ 2000 then it will take 4 years to pay for itself i 'd consider that a good investment if that same $ 2000 furnace will only cut your heating bills by $ 100 per year then it will take 20 years to pay for itself you 'd probably be better off putting the $ 2000 into the stock market and using the gains to help pay your heating bill b increase the resale value of your home if you are paying someone else to do the work the harsh reality here is almost no job will increase the resale value by more than the cost of getting the job done i 've seen many articles over the years citing studies on this i think most conclude that kitchen remodeling comes closet to paying for itself and bathrooms come next new windows are also up there i do n't have studies to prove this but my guesses would be replacing something that is basically nice with a different style will rarely pay for itself like replacing oak cabinets with cherry cabinets replacing something that is in terrible shape with something decent is more likely to pay back than replacing something decent with something beautiful like if you have an old iron that 's and falling apart replacing it may pay off if you have a 5-year old that 's in good shape but is not premium top of the line replacing it with a premium will probably do very little for resale value if you can do a lot of the work yourself the story changes many home improvement jobs do n't require a lot of materials but do require a lot of work if you do the labor you can often get the job done very cheaply and it 's likely that the increase in resale value will be more than what you spend for example most of my house has hardwood floors lots of people like pretty hardwood floors i just the floors in two rooms it cost me i do n't know maybe $ 20 or $ 30 for stain and some i 'm sure if i tried to sell the house tomorrow i 'd get my twenty bucks back in higher sale value realtors often advise sellers to paint again if you do it yourself the cost of paint may be a hundred dollars and it can increase the sale price of the house by thousands of course if you do the work yourself you have to consider the value of your time c to make your home more pleasant to live in this is totally subjective you have to make the decision on the same basis that you decide whether anything that is not essential to survival is worth buying to some people a bottle of fancy imported wine is worth thousands even millions of dollars others ca n't tell the difference between a $ 10,000 wine and a $ 15 wine   the thing to ask yourself is how important is this home improvement to me compared to other things i could do with the money like suppose you 're considering spending $ 20,000 remodeling your kitchen what else could you do with $ 20,000 you could buy a car go on an elaborate vacation eat out several times a week for years retire a little earlier etc no one can tell you how much something is worth to you any given home improvement may involve a combination of these factors like say you 're considering that $ 20,000 kitchen remodeling say you somehow find out that this will increase the resale value by $ 15,000 if the only reason you were considering it was to increase resale value then it 's not worth it you 'd lose $ 5,000 but if you also want the nicer kitchen then it is fair to say okay it will cost me $ 20,000 but ultimately i 'll get $ 15,000 of that back so in the long run it will only cost me $ 5,000 is having a nicer kitchen worth $ 5,000 to me note by the way that resale value only matters if and when you sell the house if you expect to stay in this house for 20 years any improvements done are very long term investments if you live in it until you die the resale value may matter to your heirs

i was in a similar situation about a year ago and the thing to do would be to remove your grandfather from the title   he would probably have to agree with this but i think he will if you approach it correctly in my case i was the cosigner for my son 's car loan and was told by the dealer that i had to be on the title   this is not true as far as virginia is concerned illinois may be different   i know this because when my son dropped his auto insurance i got the fine for having an uninsured vehicle and was told during the hearing that the dealer was mistaken it all worked out in the end but all we had to do was go down to the dmv and get my name taken off of the title i 'm sure if you approach it this way you do not want him to be responsible for things that you do who would get sued if you caused an accident he would agree to have his name removed from the title

i 'll add a little to the already great advice here it certainly sounds like you are in need of consolidation here having 11 different cards for your attention sounds like a nightmare to manage i also concur that it is a bad idea to cash out your retirement accounts to deal with this i know it 's frustrating to have the debt hanging over your head i have student loans i 'm personally working on but getting a loan to consolidate that level of noise sounds like a much smarter move that can help greatly if you have high interest cards most likely the case here since you mentioned that you are not interested in selling the house have you considered a home equity loan to consolidate this best of luck to you

if your requirements are hard must have $ 1000/month must have the same or bigger in capital at the end stocks are a poor choice of investment however in many cases people are willing to tolerate some level of risk to achieve the expected returns you also do not mention inflation which can take quite a lot out of your portfolio over the course of ten years if we make some simplifying assumptions you want to generate $ 12,000 a year you can realistically expect the whole stock market long term i.e. over time periods substantially longer than 10 years to return approximately 4 5 after factoring in inflation that means an investment of $ 240,000 $ 300,000 the math is simplified somewhat here if you do n't care about inflation you can up the percentage rather somewhat according to this article the s&p 500 returned an average of from through 2010 not factoring in inflation which would require an investment of approximately $ but this opens you up to substantial risk the stock market may go down 30 this year according to the above article the s&p returned only from 2001 to 2010 long term it goes up but your investment case is really to investing in an index to the entire stock market given your requirements you may be better suited investing primarily in stable bonds or perhaps a mix of bonds and stocks alternatively you may want to consider even more stable investments such as treasury notes treasury notes are all but guaranteed but with a lousy rate of return heck you could consider a gic that may be canada only or even a savings account there 's also the possibility of purchasing an annuity though almost everyone will advise against such personally i 'd go for a mutual fund which invested approximately 70 bonds and the rest in stocks over such a time period something like ing direct 's balanced income portfolio if you were in canada it substantially lowers your expected return but also lowers your risk i ca n't honestly say what the expected return there is at this point it 's returned 4 per year before inflation but has been around only since the beginning of 2008 and to be clear this is absolutely not free of risk

if this is in the united states there are laws governing business behavior when they have recorded expenses checks bills etc which are never withdrawn or deposited   a business is required to turn over these funds after a certain time frame to the state government as a part of their business tax cycle   one these laws vary in age by state and 13 years is a long time   you might still be out of luck for an amount so old there are even businesses which have up to search for lost money for a fee of course that your great uncle might have left behind and which now sits in a government holding account somewhere   it 's not necessary to go through the third parties though because the united states posts this information for the world to see   a good starting place is unclaimed money tool do as much legwork there as you can   you could even attempt to contact the former employer you said the business accounts still exist and in a very friendly non manner ask them what their procedures are and would have happened to your paycheck funds   as others have stated they are under no legal obligation whatsoever to fix your problem for you but who knows you could get lucky and they might voluntarily help you out   you 're looking for information not cash so patience and understanding are your tools if all else fails you could try one of these 3rd party services   here you run into diminishing returns as paying fees to search for money which might not exist just puts you further in the red

this is a reasonable requirement which many banks probably have the reason is that after you deposit a check ach or direct deposit they may be reversed after a couple of days check bounced payment canceled etc if you wire the money out and then the check by which you got the money gets bounced the bank is left hanging because money wired out is very hard to return wire transfers are generally irreversible unless its a mistake in the wire   after 10 days these transactions can not be reversed and the money is bound to remain on the account so you can wire it out by the way it also goes for cashier 's checks as well i had a similar discussion with my banker do n't remember if it was wf or chase when i needed one based on a ach transfer from my savings account elsewhere they gave me the check but said that its because i proved that the transfer was from my own account

i am a bit confused here as to how a 4 k loan will negatively effect your credit score if payments are made on time   fico scores are based upon how well you borrow   if you borrow pay back on time your score will not go down   perhaps a bit in the short run when you first secure the loan but that should come back quickly   in the long run it will help improve your score which seems like it would be more important to you having the provider finance your loan will probably not show up on your credit unless you fail to pay and they send to collections if the score is so important to you which i think is somewhat unwise then use a credit card   with a 750 you should be able to get a pretty good rate but assume it is 18   in less then 9 months you will have it paid off paying about $ in interest   you could consider that a part of the cost of doing business for maintaining a high credit score   again not what i would advise but it might meet your needs one alternative is go with lending club   with that kind of score you are looking at 7 or so   at $ 500 a month you are still looking at just over 8 months and paying about $ 100 in interest   much less money for improving your credit score edit based upon the comment my understanding is that using a significant portion of your available credit balance is bad for your credit even if you pay your bills on time define bad   as i said it might go down slightly in the short term   in three months you will have almost 33 of the loan paid off which is significantly lower then the original balance   if you go the credit card route you may be approved for quite a bit more then the 4000 which may not move the needle at all   are you planning on buying a home in the next 90 days   if not why does a small short term dip matter   will your life really be effected if your score goes down to 720 for three months keep in mind this is exactly the kind of behavior that the banks want you to engage in   if you worship your fico score which gives no indication of wealth then you should do exactly what i am suggesting

property sold at profit is taxed at capital gains rate if you held it for more than a year which you have based on your previous question thus deferring salary wo n't change the taxable amount or the tax rate on the property it may save you the 3 difference on the salary but i do n't know how significant can that be the 25 depreciation recapture rate or whatever the current percentage is is preset by your depreciation and can not be changed so you 'll have to pay that first whatever is left above it is capital gains and will be taxed at discounted rates 20 iirc you need to make sure that you deduct everything and capitalize everything else all the non deductible expenses and losses with regards to the property for example if you remodeled its added to your basis reduces the gains if you did significant improvements and changes the same if you installed new appliances and carpets they 're depreciated faster you can appropriate part of the sale proceeds to these and thus reduce the actual property related gain also you need to see what gain you have on the land the land can not be depreciated so all the gain on it is capital gain your cpa will help you investigating these and maybe other ways to reduce your tax bill do make sure to have proper documentation and proofs for all your claims do n't make things up and do n't allow your cpa cut corners it may cost you dearly on audit

in a hot market aka a sellers market rates are low money readily available housing inventory low and demand high it 's not rocket science and in fact the only thing the buyer is likely to need from his agent is advice on price is it possible the fair price attracts a buyer on day one sure but it 's far more likely the house should have been listed higher perhaps a lot higher   disclosure i am an agent i 'd rather set a price too high and agree with the seller that we have room to go down than to sell on day one at a low price wondering how much money i just lost my client   even if an offer came at asking price on the first day in a hot market the right answer is we are entertaining a number of offers please confirm your best and final by next friday

is there anything i need to ask or consider during my negotiation    process based on the fact that they probably will soon be own by    another company very tricky situation you are being hired by one company and one hiring manager but you already know that there are big changes ahead what you do n't know is how all those changes will actually play out you will at least end up working for a different company   i 've worked for several companies in the past that were acquired and some that acquired other companies after each acquisition the nature of the company changed significantly some teams were let go completely often overhead departments like accounting marketing etc that were handled at the corporate level some teams were moved to a different location others stayed the same sometimes management changed in one case i was working for a new boss who worked out of the home office in another state the time frame for these changes ranged from immediately to several years after the acquisition for me at least some of the things that made the job appealing earlier typically were gone   try as best you can to ask questions about the acquisition and about the nature of the acquiring company if they are allowed to tell you the name of the company that is acquiring them do some searching see if you can find out how the company typically deals with acquisitions do they immediately let almost everyone go keeping only the essential few or do they run new acquisitions as separate divisions and leave them alone for at least a while try to find out from your hiring manager what their expectations are for your specific team post acquisition try to find out if anything within your offer is subject to change post acquisition are you being hired under the old pre acquisition rules or under the new post acquisition rules the fact that you even know the company is being acquired is good often companies can not even divulge that fact until very near the end on the other hand your use of the phrase probably will soon makes me wonder how much is definite here here 's something you might wish to read

this sounds very like disguised employment you act like an employee of the company but your official relationship with them is as a contractor you gain none of the protection you get from being an employee and this may make you cheaper less risky and more desirable for the company who is hiring you   depending on your country you may also pay corporation tax rather than income tax which may represent a very significant saving also the company hiring you may not have to pay paye national insurance stakeholder pension etc this arrangement is normal and legal providing you genuinely are acting as a subcontractor however if you are behaving as an employee desk at the company company email have to work specific hours in a specific location no ability to subcontract etc you may be classified as a disguised employee in the uk it used to be common practice for highly paid employees to set up shell companies to avoid tax this will now get you into hot water google it sounds like your relationship in this case is directly with the recruiter you will have to consider if the recruiter is acting as your employer or if you remain a genuinely independent agent the duration of your contract with the recruiter will have a bearing on this in the uk there are a whole series of tests for disguised employment this is a good arrangement provided you go in with your eyes open and an awareness of the legislation   however you should absolutely check the rules that apply in your country before entering into this agreement you could potentially be very badly indeed

stock is ownership and whether the thing you own is a good or service irrelevant the ownership itself is all that matters ownership = service ownership = good maybe the problem is your trying to fit a verb into a noun based categories

well that 's the clever part of it   if you only dole out effective surpluses to those who have squandered a bunch of energy then you 've incentivized a certain lifestyle and robbed people who do n't live that lifestyle to finance it   it 's what we 've been doing for 40 years give or take with consumer goods   they keep getting cheaper and higher quality so if you 're not budgeting a healthy portion of your annual income on consumer goods then you 're missing out on the effective surplus   that incentivizes participation in the mass production consumer culture   which in turn keeps the wheels of the economy turning and keeps all the little worker bees in line   if you just handed people more money they might get crazy ideas like starting their own businesses organizing labor unions running for political office taking a day off work to go vote or attend council meetings and generally being a nuisance to the people that run everything   you would n't want that would you

you should consult a us cpa to ensure your situation is handled correctly   it appears the money is israel source income and not us source income regardless if you receive it while living in the u.s. if you file the correct form i suspect the form is 1040nr and your state form to disclose your income if any in 2015 and 2016 it should not be a problem having said that if you do earn any type of income while in the u.s. you are required to disclose it to both the irs and state

but then they turn their stores is hugely expensive show rooms    bb 's real problem is that they are getting eaten at both ends amazon is taking the online business and walmart has expanded their electronics    bb niche is gone it has nothing to do with their customer service or their pricing practices it just has a business model that does n't work anymore    only chance is to reduce the number of stores and aim for the in person sales only

you are not perfectly clear but i will assume that your ex girlfriend owns the car and that her name is the only one on the title the fact that you paid off the loan and repaired the car is completely irrelevant from a court 's point of view you gifted the car to your girlfriend if you are listed on the title then your best move is to steal the car and hide it so she ca n't steal it back note that you are not actually stealing it if you are listed on the title since you own the car try to steal it when it is parked in some public place avoid going onto her property wait until she gets hungry then offer her $ 500 if she agrees to remove her name from the title by the way after you steal the car send a certified letter to her informing her that you have possession of the car this is so that she has no grounds to report it stolen check with the police periodically to make sure she does n't report it stolen anyway if she reports it stolen after you have notified her that you have possession then it is a crime making a false report
