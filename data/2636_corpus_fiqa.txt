i remember in the 19th and early 20th century was the problem of trusts set up by the wealthy to avoid taxes hence the term anti trust that 's not what antitrust means   the trusts in that case were monopolies that used their outsized influence to dominate customers and suppliers   they were n't for tax evasion purposes   trusts were actually older than a permanent income tax   antitrust law was passed around the same time as a permanent income tax becoming legal   prior to that income taxes were temporary taxes imposed to pay for wars    the primary ways to evade taxes was to move expenses out of the personal and into businesses or charities   the business could pay for travel hotels meals and expenses   or a charity could pay for a trip as a promotion activity the infamous safari to africa scheme   charities can pay salaries to employees so someone could fund a charity tax deductible and then use that money to pay people rather than giving gifts   if you declare your house as a historical landmark a charity could maintain it    subscribe to magazines at the office and set them in the waiting room after you read them   use loyalty program rewards from business expenses for personal things   sign up for a benefit for all employees at a steep discount and pay everyone a little less as a result   barter   you do something for someone else e.g. give them a free car and they return the favor   call it marketing or promotion trump is carried away from his tower in a new mercedes benz limousine    another option is to move income and expenses to another tax jurisdiction that has even fewer laws about it   where the united states increasingly cracked down on personal expenses as business expenses many jurisdictions would be happy just to see the money flow through and sit in their banks briefly    tax policy is different now than it was then   many things that would have worked then would n't work now   the irs is more aggressive about insisting that some payments be considered income even if the organization writes the check directly to someone else   it 's unclear what would happen if united states tax rates went back to the level they had in the fifties or even the   would tax evasion become again   or would it stay closer to current levels    the rich actually pay a higher percentage of the overall income taxes now than they did in the and fifties   and the rich in the united states pay a higher percentage of the taxes paid than the rich in other countries with higher marginal rates   some of this may be more rich people in the us than other countries but tax policy is part of that too   high income taxes make it hard to become rich

a simple rule of tax is it does n't matter where u live or your residence when it comes to income accruing in india   as far as i know you will need to find out the purchase prices of the inherited land and calculate the index value then pay tax on the capital profit not sure i guess its 20   example original value is 100,000 and the index value is so the profit will be you pay 20 of the only   for paying minimum tax tax saving there are few sections which gives exemption like purchase some bonds or purchase a house   its best if you ask a chartered accountant for this simple case he should n't charge much he should have updated knowledge of the situation and guide you better

having worked at a financial institution this is a somewhat simple two part solution 1 the vendor financial institution simply turns off the overdraft protection in all its forms if no funds are available at a pin presented transaction the payment is simply declined no fee no overdraft no mess 2 this sticking point for a recurring transaction is that merchants such as netflix gold 's gym etc choose to allow payments like this because they are assured they are going to get paid by the financial institution it prevents them from having issues only a gift card will not cost you more money than you put in but i know of several institutions that too many non payment periods can cause them to cease doing business with you in the future tl dr imo if you do n't want to pay more than you have gift cards are the way to go you can re charge them whenever you choose and should you run into a problem simply buy a new card and start over

i 'm sorry   but no   it is not   some simple theories can be predictive in the current   but macroeconomic theories are almost never predictive and always more reminiscent of a religion   science must be predictive by definition   but predictions about complex systems are notoriously   this is why your ca n't predict more than a few days out     it 's because it 's impossible   the system is too complex   it is sensitive to initial conditions which are unknown and unknowable   and the inputs are too numerous and varied to account for everything   but they can be accurate to within a given confidence interval even if it does not achieve formal statistical significance   and they can run something akin to what economists would call monte carlo simulations given their models   but so far as macroeconomics go there is no admission by many practitioners in many schools about the predictive limitations on the whole endeavor based on the complex nature of the system   there are simply constructed theoretical frameworks which are not predictive but which seem to have fit certain patterns in the past that are cherry picked to confirm a hypothesis   if that is science it is bad science   this does not mean one can not have an untested hypothesis   economists generally can not set up their own experiments after all   and they deal in complexity and human decision just like the other social scientists   but economists perhaps more so than other social scientists due to the increased mathematical skill set in the standard tool box of the field tend to overstate their case   this is particularly true for those larger named economists in the field who inevitably get hired by major media companies   if friedman and were both scientists how did they come to such widely different conclusions     how does the university of chicago predict and prescribe the polar opposite of u. mo st. louis    basing any theory on splitting one half of 's theory of rationality from the other and assigning the behavioral patterns to actors already makes several cognitive leaps   and yes in the last few years we have had the school of behavioral economics and bounded rationality models to try to cope with this   but it 's still far from predictive   the austrians are certainly on some of the ground in my view   at least keynes work was rigorous   so was marx 's for that matter   that stands in stark contrasts to the austrians and their ilk   but regardless when dealing with essentially contested concepts consensus through induction becomes the only path forward   empirical deduction falls off the menu   the schools of biology and chemistry at u mo and u will not come to opposite conclusions given identical data   the schools of economics do   that in and of itself is anecdotal evidence of a severe flaw in the science in a very sense   and so i stand by my statement

danger the affidavit is a legal document understand the risk of getting caught if you are planning on using the condo to generate income the chances that you default on the loan are higher than an owner occupied property that is why they demand more down payment 20%+ and charge a higher rate   the document is n't about making sure you spend 183 + nights a year in the property it is making sure that it is n't a business and you are n't letting a 3rd party live in the property   if you within the first year tell the mortgage company to send the bill to a new address or you change how the property is insured they will suspect that it is now a rental property   what can they do undo the loan ask for penalty fee limit your ability to get a mortgage in the future or a percentage of the profits how likely is it the exact penalty will be in the packet of documents you receive it will depend on which government agency is involved in the loan and the lenders plan to sell it on the secondary market   it can also depend on the program involved in the sale of the property hud and sister agencies lock out investors   during the initial selling period they do n't want somebody to represent themselves as homeowner but is actually an investor note some local governments are interested not just in non investors but in properties being occupied therefore they may offer tax discounts to residents living in their homes then they will be looking at the number of nights that you occupy the house in a year if they detect that you are n't really a resident living in the house that has tax penalties suggestion if you do n't want to wait a year buy the condo and let the loan officer know what your plan is you will have to meet the down payment and interest rate requirements for an investment property your question implies that you will have enough money to pay the required 20 down payment then when you are ready buy the bigger house and move in if you try and buy the condo with a non investment loan you will have to wait a year if you try and pay cash now and then get a home equity loan later you will have to admit it is a rental and still have to meet the investor requirements

first you must prioritize what a need and what a want is   this is different for everyone but generally i think most people will agree that impulse items are want items   look at the item hold it put it back and wait 30 days   put the money that the item costs $ x into your savings account transfer from checking straight deposit etc come back to the store and hold the item again and as did i miss the fact that i did nt get it 30 days ago   95 of the time the answer is no   you saved $ x for and received what is a tiny bit of interest for it this is cause for celebration   if you repeat this for every item you think you need or want then you 'll be amazed at what you saved   do nt waste this money on a vacation to the islands either   keep saving    there will be plenty of rainy days when you 'll have wanted to trade that island vacation or the impulse items you bought that you used once or twice and are lost in your garage somewhere to pay for some unexpected emergency   trust me on this

how are derivatives like covered warrants or cfds different from the bucket shops that were made illegal in the us after reading up a little on the topic the core difference seems to be that bucket shops were basically running betting pools with everyone betting against the operator whereas cfds and similar derivatives are traded between speculators and the operator merely provides a market and checks the liquidity of participants a seems to be a different matter that i 'm not fully sure i understand at least the description of wikipedia seems to contradict your statement about not trade being performed on the underlying security should i worry that some regulator decides that my market maker is an illegal gambling operation not really nations with a mature financial industry like japan invariably have heavy regulations that mandate constant auditing of institutions that sell financial instruments in japan the financial services agency is in charge of this it 's almost impossible that they would let an institution operate and later decide that its basic business model is illegal what is possible are mainly two scenarios

yes that 's all they do   it 's effectively an automatic saving investing program   bank of america does something similar with keep the change transferring the leftovers from checking to savings the basic concept here is that people are lousy at saving so if you put money into savings investments in some way that is not in your control it will be better than if you do it under your control even if it costs something because you 're going to spend whatever your checking account balance is so if that balance is artificially reduced you 'll not spend that money and instead have it in savings   this may be effective for some people i do n't know   not something i would touch with a ten foot pole

you do not have to pay tax on any earnings inside a tfsa quoting wikipedia 's article investment income including capital gains and dividends earned in a tfsa is not taxed even when withdrawn this is backed up by the official tfsa government site which states investment income earned in a tfsa is tax free this makes the tfsa an appropriate vehicle to store investments which produce dividends for example if you invest $ 5500 and receive a total of $ 500 in dividends this year you will not pay tax on that $ 500 either in this tax year or even subsequently when you withdraw money out of your tfsa of course tfsas are n't meant to be used for regular withdrawals if you are planning on investing $ 5500 this year and withdrawing the dividends i 'd urge you to be careful and consider if this is actually the best sort of savings vehicle for you but that 's really just a general warning nothing specific to dividends it is possible to do this indeed withdrawing $ 500 in dividends this year will increase your available contribution room in the next tax year not in this tax year for example you contribute $ 5500 at the beginning of this year by the end of november you have accumulated $ 500 in dividends you withdraw these in december in the following tax year you can this $ 500 in addition to the standard $ 5500 contribution room so you could contribute $ 6000 just be careful with your calculations i messed mine up and ended up paying a rather substantial penalty for my overcontribution

two different questions is it better to be in debt or to pay off the debt and is it better to have student debt than other debt   any debt needs to be paid off eventually and any debt makes you less flexible so if you have the choice between spending wasting your money and paying off debt i would recommend paying off the debt   the other question is whether having student debt is better than having other debt you need to look at the terms of your student debt pay off the debt with the worst conditions first loan sharks in britain pay day loans must be paid first credit cards debt must go next then general loans depending on your situation you may want some savings as well in case you lose your job for example so if you have $ 8,000 saved and an $ 8,000 student loan you might consider waiting a bit before you pay back the loan no job + $ 8,000 student loan + $ 8,000 in the bank is better than no job + no debt + no money in the bank

from your description it seems that you should have $ 75k of basis i.e. after tax amount in your traditional ira as others have mentioned in comments you might have had to report this in the year it was rolled over i will assume that you will have figured this out having after tax amounts in a traditional ira is tricky as you usually ca n't choose to take out only the after tax portion withdrawals as well as conversions to roth ira must be pro rata which means that the amount of pre tax and post tax money in the withdrawal or conversion follows the same proportion as in the ira overall so say 7.5 of your traditional ira is after tax and the other is pre tax that means any withdrawal will consist of pre tax and post tax in those proportions so e.g. if you withdraw or convert $ 1000 $ 75 will be post tax and $ will be pre tax so any withdrawal or conversion will consist overwhelmingly of pre tax amounts which will be taxed and you may not want that at this time there is one way to separate the pre tax and post tax amounts in a traditional ira but it involves having an active 401(k which i doubt you have at this point as you 're retired some 401(k plans allow people to rollover funds from traditional ira into it if they allow this then you can use it to siphon only pre tax money from the traditional ira as irs does not allow rollover of post tax money into a 401(k this way you can rollover the entire pre tax amount of the traditional ira into the traditional 401(k leaving behind only after tax money in the traditional ira which you can immediately convert to roth ira with no tax

on the face this appears a sound method to manage long run cumulative interest but there are some caveats maxing out credit cards will destroy your credit rating   you will receive no more reasonable offers for credit only shady ones   though your credit rating will rise the moment you bring the balance back down to 10 even with high income it 's easy to the 8 months and then a high interest rate kicks in because of the low credit rating further maxing out credit cards will encourage credit card lenders to begin cutting limits and at worse demand early payment now after month 6 hits your financial payment obligations skyrocket   a sudden is never easy to manage   this will increase risk of missing a payment a disaster for such hair line financing in short the probability of your financial structure is high for very little benefit if you are confident that you can pay off $ 4,000 in 8 months then simply apply those payments to the student loan directly cutting out the middle man   your creditors will be pleased to see your total liabilities fall at a high rate while your utilization remains small encouraging them to offer you more credit and lower rates the ideal credit card utilization rate is 10 so it would be wise to use that portion to repay the student loans building up credit will allow you to use the credit as an auxiliary cushion when financial disaster strikes   keeping an excellent credit rating will allow you to finance the largest home possible for your money   every percentage point of mortgage interest can mean the difference between a million usd home and a $ 750,000 one

the only real consideration i would give to paying off the debt as slowly as possible is if inflation were much higher than it is now   if you had a nice medium to low interest fixed rate loan like yours and then inflation spiked to 7 8 for example then you 're better off not paying it now because it 's effectively making you money and then when inflation back down you pay it off with your gains however with a fairly successful and active federal reserve being careful to avoid inflation spikes it seems unlikely that will occur during your time owing this debt and certainly is n't anywhere near that point now   make sure you 're saving some money not for the return but for the safety net put it in something very safe and otherwise pay off your debt

upstream is into businesses that supply the original business downstream is into businesses that make use of the original product   so in that description what they are saying is that the original business received products from plantations and sent products to manufacturing this is also called vertical integration   meaning that they are diversifying along their supply chain so that they control more of it   this is in contrast with horizontal integration where they move into new products that either compete with the existing products or which are entirely separate    in general the upside of vertical integration is that a company is less reliant on suppliers and intermediate consumers and has more control over its supply chain   the downside is that they have less opportunity to partner with other companies in the same supply chain as they compete with them   some companies are better at managing to do both   for example amazon.com has integrated fulfillment and sales   but partners can still do their own fulfillment and/or sales choosing how much to send out to amazon    if you are investing in individual stocks integrated companies can be problematic in that they cut across diversification areas   so they can be harder to balance with other stocks   you can either buy plantations transport and manufacturing together or not buy at all   if your investment strategy says to increase plantations and reduce manufacturing this can be difficult to implement with an integrated company   of course everyone else has the same problem which can lead to integrated companies being undervalued   so they may be an opportunity as a value stock

probably the most important thing in evaluating a dividend yield is to compare it to itself in the past if the dividend yield is higher than it has been in the past the stock may be cheap if it is lower the stock may be expensive just about every stock has a normal yield for itself it 's zero for non dividend paying stocks this is based on the stock 's perceived quality growth potential and other factors so a utility that normally yields 5 and is now paying 3 is probably expensive the price in the denominator is too high while a growth stock that normally yields 2 and is now yielding 3 e.g. intel or may be cheap

sounds like your grandmother 's estate had taxable income and the estate did not pay the estate income tax   rather the estate shifted the burden to pay that tax on the beneficiaries which is why you received a k1   if that k1 reports income received by you then yes you would have to amend your tax return   i am in exactly that same situation now   after the october 15 deadline to file 2012 tax returns i received a k1 for income received from my dad 's estate   i now have to file a late amended 2012 income tax return and pay income tax on what i inherited my dad had a small estate but the money that made up that small estate all came from an ira he had   he designated the estate as his beneficiary   so when the stocks in the ira were sold that all became taxable income to the beneficiaries of the estate anything involving taxes is confusing at best   but do not confuse estate income tax with estate tax they are two different taxes hope this helps

you should be able to take a loan out on the 401(k   you ca n't do a roll over unless you leave your job   if your 401(k is that bad you should consider maxing out your ira contributions first and putting the rest into your 401(k so if you 're putting away about 7k a year lower your withholding to 1500 and put 5500 into an ira

there are several types of financial advisors some are associated with brokerages and insurance companies and the like their services are often free on the other hand the advice they give you will generally be strongly biased toward their own company 's products and may be biased toward their own profits rather than your gains remember anything free is being paid for by someone and if you do n't know who it 's generally going to be you there are some who are good but i could n't give you any advice on finding them others are not associated with any of the above and serve entirely as experts who can suggest ways of distributing your money based on your own needs versus resources versus risk tolerance without any affiliation to any particular company   consulting these folks does cost you or if it 's offered as a benefit your employer some money but their fiduciary responsibility is clearly to you rather than to someone else they are n't likely to suggest you try anything very sexy but when it comes to your primary long term savings exciting is usually not a good thing the folks i spoke to were of the latter type they looked at my savings and my plans talked to me about my risk tolerance and my goals picked a fairly standard strategy from their files ran simulations against it to sanity check it and gave me a suggested mix of low overhead index fund types that takes almost zero effort to maintain rebalance occasionally between funds has acceptable levels of risk and i admit i 've been lucky has been delivering more than acceptable returns nothing exciting but even though i 'm relatively risk tolerant i 'd say excitement is the last thing i need in my long term savings i should actually talk to them again some time soon to sanity check a few things they can also offer advice on other financial decisions whether when i might want to talk to charities about gift annuity plans whether roth versus traditional 401(k makes any difference at all at this point in my career and so on

from my experience using paypal for selling products on ebay and for the last two experiences of a friend   can paypal get money from my bank account without my authorization this is assuming they have transferred the funds to me they ca n't pull money from your bank account without your authorization they will however take the money from your paypal account if it 's still there or leave you with a negative balance if you 've already withdrawn they will do this as soon as there is a claim against you and will only release the funds if the investigation ends in your favor any money received would first be used to satisfy the negative balance what actions can paypal takes against me if charge back amount is very high and i do n't agree pay them they will send it to a collections agency is there any case it is going to effect my bank account i.e. is there any chance paypal can block my bank account in india they will block you from using paypal if you try to sign up again with a different bank account or credit card and they recognize you as the account holder they will block that account as well

unfortunately i do not have much experience with european banks however i do know of ways to earn interest on bank accounts cds certificates of deposit are a good way to earn interest its basically a savings account that you can not touch for a fixed rate of time you can set it from an average of 6 months to 12 months you can pull the money out early if there is an emergency as well i would also look into different types of bank accounts if you go with an account other than a free one the interest rate will be higher and as long as you have the minimum amount required you should not be charged hope i was able to help

i would like to establish credit history have heard it 's useful to    gain employment and makes it easy to rent an apartment higher credit scores will make it easier with landlords that 's true as to employment they do background checks which means that they usually wo n't like bad things but wo n't care about the good things or no things they 'll know you 're a foreigner anyway is it safe to assume that this implies i have no history whatsoever probably but you can verify pulling through do n't go around giving your personal information everywhere is taking out a secured loan the only way for me no but it 's one of the easiest better would be getting a secured credit card not loan for loan you 'll have to pay interest for a credit card assuming you pay off all your purchases immediately you will only pay the credit card fees for secured credit cards they charge 100 yearly fees so do shop around the prices vary a lot if you 're using it wisely after a year it will be converted to a regular credit card and the collateral will be returned to you with interest which is actually very competitive last i heard it was around 2 twice as much as the online savings accounts as to a secured loan you 'll be paying 4 to cu for your own money does n't make any sense at all for me for credit cards you 'll at least get some value for your money convenience additional fraud protection etc the end result will be the same usually the credit starts to build up after ~6 12 months that 's why after a year your secured cc will be converted to a regular one make sure to have the statement balance in the range of 10 30 of your credit limit to get the best results would it make much better sense to wait till i get a job then i would    have a fixed monthly salary and can apply for a regular cc directly you can apply but you 'll probably be rejected as i mentioned in another answer elsewhere the system in the us is such that you 're unable to get credit if you do n't already have credit which is kindof a magic circle which you can break with the secured credit card as the least costly solution

the standard double entry approach would just be to create a liability account for the loan and then make a transfer from that account to your asset savings account when the loan proceeds are distributed to you after that point the loan does n't belong to your savings account in any way each account and transaction is tracked separately so you might for instance pay that loan back with a transfer from your checking account even though the initial disbursement arrived into your savings account in order to see how much of a loan you have remaining you need to look at the loan 's liability account to see what transactions occurred in it and what its remaining balance is it sounds like what you 're really trying to accomplish is the idea of   or putting into an envelope certain assets for certain purposes this kind of budgeting is n't really something that gnucash at it does have some budget features but there 's more about being able to see how actual expenses are to expected expenses for a reporting period not about being able to ask how much discretionary assets do i have left before i start hitting my emergency fund the closest you get is splitting up your asset accounts into subaccounts as you suggest in which case you can allocate funds for your specific purposes and make transfers between them as needed that can work well enough depending on your exact goals though it can sometimes make it a little trickier to reconcile with your actual bank statements but there 's not really an accounting reason to associate the emergency fund portion of your assets with the remaining balance of your loan though there 's nothing stopping you from doing so if that 's what you 're trying to do accounting answers questions like how much have i spent on x in the past and how much do i own right now if you want to ask how much am i allowed to spend on x right now or am i likely to run out of money soon you may want a budgeting tool rather than an accounting tool

when you are saving for money you need in 5 years or less the only real option is a savings account i know the return is nothing at this point but if you can not take the risk of losing all of your money that 's the only thing i would recommend   now you could try a good growth stock mutual fund if when you look up in 2 3 years and you have lost money you wait it out until it grows enough to get what you lost back then buy your house i would not do the second option because i would n't want to be stuck renting while waiting for the account to recover and actually thinking about it that way you have more risk 3 years from now if you have lost money and do n't yet have enough saved you will have to continue paying rent and no mutual fund will out preform that

illiquid charges are charges that apply to the trading of low priced over the counter otc securities with low volumes open net buy quantity represents the total unsettled share amount per stock at any given time during a settlement cycle open net buy quantity must be less than 5,000,000 shares per stock for your entire firm basically you ca n't hold a long position of more than 5 million shares in an illiquid otc stock without facing a fee you 'll still be assessed this fee if you accumulate a long position of this size by breaking your purchase up into multiple transactions open net sell quantity represents the total unsettled share amount per stock at any given time during a settlement cycle open net sell quantity must be less than 10 percent of the average volume if you attempt to sell a number of shares greater than 10 of the stock 's average volume over the last 20 days you 'll also be assessed a fee the first link i included above is just an example but it makes the important point you may still be assessed a fee for trading otc stocks even if your account does n't meet the criteria because these restrictions are applied at the level of the clearing firm not the individual client   this means that if other investors with your broker or even at another broker that happens to use the same clearing firm purchase more than 5 million shares in an individual otc stock at the same time all of your accounts may face fees even though individually you do n't exceed the limits technically these fees are assessed to the clearing firm not the individual investor but usually the clearing firm will pass the fees along to the broker and possibly add other charges as well and the broker will charge a fee to the individual account(s that triggered the restriction also remember that when buying otc pink sheet stocks your ability to buy or sell is also contingent on finding someone else to buy from sell to if you purchase 10,000 shares one day and attempt to sell them sometime in the future but there are n't enough buyers to buy all 10,000 from you you might not be able to complete your order at the desired price or even at all

a mutual fund 's return or yield has nothing to do with what you receive from the mutual fund the annual percentage return is simply the percentage increase or decrease of the value of one share of the mutual fund from january 1 till december 31 the cash value of any distributions dividend income short term capital gains   long term capital gains might be reported separately or might be included in the annual return   what you receive from the mutual fund is the distributions which you have the option of taking in cash and spending on whatever you like or investing elsewhere or of re investing into the fund without ever actually touching the money regardless of whether you take a distribution as cash or re invest it in the mutual fund that amount is taxable income in most jurisdictions in the us long term capital gains are taxed at different lower rates than ordinary income and i believe that long term capital gains from mutual funds are not taxed at all in india you are not taxed on the increase in the value of your investment caused by an increase in the share price over the year nor do you get deduct the loss if the share price declined over the year it is only when you sell the mutual fund shares back to the mutual fund company that you have to pay taxes on the capital gains if you sold for a higher price or deduct the capital loss if you sold for a lower price than the purchase price of the shares be aware that different shares in the sale might have different purchase prices because they were bought at different times and thus have different gains and losses   so how do you calculate your personal return from the mutual fund investment if you have a money management program or a spreadsheet program it can calculate your return for you if you have online access to your mutual fund account on its website it will most likely have a tool called something like personal rate of return and this will provide you with the same calculations without your having to type in all the data by hand finally if you want to do it personally by hand i am sure that someone will soon post an answer writing out the gory details

no you probably do not need to file a tax return if you received no income and if you meet a number of other criteria the below is copied and pasted slightly edited from the cra you must file a return for 2014 if any of the following situations    apply you have to pay tax for 2014 we sent you a request to file a return you and your spouse or common law partner elected to split pension    income for 2014 see lines 115 116 129 and 210 you received working income tax benefit advance payments in    2014 you disposed of capital property in 2014 for example if you sold    real estate or shares or you realized a taxable capital gain for    example if a mutual fund or trust attributed amounts to you or you    are reporting a capital gains reserve you claimed on your 2013    return you have to repay any of your old age security or employment insurance    benefits see line 235 you have not repaid all amounts withdrawn from your registered    retirement savings plan rrsp under the home plan or the    lifelong learning plan for more information go to home buyers plan    hbp or see guide lifelong learning plan llp or you have to    contribute to the canada pension plan cpp this can apply if for    2014 the total of your net self employment income and    employment income is more than $ 3,500 see line you are paying employment insurance premiums on self employment and    other eligible earnings see lines and 430 in general you will want to file a tax return even if none of the above applies you could for example claim a gst hst credit even with no income now if you receive any income at all you are going to have to pay taxes which means you are obligated to file a tax return if sufficient taxes were deducted from your paycheque you are still obligated to file a tax return however you will not have to pay penalties if you file late even if you file very late at least not until the cra sends you a request to file but be aware you wo n't likely be able to tell if you owe the cra money until you do your taxes and if you do end up owing there are substantial penalties for filing late in general i 'd strongly advise filing your tax return in almost all circumstances

this is a tricky question because the financial aid system can create odd incentives good schools tend to price themselves above and beyond any reasonable middle class ability to save and then offer financial aid much of it in the form of internal grants or loans   if you think about it the internal grant is more of a discount than a grant since no money need have ever existed to fund the grant   the actual price to the parents is based on financial aid paperwork and related rules perhaps forming a college price setting cartel   it is these rules that need to be considered when creating a savings plan suppose it is $ 50k year to send your kids to the best school admitting them   that s $ 200k for the 4 years   suppose you had $ 50k now to save instead of $ 10 k and are wondering whether to put it in your son 's college savings whether or not you can do so in a tax advantaged way or to pay down the mortgage   if you put it in your kids savings and the $ 50k becomes $ 75k over time that $ 75k will be used up in a year and a half as the financial aid system will suck it dry first before offering you much help   on the other hand if you put the $ 50k on paying down the mortgage provided the mortgage is healthy not upside down your house payment will still be the same when your kids go to college   the financial aid calculations will consider that the kid has no savings and allocate a grant and some loans the first year and a parental portion that you might be able to tap with a home equity loan or work overtime      generally you should also be encouraging your kids to excel and perhaps obtain academic scholarships or at least obtain some great opportunities   a large college savings fund might be as counterproductive as a zero fund   they should n't be expecting to breeze through some party school with a nice pad and car homework assistance and beer money   unless they are good at a sport like maybe football in which case you wo n't need to be the provider it is not obvious how much the optimal esa amount is   it might not be $ 0   saving like crazy in there probably is n't the best thing to do either

no   i have nearly a million miles in the air and i do not despise flying   the tsa today are only slightly more obnoxious than they were say 10 years ago   the purpose of airport security is to get rid of the low hanging fruit threats   without it every with an agenda would be a problem   with it only the hardcore threats are a concern   the real problem with air travel today is the amateurs that travel once a year and have some very weird behaviors   they show up late and clueless and then get annoyed that the word does n't stop to accommodate them   they show up massively overweight and blame the airline for the small seats   yeah that 's the problem   the seats are too small to accommodate your buffalo like   they try to bring aboard that wo n't fit in the back of an suv let alone in the overhead   they think a $ 49 ticket entitles you to treatment and a luxury experience   they drink like boys and become about equally obnoxious   they bring their children along that 's fine but then ignore them so that the rest of us have to put up with the whining and screaming that comes from children that are hungry or need a diaper change   in short the tsa does n't bother me anywhere near as much as a good many of my fellow passengers   protip 1   when traveling travel light and be 10 more courteous and 10 more patient than you would be say at home   it will make the entire experience better for all involved   protip 2   the single biggest element of travel stress in my experience is noise   go to your local gun shop and buy a pair of the foam   wear them from the time you walk into the airport until you walk out at the other end   you will see your stress levels go down significantly   protip 3 the most dangerous thing in the airport is n't terrorists   it 's the food

i 'd recommend you use an online tax calculator to see the effect it will have to your comment with @littleadv there 's fmv agreed but there 's also a rate below that one that 's a bit lower than fmv but it 's a discount for a tenant who will handle certain things on their own i had an arm 's length tenant who was below fmv i literally never met him but our agreement through a realtor was that for any repairs i was not required to arrange or meet fmv is not a fixed number but a bit of a range   if this is your first rental you need to be aware of the requirement to take depreciation simply put you separate your cost into land and house the house value gets depreciated by i.e. you divide the value by 27.5 and that 's taken as depreciation each year you may break even on cash flow the rent paying the mortgage property tax etc but the depreciation might still produce a loss this is n't optional it flows to your tax return and is limited to $ 25k yr further if your adjusted gross income   is over $ 100 k the allowed loss is phased out over the next $ 50 k of income i.e. each $ 1000 of agi reduces the allowed loss by $ 500 the losses you ca n't take are carried forward until you use them to offset profit each year or sell the property   if you offer numbers you 'll get a more detailed answer but this is the general overview in general if you are paying tax you are doing well running a profit even after depreciation

the monthly bill should reduce as required by loan a no longer requiring payment this will occur only when loan a is fully payed off not before if you 're going to do this make sure you tell them that any extra money is principal reduction and not prepayment   lets say you do pay off loan a and you continue to pay $ 11 a month   if you specify principle reduction for the $ 1 extra they must reduce the loan balance by $ 1   if you do not specify or you specify prepayment they may apply $ 0.20 to principal reduction and $ 0.80 to interest

yes   i heard back from a couple brokerages that gave detailed responses specifically in a margin account there are no sec trade settlement rules which means there is no risk of any free ride violations the sec has a faq page on free riding which states that it applies specifically to cash accounts this led me to dig up the text on regulation t which gives the free riding rule in which is titled 90 day freeze is the section on cash accounts nothing in the sections on margin accounts mentions such a settlement restriction from the wikipedia page on free riding the margin agreement implicitly covers settlement buying power does n't seem to be a regulation t thing but it 's something that the brokerages that i 've seen use to state how much purchasing power a client has given the response from the brokerage above and my reading of regulation t and the relevant wikipedia page proceeds from the sale of any security in a margin account are available immediately for reinvestment settlement is covered implicitly by margin i.e. it does n't detract from buying power additionally i have personally been making these types of trades over the last year in a k margin account proceeds are immediately available the only thing i still have to look out for is running into the day trading rules

hmm others are hating on the article but from my experience there is truth there every single tiny company that 's trying to hire you as a young coder will the possibility of a massive upside later on the founder ceo believes that success is just around the corner and a good one has the ability to charm everyone else into believing it too alas this is not a guarantee of success   so i think if you 're in that position young coder trying to pick a job or decide whether to stick with one the advice is this if you 're not sure whether you know what you 're doing you probably do n't in which case look at the base odds 1 in 100 startups succeed the rest and act accordingly if you are sure you know what you 're doing then more power to you

as an expansion on the correct answer consider a really boring economy   nothing changes   wages and prices stay constant for years at a time   every month the consumer price index stays at 0    then something catastrophic happens say on july 31 2000 a cheap local source for a vital resource runs out and it must be obtained from a higher cost source   floods cut internal road networks resulting in higher transportation costs   whatever   the new situation is permanent as a result the next month august 2000 prices go up 5   that is 5 higher than the previous month july 2000 and 5 higher than a year previously august 1999 there is a lot of and politicians each promise that they and only they can inflation to the ground but when the figures for september 2000 come out inflation stays the same   prices are the same as in august 2000 and 5 higher than in september 1999 this goes on for months   nothing changes prices stay the same and the inflation rate year over year stays at 5 finally the figures for august 2001 come out   wonder of wonders   prices are the same as in august 2000 and inflation drops to zero    and the politicians all take the credit short version inflation year over year changes either because of what in now included in the month just past or what is now excluded from a year ago

mutual funds do n't work like stocks in that way the price of a mutual fund is set at the end of each day and does n't fluctuate during the day so no matter when you put in your order it will be filled at the end of the day at whatever the closing price is for that day here is some good information on that there is no continuous pricing of fund shares throughout the trading    day when an investor places an order to buy or sell a fund 's shares    the order is executed based on the nav calculated at the end of that    trading day regardless of what time during the day the order was    placed on the other hand if the investor were to check the price of    his or her fund shares halfway through the business day the price    quoted would be the previous day 's nav because that was the last time    the fund calculated and reported the value investing how mutual funds are

from my reading of the wikipedia page crt this only happens if you deposit or withdraw currency not checks   the idea behind this is that checks ach etc leave paper trails that can be tracked   cash does n't so it gets this extra level of scrutiny   if get a cashiers check or a money order to pay a bill i do n't think a crt is created   if you withdraw $ 15,000 to buy a car in cash 1 stack of $ 100 bills then a crt would be generated   it still is n't a problem as long as you can show a bill of sale showing where the money went or came from if you are the seller the irs has a faq about this   it says taken from several spots at that page cash is money it is currency and coins of the united states and any other country   a cashier ’s check bank draft traveler ’s check or money order with a face amount of more than $ 10,000 is not treated as cash and a business does not have to file form when it receives them these items are not defined as cash because if they were bought with currency the bank or other financial institution that issued them must file a currency transaction report the exception to this is if you are buying something with a resale value of more than $ 10k with a check money order etc of less than $ 10k

congrats to your gf   how much depends a lot on how stable her income tends to be if she has stable salary $ 20 k plus $ k in contract work then having a larger ef is important if she has a consistent track record of pulling in $ 35 k each year with contract work then she may still need a somewhat higher emergency fund to tide her over between gigs   the rule of thumb is at least 3 months expenses before you start investing for better returns if she is reliant on contract work then holding up to 6 months expenses could be wise just in case she hits a slow patch with work   after that emergency fund is covered she can look at investment opportunities with varying levels of risk return   i would also recommend putting it down in writing why she 's investing saving is she saving up for an awesome vacation maybe that 's why she really is so far above a normal ef does she want a new car maybe there 's not really so much to spare bottom line assuming her monthly expenses are around $ 2 k per month she might have $ 4,000 to $ 5,000 that she could look to start investing safely

if the period is consistent for company x but occurs in a different month as company y it might be linked to the release of their annual report or the payment of their annual dividend companies do n't have to end their fiscal year near the end of the calendar year therefore these end of year events could occur in any month the annual report could cause investors to react to the hard numbers of the report compared to what wall street experts have been predicting the payment of an annual dividend will also cause a direct drop in the price of the stock when the payment is made there will also be some movement in prices as the payment date approaches

most answers have concentrated on this being a scam however it is possible this is an innocent mistake australian bank account numbers do not have redundant digits to be used to validate an account number all of the numbers are data and uniquely identify a bank and branch the number and an account the account number computer check digits are not part of bank account numbers because bank account numbers pre date computers it is entirely possible that someone entering an incorrect number can by chance hit upon an existing account as the bank clearance system in australia is entirely automatic there is no cross checking of account numbers with account names   internet banking in australia is not a wire transfer as is common in places like the usa although these can be done here you are effectively accessing your bank 's back office nor is it like the service which   is used primarily by b to c businesses as a way for their customers to pay their bills when using this service the biller code will show you who you are paying and the customer number does have check digit validation i run a business in australia and it has happened to us on several occasions than an employee or supplier has given us incorrect numbers usually it is not a real account and after a week or so the money makes its way back to us with a message like no account or a c closed   very occasionally however the wrong number hits a live account when that happens the person who up needs to contact their bank and try and get the transaction reversed if there is money in the destination account this usually happens with little fuss however if the destination account has been closed or emptied things get problematic of course taking money that is n't yours is stealing even if it happens to be sitting in your bank account however unless the sum involved is significant the police are usually not interested in diverting their attention away from serious crimes like armed robbery and terrorism so the party is usually on their own that said this is probably a scam because they called you rather than your bank doing so they can not get your phone number from your account number they have to know who you are and what your account number is this is not as hard to do as it sounds since both your name and account number are prominently printed on your cheques and deposit books possibly your phone number as well which saves them looking it up in the white pages

in practice no not at zero banks currently have the ability to borrow at very low interest rates but not quite at zero   using the fed funds range as a metric we can see that recently nov 2015 the lower bound of the fed funds range was 0.05   fed funds are overnight lend borrow transactions between banks often between the federal home loan banks and other institutions 0.05 is also the fed 's current reverse repo program rate rrp which is the rate at which certain counterparties can deposit cash with the fed overnight in exchange for collateral   the collateral us treasuries is insurance against the fed defaulting a very low risk considering the fed has the ability to create more us dollars out of thin air   in theory the rrp rate should be a lower bound for the fed funds rate however in practice it is possible to see lower rates trade in the street what do you mean by third party institutions only banks of the highest credit quality are able to borrow at the lower bound of the fed funds range   these are usually large domestic banks like jp morgan bank of ny etc   as credit quality decreases the rate at which they borrow increases currently german french banks have relatively good credit and borrow overnight money towards the lower part of the fed funds range   italian spanish and smaller regional us banks have lesser credit quality and borrow at the higher end of the fed funds range institutions with lower credit quality would borrow at still higher rates

are you in the united states is there some sort of written agreement that the money your parents paid into the house is a loan that will be paid back   i assume the deed to the home is in your name and your parents do not have a lien on the property in any way in the united states provided there is no lien and your parents are not also on the mortgage that home is 100 yours now i would argue you still owe your parents money but absent some sort of contract it sounds like an interest free loan that you 'll pay back at a rate of   your parents could attempt to sue you and if this happens i recommend you find a real estate attorney it 's unlikely that they would win the case since there 's no paperwork and even if there was it is unlikely to hold up since it so strongly favors them your parents   now if your parents are listed on the mortgage or somehow have a lien on the house you have a bigger issue as they technically own or at least have an interest in part of the property and when you decide to sell the house you would have to involve them

no at least not noticeably so the majority of what hft does is to take advantage of the fact that there is a spread between buy and sell orders on the exchange and to instantly fill both orders gaining relatively risk free profit from some inherent inefficiencies in how the market prices stocks the end result is that intraday trading of the non hft nature as well as speculative short term trading will be less profitable since hft will cause the buy sell spread to be closer than it would otherwise be buying and holding will be largely unaffected since the spread that hft takes advantage of is miniscule compared to the gains a stock will experience over time   for example when you go to buy shares intending to hold them for a long time the hft might cost you say 1 to 2 cents per share when you go to sell the share hft might cost you the same again but if you held it for a long time the share might have doubled or tripled in value over the time you held it so the overall effect of that 2 4 cents per share lost from hft is negligible however since the hft is doing this millions of times per day that 1 cent or more commonly a fraction of a cent adds up to hfts making millions individually it does n't affect anyone that much but collectively it represents a huge loss of value and whether this is acceptable or not is still a subject of much debate

first request that you complete a tax return on this tax return you will complete both the employed and self employed sections this will give you a total income and tax liability you will already have paid some tax via paye but you will have to pay additional tax for any other income for future years there is the option depending on amount to collect extra tax through paye to cover the other earnings if it is likely to be the same for the next few years this may be a better option than paying a lump sum the tax return is now mostly online and not too bad if your affairs are otherwise simple the hardest part will be keeping a good record of your other earnings remember that you have to keep these records for seven years in case hmrc ever want to audit them and it 's a good idea to have a separate account for the income or some other way of easily identifying it

after 30 years you 'd have a million dollar house vs a quarter million dollar house you 've captured three quarters of a million dollars in rent given my napkin math hypothetical as i figure the math a 250,000 house appreciating to a million dollar house in 30 years requires a sustained appreciation every year seems unrealistic the historical rate of inflation on average has been closer to 3 3.5 a 3 appreciation would give a final value of $   this also does n't taken into account the idea that you may have bought a property during a housing bubble and so then you would n't get 3 year over year returns but also in terms of capturing rent you are not factoring in necessary or possible costs that renting does n't have   mortgage interest and insurance maintenance property tax insurance buying and selling associated fees and importantly opportunity costs in that the money not tied up in the house could be invested elsewhere    so it is not such a slam dunk as you make it out   many use the ny times buy rent calculator to compare renting vs. buying

unfortunately you ca n't use your hsa to pay for expenses in year a. qualified medical expenses for an hsa must occur after the date the hsa account was established established typically means the date the account was opened in your name the other answers already mostly answered your other questions but i want to really hit home some particular points that many people may not realize the most important thing to do when you are eligible to have an hsa account is to open an hsa account asap this is true even if you do n't put any money in it and you leave it empty for years the reason is that once the account is established all qualified medical expenses that occur after that date are eligible for distributions even if you wait years before you fund your hsa account the second most important thing to do is to keep track of all out of pocket medical expenses you incur after you open the hsa account all you need is a simple spreadsheet and a place to store your receipts once you have the account and are tracking expenses now you can put money into your hsa and take it out whenever you 'd like with you ca n't put in more than the contribution limit for a single tax year and you ca n't take out more than your eligible expenses to date helpful tip many people do n't fund their hsa because they ca n't afford to set aside extra money to do so fortunately you do n't have to for example suppose you have some dental work and it costs you $ 500 once you get the bill before you pay it put the $ 500 into your hsa account the next day take the $ 500 back out and pay your dental bill with it most hsa accounts will give you a debit card to make this even easier to pay the bill by putting the money into your hsa for 1 day you just received a $ 500 tax deduction alternatively you can always pay out of pocket like you normally would track your receipts and wait until the end of the year or up until april 15 of the next year i like this option because i can pay all of my medical bills with a credit card and get cash back then at the end of the year i add up the expenses deposit that much into my hsa and if i 'd rather put that money somewhere else i just pull it out the next day if you decide you do n't need the money right away that 's even better since you can leave it in the hsa account and invest it like a roth account you do n't pay tax on the growth you achieve inside of an hsa another tip if your employer offers the service of automatically making deposits into your hsa by reducing your paycheck you should definitely try to do that if you can afford it rather than manually making contributions as i described in the previous tip when your employer makes the contributions for you your wages are reduced by that amount on your w2 so you end up saving an additional 7 in fica taxes

one option might be to use tax certificates to save this money at the moment they do n't pay any interest unless you deposit more than £ 100,000 at once so they are n't very attractive from that point of view but they do give you a clean way to segregate your money and for the purposes of charging penalty interest hmrc will treat you as having made the payment at the time you purchased the certificate if it turns out that you should have paid the actual tax earlier than you did another option is a regular saver account these typically have limits of £ 250 per month so you might have to open a few given the amount you have to save that would add up to a lot of maintenance effort particularly as you 'd have to open new accounts again each year however they do typically offer good interest rates compared to what 's available elsewhere and the way they operate fits well with your needs money coming in regularly and then going out all at once

the answer would depend on the equities held some can weather inflation better than others such as companies that have solid dividend growth and even outpace inflation some industries are also safer against inflation than others such as consumer staples and utilities since people usually have to purchase these regardless of how much $ they have in looking over the data comparing s&p 500 returns dividends and inflation the results are all over the map in the 50 's the total return was with inflation at 2.2 then in the 70 's returns were 5.8 with inflation at percent leading one to think that inflation diminished returns but then in the 80 's inflation was 5.1 yet the return on the s&p was up to either way aside from the 70 's every other decade since 1950 has outpaced inflation as long as you are including dividends hence my first paragraph s&p 500 total and inflation adjusted historical returns also the 7 average stock appreciation you mention is just that an average you are comparing a year over year number 7 inflation with an aggregated one stock performance over x number of years and that is a misrepresentation and is not being weighted for the difference in what those numbers mean finally there are thousands of things that have an effect on the stock market and stocks some are and others are not the idea that any one of them such as inflation has any sort of long term effect on prices that they can not is improbable this is where researching your stocks comes in and if done prudently who cares what the inflation rate is

i disagree that they are taxis which is why i think that consumers should realize they do n't offer the same protections   the argument for more regulations is that taxis have regulations to keep people safe   well ok let 's go with that premise people are ok with ride sharing services because of the many added benefits but they also know that these services are n't taxis does everyone who uses them know they might be taking on an additional risk probably not but i 'd guess most people would be ok with fewer protections in order to use the added value from these services   basically it should n't have to be a level playing field if consumers willingly forfeit the protections taxis offer then that is their choice

first make sure you understand the objective of an etf   in some cases they may use leverage to get a multiple of the index 's return that is different than 1   some may be ultra funds that go for double the return or double the inverse of the return and thus will try to apply the appropriate leverage to achieve that return those that use physical replication can still have a small portion be used to try to minimize the tracking error as there is something to be said for what kind of tracking error do you accept as the fund 's returns may differ from the index by some measure yes   for example if you were to have a fund that had a 50 and -50 return in back to back periods what would your final return be   answer which if you need to visualize this take $ 1 that then becomes $ 1.50 by going up 50 and then becomes $ .75 by going down 50 in a compounded fashion   this is where you have to be careful of the risks of leverage as those returns will compound in a possibly negative way

you can not deduct commute expenses regarding your specific example something to consider is that if the standard of living is higher in san francisco presumably the wages are higher too therefore you must make a choice to trade time and some money for commuting costs for even more money in the form of higher wages for example if you can make $ 50 k working 2 hours away from sf or $ 80 k working in sf and it costs you $ 5 k extra per year in commute costs you still come out ahead by $ 25 k minus taxes if it ends up costing $ 20 k more to live in sf due to higher rent mortgage food etc some people choose to trade 4 extra hours of commuting time to put that extra $ 20 k in their pocket it 's sort of like having an extra part time job except you get paid to read watch tv sleep on the job assuming you can take a train to work

bonds might not be simple but in general there are only a few variables that need to be understood bid coupon interest rate maturity and yield   bond tables clearly lay those out and if you 're talking about government bonds a lot of things like do n't apply although default is still a concern this might be overly simplistic but i view etf 's primarily as an easy way to bring somewhat esoteric instruments like grain futures into the easily available markets of nasdaq and the nyse that they got enhanced with leveraged funds and the such is interesting but perhaps not the original intent of the instrument   complicating your situation a bit more is the fee that gets tacked onto the etf even vanguard government bond funds hang out north of 0.1 that 's not huge but it 's not particularly appealing either considering that unlike rounding up live cattle futures it 's not that much work to buy us government bonds so the expense might not seem worth it to someone who 's comfortable purchasing the securities directly   i 'd be interested to see someone else 's view on this but in general i 'd say that if you know what you want and know how to buy it the government bond etf becomes a lot less relevant as the liquidity offered including the actual ease of transacting seem to to be the biggest factors in favor from investopedia 's description the bond etf is an exciting new addition to the bond market offering    an excellent alternative to self directed investors who looking for    ease of trading and increased price transparency want to practice    indexing or active bond trading however bond etfs are suitable for    particular strategies if for instance you are looking to create a    specific income stream bond etfs may not be for you be sure to    compare your alternatives before investing

first do n't owe much money on a car that 's out of warranty   if you have an engine blow up and repairs will cost the lion 's share of the car 's value the entire car loan immediately comes due because the collateral is now worthless   this puts you in a very miserable situation because you must pay off the car suddenly while also securing other transportation   second watch for possible early payment penalties   they are cheaper than paying interest but run the numbers   their purpose is to repay the lender the amount of money they already paid out to the dealer in sales commission or kickback for referring the loan   the positive effects you want for your credit report only require an open loan owing more money does n't help it hurts   however interest is proportional to principal owed so a $ 10,000 car loan is 10 times the interest cost of a $ 1000 car loan   that means paying most of it off early can fulfill your purpose as the car is nearer payoff you can reduce costs further assuming you handle the hit by increasing the deductible on collision and comprehensive fire and theft auto insurance   it 's not just you paying more co pay it also means the insurance company does n't have to deal with smaller claims at all e.g. with a $ 1000 files a claim on an $ 800 repair   if the amount you owe is small compared to its value and within $ 1000 2000 of paid off the lender may be ok with you dropping collision and comprehensive coverage altogether assuming you are   all of this adds up to paying most of it off but not all may be the way to go you could also talk to your lender about paying say 3/4 of it off and refinancing the rest as a 12-month deal

some thoughts on your questions in order duration you might want to look at the longest dated option often a leap for a couple reasons one is that transaction costs spread plus commission especially spread are killer on options so a longer option means fewer transactions since you do n't have to keep rolling the option two is that any fundamentals based views on stocks might tend to require 3 5 years to relatively reliably work out so if you 're a fundamental investor a 3 6 month option is n't great over 3 6 months momentum short term news short etc can often dominate fundamentals in determining the price one exception is if you just want to hedge a short term event such as a pending announcement on drug approval or something and then you would buy the shortest option that still expires after the event but options are usually super expensive when they span an event like this strike strike price on a long option can be thought of as a tradeoff between the max loss and minimizing insurance costs that is if you buy a deeply in the money put or call the time value will be minimal and thus you are n't paying so much for insurance but you may have 1/3 or 1/2 of the value of the underlying tied up in the option and subject to loss if you buy a put or call at the money then you might have only say 10 of the value of the underlying tied up in the option and subject to loss but almost the whole 10 may be time value insurance cost so you are losing 10 if the underlying stock price stays flat i think of the deep in the money options as similar to buying stocks on margin but the implied interest costs may be less than consumer margin borrowing rates and for long options you ca n't get a margin call the at the money options are more like buying insurance and it 's expensive the commissions and spreads add significant cost on top of the natural time value cost of the option the annual costs would generally exceed the long run average return on a diversified stock fund which is daunting undervalued overvalued options pt 1 first thing is to be sure the options prices on a given underlying make sense at all there are things that should hold for example a synthetic long or short should match up to an actual long or short these kinds of rules can break for example on linkedin after its ipo when shorting was not permitted the synthetic long was quite a bit cheaper than a real long usually though this happens because the arbitrage is not practical for example on the shares to short were n't really available so people doing synthetic shorts with options were driving up the price of the synthetic short and down the price of the synthetic long if you did actually want to be long the stock then the synthetic long was a great deal however a riskless arbitrage buy synthetic long short the stock was not possible and that 's why the prices were messed up another basic relationship that should hold is put call parity undervalued overvalued options pt 2 assuming the relationship to the underlying is sane synthetic positions equivalent to actual positions then the valuation of the option could focus on volatility that is the time value of the option implies the stock will move a certain amount if the time value is high and you think the stock wo n't move much you might short the option while if the time value is low and you think the stock will move a lot you might buy the option you can get implied volatility from your broker perhaps or for example has a bunch of data on option prices and the implied components of the price model i do n't know how useful this really is though the spreads on options are so wide that making money on predicting volatility better than the market is pretty darn hard that is the spread probably exceeds the amount of the mispricing the price of the underlying is more important to the value of an option than the assumed volatility how many contracts each contract is 100 shares so you just match that up if you want to hedge 100 shares buy one contract to get the notional value of the underlying multiply by 100 so say you buy a call for $ 30 and the stock is trading at $ 100 then you have a call on 100 shares which are currently priced at $ 10,000 and the option will cost $ 30 you are leveraged about 3 to 1 this points to an issue with options for individual investors which is that one contract is a pretty large notional value relative to most portfolios

this is your best answer so far a detail left out is that derivatives are mostly known for the amount of leverage allowed which is typically about 20 1 or 5 down this is legal because it 's generally assumed that someone is not going to buy or sell the underlying asset that they will offset their long or short position long before the contract 's delivery date your derivative futures instead of forwards because they 're a standardized size traded on an exchange and more liquid will call you when you lose about half of your 5 to tell you to either transfer some money to cover your position or to ask you to exit your position at a loss   are traded through clearinghouses not exchanges and they can be for any underlying asset for any delivery date for any price so long as parties agree on it just think of it as a contract

i ca n't address the psychology of trust involved in your question but here are some common sense guidelines for dealing with your issue make sure you know who you are talking to   call the company you need to speak to via a publicly available phone number an email or something you got in a letter might be from a different source   if you use a website you should be sure you are on the correct website keep careful records   make good notes of each phone call and keep all emails and letters forever note the time name and/or id of the person you spoke to and numbers called in addition to keeping notes on what actions should be done   keep your transmission receipts and shipping tracking numbers too if you are nervous ask them why they want the info   the fraud department should be able to explain it to you   for example they probably want your social because that is how your credit report is identified   if they are going to fix a credit report they will need a social   it is doubtful they would have a good explanation why they need your mother 's name ask for secure transmission or confirm they have it   postal mail is n't so secure but i 'll go out on a limb and say most fax machines today are not really fax machines but software that deals in pdfs   at some point you will have to realize you will have to transmit something   no method is perfect but you can limit your exposure help them do their jobs   if you are understandably nervous consider their motivations corporate profit   but that could very well mean not running afoul of the law and with any luck treating customers the best way they know to earn business   if you the fraud department how can they help you if the id theft was serious enough document your issue for future law enforcement so you getting pulled over for speeding does n't result in you going to jail for whatever crime the other person did   perhaps the fraud department you are dealing with can assist there finally while you work with fraud departments to clear up your name and account work on the other end to limit future damage   freeze your credit   see if you bank or credit card have monitoring   use creditkarma.com or a similar if you can not find a free service   please do n't ever pay for credit monitoring

the price of the last trade is the price of the last trade it indicates what one particular buyer and seller agreed upon there is absolutely no requirement that one of them did n't offer too much or demand too little so this is nearly meaningless as an indication of what anyone else will be willing to offer or demand an average of trades across a sufficiently large number of transactions might indicate a rough consensus about the value of a stock but transactions will be clustered around that average and the average itself moves over time either you offer to sell or buy at a particular price wait for that price and risk the transaction not taking place at all if nobody agrees or you do a spot transaction and get the best price at that which may not be the best in the next or you tell the broker what the limits are that you consider acceptable trading these risks off against each other pick the one which comes closest to your intent and ignore the fact that others may be getting a slightly different price that 's just the way the market works if his price is lower why did n't you buy it there he 's out of stock well come back when i 'm out of stock and i 'll be unable to sell it to you for an even better price

when i first started working in finance i was given a rule of thumb to decide which price you will get in the market you will always get the worst price for your deal so when buying you get the higher ask price and when selling you get the lower bid price i like to think of it in terms of the market as a participant who always buys at the lowest price they can i.e. buys from you and sells at the highest price they can if that were n't true there would be an arbitrage opportunity and free money never exists for long

i am sorry to say you are asking the wrong question if i own a rental that i bought with cash i have zero mortgage the guy i sell it to uses a hard money lender charging a high rate and finances 100 all of this means nothing to the prospective tenant   in general one would look at the rent to buy ratio in the area and decide whether homes are selling for a price that makes it profitable to buy and then rent out   in your situation i understand you are looking to decide on a rent based on your costs that ship has sailed you own already you need to look in the area and find out what your house will rent for and that number will tell you whether you can afford to treat it as a rental or would be better off selling   keep in mind you do n't list a country but if you are in us part of a rental property is that you must depreciate it each year this is a tax thing you reduce your cost basis each year and that amount is a loss against income from the rental or might be used against your ordinary income but when you sell your basis is lower by this amount and you will be taxed on the difference from your basis to the sale price   edit after reading op 's updated question let me answer this way there are experts who suggest that a rental property should have a high enough rent so that 50 of rent covers expenses this does n't include the mortgage e.g. $ 1500 rent $ 750 goes to taxes insurance maintenance repairs etc the remaining $ 750 can be applied to the mortgage and what remains is cash profit   no one can give you more than a vague idea of what to look for because you have n't shared the numbers what are your taxes insurance annual costs for landscaping snow plowing then take every item that has a limited life and divide the cost by its lifetime e.g. $ 12,000 roof over 20 years is $ 600 do this for painting and every appliance then allow a 10 vacancy rate if you cover all of this and the mortgage it may be worth keeping since you have zero equity time is on your side the price may rise and hopefully the monthly payments chip away at the loan

generally speaking no person or program is really going to be able to help you lower your current tax burden most tax decisions are done well before you reach the tax time you either qualify for the deduction credit or your do n't where a good accountant will really be able to help you out is in planning that will limit your future tax burden particularly if you run a small business or are very wealthy you will probably want to consider using an accountant i would always avoid the large scale tax prep places like hr block they provide the same or lower quality service for a higher price than the software i run a small business and do my own taxes using turbo tax but my business is n't overly complex sole prop no employees couple 1099 's simple expenses nothing to amortize etc

the answer depends on the specific instrument to which you are referring it is possible to make straight bets that are cash settled and in which the underlying commodity or instrument will never be bought or sold   it is also possible to have such a contract be settled in the underlying if the cash value is appropriate then the cash settlement can be used to purchase the underlying directly if necessary   physical delivery was predominant until the last few decades   most traders as opposed to or are going to prefer cash settled contracts as opposed to physical delivery it is possible to make trades with a brokerage firm such that the firm pays if the trader wins the bet   the firm will typically find parties on the other side to even out this bet and leave itself neutral as to the outcome plus a small premium it charges each side for the cost of making the market   the cost charged to one contracting party should be set by the dealer in relation to prices being charged to parties making the opposite matching bet in this way brokers are following market price while traders are setting it financially options and contracts can be settled for cash or for the underlying and they can be made directly with the opposite or with a neutral dealer

numbers estimate you still owe around 5 interest per month payment initial price down payment payments made none of these mean anything   ask your lender what is the payoff of the current loan next sell or trade the current vehicle compare to the amount owed any shortfall has to be repaid out of pocket or in some cases added to the price of the new car and included in the principal of the new loan   you can not calculate how much you still owe the way you have because it totally ignores interest advice on practicality   do n't do this   you will be upside down even worse on the new car from the instant you drive off the lot   sell the current vehicle find a way to pay the difference one that does n't involve financing cut your losses on the upside down vehicle then purchase a new vehicle i 'm in the pay cash for gently used school ymmv another option is to go to your bank   refinance your car now to get a lower interest rate   pay as much of the principal as you can   keep that car until it is paid off   then you will not be upside down if you 're asking how to use the estimator on the webpage   put the payoff in the downpayment as a negative and the trade in value in the trade in spot   expect the payment to go up significantly    another opinion that might be practical advice   nothing we say here will convince your financially responsible spouse that this is a good idea

gt well if you only own the option you are only limited to loosing the premium with futures at least with the brokers i talked to most of the time you need to sign a margin contract just to trade futures i do n't want to go into debt and i do n't think i would do too well to be fairly honest   this is n't how margin works your broker would demand more money before coming back to you   gt   i am a college student and want to limit my risk   yet you 're talking about things that are very risky and that you do n't take seriously   gt   to me honest if i had my way i would just buy and hold and that is the strategy i want to emulate closest   why are n't you buying and holding equities funds why not have your way   gt basically i want to avoid debt but still trade commodities    margin in futures is n't a loan it 's the fraction of the value of a contract you actually pay there 's no borrowing involved   if you want less risk do n't get the maximum you can but rather have cash reserves   you do not sound like you are in a position to be investing in these sorts of instruments at all

i know this may be difficult for you and like so many other people pointed out here you either only read what you want or do not comprehend what you read    i was specifically talking about ms the entire time never said anything about the bakery you are referencing so once again you are making a moot point with your protected class information i was talking about how the entire state was burned in reddit when some bigoted business owners decided to not do business with people about 8 months ago   again just because you think something should be some way does n't mean it is wish and hope all you want to but until the law says they are protected they are not so again what paypal did is not different than what the businesses in ms did but your type of people had the opposite reaction then than you do now and i was merely trying to point it out like almost everyone else you are arguing with in this thread has tried to but fell on deaf ears they are the same but they do not match your opinion so you put up you blinders and shove your fingers in your ears while screaming like a child at anyone trying to point out a fallacy in your logic    also what does my politics have to do with this i hate to burst your bubble but i 'm not libertarian regardless it does not matter you bring up politics as if it would effect me by you calling me libertarian why just because my opinion is different you automatically call me out as insert political party here that does not agree with you to try and invalidate anything i 'm saying    well i 'm done it is pointless to try and tell you anything that differs from your opinion i grow tired of telling you the same thing over and over again especially when you apparently do not read replies or skip over any part that you disagree with good luck with your line of thinking hopefully one day someone like paypal does not block your business or a business you do business with because it differs from their opinion your opinion now aligns with theirs but what happens next time it does n't and they have the same kind of power let them do it once next time you well not have a choice   do n't worry about replying i 'm no longer interested in hearing your opinion as i have now made up my mind that you are small minded and lack basic thought required to see past your immediate fields of view    they are burning someone else now eventually they well burn you since you are so happy to let them do it too someone else do n't make a stand now they will not let you make a stand later

to be fair i do n't necessarily think that our guy was actively trying to screw us over in retrospect i 've known a few people like him people with major control issues who get extremely anxious and when something is n't in their hands and who kind of develop this authoritarian mindset because they do n't trust the group as a whole that leads to a lot of paranoia and projection i think he kind of developed a sort of oh no i think he 's gon na kill me well i 'll kill him first mentality and that affected his thinking   every complaint he brought up privately with our president was something he was actually the one bringing to the table they think i 'm power hungry actually we did n't but thank god we found out that he actually was before it was too late they do n't trust me as the executive to make the decisions he seemed to be the strongest and guiding voice in the meetings but apparently was n't actually or expressing any of his actual plans because he did n't trust us to know them they 're gon na cut and run and we 'll be left to keep things together he set of a chain of events which led to us having to to get everything out of his name in order to keep our original timetable after this all went down it came to light how absurdly and specific his fears were down to my wife for being controlling or something because i wanted to discuss my portion of the buy in with her before i paid it when he 'd never even met her   anyway i 've had actual adult bosses like this and they invariably find ways of bringing people down over little personal disagreements regardless of how well they 're performing the paranoia and ego driving things for that personality type can be hard to see at first because they 're invariably charismatic and on message and capable of really looking like they 're taking the whole of the picture into account before making reasoned suggestions and you need somebody with these skills for top leadership positions i do have a measure of pity for these people as they seem to live in a state of really subtle but profound internal dissonance that nobody else really gets a look at   the main problem here is that it 's easy to conflate image with substance as you have to have a fair amount of knowledge about the topic being discussed to parse their behavior and especially once a large power structure around the guy the of can really build which makes it tough to distinguish between a well reasoned interpretation of reality and a specious one well our last meeting with the new structure was great and we 're more excited than ever about getting started with less baggage

the current stock price you 're referring to is actually the price of the last trade   it is a historical price but during market hours that 's usually mere seconds ago for very liquid stocks whereas the bid and ask are the best potential prices that buyers and sellers are willing to transact at the bid for the buying side and the ask for the selling side   but think of the bid and ask prices you see as tip of the iceberg prices   that is the bid is an indication that there are potential buyers bidding $ for up to 200 shares   their bids are the highest currently bid and there are others in line behind with lower bid prices   so the bid you 're seeing is actually the best bid price at that moment   if you entered a market order to sell more than 200 shares part of your order would likely be filled at a lower price the ask is an indication that there are potential sellers asking $ for up to 1000 shares   their ask prices are the lowest currently asked and there are others in line behind with higher ask prices   so the ask you 're seeing is the best asking price at that moment   if you entered a market order to buy more than 1000 shares part of your order would likely be filled at a higher price a transaction takes place when either a potential buyer is willing to pay the asking price or a potential seller is willing to accept the bid price or else they meet in the middle if both buyers and sellers change their orders note there are primarily two kinds of stock exchanges   the one i just described is a typical order driven matched bargain market and perhaps the kind you 're referring to the other kind is a quote driven over the counter market where there is a market maker as johnfx already mentioned   in those cases the spread between the bid ask goes to the market maker as compensation for making a market in a stock   for a liquid stock that is easy for the market maker to turn around and buy sell to somebody else the spread is small narrow   for illiquid stocks that are harder to deal in the spread is larger wide to compensate the market maker having to potentially carry the stock in inventory for some period of time during which there 's a risk to him if it moves in the wrong direction     finally if you wanted to buy 1000 shares you could enter a market order in which case as described above you 'll pay $   if you wanted to buy your shares at no more than $ instead i.e. the so called current price then you would enter a limit order for 1000 shares at $   and more to the point your order would become the new highest bid price until somebody else accepts your bid for their shares   of course there 's no guarantee that with a limit order that you will get filled your order could expire at the end of the day if nobody accepts your bid

if your uncle is looking to maintain life insurance coverage for specific shorter period of time he may want to look into hybrid life insurance if you buy a hybrid universal life policy the premium and death benefit can be guaranteed to last until any age since most permanent policies focus on cash value accumulation it is hard for most people to find cheap whole life or affordable universal life consumers only looking for a longer duration have a more flexible choice with a new hybrid product that combines elements of both term life coverage and universal life hybrid universal   policies are much cheaper then other permanent coverage such as whole life coverage because they do not emphasize cash value accumulation however the premiums and death benefits can still be guaranteed to a specific age i.e. 85 90 95 100 so premiums can be scaled to coordinate with your desired budget and the face amount required for your family typical universal life and whole life insurance contracts only allow for lifetime coverage however hybrid universal life offers a much smaller premium because the coverage can be into a specific age if the does live beyond the originally selected age the death benefit will simply begin getting smaller while the original premium will   continue to remain the same

as an addition to chris rea 's excellent answer these tender offers are sometimes made specifically to cast doubt on the current market price for instance a large public company that contracts with a smaller supplier or service company also public might make a tender offer below market price the market will look at this price and the business relationship and wonder what the larger company knows about the smaller one that they do n't now what happens when investors lose confidence in a stock they sell it supply goes up demand goes down and the price drops the company making the tender offer can then get its shares either way directly via the offer or on the open market this is however usually not successful beyond the very short term and typically only works because the company making a tender offer is the gorilla which can dictate its own terms with practically anyone else it meets such offers are also very closely watched by the sec if there 's any hint that the larger company is acting in a predatory manner or that its management is using the power and information of the company to profit themselves the strategy will backfire as the larger company finds itself the target of sec and doj legal proceedings

significant moral hazard is something to consider if you want to help someone give them a gift make sure everyone knows that it is a gift with no strings attached and move on that 's charity and it 's a great thing if a medical emergency pops up and he 's poor the government already provides the safety net we 're all paying for of course setting something like you suggest up creates expectations that 's why welfare programs are universally detrimental to the individual why work when someone else is going to give me money every month that 's basic human nature

outstanding principal balance is the amount you owe at any given time not including the amount of interest you need to pay as soon as possible the capitalized interest shown is consistent with an average of 13.5 months between when each dollar is borrowed and when the repayment period begins suppose you borrow the first half of the money on september 1 2017 and the second half of the money on february 1 2017 5 months later   at that point half the money has been accruing interest for 5 months   on january 1 2018 half the money accrued interest for 16 months and half the money accrued interest for 11 months   the lender now expects you to start repaying the loan with the first payment due at the end of january 2018 or the beginning of february 2018   if you make the minimum payments on time the lender expects you to make 120 monthly payments   the last monthly payment would be at the end of december or the beginning of january the lender or the website should provide details about the actual payment plan grace periods provisions for handling inability to pay due to unemployment and other terms in the united states most installment loans pretend that for purposes of calculating interest every month has 30 days even february and july   each month 1/12 of the annual percentage rate apr is charged as interest   if you do the compounding a 6.8 percent apr corresponds to 1 + 1 = percent annual percentage yield apy also the apr is understated   the 6.8 percent applies to the full balance including the loan fees even though the borrower only gets the amount minus the loan fees   the 6.8 percent rate is useful for doing calculations after the loan fees have been charged though   these calculations include the capitalized interest and the monthly payment amounts a true calculation of the apr would take the loan fees into account and give a higher number than 6.8 percent   but the corrected apr would not be useful for calculating the capitalized interest nor for calculating the monthly payment amounts

your goal of wanting to eliminate your debts early is great generally you can save more money by paying off loans with higher interest rates first however it sounds like you are excited about the idea of eliminating one of your car loans in two months   there is nothing wrong with that it is good to be excited about eliminating debt   i like your plan pay off the $ loan first then apply the $ monthly payment to the $ loan   you 'll have that loan paid off almost 3 years early   perhaps you 'll find some additional money to apply to it and get rid of it even earlier after you 've eliminated both car loans save up that $ 1000/month for your next car   that will allow you to pay cash for it which will allow you to negotiate the best price and save interest   0 loans are not free money other answers will tell you to wait as long as possible to pay off your 0 loan but i think there can be good reasons to eliminate smaller loans first regardless of interest

first and foremost it 's about changing habits   it seems like you 've learned a painful lesson with the car financing   that 's a good start   i 'd work on developing the habit of making a budget every month before you spend a penny as for this money i would pay off the apple loan and put the rest in savings   then pay off the entire credit card balance the month before the rate increases the point of putting the money in savings is not about making the small amount of interest   you need to get in the habit of having money in an emergency fund and paying for unexpected emergencies out of that not just throwing it on a credit card   ideally budget over the next few months to pay off the credit card out of your income not out of savings

wow first congratulations you are both making great money you should be able to reach your goals   are we on the right track are we doing any mistakes which we could have avoided please advice if there is something that we should focus more into i would prioritize as follows get on the same page my first red flag is that you are listing your assets separately you and your wife own property together and are raising your daughter together the first thing is to both be on the same page with your combined income and assets this is critical set specific goals for the future dreaming and big picture life planning will be the foundation for building a detailed plan for reaching your goals you will see more progress with more sacrifice if you both are not equally excited about the goals you will not both be equally willing to sacrifice lifestyle now you have the income now to be able to set yourselves up to do whatever you want in 10 years if you can agree on what you want hire a financial planner you trust interview people ask someone who is where you want to be in 10 years you need someone with experience that can guide you through these questions and understands how to manage your income stream start saving for retirement in tax advantaged accounts this should be as much as of your income combined so $ per year you need to start diversifying your investments real estate is great but i would never recommend it as this large a percentage of net worth start saving for your child 's education hard to say what you need here since i do n't know your goals a financial planner should assist you with this get rid of your debt out of your $ 2.1 m of rental real estate and land you have $ 1.4 m of debt it will be difficult to start a business with that much additional debt it will also put stress on your retirement that you do n't need you are taking on lots of risk here i would sell all but maybe one of the properties and let it cash flow this will free up cash to start investing for retirement or future business too buy more rental in the future with cash only you have plenty of income to do it this way and you will be setting yourself up for a great future at this point you can continue to pile funds into any all your investments with the goal of using the funds to start a business or to live on if all your investments are tied up in real estate you wo nt have anything to draw on if needed for a business opportunity you need to weigh this out in your goal and planning what should we do to prepare for a comfortable retirement and safety you can not plan for or see all scenarios however good planning will give you more options and more choices investing driven by fear will set you up for failure   spend less than you make be patient be generous cheers

first of all congrats very nice work indeed   secondly i do not offer this as legal advise lol anyhow you need to make sure to hang on to as much as possible being a single earner our uncle sam is going to want what 's due that being said you should probably look into investments for starters purchase a primary residence or start a business or purchase a primary residence and use that as a business residence both what you basically want are write offs you need to bring your taxable income as low as possible so you pay minimal taxes in your case you 're in danger of paying a hefty sum in taxes i 'm sure you can shield yourself with various business expenses a car workplace computers etc that you could benefit from both professionally and individually and then seriously bro making 250k leads me to believe you 've got at least more than half a brain and that you 're using more than half of that so dude get an accountant and one you can trust ask your parents colleagues people you 've worked with in the past etc there are professionals who are equally as talented in helping you keep your money as you are in making it you could get married make sure your wife stays at home and start popping out kids asap those keep my taxable and excess income pretty low lol i 'm going to add to this as a contractor i 've generally put any estimated taxes into some kind of interest accruing account so i can at least make a little money before i have to give it away in your case i 'd say put away at least 2/3 's into some kind of interest earning account start by talking to your personal banker wherever your money is you 'll be surprised at how nice they treat you you are going to have to pay taxes so until you do try to make a little money while it sits   again nice problem to have

as stated in the other answer debit card payments even contactless ones do not debit instantly or anywhere near instantly they can take several days or even longer however the fact that the payment was approved would indicate that the contactless device used by the retailer managed to connect to your bank account and could see there were sufficient funds   at this time the payment should also have reserved the funds so it will be pending as such   your online banking may not show all types of pending transactions it may only show direct debits for example if you ring the bank i expect they will be able to see this payment and advise accordingly out of interest who do you bank with if you can see your available funds you should find that includes this payment having been reserved ie you ca n't use that money but if it 's a small amount you may struggle to spot it   again this will vary by bank and how their internet banking system has been implemented i would expect this payment to debit your account the working day after you made it or at worst the day after that   in theory with faster payment technology it could happened within 2 hours but not all banks implemented that system in the same way so delays can and do occur   if the retailer merchant banks with the same bank you do in theory the transaction could be instantaneous again depending on the bank short answer short the transaction is fine it wo n't be void you just need to wait probably a day or two this link has more info especially useful if you bank with natwest as i say the technology is likely to vary by bank to some extent   your own bank should have their own version of this

banks are currently a lot less open to creative financing than they were a few years ago but you may still be able to take advantage of the tactic of splitting the loan into two parts a smaller second mortgage sometimes called a purchase money second at a slightly higher interest rate for around 15 20 of the value and the remaining in a conventional mortgage   since this tactic has been around for a long time it 's not quite in the category of the they were pulling a few years back so has a lot more potential to still be an option   i did this in for my first house in 93 and again in 99 when i moved to a larger home after getting married   it allowed me to get into both houses with less than 20 down and not pay pmi this way neither loan is above 80 so you do n't have to pay pmi   the interest on the second loan will be higher but usually only a few percent and is thus usually a fraction of what you were paying for the pmi and it 's deductible from your taxes if you 've been making your payments on time and have a good credit rating then you might be able to find someone who would offer you such a deal   you might even be able to get a rate for your primary that is down in the low 4 's depending on where rates are today and what your credit rating is like    if you can get the main loan low enough even if the other is like say 7 your blended rate may still be right around 5 if you can find a deal like this it 's also great material to use to negotiate with your current lender either help me get the pmi off this loan or i 'm going to refinance   then you can compare what they will offer you with what you can get in a refinance and decide what makes the most sense for you   on word of warning when refinancing do not get sucked into an adjustable rate mortgage   if you are finding life tight right now with house payments and all the an arm could be highly since they often offer a very low initial rate however then invariably adjust upwards and you could suddenly find yourself with a monster payment far larger than what you have now   with low rates where they are getting a conventional fixed rate loan or loans in the case of the tactic being discussed here is the way to go

why not just get a consolidated loan for 15 k and then $ 20 k zero transfer the loan will have a payoff on the amount borrowed probably a fixed payment which would be more than double the payment as if it were only $ 15 k to start that make sense   if you are approved for both pieces of this it should help what is going to be the rate on the loan   the process you are starting has 3 aspects cut spending reduce interest minimize payment obligations if you do anything to earn more even a few hours a week it will add up   i would not reduce any credit lines in a perfect world you will have a buffer of money to cover any expense until then available access to money is important but of course to be used either for emergencies or when cash is there to pay the bill in full when it comes in

you do n't start out buying a shopping mall you have to work up to it   you can start with any amount and work up to a larger amount for me i saved 30 of my investing in stocks for 8 years   it was tough to live on less but i had a goal to buy passive income   i put down this money to buy 3 houses putting 35 down and maintaining enough cash to make 5 years of payments   i rented out the houses making a cap of 15   the cap is the net payment per year cost of the property where the net accounts for taxes and repairs   i did not spend any of the profits but i did start saving less salary   after 5 years of appreciation mortgage payments and rental profit i sold one house to get a loan for a convenience store   buildings go on the market all the time it takes 14 years to directly recoup an investment at a 7 cap which is the average for a commercial property sale   many people cash out for this reason it 's slow but steady growth though the earnings on property appreciation is a nice bonus   owning real estate is a long term game after a long time of earning you can reinvest but it comes with the risk of bad or no tenants you can start both slower and smaller just make sure you 're picking up assets not liabilities   like investing in cars is generally bad unless you are sure it will appreciate

a credit card is a way to borrow money that 's all sometimes the loans are very small $ 5 and sometimes they are larger you can have a credit card with a company bank or whatever that you have no other relationship with they 're not a property of a bank account they are their own thing the card you describe sounds exactly like a debit card here and you can treat your canadian debit card like your french credit card you pay for things directly from your bank account assuming the money is in there in canada many small stores take debit but not credit so do be sure to get a debit card and not only a credit card now as to your specific concerns you are n't going to forget to make a wire you 're going to get a bill perhaps a paper one perhaps an email and it will say here is everything you charged on your credit card this month along with a date which will be perhaps 21 days from the statement date not the date you used the card pay the entire balance not just the minimum payment by that date and you 'll pay no interest the bill date will be a specific date each month eg the 23rd so you can set yourself a reminder to check and pay your bill once a month building a credit history has value if you want to borrow a larger amount of money to buy a car or a house or to start a business unlike the us it does n't really have an impact on things like getting a job if you use your card for groceries you use it enough no worries in 5 years it is nice to look back and see never paid late mostly paid the entire amount each month never went over limit never went into collections and so on in my experience you can tell they like you because they keep raising your limit without you asking them to if you want to buy a $ 2500 item and your credit limit is $ 1500 you could prepay $ 1000 onto the credit card and then use it or you could tell the vendor you 'd rather use your debit card or you could pay $ 1500 on the credit card and then rest with your debit card lots of options in my experience once you get up to that kind of money they 'd rather not use a credit card because of the merchant fees they pay

when coming to that conclusion you only consider half of the facts yes all money is debt   but what you miss is that there are other values and assets out there not just money these actually match each other to some degree if the value of all these other assets grow at the same pace as the money supply then there will be a balance   if one grows faster than the other there will be inflation or deflation at least there should be which is the problem not understood

my theory if you must be in debit own it at the least expense possible the interest you will pay by the end combined with the future value of money example the future value of $ 3000 at an effective interest rate of 5 after 3 years = $ present value of $ 3000 at 5 over 3 years = $ you will need more money in the future to pay for the same item

this is a good idea but it will barely affect your credit score at all   credit cards while a good tool to use for giving a minor boost to your credit score and for purchasing things while also building up rewards with those purchases are n't very good for building credit    this is because when banks calculate your credit report they look at your long term credit history and weigh larger longer term debt much higher than short term debt that you pay off right away   while having your credit card is better than nothing it 's a relatively small drop in the pond when it comes to credit    i would still recommend getting a credit card though it will if you have n't already started paying off a debt like a student or car loan give you a credit identity and rewards depending on the credit card you choose   but if you do do not ever let yourself fall into delinquency   failing to pay off loans will damage your credit score   so if you do plan to get a credit card it is much better to do as you 've said and pay it all off as soon as possible    edit   in addition to the above using a credit card has the added benefit of having greater security over debit cards and ensures that your own money wo n't be stolen though you will still have to report a fraudulent charge

bid and ask prices are the highest buy price and lowest sell price in the market which does n't mean one must only buy sell at prices that said one can buy sell at whatever price they so wish although doing it at any other price than the bid ask is usually harder as other market participants will to the bid ask price so in theory you can buy at ask and sell at bid whether or not your order will be filled is another matter altogether

you 're missing the concept of systemic risk which is the risk of the entire market or an entire asset class diversification is about achieving a balance between risk and return that 's appropriate for you your investment in vanguard 's fund although diversified between many public companies is still restricted to one asset class in one country yes you lower your risk by investing in all of these companies but you do n't erase it entirely   clearly there is still risk despite your diversification you may decide that you want other investments or a different asset allocation that reduce the overall risk of your portfolio over the long run you may earn a high level of return but never forget that there is still risk involved bonds seem pretty worthless at least until i retire according to your profile you 're about my age our cohort will probably begin retiring sometime around 2050 or later and no one knows what the bond market will look like over the next 40 years we may have forecasts for the next few years but not for almost four decades writing off an entire asset class for almost four decades does n't seem like a good idea also bonds are like equity and all other asset classes in that there are different levels of risk within the asset class too when calculating the overall risk return profile of my portfolio i certainly do n't consider treasuries as the same risk level as corporate bonds or high yield or junk bonds from abroad   depending on your risk preferences you may find that an asset allocation that includes us and/or international bonds fixed income international equities real estate and cash to make rebalancing your asset allocation easier reduces your risk to levels you 're willing to tolerate while still allowing you to achieve returns during periods where one asset class e.g. equities is losing value or performing below your expectations

ultimately money derives its value from being spend on a good or service investing it is an act of denying your present self a good or service so that your future self can obtain hopefully more goods or services investing is a sensible and responsible default position but you clearly have passed the point at which the opportunity cost of the dollar not spent today is greater than its benefit in the future not all dollars are the same remember that money is a temporary store of value but you have to spend it to realize that value in your search learn about the psychology of money what are you saving it for how much do you want left over when you die if you die tomorrow will you regret not having spend a little more i 'm sorry to get morbid on you but saving for the future requires answering the question how long and it 's never forever this may be tangential but it shaped my behaviour towards money nonetheless frank on the psychology of time i would hazard a guess and say that you land in the future oriented camp

someone 's or a bank 's exposure to equities refers to the amount of value which has a risk that fluctuates with the equities market ie the stock market in very broad terms i think it might make sense to say that exposure to equities could mean for example owning many rental properties if the rental market was highly correlated with the equities market that is if house prices go down when the equities market goes down and if that relationship is very strong then owning a house means you are exposed to the equities market   however in the sense it is used there it seems to mean direct exposure to equities ie owning stocks and stock based funds

the government could actually do either one to expand the money supply as necessary to keep up with rising productivity an increased labor supply   the question is merely political in the case of the us printing money involves convincing politicians to spend it   while we currently run a deficit there is a large lobby within the us who are incredibly anti deficit and are fighting against this for no good reason   if the money supply were left in their hands we would end up with a shrinking money supply and rapid deflation on the other hand the fed can simply bypass the politicians and control the money supply directly by issuing bonds   it 's easier for them they do n't have to explain it to voters only to economists and it gives them more direct control without any messy political considerations like which programs to expand or cut

from your question it seems your problem is that you have a company that wants to make a deal but does not currently have enough money to go through with it therefore it needs to raise capital assuming that you can not get a loan from a bank and you do not want to seek funding from other sources the two owners must provide the funds themselves somehow option a the easiest and fairest way to do this is for the two shareholders to provide 75 and 25 of the funding as a loan to the company they will provide this loan knowing it may not be paid back if the company goes under note that it would not be fair for one of the shareholders to provide more as that shareholder would be taking all the risk while the other still the rewards although you could add a large interest rate to account for this option b but say one of the shareholders can not provide additional funds in that case the company should issue new shares and each shareholder can purchase however many of the new shares he she wants each shareholder is entitled to purchase at least 75 or 25 respectively but does not have to the result of this may be that company ownership percentages have changed after the capital raising this is more complex as it require valuing the company accurately to be fair and probably requires reporting to a government depending on the jurisdiction

i 'd contact paypal to request clarification   in the meantime most banks will credit outgoing transfers immediately but process later and only debit incoming after it passes through a processing team so while the money will go out right away it may take a few days for your bank to actually process the withdrawal and the subsequent reversal from paypal in reality paypal does n't usually recieve the money immediately either but they extend you credit to speed up things either way it does n't hurt to contact paypal to make sure they have reverted the amount to your bank and if they confirm such you can also reach out to your bank and ask where the money is stuck usually delays like this will happen in the interface between two unrelated financial institutions

there are two issues here arithmetic and psychology scenario 1 you are presently paying an extra $ 500 per month on your student loan above the minimum payments your credit card company offers a $ 4000 cash advance at 0 for 8 months so you take the cash advance pay it toward the student loan and then instead of paying the extra $ 500 per month toward the student loan you use that $ 500 for 8 months to repay the cash advance net result you pay 0 interest on the loan and save roughly 8 months times $ 4000 times the interest on the student loan divided by two i say divided by two because it 's not the difference between $ 4000 and zero but between $ 4000 and the $ 500 you would have been paying off each month clearly you are better off if you are not presently paying an extra $ 500 on the student loan or even if you are but it is a struggle to come up with the money then the question becomes can you reasonably expect to be able to pay off the credit card before the grace period runs out interest rates on credit cards are normally much higher than interest rates on student loans if you get the cash advance and then ca n't repay it after 8 months you are paying a very steep interest rate and anything you saved on the student loan will quickly be lost what i mean by psychological is that you have to have the discipline to really repay the credit card within the grace period if you 're not very that you can do that this plan could go bad very quickly personally i 've thought about doing things like this many times cash advances against credit cards home equity loans etc all give low interest money that could be used to pay off a higher interest debt but it 's easy to get into trouble doing things like this it 's easy to say to yourself well i do n't need to put all the money toward that other debt i could keep a thousand or so to buy that big screen tv i really need or to fail to pay back the low interest loan on schedule because other things keep coming up that you spend your money on instead whether frivolous luxuries or true emergencies and there 's always the possibility that something will happen to mess up your finances from a big car repair bill to losing your job you do n't want to paint yourself into a corner finally maxing out your credit cards hurts your credit rating the formulas are secret but i understand that if you use more than half your available credit that 's a minus how much it hurts you depends on lots of factors

the fundamental issue with leverage of any sort really is that the amplified downsides are extremely likely to more than cancel out amplified equivalent upsides example without using a major swing 2x leverage on a 5 decline so a 10 decline   the 5 decline needs a increase to get back level   however the 2x leverage needs an increase to get back   so a cycle for the unleveraged returns of -5 + 5.4 would see the unleveraged asset go up by a net + but 2x leverage would leave you at   conversely imagine leverage it 's easy to do that 50 cash allocation after an underlying -5 the leverage needs only + to reach par   this is basically the argument for low volatility funds of course if you can leverage an asset that does n't go down then the leverage is great   and for an asset with an overall positive compound return a little leverage is probably not going to hurt simply because there are likely to be enough upsides to cancel out downsides

if i were you i would rent   wait to buy a home   here is why when you say that renting is equal in cost to a 30-year mortgage you are failing to consider several aspects   see this recent answer for a list of things that need to be considered when comparing buying and renting you have no down payment   between the two of you you have $ 14,000 but this money is needed for both your emergency fund and your fiancée 's schooling in your words we ca n’t afford a home   a home is a big financial commitment   if you buy a home before you are financially ready it will be continuous trouble    if you need a cosigner you are n't ready to buy a home   i would absolutely advise whoever you are thinking about cosigning for you not to do so   it puts them legally on the hook for a house that you ca n't yet afford you are n't married yet   you should never buy something as big as a home with someone you are n't married to there are just too many things that can go wrong   see comments for more explanation   wait until you are married before you buy your income is low right now   and that is okay for now you 've been able to avoid the credit card debt that so many people fall into however you do have student loans to pay and taking on a huge new debt right now would be potentially disastrous for you   your family income will eventually increase when your fiancée gets her degree and gets a job and at that time you will be in a much better situation to consider buying a house you need to move asap buying a house when you are in a hurry is a generally a bad idea when you look for a home you need to take some time looking so you are n't rushed into a bad deal that you will regret even if you decide you want to buy you should first find a place to rent then you can take your time finding the right house   to answer your question about escrow when you own a house two of the required expenses that you will have besides the mortgage payment are property taxes and homeowner 's insurance   these are large payments that are only due once a year   the bank holding the mortgage wants to make sure that they get paid   so to help you budget for these expenses and to ensure that these expenses are paid the bank will add these to your monthly mortgage payment and set them aside in a savings account called an escrow account   then when these bills come due once a year they are paid for out of the escrow account

ianal but as you note when you open a new account they give you temporary checks that are usually blank in the upper left i 've used such checks and the bank has honored them therefore i conclude that there must not be any legal requirement for anything to appear there nor does the bank require it businesses are often reluctant to accept such temporary checks for the obvious reason that anyone could go to the bank open an account with $ 10 write checks for thousands of dollars and disappear at least if they 've waited long enough to get the permanent checks in there 's some reason to believe that they plan to stick around   in any case it 's not clear what you are trying to accomplish you want to hand write either your business name or your personal name depending on whether the check is for personal or business purposes i do n't see what that gains you could always use a personal check for business purposes if you 're afraid someone will say hey that does n't look very professional what kind of fly by night company is this that uses personal checks surely a hand written company name would look even less professional why not just open a business account and have your personal checks printed with your personal name and your business checks with your business name i do n't know where you live but i have a business account on which i pay zero fees the only cost is getting checks printed there 's the small hassle of having to make one trip to the bank to open the account well the biggest hassle i have is that the bank wo n't let me transfer money between my personal and business accounts over the internet so i have to either go to the bank to move money back and forth or i have to write a check from one account to the other and deposit through an atm

what you have suggested would work in spain ireland us even italy but not in greece because the last piece of the cycle of money you outlined earlier would be that greek economy would expand and the government would collect revenues   the problem is that public and private projects in greece are very expensive due to strict labor laws a good chunk of any public money would end up in bank accounts outside greece and the resultant building would be of poor quality and little use in summary the greek government would be even more debt the economy would see very little benefit no increase in tax revenue and you would end up with a useless structure   even if greece had n’t joined the euro it would either suffer from inflation or from a crisis similar to this the global economic crisis has made the situation much worse it is not the cause of the crisis at least for greece

in general scholarship income that you receive that is not used for tuition or books must be included in your gross income and reported as such on your tax return   scholarship income you receive that is used for those kinds of expenses may be from your gross income   see this irs information and this related question i believe that as represented on the 1098-t this generally means that if box 5 scholarships and grants is greater than box 1 or 2 only one of which will be used on your 1098-t you received taxable scholarship income   if box 5 is less than or equal to box 1/2 you did not receive taxable scholarship income   this page draws the same conclusion however you should realize that the 1098-t is not what makes you have to pay or not pay taxes   you incur the taxes by receiving scholarship money and you may reduce your tax liability by paying tuition   the 1098-t is simply a record of payments that have already been made for instance if you received $ 10,000 in scholarship money that is actually received checks for that amount or had that amount deposited into your bank account then your income went up by $ 10,000   if you yourself paid tuition it is likely that you can exclude the amount of the tuition from your taxable income reducing the tax you owe see the irs page linked above   however if you received $ 10,000 in actual money and in addition your tuition was paid by the scholarship with money you never actually had in your own bank account then the entire $ 10,000 would be taxable   you do not give enough information in your question to be sure which of these situations is closer to your own   however you should be able to decide by looking at your bank account look at how much money you received and how much you spent on tuition   if you received more scholarship money than the tuition you paid out of pocket you owe taxes on the remainder   i emphasize that this is just a general rule of thumb and should not be taken as tax advice you should review the irs information and/or consult a tax professional to determine what part of your scholarship income is taxable in addition as this now rather old article from the new york society of cpas notes many colleges and universities prepare incorrectly and report tuition and related expenses   this means you should be careful to reconcile the 1098-t with your own financial records of what money you actually received and paid   when i was in grad school there was a good deal of hand wringing and hair pulling each year among the students as we tried to determine what relationship if any the 1098-t bore to the financial facts

first of all debt is a technology that allows borrower to bring forward their spending it 's a financial time machine from borrowers point of view debt is good when it increases overall economic utility   a young person wants to bring up a family but can not afford the house had they waited for 30 years they would have reached the level of income and savings to buy the house for cash by the time it might be too late to raise a family sure they 'd enjoy the house for the last 20 years of their life but they would loose 30 years of utility they could have enjoyed the house for 50 years so for a reasonable fee they can bring the spending forward   another young person might want to enjoy a life of luxury using the magical debt time machine and bringing forward their future earnings they might spend 10 years worth of future earnings on entertainment within a year and have a blast due to the law of diminishing marginal utility all that utility is pretty much wasted but they 'll still will need to make sacrifices in the future the trick is to roughly match the period of debt repayment to the economic life of the purchase buying a house means paying over 30 years for an asset that has an economic life of 80 given that the interest fee is reasonable and the house wo n't loose it 's value overnight that 's a good debt buying a used car with a remaining life of 5 years and financing its with a seven years loan is not a good idea buying a luxurious holiday that lasts a fortnight with 2 years of repayments i.e. financing non essential short term need with medium term debt is insane the other question is could the required utility be achieved through a substitute at a lower cost without having to bring the spending forward or paying the associated fee

this is really two questions about yield and contents content as others have noted an annuity is a contractual obligation not a portfolio contained within an investment product per se the primary difference between whether an annuity is fixed or variable is what the issuer is guaranteeing and how much risk reward you are sharing in generally speaking the holdings of an issuer are influenced by the average duration of the payments however you can ascertain the assets that back that promise by looking at for example the holdings of a large insurance or securities firm that is why issuers are generally rated as to their financial strength and ability to meet their obligations a number of the market failures you mentioned were in part caused by the failure of these ratings to represent the true financial strength of the firm yield as to the second question of how they can offer a competitive rate there are at least several reasons i am assuming an immediate annuity 1 return of principal the 7 you are being quoted is the percent of your principal that will be returned to you each year not the rate of return being earned by the issuer if you invest $ 100 in the market personally and get a 5 return you have $ 105   however the annuity 's issuer is also returning part of your principal to you each year in your payment as they do n't return your principal when you eventually die because of this they can offer you more each year than they really make in the market what makes a ponzi scheme different is that they are also paying out your principal usually to others but lie to you by telling you it 's still in your account 2 the time value of money a promise to pay you $ 500 tomorrow costs less than $ 500 today a fixed annuity promises to pay you a certain amount of money each year this can be represented as a rate of return calculated based on how much you have to pay to get that annual payment but it is important to remember that the first payment will be worth substantially more in real purchasing power than the last payment you get the longer you live the less your fixed payment is worth in real terms due to inflation in short the rate of return has to be discounted for inflation it is not a real rate of return in other words if you give me $ 500 today and i promise to pay you $ 100 for the next 5 years i am making money not only because i can invest the money between now and then but also because $ 100 will be worth less five years from now than it is today with annuities if you want your payment to rise in step with inflation you have to pay more for that a lot more these are the two main reasons here are a few smaller ones 3 a very long time horizon if the stock market or another asset class is performing well poorly the issuer can often afford to wait much longer to buy or sell than an individual and can take better advantage of historical highs and lows over the long term 4 big boy investing a large financially sound issuer can afford to take risks that an individual can not such as in very large or illiquid assets such as a private company a la warren buffet 5 efficiencies of scale institutional investors have a number of legal advantages over individuals which i wo n't discuss in detail here however they exist large issuers are also often in related business insurance mutual funds such that they can deal in large volumes and form an internal clearinghouse i.e. if i want to buy facebook and you want to sell it they can just move the stock around without doing any trading with the result that their costs of trading are lower than those of an individual hope that helps

well as you say the instructions for form w-2 for your employer to fill out say you must report all employer contributions including    an employee 's contributions through a cafeteria plan to    an hsa in box 12 of form w-2 with code w. employer    contributions to an hsa that are not from the    income of the employee also must be reported in boxes 1    3 and 5 however while it 's your employer 's job to fill out w-2 correctly it 's only your job to file your taxes correctly especially as you say your box income is correct this is n't too hard to do you should file form 8889 with your return and report the contributions on line 9 as employer contributions and as you say both what the employer contributed outright and what you had deducted from your pay are both employer contributions be sure to keep your final pay stub for the year or other documentation showing that your employer did contribute that amount just in case the irs does end up questioning it for some reason   if you really want to you could try calling the irs and letting them know that you have contributions that were n't reported on your w-2 to see if they want to follow up with your employer about correcting their documentation if your efforts have been fruitless there 's even a faq page on the irs site about how to contact them when your employer is n't giving you a correct w-2 and how to fill out a form instead of using the w-2 which i 'd recommend if the amount of income listed was wrong or if there were some other more major problem with the form most likely though since it 's not going to affect the amount of tax anybody will pay it 's not going to be at the top of their list i would worry more filling out the forms you need to fill out correctly rather than worrying about the forms your employer is n't filling out correctly
