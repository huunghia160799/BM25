in some stores that is done when i shop at the apple store or at the farmers market the receipt is automatically sent to my email address why do n't others do it if the target of the itemized receipt is a credit card company they would be sending data that they spent collecting to another corporation the grocery store is collecting your data so they can sell it to their vendors they sell to vendors the info that gen x shoppers that buy cat food are more likely to use brand x laundry detergent then millennials the credit card companies could gather even more meta data that they could sell privacy some people do n't join the reward program at the store because they do n't want a company to know exactly what they buy even fewer would want the credit card company to have that information   the credit card companies would have to want this level of data that would have to be stored maintained and protected

many partnership agreements include a shotgun clause one person sets a price the other can either buy at that price or sell at it it 's rather brutal you can make offers that you know are less than the company is worth if you 're sure the other person will have to take that money from you say if you know they ca n't run the company without you   he has asked for $ x to be bought out and failing that he would like to keep owning his half and send his wife who may very well be competent but who among other things has a very ill husband to deal with to take his place if he can occasionally contribute to the overall vision and she can do the day to day then keeping things as they are may be the smart move but if that 's not possible it does n't mean you have to buy him out for twice what you think it 's worth   in the absence of a partnership agreement it 's going to be hard to know what to do but one approach might be to pretend there is a shotgun clause ask him if he thinks half the company is worth $ x if he 's willing to buy you out for that price and have his wife run it without you he is likely to out that it is n't worth that and she ca n't do that   and at that point you 'll actually be negotiating

regarding asia i think that it 's a matter of relative specialization hk has primarily developed as the gateway for china financial services hk will certainly offer islamic finance but i do n't think that there is a compelling reason why hk would become a hub for such services relative to singapore   singapore is at the center of major islamic populations and is socially and much more capable than hk of serving islamic finance investors   one possible counterpoint in favor of hk would be the one belt one road initiative perhaps a lot of the capital accumulation in the countries many of which are muslim would end up in hk but whether it has a major impact is more of a possibility than a certainty

your best bets are a roth ira or traditional ira   if you roll it to a roth you will have to pay taxes on the amount you roll over unless it was a roth 401k however what is in the roth will grow tax free and it will be tax free when you withdraw   with a traditional ira you wo n't owe taxes on the money now but will pay taxes when you withdraw you wo n't be able to withdraw this money until 59 1/2 years of age without paying a penalty the same goes for your current 401k   if you take the money for mortgage other investment etc and do n't roll it over to a qualified account you will owe taxes on it plus a 10 penalty   so you will only get between 60 and 70 of its value

yield can be thought of as the interest rate you would receive from that investment in the form of a dividend for stocks or interest payments on a bond   the yield takes into account the anticipated amount to be received per share unit per year and the current price of the investment    of course the yield is not a guaranteed return like a savings account   if the investment yield is 4 when you buy it can drop in value such that you actually lose money during your hold period despite receiving income from the dividend or interest payments

i believe the following statement by jaganalyst is incorrect in your wife 's case if you have an hsa and she has traditional health benefits with an fsa this is not considered a problem since she can only use the fsa money for expenses incurred by members of your family on her plan unless your fsa funds can only be used for your spouse 's expenses and not yours very few employer fsa plan documents state this then the irs will assume that the fsa funds are available to all family members thus making you ineligible to contribute to an hsa according to the link cited above above by jaganalyst regarding eligible expenses   you can use your account funds for numerous health care related products and services for yourself your spouse and your qualifying child or relative

while this question can i get a rebate after using my hsa mentions health savings account the answer is still applicable go to the website for the plan administrator they will either have a form to put the money back into the account or they will have a contact number in the past when i had an fsa i did this   in one case i remember the doctor told us the bill would be x but when they submitted the claim to the insurance the final bill was less than x so the doctor 's office sent us the extra back i was able to return the money back to the fsa administrator following their procedure   your situation is not unusual accidental transactions happen all the time

answering this question is weird because it is not really precise in what you mean do you want all stocks in the us do you want a selection of stocks according to parameters   do you just want a cool looking graph however your possible misuse of the word derivative my interest your reference to   gold and silver seems to indicate that you do not know what a derivative actually is or what it would do in a portfolio   the straightforward way to see an efficient frontier is to do the following for a set of stocks in this case six randomly selected ones                rai amzn msft twx from = 2012 06 01 to = 2017 06 01      returns lt;- null   tickerlist lt;- rai amzn msft twx   for ticker in tickerlist    returns lt;-     lt;- tickerlist   returns lt;-     frontier lt;-   width = 800 height = 600   which = all       constraints =     portfolio weights         rai    amzn    msft     twx             covariance risk budgets         rai    amzn    msft     twx             target returns and risks    mean            var          the minimum variance portfolio of these six assets has a mean return is and variance is amzn does not get any weight in the portfolio   it kind of means that the other assets span it and it does not provide any additional diversification benefit    let us add two etfs that track gold and silver to the mix and see how little difference it makes     from = 2012 06 01 to = 2017 06 01     returns lt;- null   tickerlist lt;- rai amzn msft twx gld   for ticker in tickerlist    returns lt;-     lt;- tickerlist   returns lt;-    frontier lt;-     width = 800 height = 600         optimal weights   out lt;- constraints =   lt;-   lt;-   lt;-   lt;- optimal portfolio     equal weights   lt;- 8)   lt;-   lt;-   lt;- equal weights portfolio    width = 800 height = 600   =   chart ylim = c(0 2   chart ylim = c(0 2   chart main = drawdown ylim = 0   chart main = drawdown ylim = 0         adding gold changes the minimum variance mean return to and the variance stays about the same you can see how the weights change at different return and variance profiles in the picture   the takeaway is that adding gold decreases the return but does not do a lot for the risk of the portfolio   you also notice that silver does not get included in the minimum variance efficient portfolio and neither does amzn     we can also compare the optimal weights to an equally weighted portfolio and see that the latter would have performed better but had much   larger drawdowns which is because it has a higher volatility which might be undesirable     everything below here is false but illustrative   so what about the derivative part let us assume you bought an out of the money call option with a strike of 50 on msft at the beginning of the   time series and held it to the end   we need to decide on the the annualized cost of carry rate the annualized rate of interest the time to maturity is measured in years the annualized   volatility of the underlying security is by the historical volatility       lt;- months   t lt;- 60 months 5 years   vol lt;- annualized volatility     lt;- 60 1   for t in    s lt;-    lt;- = c s = s x = 50 time = t t 12 r = 0.001 b = 0.001 sigma = vol    lt;-       lt;-   lt;-     lt;-   lt;-     returns lt;-     lt;- 9     lt;-   lt;-   lt;- equal weights derivative portfolio     width = 800 height = 600   =   chart ylim = c(0 4.5   chart ylim = c(0 4.5   chart main = drawdown ylim = 0   chart main = drawdown ylim = 0        even though we have a massively profitable instrument in the derivative the portfolio analysis does not include it   because of the high volatility however if we just use equal weighting and essentially take a massive position in   the out of the money call which would not be possible in real life we get huge drawdowns and volatility but   the returns are almost two fold but nobody will sell you a five year call   others can correct any mistakes or misunderstandings in the above it hopefully gives a starting point   read more at      the album

square charges a 2.75 fee which the merchant pays so you would be losing money if you only got a 1.5 cashback bonus i would guess that the real reason square prohibits you from getting cash is because of visa mc state and federal regulations   visa mc probably prohibit it for regular merchants due primarily to laws that are designed to prevent money laundering certain merchants like casinos are allowed to give you cash advances against a credit card but regular merchants are not allowed to do this it is much more difficult to get visa mc to approve merchants to handle cash advances and they are subject to many additional regulations   services like western union will let you send cash with a regular credit card but they are classified as money and must comply with additional state and federal regulations if square were to allow cash advances this would likely subject them to a bunch of additional regulations   it would cost them more to comply with these regulations and is outside their business model so they simply prohibit it

be careful of the other answers here many are wrong or partially wrong the question implies that you knew this but for everyone else 's benefit you can keep you llc organization and still elect to be treated as a s corp by the irs just for tax purposes   you do this by filing form with the irs you can also by the way elect to be taxed as a regular c corp if you want although that 's probably not advantageous   see form the advantage of electing to be treated as an s corp is that income beyond what constitutes a reasonable salary are not subject to social security and medicare taxes as they would when paid was wages or counted as self employment income on schedule c.   depending on what you need to pay yourself to meet the reasonable salary test your overall income and other factors about your business this could result in tax savings contrary to other answers here making this election will not force you to create a board of directors   you are still an llc for all purposes except taxes so whatever requirements you had in organization and governance at the state level will not change   you will have to file a corporate tax return on form 1120s and likely some corresponding state tax form so that is additional paperwork but this corporate return does not mean the s corp pays taxes itself with a couple of exceptions the s corp pays no taxes directly and therefore does not pay at the corporate tax rate instead the s corp its income expenses and deductions to the owner(s on schedule k.   the owners get their portion reported from the s corp on schedule k1 and then include that on their personal form 1040 to pay tax at their personal rate in addition to filing form 1120s you will have to handle payroll taxes which will create some additional administrative work and/or cost using a payroll service for this will likely be your best option and not terribly expensive you 've also got the issue of determining your reasonable salary within the rules which is the subject of other questions on this site and other irs guidance

first i would like to say do not pay credit card companies in an attempt to improve your credit rating in my opinion it 's not worth the cash and not fair for the consumer there are many great resources online that give advice on how to improve your credit score you can even simulate what would happen to your score if you did this credit karma will give you your transunion credit score for free and offers a simulation calculator if you only have one credit card i would start off by applying for another simply because   $ 700 is such a small limit and to pay a $ 30 annual fee seems outrageous try applying with the bank where you hold your savings or checking account they are more likely to approve your application since they have a working relationship with you all in all i would not go out of my way and spend money i would not have spent otherwise just to increase my credit score to me this practice is counter intuitive you are allowed a free credit report from each bureau once annually you can get this from this wo n't include your credit score but it will let you see what banks see when they run your credit report in addition you should check it over for any errors or possible identity theft if there are errors you need to file a claim with the credit agency immediately edit from with 3 agencies to choose from you can alternate during the year to pull a different report every 4 months a couple every 2 here are some resources you can read up on improve your fico credit score top 5 credit misconceptions   9 fast fixes for your credit scores

you can think of a free cash flow as dividends from operations fcf = cash from operations investment in operations the present value of these cash flows into the future is the value of the firm dcf is very much like the dividend discount model    now why does a dcf produce enterprise value and not equity value because a dcf values the firm 's operating assets to find the equity value you use the accounting relation assets = liabilities + equity or in financial terms net operating assets = net financial obligations + common stockholders equity this means you take away net debt from the value produced by the dcf to find equity   now all your excess cash is netted off against your financial obligations debt to find the net debt cash used for day to day operations is an operating asset and should be treated as such operating cash should not deducted from value of assets when finding the value of equity   at least that 's what they 're teaching at university now i 'm a uni student who 's just finished my business valuation subject

do not borrow to invest in real estate   the interest payments will eat up most of your profit the property management fees might eat up the rest and you will have significant risk with tenant issues property value etc   many people have made it work many also lose everything real estate can be a great investment but you ca n't even afford a house of your own yet let alone investment property   keep saving up until you have 20 down to buy a house of your own ideally that you can put on a 15 fixed mortgage and pay it off as quickly as you can   then you can start saving for your first rental property if that process is n't fast enough for you you have two options   increase your income or reduce your expenses   there 's no shortcut to wealth building without taking significant risks at most i would scale back the 401(k to the 5 match you get but you should scale that back up once you have enough for a down payment

the recommendation is not to make the investment in general a company does not have to sell their shares to you or allow you to become an investor because as you have stated it is a private company not quoted on the stock market    if everyone were trustworthy you could buy the tools for $ so that you own the tools and sign a lease of the tools to the company whereby they pay you $ x month   the lease should be reviewed by a lawyer before it is signed and perhaps give the buyer the right to demand back the tools at any time   however even this arrangement is very risky because the company could simply steal or damage the tools and disappear    it is not an investment that i would make because it sounds too good to be true   $ steady cash flow for $ 11,000 invested   no i do n't think so    the following information may also be useful either to you or future readers if you still want to make this investment then you should know that the offering for sale of shares by companies located in the usa is subject to a wild array of complex laws   this is true in many other countries as well   these laws   called securities laws or regulations   can require certain disclosures require that investors have a high net worth so that they can afford to lose the money or conduct their own investigations and legal actions or require that the investors know the company founders personally and can prohibit or limit resale by the buyer investor   promoters who say you can still invest and are ignoring or the securities laws are being at least negligent but more likely are dishonest and probably criminal   even if you trust in the investment can you trust negligent managers to do a good job executing that investment what about dishonest managers   what about criminals and thieves

first i 'd recommend that you separate short term assets from long term assets in your head   short term assets are earmarked for spending on something specific in the near future or are part of your emergency fund   these should be kept in cash or short bond funds    long term assets are assets that you can take some risks with and are n't going to spend in the next few years   under normal circumstances i 'd recommend 80 bonds or even 70/30 for someone your age assuming you 're saving mainly for retirement and thus have a correspondingly long time horizon   these portfolios historically are much less risky than 100 stock and only return slightly less    right now though i think that anyone who does n't absolutely need safety keep 100 of their long term assets in stocks   i 'm 26 and this is my asset allocation   bond yields are absolutely pathetic by historical standards   even ten year treasury yields are comparable to s&p 500 dividend yields and likely wo n't outperform inflation if held to maturity   the stock market is modestly undervalued when measured by difference between current p e ratio and the historical average and more severely undervalued when you account for the effects of reduced inflation transaction costs and capital gains taxes on fair valuation   therefore the potential reward for taking risk is much higher now than it usually is

generally yes   rather than ask why are these guys so cheap you should be asking why the big names are so expensive marketing spend plays a big role there getting babies to shill for your company during the super bowl requires a heck of a lot of commissions due to the difficulties involved in setting up a brokerage it 's unlikely that you 'll see a scam a brokerage might go bankrupt for random reasons but that 's what investor insurance is for is mostly the likelihood that you 'll be able to get access to your funds on deposit with the broker investment funds are insured by sipc for up to $ 500,000 with a lower limit on cash the specific limits vary by broker with some offering greater protection paid for on their own dime check with the broker it 's usually on their web pages under security funds in cash might be swept into an interest earning investment vehicle for which insurance is different and that depends on the broker too a few forex brokers went bankrupt last year although that 's a new market with fewer regulatory protections for traders i heard that one bankruptcy in the space resulted in a 7 loss for traders with accounts there and that there was a ponzi ish scam company as well luckily the more stringent regulation of stock brokerages makes that space much safer for investors if you want to assess the reliability of an online broker i suggest the following it 's tempting to look at when the brokerage was founded fly by night scams by definition wo n't be around very long and usually that means under a few months any company with a significant online interface will have to have been around long enough to develop that client interface their backend databases and the interface with the markets and their clearing house the two brokerages you mentioned have been around for 7 + years so that lends strength to the supposition of a strong business model that said there could well be a new company that offers services or prices that fit your investment need and in that case definitely look into their registrations and third party reviews finally note that the smaller independent brokerages will probably have margin rules if you 're playing a complex novel and/or high risk strategy that ca n't handle the volatility of a market crash even a short excursion such as the 2010 flash crash stiff margin rules might have consequences that a novice investor would rather pretend did n't exist

i think you would be better asking about what things could increase in value even the given example houses are not certain to increase in value in fact one of the key causal factors of this recession imho is that no one realized that partly because there have been few recent housing busts and also the illusory effect of inflation that made it seem like houses always increase in value   i once heard it described that rich people tend to get richer because they spend more of their money on things that are more likely to hold their value or appreciate houses art etc as opposed to poor people who spend the majority of their money on consumables like rent utilities food cars etc

costco requires an annual paid membership before you can enter and the the minimum price of any purchase is greater than at other stores because you are getting large bulk of that item   starbucks charges several dollars for a cup of coffee not an essential item   in both cases their clientele are the middle classes not the less well off members of society   consequently it makes business sense for them to pay staff such that are they are substantially similar to the customers   but walmart does serve the less well off   and their management is n't stupid if they believed a doubling of wages would result in greater sales and profitability they would do it in an heartbeat   but it wo n't   and i 'll bet walmart 's customers and employees are as similar to each other as costco 's customers and employees are to each other     walmart 's effects on prices is well   every cent they save customers is a cent those customers can put towards other things or prolong how long a particular amount of money will last   there are numerous claims about them lowering the effects wal mart   so changing nothing else increasing employee wages would decrease customer savings   we could make the cost of living for employees be less by reducing the costs of housing rather than every time house prices go up   and if you believe everyone should have healthcare then ensure everyone has it   if you believe it should be provided via employers along with a bizarre insurance industry a rather peculiar then just make that mandatory in the law   and finally for all the who believe it can be done better go ahead and do so   it is always easier to advocate how and what others should do if walmart are getting it so wrong then show everyone the right way

no getting more credit lowers your credit utilization ratio if you do n't use it which raises your credit rating this can also be done by asking for a higher limit on your existing credit card also there is a chance that the company you got your first card from wo n't pull your credit a second time when they go to the underwriter as any extensions of credit lower your credit score although the credit utilization ratio is weighted more heavily

ordinarily a cosigner does not appear on the car 's title thus no ownership at all in the vehicle but they are guaranteeing payment of the loan if the primary borrower does not make the payment you have essentially two options stop making payments for him   if he does not make them the car will be repossessed and the default will appear on both his and your credit   you will have a credit ding to live with but he will to and he wo n't have the car continue to make payments if he does not to preserve your credit and sue him for the money you have paid   in your suit you could request repayment of the money or have him sign over the title ownership to you if you would be happy with either option   i suspect that he will object to both so the judge is going to have to decide if he finds your case has merit if you go with option 1 and he picks up the payments so the car is n't repossessed you can then still take option 2 to recover the money you have paid   be prepared to provide documentation to the court of the payments you have made bank statements showing the out go or other form of evidence you made the payment the finance company 's statements are n't going to show who made them

that 's not what he 's saying at all   basically most of his argument 4 of 6 points is the connection between bond prices and equity prices it 's not particularly interesting but it definitely does n't always apply either if bond yields fall then so too should equity earnings yields if spreads remain relatively constant i.e. higher equity prices additionally if bond yields are low then any future equity growth gets capitalized at a much higher value because discount rates are much lower again not particularly insightful   the two interesting comments were about oil and cash as a of assets at financial institutions both of these are likely linked to falling or low rates above because banks ca n't invest profitably at low rates and hence hold cash and equivalents instead and oil prices are more likely to fall in a low or falling inflation environment implied by the low rates or fed tightening   really i think he s 's saying something more obvious but not necessarily trivial which is if one asset class goes up so too is another related one

for those who are looking to improve credit for the sake of being able to obtain future credit on better terms i think a rewards credit card is the best way to do that i recommend that you only use as many cards as you need to gain the best rewards i have one card that gives 6 back on grocery purchases and i have another card that gives 4 back on petrol and 2 back on dining out both of those cards give only 1 back on all other purchases so i use a third card that gives 1.5 back across the board for my other purchases i pay all of the cards in full each month if there was a card that did n't give me an advantage in making my purchases i would n't own it i 'm generally frugal so i know that there is no psychological disadvantage to paying with a card you have to consider your own spending discipline when deciding whether paying with cards is an advantage for you in the end you should only use debt when you can pay low interest rates or as in the case of the cards above no interest at all in the case of the low interest debt it should be allowing you to make an investment that will pay you more by having it sooner than the cost of interest you might need a car to get to work but you probably do n't need a new car borrow as little as you can and repay your loans as quickly as you can debt can be a tool for your advantage but only if used wisely do n't be in by the temptation of something new and shiny now that you can pay for later

well as you say the instructions for form w-2 for your employer to fill out say you must report all employer contributions including    an employee 's contributions through a cafeteria plan to    an hsa in box 12 of form w-2 with code w. employer    contributions to an hsa that are not from the    income of the employee also must be reported in boxes 1    3 and 5 however while it 's your employer 's job to fill out w-2 correctly it 's only your job to file your taxes correctly especially as you say your box income is correct this is n't too hard to do you should file form 8889 with your return and report the contributions on line 9 as employer contributions and as you say both what the employer contributed outright and what you had deducted from your pay are both employer contributions be sure to keep your final pay stub for the year or other documentation showing that your employer did contribute that amount just in case the irs does end up questioning it for some reason   if you really want to you could try calling the irs and letting them know that you have contributions that were n't reported on your w-2 to see if they want to follow up with your employer about correcting their documentation if your efforts have been fruitless there 's even a faq page on the irs site about how to contact them when your employer is n't giving you a correct w-2 and how to fill out a form instead of using the w-2 which i 'd recommend if the amount of income listed was wrong or if there were some other more major problem with the form most likely though since it 's not going to affect the amount of tax anybody will pay it 's not going to be at the top of their list i would worry more filling out the forms you need to fill out correctly rather than worrying about the forms your employer is n't filling out correctly

short time horizon small pot of money and low appetite for risk   that smells like low return situation to me i guess it depends on how low your appetite for risk is though   you could open a brokerage account free and purchase $ 10 k worth of a fully diversified etf like vti optionally putting maybe 20 of it in a diversified bond etf   i consider that a reasonably conservative investment but if you are of the mindset that you can not tolerate a drop in your wealth it 's not going to work   plus if you do n't have any other investments this will be the thing that requires you to report capital gains to the irs and that paperwork is never fun as an alternative you have cd 's which will make you very little   or a high ish interest rate electronic savings account like capital one 360 or direct there are probably newer ones now that even these   still with anything in this paragraph you will be lucky to beat inflation   the real interest rate was negative last time i checked so every risk free investment will lose money in purchasing power terms   to beat inflation you will need to take on risk

a diversified portfolio such as a 60 stocks 40 bonds balanced fund is much more predictable and reliable than an all stocks portfolio and the returns are perfectly adequate the extra returns on 100 stocks vs. 60 are 1.2 per year historically according to to get those average higher stock returns you need to be thinking 20 30 years even 10 years is too short term over the 20 30 years you must never panic and go to cash or you will destroy the higher returns you must never get discouraged and stop saving or you will destroy the higher returns you have to avoid the panic and despite the likelihood that some 10-year period in your 20 30 years the stock market will go nowhere you also must never have an emergency or other reason to withdraw money early if you look at dry periods in stocks like 2000 to 2011 a 60/40 portfolio made significant money and stocks went nowhere a diversified portfolio means that price volatility makes you money due to rebalancing while a 100 stocks portfolio means that price volatility is just a lot of stress with no benefit it 's somewhat possible probably to predict dry periods in stocks if i remember the statistics about 50 of the variability in the market price 10 years out can be explained by normalized market valuation normalized = adjusted for business cycle and abnormal profit margins some funds such as are completely based on this though a lot of money managers consider it with a balanced portfolio and rebalancing though you do n't have to worry about it very much in my view the proper goal is not to beat the market nor match the market nor is it to earn the absolute highest possible returns instead the goal is to have the highest chance of financing your non financial goals such as retirement or buying a house to maximize your chances of supporting your life goals with your financial decisions predictability is more important than maximized returns your results are primarily determined by your savings rate which realistic investment returns will never compensate for if it 's too low you can certainly make a projection in which 1.2 difference in returns makes a big difference but you have to remember that a projection in which value steadily and predictably compounds is not the same as real life where you could have emergency or emotional factors where the market will move and might have a big plunge at just the wrong time end of the 40 years and so on if your plan relies on the extra 1.2 returns then it 's not a reasonable plan anyhow in my opinion since you ca n't count on them so why suffer the stress and extra risk created by an all stocks portfolio

first a credit account is increased by credit transactions and decreased by debits liabilities is a credit account and should be a positive number   a debit account is increased by debit transactions and decreased by credit assets is a debit account and should be a positive number   equity = assets debit liabilities credit may be positive or negative   you currently are subtracting a negative number for a net positive since your liabilities is set as a debit account   how you currently are set > equity = assets debit liabilities debit it is easier to understand if you change the columns from increase decrease to credit debit i believe this is changed through edit > preferences > accounts > labels > use formal accounting labels   to fix your situation open up the loan account and switch columns on the amounts this will decrease opening balances and increase the loan per your current column   this is a of opening balances you see that opening balances is debited and the loan liability account credited i included petty cash to show the reverse petty cash is an asset so it credits opening balances and debits petty cash this is a student loan liability account as you see the opening balance is debited and decreased the loan is credited and liabilities increased as payments are made the reverse happens the loan being a credit account is debited and the balance decreases opening balances moves closer to 0 as well the savings account being a debit account is credited and the balance decreases there has been no change in equity since liabilities and assets by the same amount

as someone who 's done quit a bit of home improvement and seen positive roi i can speak from some personal experience   all of this assumes you do the unskilled labor yourself and shop around for relatively cheap plumbers electricians etc first never underestimate the resale value added by a can of paint   this assumes you have or know someone with a good sense of style that can help improve the aesthetics of the home significantly   white walls can be so boring to homebuyers and so many of them ca n't see through the of an inch of white paint second look for shortcomings in the house as is anyway these are some common upgrades   the big thing is to find something you are reasonably comfortable doing yourself and that you will enjoy   realize that if you 're new to this most projects will cost twice what you budget and take four times as long   the pride of having done it yourself and put in the sweat equity makes it worth it though usually edit to better answer your modified question i 'm adding to my answer   so if i understand it your question is now at what rate is it sane to invest in our house vs. outside investments   this is really just a matter of balancing risk vs. lifestyle   with most upgrades there is no financial benefit to investing in upgrading your home now vs. 5 years from now right before you sell   you could be making 10 in mutual funds until then and then invest in the upgrades right before you sell   there is obviously a physical limit to how fast you can do these improvements yourself but front loading this now at the beginning of your timeframe as opposed to the end is not an investment decision it is a lifestyle decision   not saying do n't do it but do n't rationalize it to yourself as we 're saving money by doing this now   maybe use the rationalization we want to enjoy these upgrades and not just add them before we move out one exception to that i 'd plant any trees now and make sure they have a good water supply   good trees take a while to grow and doing that sooner rather than later will help

what prevents a company from doing secondary public stock offerings on regular basis the primary goal of a company doing secondary public offering is to raise more funds that can be utilized for funding the business if no funding is needed i.e. company has sufficient funds or no expansion plans this funding creates a drag and existing shareholder including promoters loose value for example with the current 100 invested the company is able to generate say 125 25 as profit if additional 100 is taken as secondary public offering then with 200 the company should mark around 250 else it looses value so if the company took additional 100 and did not is not able to deploy in market on 200 they still make 25 as profit its bad there are other reasons i.e. to fight off hostile acquisition or dilute some of promoters shares etc thus the reasons for company to do a secondary po are few and doing it often reduces the value for primary share holders as well as minority share holders

has mentioned this in a comment but i think it ought to be expanded upon companies that are n't already penny stocks really do n't stand to gain anything from trying to prevent short interest   short selling does not inherently lower the stock price not any more so than any other kind of selling   when somebody shorts a stock it 's simply borrowed from another investor 's margin as long as it 's not a naked short resulting in an failure to deliver then it does not add any artificial selling pressure in fact shorting can actually drive the price up in the long term due to stops and margin calls   not a guarantee of course but if a rally occurs then a high short interest can cause a cascade effect from the short squeeze resulting in an even bigger rally than what would have occurred with zero short interest   many investors actually treat a high short interest as a bullish signal compare with margin buying essentially the opposite of short selling which has the opposite effect   if investors buy stocks on margin then if the value of that stock decreases too rapidly they will be forced to sell which can cause the exact same cascade effect as a short interest but in the opposite direction   shorting is in a sense evening out the odds by inflating the buying pressure at lower stock prices when the borrowers decide to cover and take profits bottom line is that aside from illegal insider trading it does n't do businesses any good to try to manipulate their stock price or any trading activity   yes a company can raise capital by selling additional common shares but a split really has no effect on the amount of capital they 'd be able to raise because it does n't change the actual market cap and a dilution is a dilution regardless of the current stock price   if a company 's market cap is $ 1 billion then it does n't matter if they issue 1 million shares at $ 50.00 each or 10 million shares at $ 5.00 each either way it nets them $ 50 million from the sale and causes a 5 dilution to which the market will react accordingly they do n't do it because there 'd be no point

does it ever make sense yes but almost never   if you 're in a situation where you 're invested in something with low rates think government securities or cash equivalents then you do need to think about rate spread as you mention does the savings over the life over the mortgage beat out the 35 hit now plus all the interest you would earn over those 20 years have you factored in other considerations such as mortgage interest deduction on taxes do n't forget you need to think about how rates will change down the line they ca n't go much lower so potentially you 'll get better rates in the 401(k down the line do n't forget there 's also the impact of inflation again the rates on your savings may go up but your mortgage is a fixed payment so with even a low rate of inflation your payments effectively become less over time if your investments are in something like stocks and bonds then i would say undoubtedly you would want to keep the money in the 401(k time in market and compounding are your best friends over a long time horizon also as mentioned by @johnfx the hit of your 35 now is something you will absolutely feel now hopefully not but your life situation could change where you have an emergency and need to drain your savings or you may not see the end of that 20 years

oddly enough in the usa there are enough cost and tax savings between buy and hold of a static portfolio and buying into a fund that a few brokerages have sprung up around the concept such as to make it easier for small investors to manage numerous small holdings via fractional shares and no commission window trades a static buy and hold portfolio of stocks can be had for a few dollars per trade   buying into a fund involves various annual and one time fees that are quoted as percentages of the investment   even 1 2 can be a lot especially if it is every year   typically a us mutual fund must send out a 1099 tax form to each investor stating that investors share of the dividends and capital gains for each year the true impact of this is not obvious until you get a tax bill for gains that you did not enjoy which can happen when you buy into a fund late in the year that has realized capital gains   what fund investors sometimes fail to appreciate is that they are taxed both on their own holding period of fund shares and the fund 's capital gains distributions determined by the fund 's holding period of its investments for example if abc tech fund bought google stock several years ago for $ 100/share and sold it for $ in the same year you bought into the abc fund then you will receive a capital gains distribution on your 1099 that will include some dollar amount which is considered your share of that long term profit for tax purposes the amount is not customized for your holding period capital gains are distributed pro rata among all current fund shareholders as of the ex distribution date morningstar tracks this as potential capital gains exposure and so there is a way to check this possibility before investing funds who have unsold losers in their portfolio are also affected by these same rules have been called free rides because those funds if they find some winners will have losers that they can sell simultaneously with the winners to remain tax neutral   see on the lookout for tax traps and free riders morningstar pdf in contrast buying and holding a portfolio does not attract any capital gains taxes until the stocks in the portfolio are sold at a profit   a fund often is actively managed   that is experts will alter the portfolio from time to time or advise the fund to buy or sell particular investments note however that even the experts are required to tell you that past performance is no guarantee of future results

someone has to hand out cash to the seller even if no physical money changes hands and i 've bought a house i can tell you a lot of money changes hands at closing in at least the form of a personal check and regardless of exactly how the bank accounts for the actual disbursement of the loan the net result is that the buyer has cash that they give the seller and are now in debt to the bank for least that amount but they now have a house now the bank probably did n't have that money just sitting in its vault money sitting in a vault is money that is not making more money for the bank therefore most banks keep only fractionally more than the percentage of deposit balances that they are required to keep by the feds there are also restrictions on what depositors money can be spent on and loans are not one of them the model of taking in money in savings accounts and then loaning it out is what caused the savings and loan collapse in the 80s so to get the money it turns to investors the bank sells bonds putting itself in debt to bond holders then takes that money and loans it out at a higher rate covering the interest on the bond and making itself a tidy profit for its own shareholders banks lose money on defaults in two ways first they lose all future interest payments that would have been made on the loan technically this is n't revenue until the interest is calculated for each month and accrues on the loan therefore it does n't show on the balance sheet one way or the other however the holders of those bonds will expect a return and the banks no longer have the mortgage payment to cover the coupon payments that they themselves have to pay bondholders creating cash flow problems the second and far more real and damaging way that banks lose money on a foreclosure is the loss of collateral value a bank virtually never offers an unsecured signature loan for a house certainly not at the advertised 3 4 interest rates they want something to back up the loan so if you disappear off the face of the earth they have a clear claim to something that can help them recover their money usually that 's the house itself if you default they get the house from you and sell it to recover their money now a major cause of foreclosure is economic downturn like the one we had in 2009 and are still recovering from when the economy goes in the crapper a lot of things we generally consider stores of value lose that value because the value of the any really is based on what someone else would pay to have it when fewer people are looking to buy that demand drops bringing prices with it homes and real estate are one of the real big ticket items subject to this loss of value when the average joe does n't know whether he 'll have a job tomorrow he does n't go house hunting this average joe may even be looking to sell an extra parcel of land or an income property for cash increasing supply further decreasing prices economic downturn can often increase crime and decrease local government spending on upkeep of public lands as well as homeowners upkeep of their own property by the broken window effect this makes the neighborhood even less desirable in a vicious cycle what made this current recession a double whammy for mortgage lenders is that it was caused in large part by a housing bubble cheap money for houses made housing prices balloon rapidly and then when the money became more expensive such as in sub prime arms a lot of those loans which should never have been signed off on by either side went belly up between the loss of home value a lot of which will likely turn out to be permanent that 's the problem with a bubble things never recover to their peak and the adjustment of interest rates on mortgages to terms that will actually pay off the loan many homeowners found themselves so far underwater and sinking fast that the best financial move for them was to walk away from the whole thing and try again in seven years now the bank 's in a they have this loan they 'll never see repaid in cash and they have this home that 's worth maybe 75 of the mortgage 's outstanding balance if they 're lucky some homes in extremely distressed areas like detroit are currently trading for 30 40 of what they sold for just before the bubble burst multiply that by say 100,000 distressed homes with similar declines in value and you 're talking about tens of billions of dollars in losses on top of that the guarantor basically the bank 's insurance company against these types of losses is now in financial trouble themselves because they took on so many contracts for debt that turned out to be bad aig fannie freddie they may very well declare bankruptcy and leave the bank holding the bag even if the guarantor remains solvent as they did thanks to generous taxpayer bailouts the bank 's swap contract with the guarantor usually requires them to sell the house thus realizing the loss between what they paid and what they finally got back before the guarantor will pay out but nobody 's buying houses anymore because prices are on their way down the only people who 'd buy a house now versus a year from now or two or three years are the people who have no choice and if you have no choice you 're probably in a financial situation that would mean you 'd never be approved for the loan anyway in order to get rid of them the bank has to sell them at auction for pennies on the dollar that further increases the supply of cheap homes and further drives down prices making even the nicer homes the bank 's willing to keep on the books worth less there 's a reason these homes were called toxic assets they 're poisonous to the banks whether they keep or sell them meanwhile all this price depression is now affecting the people who did everything right even people who bought their homes years before the bubble even formed are watching years of equity building go down the crapper that 's to say nothing of the people with prime credit who bought at just the wrong time when the bubble was at its peak even without an adjusting arm to contend with these guys are still facing the fact that they paid top dollar for a house that likely will not be worth its purchase price again in their lifetime even with a fixed mortgage rate they 'll be underwater effectively losing their entire payment to the bank as if it were rent for much longer than it would take to have this entire mess completely behind them if they just walked away from the whole thing moved back into an apartment and waited it out so these guys decide on a strategic default give the bank the house which does n't cover the outstanding balance of course and if they sue file bankruptcy that really makes the banks nervous if people who did everything right are considering the hell of foreclosure and bankruptcy to be preferable to their current state of affairs the bank 's main threat keeping people in their homes is hollow that makes them very reluctant to sign new mortgages because the risk of default is now much less certain now people who do want houses in this market ca n't buy them further reducing demand further decreasing prices you get the idea that 's the housing collapse in a nutshell and what banks and our free market have been working through for the past five years with only the of a turnaround picking up home sales

car dealers as well as boat dealers rv dealers maybe farm vehicle dealers and other asset types make deals with banks and finance companies to they can make loans to buyers they may be paying the interest to the finance companies so they can offer a 0 loan to the retail customer for all or part of the loan term   neither the finance company nor the dealer wants to make such loans to people who are likely to default such customers will not be offered this kind of financing but remember too that these loans are secured by the asset the car which is also insured but the dealer or the finance company holds that asset as collateral that they can seize to repay the loan so the finance company gets paid off and the dealer keeps the profit he made selling the car so these loans are designed to ensure the dealer nor the finance company looses much these are called asset finance loans because there is always an asset the car to use as collateral

i 've been highly compensated for a while now and i have never used a tax professional   my past complications include the year that my company was bought by a vc firm and my stock options and stock held were bought out to the tune of 5x my salary   and now i have two kids in college with scholarships and paying the remainder out of 529 accounts usually i do n't even use tax software   my typical method is to use the online software like turbotax online and let it figure out where i am   then i use the free file forms online to actually complete the process   search for free file forms it 's not the same as using turbotax or taxact for free    my suggestion to you   download the pdf form of 1040ez and 1040a from the irs   print the ez and fill it out   this will give you a better feel for what exactly is going on   with your income i do n't think you can file the ez but it 's a good way to get your feet wet the way income taxes work here in the us according to the irs the personal exemption this year is worth $ 4,050 and the standard deduction $ 6,300 assuming you 're single    lets assume that your salary will be in fact 75,000 and you do n't pay for any benefits but you do make a 401k contribution of 15 of your salary   then your w-2 at the end of the year should tell you to put in a particular box on your 1040 form   is 85 of 75,000   lets then assume is your agi after other additions and   4,050 6,300 = = the federal tax system is graduated meaning there are different ranges brackets with different percentages   the term tax people use for taxable income of is marginal tax so the last dollar they tax at 25   other dollars less   according to the irs if you 're single then on you pay $ plus 25 of the amount over $   or + 750 or note this is only federal income tax   you will also be paying social security and medicare payroll tax   and i 'm guessing you 'll also be paying colorado state income tax   each state has its own forms and methods for figuring out the taxes and stuff by the way when you start you 'll fill out a w-4 form to help you figure out how much to withhold from every paycheck   i find the w-4 is not helpful at all   your company will withhold from your paycheck some mysterious amount and the process of filling out your 1040a or 1040ez or whatever will be likely to get the over withheld amount back

i work in the fsa hsa industry and just wanted to point out that if your wife has a medical fsa you can not contribute to an hsa whether or not you are covered by her medical insurance plan the only exception to this per the rules is if your wife 's employers plan limits the medical fsa benefit to the employee your wife which i can say from experience is extremely rare it 's possible but i 've never personally seen an employer with this in their plan document so better check first to be sure the fsa is restricted to your wife only you have to understand the fsa to know why this is true unless restricted your wife can use her medical fsa for herself her spouse and any tax dependents meaning whether or not she uses the fsa for your eligible expenses you still have 1st dollar coverage from the fsa making you in eligible to open and contribute to an hsa until the end of the plan year and possibly grace period if her employer has one in place and she does not spend her funds by the end of the plan year hope this helps if your still not sure talk to a tax professional which i am not but do advise employers and participants on both hsas and fsas

you should start by making a written complaint to the insurance company itself you have two angles of attack what was discussed when she was sold the policy make sure you set out exactly what you believe you were told and highlight that they did n't ask about commuting assuming that 's the case ask them to preserve any recordings they have of the call and to send you a copy the nature of the journey where the accident happened from the description unless it was part of a journey to and from work there 's no good reason for them to classify it as commuting make sure you make good written notes now of anything that happened verbally phone calls etc and keep doing this as the process goes along if that written complaint does n't work your next step is to go to the financial ombudsman who are a neutral service if the ombudsman does n't support your case you could go to court directly but it 'll be expensive and a lot of effort and by this stage it 'd be unlikely you would win the ombudsman 's rejection would n't count against you directly but it 'd be a strong indication that your case is weak see for a more detailed walk through

how much should a rational investor have in individual stocks probably none an additional dollar invested in a etf or low cost index fund comprised of many stocks will be far less risky than a specific stock and you 'd need a lot more capital to make buying voting and selling in individual stocks as if you were running your own personal index fund worthwhile i think in index funds use weightings to   make it easier to track the index without constantly trading so my advice here is to allocate based not on some financial principal but just loss aversion do n't gamble with more than you can afford to lose figure out how much of that you need it does n't sound like you can actually afford to lose it all so i 'd say 5 percent and make sure that 's funded from other equity holdings or you 'll end up overweight in stocks

gt but the buying power of that money can be significantly reduced to the point where it 's fundamentally useless i.e. inter war germany and many countries in south and central america   that 's true but how does that come about the effect on buying power stems from the level of spending in the present period too little leaves you anywhere from outright deflation and contraction to weaker growth falling short of capacity too much reaches capacity and keeps spending bidding up prices and driving down purchasing power   it has nothing to do with debt gdp or interest payments   gt germany managed to skate by by creating a new in a confidence trick and it worked because germany is a solid iron clad manufacturing powerhouse of a lot of stuff    there are two important differences between inter war germany and the us first is that inter war germany lost a this real shock is kind of important when you 're talking about buying power of money one side of it is the amount of money in circulation but the other side of it is how much real output there is to buy and german real output capacity collapsed after the war their most productive regions were occupied territory and they were no longer a powerhouse manufacturing a lot of stuff driving down the value of their currency   so lesson number one from germany real output collapse harms your currency   the second problem is that losing a war left germany saddled with war denominated in foreign currency when you 're on the hook for something you do n't print you 're in a situation where you can run out of money and that 's exactly what happened to them they tried printing more of their own currency to buy the foreign stuff with but that quickly drove down the value of german currency   so lesson number two from germany is you do n't want to be on the hook for a currency you do n't issue   put the two together and you have a real supply shock + foreign denominated debt the buying power of german currency it was n't debt gdp but the real basis for their economy collapsing out from under them pushed along by a need for foreign currency   gt;my question is at what point do we engage washington 's unlimited money printing presses until we reach that point   in answer to your question the printing presses are what funds the real economy the worry in terms of avoiding that point is in making sure we keep that real economy productive and fully funded ironically taking our eye off the ball to focus on budget balance at the expense of real output pushes the economy in the direction you 're afraid of going see also the euro zone today

tax cuts do lead to economic growth and why not   more money circulating in the private economy is good for everybody   it ’s why the stock market is up big on the prospect for tax cuts   the problem is the rosy growth projections that accompany these plans   the growth will occur but the pace of growth is a big question and very hard to model   so a prudent policy proposal would be to cut spending as well while the growth   then hopefully that spending cut becomes permanent as the economy grows so the private economy grows at the expense of the state

first of all the company will pay the money for the insurance do not be afraid they have to pay if 1 the insurance premium was paid every month and 2 there was not a false declaration of health when the contract was signed 5 or 10 years ago it normally takes between 1 month and 4 months to settle an insurance contract your case might take a little longer second the insurance company admit that you are the beneficiary so the money will eventually come to you what they say is that you need someone in charge a trustee or a to handle the money in your name why because you have a mental health team in charge of you be patient and third start by talking to someone in charge in your mental health team or the people you see what you need is someone acting as a trustee for you you need to go and seek free legal aid depending on your country or state of residence   i can not help you more than that you will have the money eventually in a few months but you need to find a trustee a guardian as soon as possible someone in your family could easily do it for you

usually not the total interest but all interest accrued and unpaid to date this is called the loan payoff amount and repays the bank their principal plus the true cost of capital on that principal since your last amortized payment which is probably never since you just signed the loan papers there may also be a prepayment penalty this is something that should have been disclosed to you if it exists but it 's fairly rare in u.s. mortgages anymore   the theory is the bank got the money they paid you at the start of the loan by selling a bond package backed by your mortgage and others of similar credit history and/or about the same time a mortgage backed security by turning around and paying early you meet your obligation but the bank is now stuck with at least 10 years of quarterly coupon payments on that bond which they were expecting to pay using your mortgage interest for their trouble you would pay an additional amount that either covers their call price on the portion of the bonds used for your principal or simply buys them the time to re issue a new mortgage using your repaid principal to back the bond again in the modern housing market such a prepayment penalty is very rare because so many lenders are willing to give you a mortgage without one and so many buyers balk at the thought of having to pay more if they pay early the whole point is to pay less by paying early just something to look up in your mortgage documentation

cd laddering is funding a few cds in succession for instance for 6 months each month you open up a 6 month cd rather than   opening up one big one doing this will give you monthly interest payments as each month a cd will reach maturity after 6 months at that time you can choose to roll over the principal in a new cd and keep the interest reinvest all etc etc etc you still get the benefits higher rates that cds offer but with greater flexibility and more frequent interest payouts the only downside that i 'm aware off is that you may end up with a slightly lower overall interest rate

has provided a good answer i 'm only addressing my comment about the data quality the portfolio optimization technique you employed is very sensitive to the inputs in particular it relies entirely on the mean and assumptions i.e. the first two moments and the results could change drastically with very small amount of change in the inputs to see that you can make up some inputs for the solver you have and try adjusting the inputs a little bit and see the results therefore if you decide to take this approach data quality is very crucial edit what i meant by data quality i have no experience with this website but this should be easy to spot check the answer is usually yes for liquid assets illiquid assets can often be priced at a level with no volume and the bid ask spread could be huge   should i close my eyes on the fact that these are n't perfectly priced in my currency and use another one such as the dollar you seem to have concern about data quality in at least the price quoted in your currency and are thinking about using data quoted in usd but would it be any better the law of one price tells us that there should n't be any discrepancy between prices in different currencies otherwise there would be arbitrage in addition when compared to traditional assets cryptocurrency price data has a shorter data history and with lower liquidity in the market the short history means you have less data to infer the characteristics of the price behavior low liquidity means the volatility may well be underestimated so we have an input sensitive technique combined with not so perfect data i would n't allocate my money solely based on the result of this exercise edit i have quite some reservation about doing portfolio optimization for cryptocurrency personally i 'm not a fan of the technique as is the optimization has an underlying assumption that returns follow a certain distribution and correlation is fixed i do n't know if you can make such assumption for cryptocurrencies from what i read about btc for example it seems to have a high risk exposure concerning chinese monetary policy for that kind of assets perhaps a fundamental analysis approach is a better one   also if you would like to learn more about portfolio optimization try quant se

i would apply extra cash left over at the end of the month as follows in order of priority realize though that this is my take on priority my experience has been that a liquidity crisis is much more stressful than having a mortgage or other debt illiquid wealth is almost useless when you need cash so if you still have strong feelings about retiring that debt after considering the liquidity issue go ahead and swap 3 and 4 above make plans to pay off the mortgage over the next 10 years find a mortgage payoff calculator and make extra monthly payments that keep you on a 10 year schedule i 'd strongly suggest making sure your retirement savings are on track though time is on your side here and your required monthly contribution will be low now while you 're still in your 20s

the dividend yield can be used to compare a stock to other forms of investments that generate income to the investor such as bonds   i could purchase a stock that pays out a certain dividend yield or purchase a bond that pays out a certain interest   of course there are many other variables to consider in addition to yield when making this type of investment decision the dividend yield can be an important consideration if you are looking to invest in stocks for an income stream in addition to investing in stocks for gain by a rising stock price the reason to use dividend market price is that it changes the dividend from a flat number such as $ 1 to a percentage of the stock price which thus allows it to be more directly compared with bonds and such which return a percentage yeild

this started as a comment but then really go too long so i am posting an answer i am also using gnucash just like you as a non accountant but i think it really pays off to get to know more about accounting via gnucash it is so useful and you learn a lot about this hundreds of years old double entry system that all accountants know so start learning about 5 main accounts and debits and credits imho it is far easier than one can think now the answer even without balancing amounts exactly program is very useful as you still can track your monthly outgoings very well just make adjust some reports and save their so you can re run quickly when new data comes in after you have classified your transactions properly if i still did not know what some transactions were happens a lot at first import i just put them under expenses unaccounted expenses thus you will be able to see how much money went who knows where if later you learn what those transactions were you still can move them to the right account and you will be pleased that your reports show less unaccounted money how many transactions to import at first for me half a year or a year is quite enough once you start tracking regularly you accumulate more date and this becomes a non issue reflecting that personal finance is more about behaviour than maths and that it is more for the future where your overview of money is useful gnucash wil learn from import to import what transactions go where so you could import say 1 or 3 month intervals to start with instead of a while year no matter what i still glance at every transaction on import and still sometimes petrol expense lands in grocery because of the same seller but to spot things like that you use reports and if one month is abnormal you can drill down to transactions and learn correct things note that reports are easy to modify and you can save the report with names you can remember they are saved on the machine you do the accounting not within the gnucash file so if you open the file or mysql database on another computer you will miss your custom reports you can transfer them but it is a bit hence it makes sense to use gnucash on your laptop as that you probably will have around most often once you start entering transactions into gnucash on the day or the week you incur the expense you are getting more control and it is perhaps then you would need the balance to match the bank 's balance then you can adjust the equity opening balances to manipulate the starting sums so that current balances match those of your bank this is easy   when you have entered transactions proactively on the day or the week and then later do an import from bank statement the transactions are matched automatically and then they are said to be reconciled i.e. your manual entry gets matched by the entry from your statement so for beginning it is something like that if any questions feel free to ask imho this is a process rather a one off thing i began once got bored but started again and now i find it immensely useful

does the 5 year rule apply on the after tax 401k > roth 401k > roth    ira conversion of the 20000 including 10000 earnings that was    originally pre tax no the after tax amounts are not subject to the 5 years rule the earnings are how does this affect roth ira withdrawal ordering rules with respect    to the taxable portion of a single conversion being withdrawn before    the non taxable portion taxable portion first until exhausted to better understand how it works you need to understand the rationale behind the 5-year rule consider you have $ 100 k in your ira traditional and you want to take it out just withdrawing it would trigger a 10 k statutory penalty on top of the taxes due but you can use the backdoor roth ira right so convert the 100 k and then it becomes after tax contribution to roth ira and can be withdrawn with no penalty one form filled ad 10 k saved to block this loophole here comes the 5 years rule you can not withdraw after tax amounts for at least 5 years without penalty if the source was taxable conversion thus in order to avoid the 10 k penalty in the above situation you have a 5-year cooling period which makes the loophole useless for most cases however amounts that are after tax can be withdrawn without penalty already even from the traditional ira so there 's no need in the 5 years cooling period the withdrawal attribution is in this order roth ira rollovers are sourced to the origin e.g. if you converted $ 100 to the roth ira at firm x and then a year later rolled it over to firm y it does n't affect anything and the clock is ticking from the original date of the conversion at firm x. 5-year period applies to each conversion rollover from a qualified retirement plan see here distributions are applied to the conversions in fifo order so in one distribution depending on the amounts you may hit several different incoming conversions the 5 years should be check on each of them and the penalty applied on the amounts attributable to those that do n't have enough time 5-year period for contributions applies starting from the beginning of the first year of the first contribution that established your roth ira plan the penalty applies to the amounts that were included in your gross income when conversion occurred i.e. does n't apply on the amounts converted from after tax sources note the difference from the traditional ira distributions from pre tax sources are prorated between the non deductible basis amounts and the deductible earnings amounts taxable that is why the taxable amounts are first in the ordering of the distributions

the real answer why the government is allowed to do something is because they are the government and they make the rules there are lots of laws that i think make no sense i ran into a similar situation to yours i bought a house during a time when the market in my area was way down the previous owner had paid $ 140,000 but i got it for only $ 80,000 the government appraised it for i forget the exact number but over $ 100,000 i appealed and the argument i made to the appeal board was that the law says it is supposed to be appraised for fair market value the definition of fair market value is the amount that a willing buyer would pay to a willing seller absent special conditions like a sweetheart sale to a relative the house had been advertised for a higher price and the seller had to drop the price several times before getting an offer and finally accepting mine this is pretty much the definition of fair market value the appeals board replied that it was not fmv because the market was bad at this particular time and so i got a good deal i said that that 's the definition of market value it goes up and down as market conditions change if the market happened to be up when someone bought a house and they had to pay a high price would the government assess the house at a lower value because that was an unusually high price i doubt it they ended up reducing the assessed value but not to what i actually paid all that said arguably a foreclosure sale might be considered special conditions prices at a foreclosure sale tend to be lower than ordinary sales in a foreclosure the bank is usually trying to get rid of the property quickly because they do n't want to be in the property management business they want to be in the money lending and management business of course you could say that sort of thing about conditions surrounding many sales maybe the price is low because the seller needed cash now to start a business maybe the price is high because the buyer was too lazy to shop around maybe the price is low because the buyer is a very skilled negotiator etc etc   my watch just broke and while i was shopping for a new one i found two listings for the exact same watch i mean exact same manufacturer and model number identical picture on the same web site one giving the price as $ 24 and the other as $ 99 what is the market value of that watch i presume anyone who saw both listings would pick the $ 24 one but i presume some number of people pay the higher price because they never see the lower price in real life there is n't really one exact fair market value that 's an abstraction

what is wrong ca n't be fixed by communism education unions or new technology   these solutions all count on the problem being something it is n't     early capitalism did n't work until we learned we needed to tax real estate to keep the rich from draining our economies through their ownership and thus remove the value from work turning us into impoverished   today we have expanded the range of things that can earn money for their owners far beyond simple land and buildings into machinery patents software media and all manner of technology   furthermore we 've adopted a global policy of tax free trade which removes our ability to tax these things     until we adopt a political stance that treats profit as a drain on economic vitality and money seeking to earn more money as the enemy of our prosperity the world 's middle class will continue its descent into poverty

rebalancing your portfolio does n't have to include selling   you could simply adjust your buying to keep your portfolio in balance   if you portfolio has shifted from 50 stocks and 50 bonds to 75 stocks and 25 bonds you can just only use new savings to buy bonds until you are back at 50 50 remember to take into account taxes if you are thinking of selling to rebalance in taxable accounts the goal of rebalancing is to keep your exposures the way that you want them   assuming that you had a good reason to have a portfolio of 50 stocks and 50 bonds you probably want to keep your portfolio similar in the future   if you end up with a portfolio of 75 stocks and 25 bonds due to stock market fluctuations the exposure and the risk return profile of your portfolio will have changed and it 's probably not something that you want you do n't want to rebalance just for the sake of rebalancing either   there can be costs to rebalancing taxes transaction fees etc and these are n't always worth the effort   that 's why you do n't need to rebalance every month or if your portfolio has shifted from 50/50 to i take a look at my portfolio once a year and adjust my automated investments so that by the end of the next year i 'm back to the ratio i want

it depends on the type of loan   fully amortized loans have a schedule of payments do n't recalculate as you pay   if you want to make an additional payment you need to contact the lender to apply your payment toward principle and the loan   otherwise all your additional payment will do is change the amount due on your next payment or push out your next payment due date regarding interest calculation you owe interest on the principle outstanding   say you have a 10 year loan 120 months at 5 apr and a $ 1,000 payment this means you borrowed roughly $ each month the amount of interest owed reduces because there is less principle outstanding   the reason loans are amortized like this is so the borrower has a predictable known monthly amount due

bond etfs are traded like normal stock   it just so happens to be that the underlying fund for which you own shares is invested in bonds   such funds will typically own many bonds and have them laddered so that they are constantly maturing   such funds may also trade bonds on the otc market note that with bond etfs you 're able to lose money as well as gain depending on the situation with the bond market   the issuer of the bond does not need to default in order for this to happen   the value of a bond and thus the value of the bond fund which holds the bonds is much like a stock determined based on factors like supply demand interest rates credit ratings news etc

there is certainly an obligation in some cases of a company to distribute profit either as dividend or a stock buy back activist investors frequently push for one or the other when a company is doing well sometimes to the detriment of future growth in some eyes and can even file shareholder lawsuits saying the company is not doing its duty to its shareholders by simply holding onto cash   apple famously held out from doing either for years under steve jobs and only in the last few years started doing both a large dividend and a share buy back which increases the value of remaining shares as eps then goes up with fewer shares out there   carl icahn for example is one of those investors in apple 's case and in many cases who put significant pressure particularly when they were sitting on hundreds of billions of dollars ultimately a for profit corporation 's board is tasked with maximizing its shareholder 's wealth as such it can buy back shares pay dividends sell the company liquidate the company or expand the company at its discretion so long as it can justify to its shareholders that it is still attempting to maximize the value of their holdings   companies in their growth phase often do n't return any money and simply reinvest but the long term hope is to either return money in the form of dividends on profits or the sale of the company

companies theoretically have an infinite number of equity units at their disposal   issuance must be approved according to its founding contracts if an equity is trading on an open market then the price of each unit issued in lieu of cash compensation is known   even if an equity does n't trade openly bidders can be solicited for a possible price or an appraisal   this can be a risky route for the potentially compensated market are frequently generally approximately equal to the sales of a company   salaries and wages are frequently generally two thirds of sales it is indeed expensive for the average company to compensate with equity thus so few do usually restricting equity compensation to executives and exceptional laborers   besides they frequently have enough cash to pay for compensation avoiding transaction costs for companies in growth industries such as technology or medicine their situations are usually reversed cash constrained yet equity abundant because of large investment and dearly priced equities   for a company trading at a market capitalization multiplied by forty times the revenue compensating with equity is inexpensive

i am interested in seeing what happens to your report after you test this but i do n't think it 's possible in practice would not affect your credit score and also would n't be worth it for you to carry a negative balance like that having a -1 credit utilization essentially means that you are lending the credit card company money which is n't really something that the credit card companies do they would likely not accept an agreement where you are providing the credit to them having credit is a more formal agreement than just i paid you too much this month even if your payment does post before the transaction and it says you have a negative balance and gets reported to the credit bureau like that this would probably get flagged for human review and a negative credit utilization does n't really reflect what is happening credit utilization is how much do you owe amount of credit available to you and it 's not really correct to say that you owe negative dollars carrying a negative balance like that is money that could be invested elsewhere my guess is that the credit card company is not paying you the apr of your card on the amount they owe you if they are please provide the name of your card they probably do n't pay you anything for that negative balance and it 's money that 's better used elsewhere even if it does benefit your credit score you 're losing out on any interest each month you could have earned with that money to get maybe 1 2 better rate on your next home or car loan when will that be   tldr i think credit utilization approaches a limit at 0 because it 's based on the amount you owe and you do n't really owe negative dollars i am very interested in seeing the results of this experiment please update us when you find out

i would say the most challenging fact for this assertion is that hft firms operate with extremely limited capital bases for a stock with say 10 m shares adv even a very large and successful hft strategy might use a position limit of no more than 5000 shares   that is to say if you sum up and net the buys and sells for a stock across the day the hft firm will never exceed 10,000 shares 2x position limits assuming it completely flipped on a stock that trades 10,000,000 shares on a given day the high volumes are attained through high turnover the strategy might trade up to 500,000 shares or 5 of the volume attaining a 50x turnover   but that brings me back to the original point in the market literature market impact generally has been found to scale linearly or even sub linearly for net volume executed    if i alternate between thousands of 1 lot buy and sell orders it would be very difficult for me to move the market because the market impact of every one of my buy orders roughly cancels the market impact of my almost exactly equal number of sell orders    there might be a higher order mechanism at work but i 'm genuinely curious what you think it might be how could strategies that attain such small net positions have such out sized impact on market direction

how much should my down payment be ideally 20 of the purchase price because with 20 of the purchase price you do n't have to pay a costly private mortgage insurance pmi   if you do n't have 20 down and come across a good property to purchase it is still a good idea to go forward with purchasing with what you are comfortable with because renting long term is generally never a good idea if you want to build wealth and become financially independent how much should i keep in my emergency fund people say 3 12 months of living expenses   keep in mind though in most cases if you lose your job you are entitled to unemployment benefits from the government how long should my mortgage be 30 year amortization is the best you can always opt to pay more each month   but having that leverage with a 30 year loan can allow you to invest your savings in other opportunities which can yield more than mortgage interest best of luck

as far as the money goes it all comes down to the terms   what is going to cost you the least   look for hidden fees and costs with the store credit   you will need to read the fine print of the credit agreement some automatically sign you up for a service that will cost you extra money every month    compare what the costs are going to be over the term you will pay it off   a good calculator to help you figure this out is it is designed with larger loans but works for smaller loans too    realize that you will have to add fees and finance charges into the total loan amount to get a good comparison unless you need a computer you should wait until you can afford to pay for it   charging these types of expenses tends to lead down to a pit of debt that is hard to get out of   wanting a computer really bad is not the same as a need

you could of course request payment in eur or usd maybe keep a paypal account and just leave the funds in paypal unless you need to withdraw the money in local currency either currency would be fine because the problem you are trying to overcome is the instability in the ruble eur and usd both accomplish that if you can get local clients to pay in eur or usd again paypal seems like an easy way to accomplish that you avoid the ruble but at the risk that your services become more expensive to local clients because they have to convert a weaker currency to a stronger one you should also solicit some international clients you are obviously perfectly fluent in english and that 's a significant advantage and they 'll be happy to pay in dollars and euros

if history is any guide page ’s idealistic impulses could result in a more sprawling company the following is an example of one of page ’s idealistic impulses wanting people to share spectrum which could result in a more sprawling company if they had n't been outbid google would have expanded by buying a business asset i.e. spectrum which they did n't need i 've no experience with bidding i do n't understand what 's happening at all an auction is a way to sell something instead of offering it for sale at a fixed price you offer it to the highest bidder someone e.g. google says i 'll offer you some amount e.g. a million dollars for it if no one else exceeds that bid then you say sold and google has bought it alternatively someone else comes along with a higher bid i 'll offer you two million dollars for it in which case they 're the new high bidder and you 'll sell it to them unless the process repeats itself with anyone counter offering an even higher bid see also and the disadvantages section of this article alleges currently without a citation that despite the apparent success of spectrum auctions an important disadvantage limiting both efficiency and revenues is demand reduction and bidding the information and flexibility in the process of auction can be used to reduce auction prices by collusion when bidder competition is weak and one bidder holds an apparent advantage to win the auction for specific licenses other bidders will often choose not to the bid for higher prices hence reducing the final revenue generated by the needed in this case the auction is best thought of as a negotiation among the bidders who agree on who should win the auction for each discrete bit of spectrum google 's bid made that impossible or at least ensured that the winning bid would be at least as high as the minimum which was set by google 's bid

if you selected a mortgage that allows additional payments to be credited against the principal rather than as early payment of normal installments them yes doing so will reduce the actual cost of the loan you may have to explicitly instruct the bank to use the money this way each time if prepay is their default assumption check with your lender and/or read the terms of your mortgage to find out if this is allowed and how to do it if your mortgage does n't allow additional payments against the principal you may want to consider refinancing into a mortgage which does or into a mortgage with shorter term and higher monthly payments to obtain the same lower cost closing costs on the new mortgage run the numbers

a 401k plan will ask you to name a beneficiary who will receive the funds if you do n't withdraw them all before death usually a primary beneficiary and a secondary beneficiary is requested if you do n't specify a beneficiary your estate is the beneficiary by default   note that the name supplied to the 401k plan is who will get the money and you can not change this by the money in your will for example if you neglected to change the beneficiary upon divorce it is useless to say in your will that the money in the 401k plan goes to your new wife the 401k plan will give it to your ex wife who still remains the beneficiary of your 401k money in a 401k plan is what is called income with respect to a decedent   on which income tax is levied and it is also is part of your estate and thus liable to be subject to estate tax   the latter is true even if the 401k plan assets are not mentioned anywhere in your will and even if the assets got sent to your ex wife which is not what you wanted to have happen   there are various estate tax exceptions for spouse beneficiaries no   estate tax due now but will be charged when the spouse passes away with regard to income tax the beneficiaries of a 401k plan similarly iras 403b plans etc generally get to take the whole amount and pay the income   tax themselves edit in response to littleadv 's comments each 401k plan is different and some plans especially the smaller ones may prefer to distribute the   401k assets as a lump sum rather than allow the beneficiaries to withdraw   the money over several years and pay income tax on the amount withdrawn each year this is because there are far too many rules and regulations to trip over when making withdrawals over several years the lump sum distribution can be transferred into a newly established   inherited ira see the nolo article linked to in @littleadv 's answer for some details and some pitfalls to avoid and the income tax is thus deferred until withdrawals occur   spouse   beneficiaries are entitled to more generous rules than non spouse   beneficiaries if your heirs are otherwise well provided for and you are in a   philanthropic mood or you do n't want to give 'em a dime the who never call not even on father 's day one way of avoiding a   lot of tax is to make the beneficiary of your 401k be one or more of your favorite charities in fact if your testamentary inclination is to make some charitable as part of your will it is much more advantageous to give money from a tax deferred account to the charity size of estate is reduced no income   tax paid by anyone on amount given and assets in non retirement accounts to one 's heirs are not taxable income and heirs get a step up in basis for assets that have appreciated rather than the other way around heirs pay income tax as they withdraw the money from tax deferred   account estate planning is a complicated business and you really should talk to a professional about such matters and not rely on advice from an internet forum

the hard and fast rule is to pay off high interest loans first but each individual 's situation is different so there are some things to consider student loan interest is tax deductible up to $ 2,500   will your student loan interest exceed $ 2,500 for the year   if so i would try to pay down the student loan first to bring down the total interest for the year so that you get as much interest back as possible on your tax return   also it may be beneficial to pay off the car first to close that account so that you are only left with the 1 loan   once you have the car loan payment out of the way you can dedicate that amount to paying off the student loan i 'm in almost the same situation as you   i currently have a mortgage and car payment   in 6 months my grace period will be over and my student loan payments will start   i have $ 100k in student loan debt   so i will have a $ 1,100 mortgage payment $ 1,100 student loan payment and $ 700 car payment car loan is 0   i do n't want to have 3 loans active so i will pay off my car loan in a 2 3 months to get that out of the way   then i will pay down my student loan by paying $ 700 extra every month

here 's a good link that can answer your question how to take delivery of a futures contract the relevant part states prior to delivery day they inform customers who have open long positions that they must either close out the position or prepare to take delivery and pay the full value of the underlying contract by the same token traders with short positions are informed that they must close out their trades or prepare to deliver the underlying commodity in this case they must have the required quantity and quality of the deliverable commodity on hand    on the few occasions that a buyer accepts delivery against his futures contract he is usually not given the underlying commodity itself except in the case of financials but rather a receipt entitling him to fetch the wheat or corn from warehouses or distribution points i hope this helps good luck

making these difficult portfolio decisions for you is the point of target date retirement funds   you pick a date at which you 're going to start needing to withdraw the money and the company managing the fund slowly turns down the of the fund as the target date approaches   typically you would pick the target date to be around say your birthday   many mutual fund companies offer a variety of funds to suit your needs your desire to never have to recover indicates that you have not yet done quite enough reading on the subject of investing   or possibly that your sources have been misleading you   a basic understanding of investing includes the knowledge that markets go up and down and that no portfolio will always go up   some recovery will always be necessary having a less aggressive portfolio will never shield you completely from losing money it just makes loss less likely the important thing is to only invest money that you can afford to lose in the short term with the understanding that you 'll make it back in the long term   money that you 'll need in the short term should be kept in the absolute safest investment vehicles such as a savings account a money market account short term certificates of deposit or short term us government bonds

the obvious disadvantage of paying loans off more slowly is that you will pay a lot more in total interest which means less savings and less disposable income on the long term unless you are doing something with the money which produces more income than the interest costs you this is very much penny wise pound foolish if you are n't making money by paying that money all you can do is loose money at the slowest rate you can afford you do that by paying off the loan as quickly as you can afford to do so it 's up to you to look seriously at your finances and decide what your real needs are how you 're going to meet them and how much you can afford beyond that while still paying off the loans as quickly as possible now will cost you much more than you expect layer due to the compounding you will have missed out on really   see the questions about how to start saving investing for answers that discuss how to prioritize your money there are some steps you should be taking asap if you have n't already done so

there could be a number of reasons the price hit your number $ but by the time your order hit the market the price had gone up perhaps the stock went up between when you placed the stop loss and when the order was executed a trailing stop loss will ratchet up very simply the trailing stop maintains a stop loss order at a precise percentage below the market price or above in the case of a short position the stop loss order is adjusted continually based on fluctuations in the market price always maintaining the same percentage below or above the market price

i believe you may be missing the point here it they do n't really verify this that before bofa took over the loan the homeowners were not using an escrow account i know this is possible because i had the option of using one or not when i bought my house so it seems that once bofa took over they automatically created an escrow account and when the normal payments the homeowners were making did n't cover the total monthly balance they took it out of the payment specifically for the mortgage    so according to this story its not sensational bullshit this would be the bank creating an issue that is according to the facts that are presented in the article which may not be the whole story   spelling amp grammar

try and bring with you a folder full of evidence about your skills and accomplishments many of the top blue chip companies do what 's called evidence based interviewing and it means you provide evidence to back up your assertions about how great you are so for example the interviewer asks how you get on with your colleagues and you provide an email thanking you for being a great team player or they ask you about research and you show them a piece of research you did of course this is harder when you go for your first job but bring what you can as an alternative and/or alongside this you can use stories as someone else said as a kind of evidence if you do n't have any physical evidence your story should show systematically how you handled a situation to get a good outcome   if they are a very conservative company they will want you to show that although you can kind of think outside the box you are not prone to emotional reactions or knee jerk responses and everything you do is carefully thought out and would n't bring them into if it got covered on the front page of a newspaper   good luck

the value of a company is simplified the sum of the value of the equity and the value of the debt there are some other things to add subtract to that but just think about those for now   you could also say the value of a company is the value of its assets or more precisely the value of the net cash flows those assets will generate in the future   so let 's say you want to start a company so you want to buy some assets maybe you want to buy a $ 200 asset well you only have $ 100 so you take out a loan debt for $ 100 for the remainder you buy the asset and start generating income   let 's say after a month you get bored and decide to sell the company let 's assume the value of the assets has n't changed your equity is worth $ 100 and you find a buyer who is willing to pay $ 100 for your company great right   well there 's still the $ 100 loan you owe so you have to pay that back and suddenly you now have $ 0    so in fact you should have negotiated $ 200 with the buyer because that 's what the assets are actually worth then you can pay back the loan and still have the $ 100 in equity you deserve alternatively you could have negotiated the buyer to assume responsibility for the loan same outcome for you   did that help

if it were me i would convert it to cash and keep it in a liquid account the assumption that silver will increase in value is misguided from 1985 to 2002 it was flat it 's gone up and been far more volatile since then and there has been significant declines which could eat at the stability of an emergency fund precious metals are speculation not investing they do not create wealth investing is typically considered too volatile for an emergency fund more so keeping the money in metals making it more difficult to get to like keeping it in a separate account might also fight against frivolous or accidental spending also there tends to be high transaction costs when liquidating metals i found the best way is to use ebay after some further comments and clarification here i suspect you are dealing with something else namely the white picket fence again this is supposition but perhaps she the two of you married and hosting a dinner party using the passed down silver this could be a strong emotional bond and as such it could trump the logical arguments keeping it as an emergency fund foolish you helping her keep it because you are planning a life together smart

you may have misunderstood some parts of the system if you make a pension contribution in any given year the tax relief is based on your income for that year the gross pension contribution is subtracted from your gross income and you only end up paying tax based on the reduced gross income so if the higher rate threshold is £ 40 k you have income for the year of £ 65 k and you make a gross contribution of £ 25 k then you 'll get tax relief at 40 on the whole contribution i.e. £ 10k. if your income for the year is less e.g. £ 50 k then you 'll get tax relief at 40 on £ 10 k and at 20 on the other £ 15 k i.e. £ so if you 're significantly into the higher rate band it 's usually not worth making a contribution large enough to reduce you to basic rate tax better to wait till the next tax year for the rest overall while you probably could do what you suggest subject to the caveats below why not just spread the pension contribution over the three years rather than making it all up front if you are confident you can invest the money at better than the 3.4 interest on the loan then it might make sense to borrow but you should be pretty clear that you 're deliberately borrowing to invest otherwise known as investing with leverage or you might know that your income is going to drop next year another clarification as your comment on another answer mentions basic rate tax relief is claimed directly by your pension provider relief at source whereas the higher rate part of the relief comes straight to you via your tax return so for the above £ 25 k gross contribution example you 'd hand over £ 20 k initially and then get £ 5 k back at the end of the tax year leaving you with £ 15 k less in your pocket if you did want to make a £ 20 k net contribution and had enough higher rate salary to cover it the gross contribution you 'd end up with would be £ and you 'd need to find £ more temporarily note that there are also limits on the annual contribution you can make of £ 40 k the annual allowance but you can carry forward allowances from three previous years so it 's very unlikely to be relevant

basically you have purchased 25 of the condo for $ 40,000 and your parents bought 75 of the condo for another $ 115,000 we imagine for a moment that it was n't you who lived in the condo but some unrelated person paying rent   you are paying $ 7,500 a year for tax and fees plus $ 6,000 a year so there is $ leaving your wallet if $ a year was a reasonable rent then the tax and fee would be paid out of that there would be $ 8,000 left of which you would get 25 = $ 2,000 if you were officially renting it you would pay $ a year and get $ 2,000 back again $ leaving your wallet so you are in exact the same situation financially as you would be if you paid $ rent    question is $ a year or $ a month an appropriate rent for your condo if a neighbour is renting his condo is he or she paying $ or more or less could you rent the same place for the same money if $ is the correct rent then you are fine if the rent should be lower then you are overpaying if the rent should be higher then you are making money   keep in mind that you will also be winning if rents go up in the future

e.g. a european company has to pay 1 million usd exactly one year from now while that is theoretically possible that is not a very common case mostly likely if they had to make a 1 million usd payment a year from now and they had the cash on hand they would be able to just make the payment today   a more common scenario for currency forwards is for investment hedging   say that european company wants to buy into a mutual fund of some sort say fusex that is a usd based mutual fund you ca n't buy into it directly with euros so if the company wants to buy into the fund they would need to convert their euros to to usd but now they have an extra risk parameter they are not just exposed to the fluctuations of the fund they are also exposed to the fluctuations of the currency market perhaps that fund will make a killing but the exchange rate will tank and they will lose all their gains by creating a forward to hedge their currency exposure risk they do not face this risk flip side if the exchange rate rises in a favorable rate they also do n't get that benefit unless they use an fx option but that is generally more expensive and complicated

as well as credit risk there 's also interest risk if a bond has a face value of $ 100 pays 1 and matures in 20 years time then you expect to receive a total of $ 120 from buying it now $ 1 per year for 20 years and $ 100 at the end but if you can get a 3 return elsewhere then if you invest your $ 80 there instead you will get $ per year for 20 years and then $ 80 at the end making a total of $ 128 and you also get more of the money sooner so even $ 80 for the $ 100 bond is a bad buy and you should invest elsewhere

from indian context there are a number of factors that are influencing the economic condition and the exchange rate interest rate etc are reflection of the situation i shall try and answer the question through the above indian example india is running a budget deficit of 4 odd for last 6 7 years which means that is spending more than their revenue collection this money is not in the system so the govt has to print the money either the direct 4 or the interest it has to pay on the money it borrows to cover the 4 do n't confuse this with us printing post 2008 after printing the supply of inr is more compared to usd in the market inr is current a c convertible value of inr usd falls in simplistic terms there is another impact of this printing it increases the money supply in domestic market leading to inflation and overall price rise to contain this price rise reserve bank of india rbi increases the interest rates and increases compulsory reserve ratio thus trying to pull lock up money so that overall money supply decreases but there is a limit to which rbi can do this as overall growth rate keeps falling as money is more expensive to borrow to invest the above in simplistic term how this is working however there are many factors in economy and the above should be treated as it is intended to a simplistic view only

first you should understand the basics of how insurance companies make money in a simple scenario assume 1,000 have car insurance assume that on average 100 people have accidents per year and that each accident costs $ 10,000 so we can expect total costs to be $ 1,000,000 per year some of those costs will be paid by the drivers who have some sort of deductible that is the insurance company will only cover costs after the driver has paid some initial amount something like the first $ 1,000 of repairs is paid by the driver so now the insurance company expects to have to pay out $ 900,000 in total claims this year if they want to pay those claims and also pay their administrative costs and earn a profit they might want to have $ in revenue across 1,000 people that would be $ 1,250 year in insurance premiums of course the big question for the insurance company is how much will they really need to pay out in insurance claims each year the better they can predict that number the more profitable they can be because they can charge a much more accurate amount which can earn them new customers and gives them insurance pun that each new customer is actually profitable to them on average so the insurance company spends a lot of time and money trying to predict your likelihood of a car accident they use a lot of metrics to do this some might be statistical that they charge you because they feel they can if every insurance company charges you extra for driving a instead of a then they all will and some might be based in reality so they attempt to correlate all of the items in your list to see if any of those items indicates that you should be charged more or less for your insurance this is equal parts art and science and a lot of it comes down to how they market themselves ie if an insurance company gives a discount for being in college is that because college drivers are better drivers or is it because they want to increase the number of young customers they have so they can keep those customers for life therefore how each metric factors into your calculation will be based on the company using it it would basically be impossible to come up with the same answer as the insurance company by having the information you provided because of how heavily dependant that answer is on statistics + marketing as for how your state matters some states may have different accident rates and different payout systems for example is hawaii driving more dangerous because of all the tourists driving rented cars faster than they should is new york less expensive to insure because better public health care means less cost is borne by the insurance company in the event of an accident i have no idea if either of these things are the case they are purely for hypothetical discussion purposes   in short make sure you get quotes from multiple providers and understand that it is n't just the cost that changes check changes in coverage and deductibles as well ie if one company charges you $ 100 month when everyone else charges $ 200 month make sure that the cheaper company does n't limit its coverage in ways that matter to you

your first step is to talk to the current lender and ask about refinancing in the other person 's name the lender is free to say no and if they think the other person is unlikely to pay it back they wo n't refinance if you 're in this situation because the other person did n't qualify for a loan in the first place the lender probably wo n't change their mind but it 's still worth asking from the lender 's point of view you 'll be selling the other person the car   if they qualify for a loan it 's as simple as getting the loan from a bank then doing whatever is required by your state to sell a car between either private parties or between relatives depending on who the other person is the bank might help you with this or your state 's dmv website   here are a few options that do n't involve changing who is on the loan taking out a loan for another person is always a big risk banks have entire departments devoted to determining who is a good credit risk and who is n't so if a person ca n't get a loan from a bank it 's usually for a good reason   one good thing about your situation you actually bought the car and are the listed owner had you co signed on a loan in the other person 's name you 'd owe the money but would n't even have the car 's value to fall back on when they stopped paying

first i want to point out that your question contains an assumption does anyone make significant money trading low volume stocks   i 'm not sure this is the case i 've never heard of a hedge fund trading in the pink sheets for example second if your assumption is valid here are a few ideas how it might work accumulate slowly exit slowly   this wo n't work for short term swings but if you feel like a low volume stock will be a longer term winner you can accumulate a sizable portion in small enough chunks not to swing the price and then slowly unwind your position when the price has increased sufficiently create additional buyers sellers   your frustration may be one of the reasons low volume stock is so full of scammers pumping and dumping read any investing message board to see examples of this   if you can scare holders of the stock into selling you can buy significant portions without driving the stock price up   similarly if you can convince people to buy the stock you can unload without destroying the price   this is of course morally and legally dubious so i would not recommend this practice

it depends on the exact level of risk that you want but if you want to keep your risk close to zero you 're pretty much stuck with the banks and those rates do n't look to be going up any time soon if you 're willing to accept a little more risk you can invest in some index tracking etfs instead with the main providers in australia being vanguard street state and   a useful tool for for an overview of the australian etf market is offered by the index funds reduce your level of risk by investing in an index of the market e.g. the s&p 200 tracked by   if the market as a whole rises then your investment will too even though within that index individual companies will rise and fall this limits your potential rate of return as well and is still significantly more risky than leaving your cash in an aussie bank after all the whole market can fall but it might strike the right balance for you if you 're getting started hsbc and westpac were all offering a couple of months of free trades up to a certain value   once the free trades are done you 'll do better to move to another broker you can migrate your shares to the others to take advantage of their free trades too or to a cheaper broker like cmc markets

it 's really a calculated risk the most you gain is for the growth to be tax free the downside for the excess the growth is taxed plus the 10 penalty i 'd suggest a simple strategy deposit as much as you can early on until the balance approaches the current 4 yr college cost then just add enough to match the current cost i.e. if college costs grow more than the account just make up that difference

as an nri you ca n't hold a regular savings account it should have been converted to nro option 1 open nre account since i am relocating permanently this might not be good option for me as converting   this is the best option as funds into nre are not taxable in india the provides a clean paper trail so that if there are any tax queries you can answer them easily you can open a rupee nre account move the funds on return move the funds into normal savings account and close the nre account this is not much of hassle option 2 create nro account there would be taxes on the interest earned of the funds but i am not sure of this since i will have been moved to india permanently would i need to still pay taxes on the interest earned while i am in india any interest in nro or normal savings account is taxable in india there is no exemption   option 3 i can transfer my funds directly to my account in india but i believe i would have to pay tax on the the funds that i transfer and that would be double taxation which i think would be the worst option for me please correct me if i am wrong this is incorrect any earnings outside of india when your status is nri is not taxable in india opening an nre account provides proper paper trail of funds as an nri one can not hold normal savings account this should have been converted into an nro account although there is no penalty prescribed its violation of fema regulation i also hope you were declaring any income in india i.e. interest etc on savings and filing returns accordingly option 4 i can transfer the funds to my direct relatives account i still believe there would be tax to be paid on the interest earned of the amount you can transfer it to your parents siblings etc this would come under gift tax and would not be taxable they can then gift this back to you however such transactions would appear to be evading regulations and may come under scrutiny interest on savings account is taxable so best is go with option 1 no hassle else go with option 3 but ensure that you have all the paperwork kept handy for next 7 years

this is a good question and a question i have asked about whether to invest in a roth ira or a traditional ira this is my take on the picture i 'm not sure about your tax situation and how much you 'd have to pay for each conversion you did whether you have extra money to pay those taxes etc in my opinion i do n't think it would be a good idea to use your 401(k principal to pay taxes but to have the extra money to pay these when rolling over so you do n't lose any interest especially since you 're near the end of your snowball effect with interest in your retirement account here is a resource to consider also another thing to consider that i do n't really see much of on here is inflation if you 're going to be in the same tax bracket as you are now and if whatever you 're contributing to your 401(k or traditional ira is not bumping you down in the 15 bracket then i would suggest doing a roth ira i say this because to me when i retire i would have rather paid my taxes throughout the years i 'm 23 and in 25 marginal tax bracket in a roth ira and pay nothing when i 'm withdrawing in 30 years factors people forget to consider are that the cost of living is going to be much much higher for me down the road and the cost of sending a child to school is going to be much higher as well since your child is young consider this site for the cost of a college education for your child this is comparing the average cost of education for someone attending college in 2015 versus a child born in 2015 while this seems drastic and there could be a lot of different things that happen by that time it 's a decent illustration while the website provided certainly is n't validated by the doe i have read multiple articles about this and they are all very similar again other things could happen between now and your child 's college career but if college becomes free we 're paying for it and if it 's not free and raises at historical rates you 're paying for it i also do n't really want to comment on what is going to happen with taxes over the years i 'm not sure where you live i 'm in the u.s. but imo i believe they either a wo n't change or b will raise slightly as far as ss goes i think it 's fair and definitely more than reasonable to not expect ss in retirement i 'm definitely not counting on it

the most obvious use of a collateral is as a risk buffer just as when you borrow money to buy a house and the bank uses the house as a collateral so when people borrow money to loan financial instruments or as is more accurate gain leverage the lender keeps a percentage of that or an equivalent instrument as a collateral in the event that the borrower falls short of margin requirements brokers in most cases have the right to sell that collateral and mitigate the risk   derivatives contracts like any other financial instrument come with their risks and depending on their nature they may sometimes be much more riskier than their underlying instruments for example while a common stock 's main risk comes from the movements in its price which may itself result from many other macro micro economic factors an option in that common stock faces risks from those factors plus the volatility of the stock 's price   to cover this risk lenders apply much higher haircuts when lending against these derivatives in many cases depending upon the notional exposure of the derivative that actual dollar amount of the collateral may be more than the face value or the market value of the derivatives contract usually this collateral is deposited not as the derivatives contract itself but rather as the underlying financial instrument an equity in case of an option a bond in case of a cds and so on this allows the lender to offset the risk by executing a trade on that collateral itself

if the company is non public your hands are tied most startups have a stock option plan with specific rules on the shares in almost all cases they have a clause preventing transfers of options and shares unless approved by the company who would almost always say no additionally they usually have a right of first refusal which states that if shares are going to be transferred the company gets the chance to buy it first in your case the company may argue your friend would sell you the shares for free and the company would exercise their and buy back the shares for free there is not much you can do in this case you may be able to write up a contract between your friend and you but it would be costly and possibly not worth the effort you may be better off asking for a lump sum or some other sort of compensation additionally your friend might want to be careful with this idea you could potentially gain access to sensitive company tools documents which could get them in a lot of trouble

it 's definitely a racket but safety is a pretty good reason to implement regulation and filters on who can be a driver some places have had illegal taxis operating for years which might be fine a lot of the time but can also lead to drivers robbing hurting people this is the thing that taxi drivers keep trying to remind us of while they try to keep their jobs it 's also why a lot of people would be scared to try in fact my previous manager went on a work trip to africa years ago was met at the airport by a taxi driver got driven into the middle of nowhere and robbed at gunpoint similar might have happened to me and my mum after landing in kuala lumpur years ago having a taxi driver offer us his services which we accepted only for him to run away before we got to his car because the airport police saw him and gave chase on sight   do n't forget when you get into a car you are at the mercy of the driver if taxis were just any dude who happens to be in a car then it could easily be a bad guy pretending to be a taxi driver to find victims but if taxis are uniquely marked and drivers have special licenses you at least get some assurance that their main motivation is to provide a taxi service   a key thing that uber changed is making it feel like the drivers and passengers are easily identified by being on the app while making a strong public case for their service making drivers and passengers seem legitimate but imagine getting into strangers cars a few years ago when it was n't common or even easier imagine getting into a strangers car that you did n't book through uber imagine standing at a bus stop and having some dude in a camry pull up and ask if you need a ride or seeing some guy on craigslist advertising himself as a private taxi who does n't want to use uber   if you 're asking why taxis are so expensive everywhere well that 's probably more to do with them being scummy protectionist businesses than anything else but until a few years ago the service that uber and airbnb provide was highly sketchy outside the proper channels

paying off the debt is low risk low reward   you 're effectively guaranteed a 4 return   if you buy a mutual fund you 're going to have to take some risk to have a decent chance of getting better than 4 and change return in the long run which probably means a fund that invests primarily in stocks   buying a stock mutual fund is high risk high reward especially when you 're in significant debt   on the other hand 4 and change is very low interest   if you wanted to buy stocks on margin financing stock investments directly with debt you 'd pay a heck of a lot more   bottom line   it comes down to your personal risk tolerance

looking over some historical data i can not really a find a case where a stock went from $ to $ 1 it almost seem that once a stock crosses a minimum threshold the stock never goes back up is there any truth to that that would be a 200,000 increase in the per share value which would be extraordinary   when looking at stock returns you have to look at percentage returns not dollar returns   a gain of $ 1 would be minuscule for berkshire hathaway stock but would be astronomical for this stock if the company is making money should n't the stock go up not necessarily   the price of a stock is a measure of expected future performance not necessarily past performance   if the earnings had been more that the market expected then the price might go up but if the market sees it as an anomaly that wo n't continue then there may not be enough buyers to move the stock up looking at it long term would it hurt me in anyway to buy shares which right now would run be about $ 24 including to fee and sit on it if you can afford to lose all $ 24 then no it wo n't hurt   but i would n't expect that $ 24 to turn into anything higher than about $ 100   at best it might be an interesting learning experience

in general stock markets are very similar to that however you can also put in limit orders to say that you will only buy or sell at a given price these sit in the market for a specified length of time and will be executed when an order arrives that matches the price or better traders who set limit orders are called liquidity or price makers as they provide liquidity i.e. volume to be traded to be filled later if there is no counterparty i.e. buyer to your seller in the market a market maker a large bank or brokerage who is licensed and regulated to do so will fill your order at some price that price is based on how much volume i.e. trading there is in that stock on average this is called average daily volume adv and is calculated over varying periods of time we use which is the 30 day average you can always sell stocks for whatever price you like privately but a market order does not allow you to set your price you are a price taker therefore that kind of order will always fill at a market price as mentioned above limit orders will not fill until the price is hit but will stay on book as long as they are n't filled expired or cancelled

i 'll start with a question is the 63 k before or after taxes   the short answer to your question on how much is reasonable is it depends it depends on a lot more than where you live it depends on what you want do you want to pay down debt do you want to save are you trying to buy a house those will influence how much you can should let yourselves spend it also depends on your actual salary just because i spend 5 of my salary on something does n't mean to you if you 're making and i 'm only making 10,000   i also have a lot of respect for you trying to take this on it 's never easy but i would also recommend you start by trying to see what you can do to track how much you are actually spending that can be hard especially if you mostly use cash   once you 're tracking what you spend i still think you 're coming at this a bit backwards though rather than ask how much is reasonable to spend on those other expenses you basically need to rule out the bigger items first this means things like taxes your housing food transportation and kid related expenses i 've got 2.5 kids of my own i would guess that you 're listing your pre tax salaries on here so start first with whatever it costs you to pay taxes i 'm a us citizen living in berlin have n't filed uk taxes but says that on a year with 3 deductions your net earnings will actually be that 's   then what does it cost you each month for rent utilities etc to put a house over your family 's head the rule of thumb they taught in my home economics class was 35 40 but that 's not for europe you 'll know what it costs let 's say its a month 40 for rent and utilities and maybe insurance that leaves   the next necessity after housing is food my current food budget is about 5 6 of my after tax salary but that may not compare the cost to feed a family of 3 is a fairly fixed number and our salaries are n't the same as i said i am a us expat living in berlin so i looked at this cost of living calculator and it looks like groceries are about 7 10 higher there around than here in germany still i spend about 120 € per week on food that has a fair margin in it for splurging on ice cream and a couple it feeds me i 'm almost 2 m and about 100 kilos and my family of four let 's say you spend 100 £ a week on groceries for budgeting that 's £ a month 52 weeks 12 months = = weeks month but let 's call it that leaves   from here you 'll have to figure out the details of where your own money is going that 's why i said you should really start tracking your expenses somehow even just for a short time but for the purposes of completing the answers to your questions the next step is to look at saving before you try spending anything else a nice target is to aim for 10 of your after tax pay going into a savings account this is apart from any other investments let 's say you do that you 'll be putting away £ per month that leaves   as far as other expenses you need some money for transport you have n't mentioned but let 's say you 're spending another 500 £ there that would be about enough to cover one with the petrol you need to get around town that leaves 800 £ as far as a clothing budget and entertainment i usually match my grocery budget with what i call mad money that 's basically money that goes towards other stuff that i would love to categorize but that my wife gets annoyed with my efforts to drill into on a regular basis that 's another 500 £ which leaves   you mentioned debts assuming that 's a credit card at around 20 interest you probably pay 133 £ a month just in interest 20 = 0.20 12 = x 8,000 = 133 plus some nominal payment towards principal so let 's call it that leaves you with 125 £ of wiggle room assuming i have even caught all of your expenses and depending on how they 're timed you are probably feeling a serious squeeze in between paychecks i recognize that you 're asking specific questions but i think that just based on the questions you need a bit more careful backing into the budget and you really need to track what you 're spending for the time being until you can say right we usually spend about this much on x how can we cut it out   from there the basics of getting your financial house in order are across the interwebs make a budget stick to it pay down debts save develop goals and mini incentives rewards as a way to make sure your change your psyche about following a budget

there are reward points that you have already mentioned some banks also give reward points for transfer although very few and less than debit card on a fraudulent site debit card adds a layer if compromised easy to change i.e just hot list the card get a new card issued quite a few banks have incorrect implementation and difficult to change the login id user id the dispute resolution mechanism is well established as there is master or visa network involved the ease of doing transaction is with as for card one has to remember 16 digits expiry cvv the entire process of card usage is on slow connection if something goes wrong it takes 3 days to figure out in it is instantaneous you just login to bank and see if the debit has gone through

a few reasons make sense they have a defined process for rentals risk assessment and customer credit especially for a large corporation making changes to that process is not trivial adds risk uncertainty and will be costly such changes for a relatively small customer base might not makes sense many rental companies do allow you to rent with a debit card why do some businesses take cash only   with a debit card there is no third party guarantee with a credit card the cash is coming from a well established third party who will pay assuming no disputes and has a well established history of paying even if the merchant holds your account it is still your cash under the control of you and your bank until the deposit clears the merchants bank it is not surprising they view that as more risk and potentially not worth with debit

it is unusual to need a consultant to open a bank account for you and i would also be concerned that perhaps the consultant could take the money and do nothing or continue to demand various sums of money for expenses like permits licenses identity check etc   until you give up     some of the more accepted ways to open a bank account are a call up an established bank and follow their instructions to open a personal account make sure you are calling on a real bank one that has been around a while hints has permanent locations in the local phone book and has shares traded on a national stock exchange   call the bank directly do n't use a number given to you by a 3rd party consultant as it may be a trick discuss on the phone and find out if you can open an account by mail or if you need to visit in person   b create a company or branch office in the foreign country assuming this is for business or investing    and open an account by appointing someone like a lawyer or accountant or similar professional in the foreign country to represent the company to open an account in person   if you are a us citizen you will want to ask your cpa accountant tax lawyer about the td f 90 22.1 foreign account bank report form and the fatca foreign account tax compliance act there can be very large fines for not making the required reports    the requirements to open a bank account have become more strict in many countries so do n't be surprised if they will not open an account for a foreigner with no local address if that is your situation

that depends really generally speaking though roth iras are the place for stock market mutual fund investing all the off the wall or not so off the wall things like real estate investments or buying up gold or whatever other ideas you hear from people they may be good or bad or whatnot but your roth ira is maybe not the best place for that sort of thing   the whole philosophy behind iras is to deliberately set aside money for the future anything reasonable will work for this explore interesting investment ideas with today 's money not tomorrow 's money that being said at your age i would go for the riskier options within what 's available   if i were in your situation and i have been recently i would lean toward low fee mutual funds classified as growth funds   my own personal opinion this is not advice is that small cap international funds are the place to be for young folks that 's a generalized opinion based on my feel for the world but i do n't think i 'm personally competent to start making specific stock picks so mutual funds makes sense to me in that i can select the fund that generally aligns with my sense of things and assume that their managers will make reasonably sound decisions within that framework of course that assumption has to be backed up with reputation of the specific mf company and the comparative performance of the fund relative to other funds in the same sector as to the generalized question how else can you work toward financial stability and independence outside of your roth ira find ways to boost your earning potential over time and buy a house before the next bubble within the next 18 months i 'm guessing

depends on how you value your time   these programs do not say they will get you the lowest basement price they say you get a reasonable price without negotiation   this is true use a service   pick out the car you want and spend less than an afternoon picking up your vehicle   you do n't have to fret or do all of the price research or comparison shopping because that is what the service does for you since you have to pick a make and model before you begin and because you need to arrange your financing at a credit union before you being regardless of a buying service i do n't think they actually work out financially for most folks my anecdote because we were buying an already inexpensive new car the costco pre negotiated discount was just a few hundred bucks   the discount is different for each car naturally   our base model was terrific in consumer reports but the sticker price does n't leave dealerships a lot of room for profit to start with we ended up saving a couple thousand dollars by skipping the costco program and following these tips from johnfx   what are some tips for getting the upper hand in car price negotiations but we did it all over email   we emailed any dealership we could find online that was in driving distance there were literally dozens of dealerships to choose from   we made a new throw away email address and starting to ask for a lower price   whenever we got a lower price we simply asked the others to beat it   all over email   it only took a few days we know we got a low price and the stress really was n't a factor   a couple of the salespeople got a little rude but it was over the email so we did n't care or fret i had time to kill and the extra hassle and effort saved me much more money

gt;you bring up a very good point if he cares so much about his employees but it 's just too inconvenient for him to run the company if his taxes go up 5 why not sell it instead of putting 7000 people out of a job why threaten people when there 's an obvious alternative hell if he just wants to close it anyways he could just give the company away   it 's funny you think we 're talking about only 5 liabilities could go up 10 15 it 's not just taxes its insurance liabilities and other requirements what business experience do you have you obviously are n't considering all the angles here and it 's not about caring or not caring about his employees believe it or not i 'll bet he did n't start the company 40 + years ago to create jobs for his employees caring for employees only gets you so far he probably cares for them as much as he cares about his office or his properties but if one of his office became condemned and dealing with it became more stressful than profitable guess what he 'd blow it up and never look back   he explicitly states that he will downsize or close the company if there are any new taxes whatsoever on either him or the business it 's also worth noting that his company is currently more profitable than its ever been   but that comes down from somebody who has seen increased liabilities increased over the decades its all or nothing at this point and it would n't be a tiny increase in liabilities gross profit = /= net profit   gt;what   obama has used the argument you did n't build that to say you benefited from other people 's taxes to get where you are but guess what government existed just fine without increased taxes it 's only now that they want to maintain and will increase the level of spending they need more revenues and private participation in things like the healthcare plan   gt;yeah so maybe he should cut his bullshit rhetoric when those jobs are on the line and the only one responsible for their fates is him and if it 's really too much of a bother for him to run the company if he 's making slightly less money when he 's already said he has more money than he 'll ever need he can promote someone else to run the company or just sell it saying he cares about his employees makes him a liar criticizing people who spent beyond their means makes him a hypocrite and his empty threats and beating make him a bully   jobs are a byproduct of his goal and thus peripheral they are that way for every company unless it 's a very small company the employees are not more important than the business itself   you keep this as slightly less but its not its millions and millions    the point is it is his company and he can do whatever he wants you obviously have no actual decision making business experience because if you did and talked to these people you 'd realize they 're not all greedy yes some make quite a bit of profit but you 'd also be amazed at all of the liabilities government requirements and yes taxes they have to deal with   right or wrong it 's choice to decide what happens not yours not mine

nuclear plants + nuclear fuel rod storage facilities together take up a lot of space    also to go back to one of your earlier points i tried looking up the comparison in mining between nuclear and solar panels but could n't find anything however i think they are similar not one being more or less than the other the processes are not too dissimilar you have to get what you 're mining for then wash it down and it with chemicals but if you saw the amount of land that was displaced to get one piece of uranium that would n't even make up an entire fuel rod you might not think solar had the heavier mining load besides solar generates electricity while the fuel rods have a set amount of energy so solar will end up paying for itself rather than having to mine for more of a radioactive element once your fuel rods are spent    not sure i explained that last part too well but solar starts at 0 and goes to infinity in terms of how much electricity is generated while nuclear fuel rods start at 100 and go down to 0 so i think solar is the better bet   edit i also agree that energy is really hard to solve every source has their drawbacks unfortunately except cold fusion lol

depending on how you view the loan it could either be considered an asset or a liability   since you are not charging interest it might seem more intuitive to create an assets cash loan account and transfer money to from it when you receive payments like you would with a bank account personally i prefer to think of all loans as liabilities   whether it 's a debt which you owe someone or a balance which someone else owes you since it 's an unsettled amount i file it under liabilities loan   either way you record the initial balance as a debit from your bank and then record payments as credits back to your primary account the only way that income or expenses ever gets involved would be if you charged interest income or if you some or all of the loan expense at some point in the future

i am failing to see why would a person get an ira instead of just putting the same amount of money into a mutual fund like vanguard or something like that well this is n't a meaningful distinction the mutual fund may or may not be in an ira similarly the mutual fund may or may not be in a 401(k however so i 'm going to treat your question as if it 's why would a person get a mutual fund like vanguard or something like that in an ira instead of just putting the same amount of money into the same mutual fund in a 401(k same mutual fund same amount of money narrowing your question to the difference between the two types of accounts as stated in your question 's title others have answered that to the extent that you really have no choice other than pick which type of account to use for a given bundle of money other than nobody having mentioned the employer match even if there were no other difference at all in tax treatment it 's pretty typical that 401(k contributions will be matched by free money from the employer no ira can compete with that but that 's not the only choice either many of us contribute to both the 401(k and the ira why because we can i 'm not suggesting that just anybody can but if you max out the employer matching in the 401(k or if you max out the tax advantaged contribution limit in the 401(k and you still have more money that you want to save in a tax advantaged retirement account this year you can do so the ira is available it 's not instead of the 401(k

a. bank transfer is the normal way to do it the law society will eventually make good any losses incurred on money held by solicitors acting fraudulently so your money should not be at risk provided you make sure to transfer the money to the account number your solicitor gave you b. it 's not just normal but essential to transfer the money before exchanging contracts since the deposit has to be paid by your solicitor to the vendor 's solicitor as part of the   exchange process you ca n't wait to pay the deposit until after you 've exchanged because you have n't exchanged until you 've paid the deposit c. if you really want to put down the 10 deposit now and pay the rest upon completion that should be possible talk to your solicitor about it

the key here is the bank they hold the title to the car and as such have the final say in things the best thing you can do is to pay off the loan   could you work like crazy and pay off the car in 6 months to a year the next best thing would be to sell the car   you will probably have to cover the depreciation out of pocket   you will also need to have some cash to buy a different car but buy it for cash like you should have done in the first place the worst option and what most people opt for which is why they are broke is to seek to refinance the car   i am not sure why you would have to wait 6 months to a year to refinance but unless you have truly horrific credit a local bank or credit union will be happy for your business   choose this option if you want to continue to be broke for the next five years or so once any of those happen it will be easy to re title the car in your name only provided you are on good terms with the girlfriend   it is just a matter of going to the local title office and her signing over her interest in the car my hope is that you understand the series of foolish decisions that you made in this vehicle purchase and avoid them in the future   or at the very least you consciously make the decision to appear wealthy rather than actually being wealthy

i believe they were for the government 's future plans for transitioning into a more consumer driven economy preparing for their growing middle class and increased domestic demand   it could end up being a smooth transition but they have inflated a massive real estate bubble that makes our recent one look pretty small in comparison   they claim to be able to manage the bubble as well but it will be interesting to see   to my knowledge it would be the first successful management of a massive bubble   what 's sad is that another reason for the empty cities is that the government 's plan until now has been to support its export driven economy through devaluing the yuan lower purchasing power for citizens and keeping labor costs wages low   so the future middle class has n't been able to afford housing in the new cities   the government has been actively keeping their workers standard of living artificially low for the sake of propping up exports   it 's disgusting

personally i do n't think that the interest from the car loan is worth the credit history you 're building through it there are other ways to build credit that do n't require you to pay interest like the credit card you mentioned so long as you keep paying off the balance so i 'd go that route ditch the auto loan and replace it with a line of consumer credit just be careful not to overspend because the card will likely have a higher interest rate than your loan

i can think of a few reasons why they seem like a bigger deal to people than similar situations with other loans as you point out though being underwater on your home loan is a less serious condition than having large student loans and a poor paying job for example   if the student loan situation ever comes to a head we may have people talking about student loans in

there are also currency hedged etfs these operate similarly to what mentioned for example a currency hedged japan equities etf has an inherent short yen usd position on it in addition to the equity position so the effects of a falling yen are negated note that it will still be denominated in dollars however is pegged to the dollar though is nt it if your broker is charging you a crazy price maybe try again a different day or get a new broker

no all the leveraged etfs are designed to multiply the performance of the underlying asset for that day read the prospectus their price is adjusted at the end of the day to reflect what is called a nav unit basically they know that their price is subject to fluctuations due to supply and demand throughout the day simply because they trade in a quote driven system but the price is automatically corrected at the end of the day regardless in practice though all sorts of crazy things happen with leveraged etfs that will simply make them more and more unfavorable to hold long term the longer you look at it

cute conspiratorial story   a cabal of evil grocery store owners set up a sprawling and risky supply chain overseas so they can pay more for their products for the express purpose of paying their employees market wages for their labor   grocery store workers are not underpaid   if they were they could walk across the street and make more money at a competitor   so if the profit margins are fat on the supplier side somehow competition would come in there either   you ca n't have it both ways   the vast majority of food products sold in grocery stores in north america are grown manufactured and sold right here in north america   there 's no way to explain it away the grocery store market is competitive and profit margins are slim

unfortunately there is no facility to do bulk transaction edits in gnucash so you are out of luck for your existing hundred i do n't know whether there is a way to initially import a transaction as split however once you have entered this split once it can be used as a template for new transactions using or by entering it in the scheduled transaction editor

i wonder if any successful artificial intelligence project will ultimately need to make shortcuts that lead to the same flaws as human intelligence if i might pretend greater knowledge of the human mind than i have this means tendency to be correct to a certain level of precision rather than completely correct to fudge to round edges to go by guidelines rather than rules

why wo n't anyone just answer the original question the question was not about opportunity cost or flexibility or family expenses there are no right answers to any of those things and they all depend on individual circumstances i believe the answer to the question of whether paying off a 30-year mortgage in 15 years would cost the same amount as a 15-year mortgage of the same interest rate is yes but only if you pay it off on the exact same schedule as your supposed 15-year in reality the answer is no for two reasons the amortization schedule and the fact that the 30-year will always have a higher interest rate than the 15-year the way mortgages are amortized the interest is paid first essentially for most people the majority of the monthly payment is interest for the first half of the loan 's life this is good for most people because in reality most mortgages only last a couple years after which people refinance or move and for those first couple years the majority of one 's housing costs interest are tax deductible it is arguable whether this for one 's entire life is wise but that 's the reality of most mortgages so unless you pay off your 30-year on the exact same amortization schedule of your theoretical 15-year you will pay more in interest a common strategy people pursue is paying an extra monthly payment or more each year by the time you get around to chipping away at your principal in that way you will already have paid a lot more interest than you would have on a 15-year and really if you can afford to substantially pay down principal in the first year or two of your mortgage you probably should 've borrowed less money to begin with in theory if the rates were the same they 're not and if you paid the 30 off every month in the exact same way as you would've paid a 15 you wo n't you will pay the same amount in the end you have to decide if the flexibility is worth more to you than the cost savings   for example a 300k mortgage at 3.5 will have a monthly payment of for a 15-year and for a 30-year both will start with of that being in interest gradually declining with time what i think most people undervalue is the freedom and peace of mind that comes with a paid off or nearly paid off home and 15 years is a lot more tangible than 30 plus a lot cheaper over all if you can afford a 15-year mortgage without putting too much stress on your budget it is definitely the better option for financial security   and be careful of the index fund opportunity cost advice on average it may be a good idea when you look at the very long run historically but a lot of people get less than average returns depending on when they buy and what the market does in the short run there is no certainty around what returns you will get from the stock market but if you have a 30-year mortgage there is a lot of certainty around what you will owe every month for the next different mixes of investments make sense for different people and most people would be wise to get some exposure to the stock market for its returns and liquidity however if someone 's goal is borrowing more money for their house in order to invest more money in the stock market for their retirement they would actually be better served in achieving security and independence 15 years sooner

as a new graduate aside from the fact that you seem to have the extra $ to pay more towards your loan we do n't know anything else   i wrote a lengthy article on this in response to a friend who had a loan but was also pondering a home purchase in the future student loans and your first mortgage discusses the math behind one 's ability to put a downpayment on a house vs having that monthly cash to pay towards the mortgage in your case the question is whether in 5 years the $ 8500 would be best spent as a home down payment or to pay off the 6.8 loan   if you specifically had plans toward home ownership the timing of that plan would affect my answer here as i discuss in the article   the right answer to your question can only come by knowing far more of your personal situation   meanwhile the plan comes at a cost your plan will get rid of the loan in about 5 years but if you simply double up the payments advising the servicing company to apply the extra to principal it would drop to just a couple month over over 4 as you read more about personal finance you 'll find a lot of different views some people are fixated on having zero debt others will focus on liquidity in the end you need to understand each approach and decide what 's right for you

i believe i could be wrong it has been a long day by exercising this right you have the right to purchase the equivalent of their current share   eg someone owns 50 of 100 shares and the company does a rights offering and is expanding the shares to 200 that person has first right to purchase 50 more shares to keep his share from being diluted

the random walk that you describe reflects the nature of the information flow about the value of a stock   if the flow is just little bits of relatively unimportant information including information about the broader market and the investor pool you will get small and seemingly random moves which may look like a   if an important bit of information comes out like a merger you will see a large and immediate move which may not look as random however the idea that small moves are a of search and discovery and large moves are immediate agreements is incorrect   both small moves and large moves are instantaneous agreements about the value of a stock in the form of a demand supply equilibrium   as a rule neither is predictable from the point of view of a single investor but they are not actually random   they look different from each other only because of the size of the movement not because of an underlying difference in how the consensus price is reached

a moving average will act as support or resistance to a stock only when the stock is trending the way it acts as support for instance is similar to a trend line take the daily chart of cba over the last 6 months the first chart shows cba with an uptrend support line   the second chart shows cba during the same period with 50 day ema as a support   both can be used as support for the uptrend generally you can used these types of support or resistance in a downtrend to determine when to buy a stock and when to sell a stock if i was looking to buy cba whilst it was uptrending one strategy i could use was to wait until it hit or got very close to the support trend line and then buy as it re bounces back up if i already held the stock i could use a break down below the uptrend support line as a stop to exit out of the stock

some of the items required as part of the home buying and mortgage process are traditionally paid prior to closing these are usually the items that the buyer purchases as part of the process home inspection credit check these expenses take place early in the process and if the deal falls through due to the inspection or credit history problems the seller does n't want to get stuck paying for the buyer will frequently have to write a check for these as they occur other items occur later in the process or even at the very end of the process determining which side pays for each item is a combination negotiation and local tradition even for the items that the buyer has to pay for there can be a negotiation between the   buyer and the lender sometimes the lender allows the buyer to roll the closing costs into the loan this does mean that they will be paying interest on the closing costs for years but not rolling in the closing costs mean that you need more cash on hand this is in addition to the down payment and the costs of moving    the closing costs covered by the seller reduce the size of the check they will receive at the end of the process their willingness to kick in this cash is a function of will they still make money on the deal how many other bidders there were and do they need the cash to buy their next house at settlement the forms identify each item involved and who agreed to pay for it then each side is credited for the items they paid for already then each side either writes a check for the balance due or receives a check for their reimbursement keep in mind there are also money exchanges that take place at the closing that are not covered by the buyer real estate commissions there are also items such as interest for the current month and property tax credit that depend on the day of the month and month of the year   sit down with your agent or your lender to get an idea of what you need to pay before closing   though telling everybody that you will have zero cash to pay for these things may make the lender very nervous about approving a loan

this is business as usual except that you need to keep in mind that the corporate entity is separate from the individual as such all the background checks and references should be with regards to the actual renter the corporation you should be cautious as it is not so easy to dissolve an individual well not as easy and certainly not as legal as it is to dissolve the corporation so you may end up with a tenant who does n't pay and does n't have to pay because the actual renter the corporation no longer exists so check the corporation background age credit worthiness tax returns business activity judgements against etc etc as you would do for an individual

when a store operates their salesforce on commission commission rates are highest on the highest profit items for the store this just means that the sales force will be even more pushy about the extended warranty and the gold plated hdmi cable because those are cash cows for the store and the salesforce will be incentivized to push them

this is something that many people misunderstand nearly everyone who works in the u.s. is required to pay social security and medicare taxes sometimes called payroll taxes or fica   these are not a savings plan and the money you pay is not going into an account with your name on it   this money is used to pay for the benefits of the current retirees beneficiaries   when you retire the benefits you get will be paid for by the workers that are still working and paying that tax you may be receiving benefits but you are also still working so you still have to pay the tax
