if bank b has a transfer limit set you bet that there is a nice reason for that either risk of fraud liability client preferences credit scoring etc etc for a bank the cost of denying something 1 is way lower than the potential damages and liabilities of allowing something to go through   regarding your concerns for the ach here is the summarized transaction source an whether that ’s an individual a corporation or another initiates either a direct deposit or direct payment transaction using the ach network ach transactions can be either debit or credit payments and commonly include direct deposit of payroll government and social security benefits mortgage and bill payments online banking payments person to person p2p and business to business b2b payments to name a few instead of using paper checks ach entries are entered and transmitted electronically making transactions quicker safer and easier   the originating depository financial institution odfi enters the ach entry at the request of the originator   the odfi aggregates payments from customers and them in batches at regular predetermined intervals to an ach operator   ach operators two central clearing facilities the federal reserve or the clearing house receive batches of ach entries from the odfi   the ach transactions are sorted and made available by the ach operator to the receiving depository financial institution rdfi   the receiver ’s account is debited or credited by the rdfi according to the type of ach entry individuals businesses and other entities can all be receivers   each ach credit transaction settles in one to two business days and each debit transaction settles in just one business day as per the rules   take heed of this like   the originator initiates a direct deposit payment transaction in your scenario the originator would be b. but since the transaction amount is higher than the limit b would not even initiate the ach transaction the request would be denied so the transaction would look like this 1 usually this cost comes down to just the processing costs of the denied transaction and it is rather fail fast like for the other parties involved it may have additional costs missed deadlines penalties for not fulfilling an obligation fines etc but for the bank that is irrelevant

there are many reasons which other answers have already discussed i want to emphasize and elaborate on just one of the reasons which is that it avoids double taxation especially on corporate earnings   generally for corporations its earnings are already taxed at around 40 for the us including state income taxes when dividends are distributed out it is taxed again at the individual level the effect is the same when equity is sold and the distribution is captured as a capital gain i believe this is why the dividend and capital gain rates are the same in the us for a simplistic example say there is a c corporation with a single owner the company earns $ 1,000,000 before income taxes it pays 400,000 in taxes and has retained earnings of $ 600,000 to get the money out the owner can either distribute a dividend to herself or sell her stake to another person either choice leads to $ 600,000 getting taxed at another or so at the individual level depending on the state if we calculate the effective rate it is above 50 many people invest in stock including mutual funds and the dividends and capital gains are taxed at lower rates individual tax returns that contain no wage income often have very low average tax rates for this reason however the investments themselves are continuously paying out their own taxes or accruing taxes in the form of future tax liability

why do companies exist well the corporate charter describes why the company exists usually the purpose is to enrich the shareholders the owners of a company want to make money in other words there are a number of ways that a shareholder can make money off a stock as such maintaining the stock price and dividend payouts are generally the number one concern for any company in the long term most of the company 's business is going to be directed towards making the company more valuable for a future buyout or more valuable in terms of what it can pay its shareholders directly note that the company does n't always need to be worried about the specifics of the day to day moves of the stock if it keeps the finances in line solid profits margins earnings growth and the like and can tell people that it 's generally a valuable business it can usually shrug off any medium term as market some companies are more explicitly long term about things than others e.g. berkshire hathaway basically tells people that it does n't care all that much about what happens in the short term   of course companies are and they 're run by people to make the people running the company worry about the stock price you give them stock or stock options or something like that a major executive at a big company is likely to have a significant amount of stock if the company does well he does well if it does poorly he does poorly despite a few limitations this is really a powerful incentive if a company is losing a lot of money or if its profits are falling so it 's just losing a lot of its value as a business the owners stockholders tend to get upset and may vote in new management or launch some sort of shareholder lawsuit and as previously noted to raise funds a company can also issue new shares to the market as a secondary offering as well and they can issue fewer shares if the price is high meaning that whatever the company is worth afterward the existing owners own proportionally more of it

in general lump sum investing will tend to outperform dollar cost averaging because markets tend to increase in value so investing more money earlier will generally be a better strategy   the advantage of dollar cost averaging is that it protects you in times when markets are overvalued or prior to market corrections    as an extreme example if you done a lump sum investment in late 2008 and then suffered through the subsequent market crash it may have taken you 2 3 years to get back to even   if you began a dollar cost averaging investment plan in late 2008 it may have only taken you a 6 months to get back to even dollar cost averaging can also help to reduce the urge to time the market which for most investors is definitely a good thing

i have a slightly different take on this compared to the other answers in general i think your emergency fund should always be at least 3 k especially if you own a used car that is out of warranty any number of unlucky auto repairs could easily cost over so if you have 7 k in savings i would personally buy a car that is 4 k or less or finance any amount of the car over 4 k if you can get a relatively low interest rate then i would pay down the financed portion of the car as quickly as possible while maintaining at least a 3 k emergency fund that being said notice i mentioned in general your situation may actually be quite different if you do n't have much debt with your income you might be able to build up a couple of thousand in savings in a single month and if so the above does n't really apply even if you spent the entire 7 k on a car you 'd likely have at least 3 k in your emergency fund within 60 90 days as for what 's responsible there are too many factors to dictate that if you do n't have many other expenses you could possibly afford a $ 40 k car and i do n't think anyone here could fairly call that irresponsible if you spent that much though surely no one would call it responsible either perhaps the best advice is to buy the least expensive car you will be happy with many people regret overspending on a vehicle but few regret unless they got a lemon that requires lots of repairs finally you could also consider another option you could get a very cheap car for 1 k or less and drive it for a year by then you may have closer to 20 k saved up for a much nicer car than you can afford today

one snag in your plan is that you alone ca n't undo your hsa contributions because you would also owe fica taxes on that amount and those need to be paid by both you and your employer the only way for that to happen is for your employer to undo your hsa contributions from their point of view so those wages can be entirely taxed with both fica and regular withholding how that is accomplished will probably be up to them it could mean you pulling the money out of the hsa account and then either giving it back to your employer so they can re allocate it with a new check or if you have enough pay due between now and the end of the year you could keep the money and they can reduce your next by the total additional taxes due note that you should prefer the latter if possible since this way you would get to keep the $ 1000 you should n't have gotten in the first place also note that when you withdraw the money from your hsa account you need to inform your bank that you are undoing the contributions rather than taking distributions and likely fill out a form if you do n't inform them they will improperly report to the irs that you had contributions and an equal amount of distributions which could muddy the waters with also having an fsa

interesting the answer can be as convoluted complex as one wishes to make it or back of envelope   my claim is that if one starts at 21 and deposits 10 of their income each year they will likely hit a good retirement nest egg at an 8 return each year keep in mind the last 40 years produced 10 even with the lost decade the 10 saver has just over their final income as a retirement account at 4 withdrawal this replaces 60 of their income with social security the rest to get to nearly 100 or so replacement note i wrote an article about social security benefits showing the benefit as a percent of final income at $ 50 k it 's 42 it 's a higher replacement rate for lower income but the replacement rate drops as income rises so the $ 5000 question for an individual earning $ 50 k or less this amount is enough to fund their retirement for those earning more it will be one of the components but not the full savings needed   by the way a single person has a standard deduction and exemption totaling $ in 2014 i refer to this as the zero bracket the next $ is taxed at 10 why go 100 roth and miss the opportunity to fund these low or no tax withdrawals

there are many considerations before deciding on the best place for your funds how liquid do you need the funds to be    if this is for an emergency fund i would keep at least some in an account that you have instant access to   what is your risk volatility tolerance would you be ok with the value dropping by as much as 30 in a year knowing that over time you 'll probably earn 8 12 on it   if not then equity funds or other stock investments are probably not the best move for you do you need the funds now or are they for long term retirement savings are you eligible to fund an ira that would defer your taxes until you withdraw the funds from the account but there are age restrictions that you must heed to avoid penalties are cds a good idea they do pay decent interest but in return for that you lock up your funds for a set period of time   all that to say that there are many facets to determining the best place for your funds   if you provide more specifics you can get a more specific answer

this is fine and can definitely be done the bank will be perfectly fine with it since you 're paying interest on the money as long as they 're confident that you can repay the whole growing balance of course there 's the issue of the credit limit which you 'll eventually reach and then you wo n't be able to pull this off any longer problems start when the bank either loses that confidence or the credit line is term limited like heloc for example and comes to term in either case you 'll be required to cover the balance and especially in the first case as a balloon payment if they call on you when you do that you will most likely go bankrupt and the longer you keep doing it the higher are the chances of that happening

capping the upside while playing with unlimited downside is a less disciplined investment strategy vis a vis a stop loss driven strategy whether it is less risky or high risky also depends on the fluctuations of the stock and not just long term movements for example your stop losses might get triggered because of a momentary sharp decline in stock price due to a large volume transaction esp more so in small cap stocks although the stock price might recover from the sudden price drop pretty soon causing a seemingly preventable loss that being said playing with stop losses is always considered a safer strategy it may not increase your profits but can certainly cap your losses

in a situation like this i presume you 'd invest in the child company if you thought that the child company would increase in value at a higher rate than the parent you 'd invest in the parent company if you thought the parent company would perform well as a whole but you did not want to assume the risk of an individual company underneath it say the child company is worth 100 million and the parent company is worth 500 million you 've invested a sum of money in the child company the child company performs very well and increases in value by say 20 million as the parent company owns the child we could say it also increases in value by roughly 20 million the difference is proportional your investment in the child sees a 20 gain in value whereas your investment in the parent sees a 4 gain in total value as in this example the parent company which owns nearly 100 of the child company is worth 5x more and thus proportionally sees the increase in value due to it being worth more as a whole think of it similarly to a mutual fund or etf that invests in many different stocks on the market as the market does well that mutual fund or etf does well too   as the mutual fund is made up of many individual stocks one stock performing very well say at a 10 20 increase in value does not raise the value of the etf or mutual fund by 10 20 the etf mutual fund will perform slightly better assuming all other components remain equal for this example but only proportionally to the fraction of it that 's made up of the stock that 's performing well

do you think that your bank has a separate vault for just your money    of course not the bank just has one big pot of money that everything gets dumped into    they know exactly how much money each person is supposed to have the problem is when they add up all the money in the vault well lets just say a lot of it is missing    that 's why they are supposed to have two vaults one with the customer 's money and one with the investor 's money but since all the account tracking is done internally it becomes real easy to borrow from one vault to fund the other   vault mf global 's at another bank

the answer do n't use your actual card number some banks offer virtual credit card numbers services like apple pay are functionally the same bank of america 's virtual cards work like this the virtual card number is different from your actual card number so the merchant never sees your real card number in fact the merchant can not even tell that you are using a virtual card you can set the maximum amount to be charged you can set the expiration date from 2 to 12 months once the merchant has made a charge on that virtual card only that merchant can make any further charges on that same virtual card it is not possible to discover the real card number from the virtual card number so the result is that your risk is reduced to the merchant not delivering the order or charging too much but not over the limit you set there is nothing to be stolen since your real info never goes over the internet and once a merchant has used the virtual card once no other merchant can use it other banks may have virtual cards which have fewer features the only disadvantage of this is that you have to go to the bank 's website whenever you want to make a purchase from a new merchant but you do n't have to worry about them stealing your real credit card information

the broker that is issuing the moneys after vesting is more than likely deducting a notional amount of tax and ni based on uk income tax laws if you are not a uk resident then you should pay income tax on those stock options based on your own tax residency best thing to do is speak directly with the broker to explain the situation ask them to not deduct anything from your stock options but keep in mind that you will need to declare these earnings yourself and pay the correct rate of tax from my own personal experience the uk employer more than likely receives the net value after the notional tax and ni have been deducted and in usual circumstances create a tax liability on your payslip if you were working and had earnings if of course this deduction is being made by the employer then you can simply ask them to correct this most uk payroll software will automatically deduct tax and ni for payments after leaving unless manually so they probably are n't aware if it is them doing so

i would disagree with your analysis   to me there are two purposes for a money market mm your emergency fund should be from 3 to 6 months of expenses   think of it of an insurance policy against murphy   you may want to have some money designated for big expenses or even sinking funds   for example i keep some money in a mm for a car as both the wife daughter and i driver older vehicles   i may need to replace them if you were planning on making a larger purchase car house boat engagement ring i would put the money in a mm fund so you are not subject to the whims of the market    after that you are free to invest all your money   its likely that you should have some money outside of tax advantaged funds so if you want to start a business you will not have to do high cost withdrawals

the correlation i heard most about in economics finance was that stock prices and bond yields were negatively correlated as the stock market does better bond yields fall company 's doing well as evidenced by stocks so it 's a good credit risk so ytm of its bonds on the market goes down the correlation if any between the stock and futures market should be visible in the actual price histories index prices may be useful but what 's more likely is that various future prices have correlation with various companies stocks where the future reflects the price of a raw material that is a significant cost of goods sold for a company you 'll see these two move inversely to each other in the short term i think that if there is a relationship here its that futures prices influence stock prices not the other way around the futures market generally represents the cost side of a consumer goods producer 's bottom line the stock market represents its profits as futures go up profit expectations go down putting pressure on stock prices industries that deal in services or in other types of goods can still be affected because a rise in the cost of something consumers need will cause them to spend less on other things which affects margins in those other areas so in the short and medium term when the futures market goes up the stock market sees a dip and vice versa   however companies adapt they can put upward pressure on prices for their goods to restore their desired margins usually by slowly increasing them to prevent sticker shock though elasticity of demand plays a part the more we need something no matter what it costs the faster prices can increase to maintain costs they can make things cheaper using less expensive materials more plastic less steel they can restructure production processes translated move factories offshore or at least to right to work states with less union strength to save costs elsewhere all of these reduce costs and thus increase profits but take time to implement many of these things reduce direct costs reducing demand for the commodity and causing the futures prices to go back down so over the long term these differences even out and it 's down to the things that affect the entire market inflation consumer investor confidence monetary policy

overall since gold has value in any currency and is sort of the ultimate reserve currency why would anyone want to currency hedge it because gold is mostly priced in usd you currency hedge it to avoid currency risk and be exposed to only the price risk of gold in usd   hedging it does n't mean less speculative it just means you wo n't take currency risk edit responding to op 's questions in comment what happens if the usd drops in value versus other major currencies do you think that the gold price in usd would not be affected by this drop in dollar value use the etf $ gld as a proxy of gold price in usd the correlation between weekly returns of $ gld and us dollar index measured by major world currencies since the etf 's inception is around what this says is that gold may or may not be affected by usd movement it 's certainly not a one way movement there are times where both usd and gold rise and fall simultaneously is n't a drop in dollar value fundamentally currency risk per investopedia currency risk arises from the change in price of one currency in relation to another in this context it 's referring to the eur usd movement the bottom line is that if gold price in dollar goes up 2 this etf gives the european investor a way to bring home that 2 or as close to that as possible

you state any info will be appreciated so here 's some background information on my answer you can skip to my answer when i worked for banks i was required to submit suspicious activity to the people above me by filling out a form with a customer 's name ssn account and id   you may hear in media that it is $ 10 k or sometimes $ 5k.   the truth is that it could be lower than that depending on what the institution defines as suspicious   every year we were required to take a course which implied that terrorists and criminals use cash regularly whether we agree or disagree is irrelevant this is what the course implied it 's important to understand that many people use cash only budgets because it 's easier than relying on the banking system which charges overdraft fees for going over or in some cases you pay more at merchants because of card usage some merchants give discounts for cash   if someone has a budget of $ 10 k a month and they choose to use cash that 's perfectly fine   also why is it anyone 's business what someone does with their private property   this created an interesting contrast among differently aged americans older americans saw the banking system as tyrannical whereas young americans did n't care   this is part of why i eventually left the banking system i felt sick that i had to report this information but it 's amazing how quick everyone is to accept the new rules   notice how one of the comments asks you what you intend to do with the money as if it 's any of their business   welcome to the new america my answer if you withdraw $ 100,000 here is what will more than likely happen now watch the anger at this answer because i 'm telling you the truth   this article will explain why   your very question had a negative 1 as if asking what you 're asking is wrong see the absurdity   if joseph stalin ran for president in the united states the majority of americans would welcome him   you have good reason to be concerned others at this site have noticed this as well

matt levine 's first point here is very interesting as a lens for understanding why so many large hedge funds seem to have difficulty beating the market while the ones that do tend to be either smaller operations or more independent groups within the giants   if you look at the best firms in the world like or you see a trend where they typically stop taking in outside capital and effectively convert to family offices at least for the most profitable strategies levine 's point here is particularly applicable to it has famously incredible returns via medallion but not so much the other funds unsurprisingly the medallion fund is entirely employee and owner capital   as extremely profitable strategies scale up to their capacity constraints fund managers naturally decide to pool greater amounts of their own capital into the firm therefore skin in the game is not only effective as an intuitive heuristic for skill this manager believes in the fund enough to put most of their personal net worth into it but it 's also practically effective for showing how likely the firm is to perform based on how much you 're able to participate   as the percentage of skin in the game increases the likelihood of outside investors being able to participate decreases because the fund managers know they no longer need to share risk and do n't want to waste allocations on the way to capacity constraints if a firm is soliciting capital it 's highly suspect and managers who go on to become the next jim simons or seth klarman will mostly be on the market for relatively short periods of time

the globe and mail has an interesting article on what you can do with your rrsps be aware that the article is from early 2011 and rules change they describe holding your own mortgage inside your rrsp that is if you have $ 100,000 inside your rrsp already and your remaining mortgage is $ 100,000 you can use that money to pay off your mortgage then pay back the money at interest generating a tax deferred profit inside your rrsp that approach may be viable though you 'd want to talk to your accountant first i 'd be very cautious about loaning money to someone else for a second mortgage using my rrsp though second mortgages are inherently risky so this is a very speculative investment once you make an rrsp contribution that space is used up barring a couple of exceptions such as the life long learning plan so let 's say you used $ 100,000 of your rrsp to loan to someone for a second mortgage any interest payments should be sheltered inside the rrsp substantial benefit but if the person defaults on the second mortgage which you should expect to be a significant possibility you 've lost your entire $ 100,000 contribution room as well as obviously the $ 100,000 that you loaned out i ca n't tell you whether or not it makes sense to invest in risky second mortgage loans and i ca n't tell you whether if you choose to do so it definitely should be done inside an rrsp there are substantial risks in the loan and there are both costs and benefits to doing so inside an rrsp hopefully though i 've helped you understand the questions you should be asking yourself

banks often offer cash to people who open savings accounts in order to drive new business their gain is pretty much as you think to grow their asset base a survey released in 2008 by uk based age concern declared that only 16 of the british population have ever switched their banks while 45 of marriages now end in divorce   till death do most part in the us similar analysis is pointing to a decline in people moving banks from the typical rate of 15 annually if people are unwilling to change banks then how much more difficult for online brokers to get customers to switch td ameritrade is offering you 30 days commission free and some cash 0.2 0.4 depending on the funds you invest   most people especially those who use the opportunity to buy and hold wo n't make much money for them but it only takes a few more aggressive traders for them to gain overall for financial institutions the question is straightforward how much must they pay you to overcome your switching cost of changing institutions   if that number is sufficiently smaller than what they feel they can make in profits on having your business then they will pay edit to elaborate the mechanism by which any financial institution makes money by offering cash to customers is essentially one of the law of large numbers   if all you did is transfer in say $ 100,000 buy an etf within the 30-day window or any of the ongoing commission free ones and hold then sell after a few years they will probably lose money on you   i imagine they expect that on a large number of people taking advantage of this offer    credit card companies are no different   more than half of people pay their monthly credit balance without incurring any interest charges they get 30 days of credit for free   everyone else makes the company a fortune td ameritrade 's fees are quite comprehensive outside of this special offer   besides transactional commissions their value added services include subscription fees administration fees transaction fees a few extra special value added services and then when you wish to cash out and realise your returns an outbound transfer fee however you 're a captured market   since most people wo n't change their online brokers any more often than they 'd change their bank td ameritrade will be looking to offer you all sorts of new services and take commission on all of it at most they spend $ to get you as a customer or to get you to transfer a lot more cash into their funds   and they get to keep you for how long   ten years maybe more   you think they might be able to sell you a few big ticket items in the interim maybe interest you in some subscription service this is n't grocery shopping   they can afford to think long term

i can not stress this enough so i 'll just repeat it   do n't plan your finances around your credit score   do n't even think about your credit score at all   plan a budget an stick to it   make sure you include short and long term savings in your budget   pay your bills on time   use credit responsibly   do all of these things and your credit rating will take care of itself   do n't try to plan your finances around raising it on the subject of 0 financing specifically my rule of thumb is to only ever use it when i have enough money saved up to buy the thing outright and even then only if my budget will still balance with the added cost of repaying the loan   other people have other rules including not taking such loans at all and you should develop a rule that works for you but you should have a rule   one rule should n't have is do whatever will optimize your credit score because you should n't plan your finances around your credit score    all things considered i think the most important thing in your situation is to make sure that you do n't let the teaser rate tempt you into making purchases you would n't otherwise make   you 're not really getting free money you 're just shifting around the time frame for payment and only within a limited window at that   also be sure to read the fine print in the credit agreement they can be filled with gotchas and pitfalls   in particular if you do n't clear the balance by the end of the introductory rate period you can sometimes incur interest charges retroactively to the date of purchase   make sure you know your terms and conditions cold it sounds like you 're just getting started so best of luck and remember that rome was n't built in a day   patience can be the most effective tool in your personal finance p.s do n't plan your finances around your credit score

a lot of credit card companies these days uses what they call daily interest where they charge the interest rate for the number of days till you pay off what you spent this allows them to make more money than the period billing   the idea of credit theoretically is that there is n't really a day when you can borrow without paying interest in theory

i think the right way to approach this is for your personal books and your business 's books to be completely separate you would need to really think of them as separate things such that rather than being disappointed that there 's no cross transactions between files you think of it as in my personal account i invested in a new business like any other investment with a transfer from your personal account to a stock or other investment account in your company and this business received some additional capital which one handles with a transfer probably from equity to its checking account or the like yes you do n't get the built in checks that you entered the same dollar amount in each but 1 you need to reconcile your books against reality anyway occasionally so errors should get caught and 2 the transactions really are separate things from each entity 's perspective the main way to hack it would be to have separate top level placeholder accounts for the business 's equity income expenses and assets liabilities that is your top level accounts would be personal equity business equity personal income business income and so on you can combine assets and liabilities within a single top level account if you want which may help you with that outlook of my business value you 're looking for in fact in my personal books i have in the current assets account both normal things like my checking account but also my credit cards because once i spend the money on my credit card i want to think of the money as being gone since it is obviously this is n't standard accounting in any way but it works well for what i use it for you could also just have within each normal top level placeholder account a placeholder account for both personal and my business to at least have a consistent structure depending on how your business is getting taxed in your jurisdiction this may even be closer to how your taxing authorities treat things if for instance the business income all goes on your personal tax return but on a separate form regardless of how you set up the accounts you can then create reports and filter them to include just that set of business accounts i can see how just looking at the account list and transaction registers can be useful for many things but the reporting does let you look at everything you need and handles much better when you want to look through a filter to just part of your financial picture once you set up the reporting and you can report on lists of account balances as well as transaction lists and lots of other things you can save them as custom reports and then open them up whenever you want you can even just leave a report tab or several open and switch to it refreshing it if needed just like you might switch to the main account list tab i suspect once you got it set up and tried it for a while you 'd find it quite satisfactory

assuming the numbers work out roughly the same and you can frankly whip up a spreadsheet to prove that out a defined benefit scheme that pays out an amount equal to an return from a 401(k is better   the reason is not monetary it is that the same return is being had at less risk put another way if your defined benefit was guaranteed to be $ 100/month and your 401(k had a contribution that eventually gets to a lump sum that if for the same life expectancy gave you $ 100/month the db is better because there is less chance that you wo n't see the money or put even simpler which is more likely that new york goes bankrupt and is relieved of all pension obligations or the stock market underperforms expectations   neither can be ruled out but assuming even the same benefit lower risk is better now the complication in your scenario is that your new job pays better   as such it is possible that you might be able to accumulate more savings in your 401(k than you might in the db scheme   then again even with the opportunity to do so there is no guarantee that you will   as such even modelling it out really is n't going to dismiss the key variables as such can i suggest a different approach   which job is going to make you happier now   part of that may be money part of that may be what you are actually doing   but you should focus on that question the marginal consideration of retirement is really moot in theory an ira contribution can be made that would equalize your 401(k negating it from the equation   grant you there is very slightly different tax treatment and the phaseout limits differ but at the salary ranges you are looking at you could in theory make decisions that would have the same retirement outcome in any event the real question is then not what is the effect in 20 years but rather which makes you happier now

during a stock split the only thing that changes is the number of shares outstanding   typically a stock splits to lower its price per share   sometimes if a company 's value is falling it will do a reverse split where x shares will be exchanged for y shares   this is typically done to avoid being de listed from an exchange if the price per share falls below a certain threshold usually $ 1   again the only thing changing is the number of shares outstanding   a 20 for 1 reverse split means for every 20 shares outstanding the shareholder will be granted one new share example x co. has 1,000,000 shares outstanding for a price of $ 100 per share   it does a 1 for 10 split   now there are 10,000,000 shares outstanding for a price of $ 10 per share example y co has 1,000,000 shares outstanding for a price of $ 1 per share   it does a 10 for 1 reverse split   now there are 100,000 shares outstanding for a price of $ 10 quickly looking at the news for it looks like it a 20 for 1 reverse split   you should probably look at your statements and ask your broker how the arithmetic worked in your case investopedia links for reverse stock split and stock split

congratulations on deciding to save for retirement since you cite dave ramsey as the source of your 15 number what does he have to say about where to invest the money if you want to have instantaneous penalty free access to   your retirement money all you need to do is set up one or more ordinary accounts that you think of   as your retirement money just be careful not to   put the money into cds since federal law requires a penalty of three months interest if you cash in the cd before its maturity date penalty or put the money into those pesky mutual funds that charge a redemption fee penalty if you take the money out within x months of investing it where x can be anywhere from 3 to 24 or more in federal tax law and in most state tax laws as well a retirement account has special privileges accorded to it in that the interest dividends capital gains etc earned on the money in your retirement account are not taxed in the year earned as they would be in a non retirement account but the tax is   either deferred till you withdraw money from the   account traditional iras 401ks etc or is waived completely roth iras roth 401ks etc in return for this special treatment penalties are imposed in addition to tax if you withdraw money from your retirement account before age 59.5 which presumably is on the distant horizon for you there are some exceptions including first time home buying and extraordinary medical expenses to this rule that i wo n't bother going into but you are not required to invest your retirement    money into such a specially privileged retirement    account it is perfectly legal to keep your retirement money    in an ordinary savings account if you wish and pay taxes on the    interest each year   you can invest your retirement    money into municipal bonds whose interest is free of    federal tax and usually free of state tax as well    if the municipality is located in your state of    residence if you like you can keep your retirement money in a    sock under your mattress if you like or buy a    collectible item e.g. a painting with it    this is not permitted in an ira etc in short if you are concerned about the penalties imposed by retirement accounts on early withdrawals forgo the benefits of these accounts and put your retirement money elsewhere where there is no penalty for instant access   if you use a money management program such as mint or quicken all you need to do is name one or more accounts or a portfolio as and voila it is done but those accounts portfolios do n't have to be retirement accounts in the sense of tax law they can be anything at all

i 've had a hard time finding out details on remortgaging help to buy loans myself but found one article which points out it is possible   but also that there are n't many lenders offering such deals out there   the article lists a number of lenders that do offer these programs and the extra requirements on equity you might have to have it sounds like it 's going to be critical to know how much equity you 've built up    since part of the valuation increase will be credited to help to buy you wo n't get all the £ 30k increase you 've mentioned   instead i believe you 'll only get 80 so £ 24k    which would mean your total equity is £ 24k + £ 7k = £ plus whatever you might have already paid off   i 'm going to assume there is n't much you 've paid off so will assume just over 18 while this is higher than most of the equity limits mentioned in the above article keep in mind you 'd only get cash out corresponding to the difference between your current equity amount and the equity required for the loan   for example if you went with a loan requiring 15 equity to qualify you 'd only have 3 over that and thus get £ out    and that 's before any fees you might have to pay   you might have new origination fees but you also might have early repayment fees maybe you could pursue a lower money down refi and get to keep more but the same article points out that help to buy might consider that too risky for you and refuse to allow the refi i think it 's worth shopping around to get actual numbers for your exact situation but personally it does n't sound like you have enough equity yet to get much cash out of a refi   perhaps you 'll get lucky though   best of luck

wikipedia has a nice list of currencies that use cents and currencies that use 1/100th division that is not called cent cent means 100 in latin and french and probably all the roman family of languages so if the currency is divided by 100 it will likely to be called cent or something similar in the local language the list of currencies on the same page where it is not the case is significantly shorter and includes countries with relatively ancient currency units that were invented before the introduction of the decimal system even though now they are in fact decimal they still kept the old names like the british pence or the russian the point is that dollar and cent are not directly related many currencies that are not called dollar are using cents as well euro among others it just means 1/100th and it is safe to assume that most if not all of the modern currencies are divided into 1/100th

first before we talk about anything having to do with the credit score we need the disclaimer that the exact credit score formulas are proprietary secrets that have not been revealed   therefore all we have to go on are broad generalities that fico has given us that having been said the credit card debt utilization portion of your score generally has at least two components an overall utilization and a per card utilization your overall utilization is taken by adding up all your credit card debt and all your credit limits and dividing   using your numbers above you are sitting at about 95   the per card utilization is the individual utilization of each card   your five cards range in utilization from 69 to 100 paying one card over another has no affect on your overall utilization but obviously will change the per card utilization of the one you pay first   so to your question is it better on the credit score to have one low card and one high card or to have two medium cards   i have n't read anything that definitively answers this question here is my advice to you the big problem you have is the debt not the credit score   your credit card debt should be treated like an emergency that needs to be taken care of as quickly as you possibly can   instead of trying to optimize your credit score you should be trying to minimize the number of days until all of your credit cards are completely paid off   the credit score will take care of itself once you get your financial situation back on track there is debate about the order in which one should pay off their debts but the fact of the matter is that the order is not as significant as the intensity at which you pay them all off   dedicate yourself to getting rid of the debts as fast as possible and it wo n't matter much which order they get paid off in finally to answer your question i recommend that you attack the card debt one at a time instead of trying to pay them off evenly   not because it will optimize your credit score but because it will help you focus your debt reduction energy as you work on resolving your debt emergency   fortunately the credit utilization portion of the credit score has no history so once you pay all of these off the utilization portion of your score will get better immediately and the path you took to get there will be irrelevant after the credit cards are completely paid off and you have resolved never to spend money that you do n't have again it is time to work on the student loans

if it is achievable it is almost certainly better than just tying the whole economy to the price of a single commodity if it is not achievable then it is almost certainly better to let the markets adjust and correct however than to tie the whole economy to the whims and wishes of incompetent and politically motivated money printers   so what i 'm getting from all of this is basically how we view the possibility of a workable flat currency   i think the possibility of whether or not a flat currency will actually work depends on many things some more important than others the size and power influence of a country can greatly affect how a flat currency will work within that country   if the country is large and power hungry like ours then a flat currency will most likely not work in the long run it will promote greed and monopolization of wealth but what of gold that ca n't work either because a large country ca n't sustain itself off such an inefficient monetary system   so to me it seems like extremely large countries should be split into smaller countries that can actually use flat currencies or gold without all of the potential for corruption   this same sort of logic applies to our cousins if a tribe of gets too large the group will split to relieve social tension   this is a big part of why i support ideas like   do you think there is a way for monetary systems to work in very large countries

disclaimer i am not an attorney and i have not 100 researched the law take any advise from an online forum with a grain of salt please consult an attorney tax specialist or the irs directly for any concrete answers afaik there is n't anything that would prevent you from starting a business simply owing back taxes should n't make a difference on how you make money whether that is working for yourself or someone else all the irs is concerned about at this point is that you still owe them when going through the process of forming an llc a couple of years back i do n't recall any personal tax information being brought up except when we were discussing possible loan options regarding loan options one important issue you may come into is if the irs has filed a lien against you a federal tax lien is the government ’s legal claim against your property when you neglect or fail to pay a tax debt the lien protects the government ’s interest in all your property including real estate personal property and financial assets a lien will exist on your credit report for 7 years after it is released the irs releases your lien within 30 days after you have paid your tax debt with a lien it will be very difficult to get a loan or other financing for your small business if this ends up being the case you can try to get a discharge or subordination on specific property that would allow lenders a claim on your property ahead of the irs otherwise you may find yourself relying solely on what money you currently have a big point is the irs 's threshold on filing a lien is $ 10,000 the fresh start initiative increased the irs notice of federal tax lien filing threshold from $ 5,000 to $ 10,000 however notices of federal tax liens may still be filed on amounts less than $ 10,000 when circumstances warrant since you currently owe over the past 3 years it is possible that adding another year in back taxes will cause the irs to file a lien if they have not yet already done so so it may be something to keep an eye on if you do plan on taking out a loan for your business

as others have said this opinion is predicated on an assumption that early in your life you have no need to actually use the money so you are able to take advantage of compounding interest because the money is going to be there for many many years and you are far more tolerant of loss because you can simply wait for the markets to recover this is absolutely true of a pension pot which is locked away for a great many years but it is absolutely not true of general investments someone in the to is very likely to want to spend that money on say buying a house in which case losing 10 of your deposit 3 months before you start looking for a house could potentially be a disaster in your if your child 's school college fund goes up in smoke that 's a big deal it is a very commonly espoused theory but i think it is also fundamentally flawed in many scenarios

i believe temp agencies get a payout if the employer decides to hire on the temp full time usually so it would be to prevent a temp from quitting and going to work for the employer as a way around that payment the idea is to set a term long enough not to make it worthwhile for the employer to wait rather than paying the fee

yeah i mean what it really comes down to is the fact that life is n't fair   i would think that if your company is squeezed enough that it 's paying a lot more for new employees who do what you do already then if you go to your boss and ask for a raise he 's not going to say no it 's way easier and cheaper to keep an employee particularly a good one than to find someone new just a thought

i suppose it depends on how liquid you need and if you 're willing to put forth any risk whatsoever   the stock market can be dangerous but there are strategies out there that will allow you to insure yourself against significant loss while likely earning you a decent return   you can buy and sell options along with stocks so that if the stock drops your loss is limited and if it goes up or even stays where it 's at you make money a lot more than 1 annually of course there 's risk of loss but if you plan ahead you can cap that risk wherever you want maybe 5 maybe 10 whatever suits your needs   and as far as liquidity goes it should be no more than a week or so to close your positions and get your money if you really need it but even so i would only recommend this after putting aside at least a few thousand in a cash account for emergencies

fta yet this new study notes that subsidies are n’t simply cash being handed to oil companies subsidies often come in the form of tax breaks which is just one of the many ways oil companies receive government handouts   tax breaks are not subsidies   the taxpayer pay absolutely nothing to the oil companies when a tax break is applied   the taxpayers are actually net recipients from the drilling activity   if the existence of a tax break is a requirement for oil drilling profitability then elimination of the tax break would eliminate drilling   the taxpayers are choosing between zero additional tax revenue without tax breaks or some tax revenue with tax breaks so drilling can proceed   the article ’s point about export ports being subsidized by the taxpayer is a distraction   the vast majority of oil produced in the us is consumed in the us   all that oil is drilled transported refined transported again then sold to consumers in an end to end supply chain built on a vast sum of private capital

no it means that is only the notional value of that underlying asset of that contract generally the contract specification itself is listed on the exchange 's websites and there are really no assumptions you can make about a particular contract where s&p futures have one set of specifications such as what it actually represents how many each contract holds how to price profits and losses a different contract such as ftse 100 stock futures have a completely different set of specifications anyway in this one example the s&p 500 futures contract has an initial margin of $ meaning that is how much it would cost you to establish that contract futures generally require delivery of 1,000 units of the underlying asset so you would take the underlying asset 's price and multiple it by 1,000 what price you use is also mentioned in the contract specification the s&p 500 index   is $ you mentioned so on you would have to delivery $ x 1000 or $ great news you only have to put up 1.2 in principal to control a 1.5 million dollar asset although if even that amount is too great you can look at the e mini s&p futures which require about 1/10th the capital and delivery this answer required that a lot of different subjects be mentioned so feel free to ask a new question about the more specific topics

my take on this is that with any short selling contract you are engaging in at a specified time in the future you will need to transfer ownership of the you sold to the buyer whether you own the or in your case you will buy your friend 's used   car in the meantime or dig enough gold out of the ground in the case of hedging a commodity exposure is a matter of trust hence there is normally some form of margin or credit line involved to cover for you failing to deliver on expiry

running a sandwich shop and say a software consulting service are quite different things   i had two employees at one point following the kind of thinking in the article   but i found what that meant was that i had to spend more time being a manager and salesperson and much less time doing the work i enjoyed   to make it viable i would have had to scale up to the point where i had at least one salesperson and maybe a manager which would have required more income producing staff to support them   instead i scaled back to just myself and have been very happy with that decision   the article also what can be made in consulting or it contracting   rates well above $ 100/hr are common for people with expertise as opposed to commodity providers and billing at least 40 hours a week is not usually a problem   it 's certainly true that a one man operation is much more likely to put a ceiling on your earnings but a that ceiling can be a lot higher than the article suggests and b depending on the business breaking that ceiling and earning much more is certainly possible in some businesses for example where you have the opportunity to sell your work in product form rather than hourly

this is an excellent question kudos for asking it how much a person pays over spot with gold can be negotiated in person at a coin shop or in an individual transaction though many shops will refuse to negotiate   you have to be a clever and tough negotiator to make this work and you wo n't have any success online however in researching your question i dug for some information on one gold etf which is physically backed by gold that you can redeem   it appears that you only pay the spot price if you redeem your shares for physical gold but are n't those fees exorbitant after all redeeming for 50 ounces    of gold would result in a $ 3,000 fee on a $ 65,000 transaction    that 's 4.6 percent actually the fee simply reflects the convenience premium that gold    coins command in the market here are the exchange fees compared with    the premiums over spot charged by two major online gold retailers investors do pay an annual expense ratio but the trade off is that as an investor you do n't have to worry about a thief breaking in and stealing your gold

there is nothing legal you can do in the united states to avoid the tax burden of income earned as an employee other than offsetting it with pre tax contributions which it sounds like you 're already doing making charitable contributions or incurring investment losses which is cutting off your nose to spite your face   so that $ 660 k ca n't be helped as for the $ 80 k in stock dividends you could move those investments into growth companies rather than value companies   growth companies are those that pay less in dividends where the primary increase in wealth occurs only in share price increase   this puts off your tax bill until you finally sell your shares and depending on how the tax laws are at that time your tax bill will be lower on those capital gains than they are currently on these dividends regarding rental income i know nothing but i think you 're entitled to depreciate your property 's value over time and count that against the taxes you owe on the rents   and you can deduct all the upkeep expenses   as with employment income intentionally incurring rental losses to lower your tax bill is not logical   for every dollar you earn you only have to give about 50 cents to the government whereas for every dollar you lose you 've lost a dollar

if that fraction is really small then the amount of gold can be thought of as relatively constant that fraction is very small after all people have been mining gold for thousands of years so the cumulative results of gold mining have been building up the supply for quite some time meanwhile owners of gold rarely destroy it a little bit of gold is used in some industries as a consumable this limited consumption of gold offsets some of the production that comes from mining but truthfully this effect is minuscule for the most part people either hoard it like its made of gold or sell it after all it is worth its weight in gold if you 're interested wikipedia lists a few more factors that affect gold prices if you 're not interested wikipedia lists them anyway

i work in analyzing economic development projects in the midwest like this and one of the most frustrating aspects of my job is when people try to distill and simplify complex financing structures for the sake of misleading others and furthering an agenda it 's not uncommon that i see small local blogs write articles saying something to the effect of major development project skips paying the taxes it rightfully owes completely disregarding the fact that in most cases the local government 's options are to either give the developer an incentive and make some additional money or offer nothing and watch the developer walk away from the table for a different site the next county over most governments given the choice would take lowered tax payments and more jobs over no tax payments and no jobs   since i was curious i decided to do a quick back of the envelope calculation of this project using a common economic impact model i used a conservative assumption of 3,000 new jobs the minimum foxconn expects to have by 2020 and well below the maximum capacity of the factory in the audio and video equipment manufacturing code of industry using the entire state of wisconsin as a geography this industry has average annual earnings in wisconsin of $ so i subtracted out $ 3,000 per job to make it in line with the article i also used the liberal assumption that 100 of these jobs will be considered net new or that they wo n't be replacing or destroying any existing jobs within the state    the results    salaries alone will amount to about $ 160 million per year assuming all workers receive the same salary of $ 53,000    indirect effects basically new jobs and spending for other industries used to support and maintain the factory that are n't directly employed by the factory itself will add an additional $ 20 million in earnings annually     finally induced effects the economic impact of new employees spending their salaries within the economy will add an additional $ 80 million    total change in jobs including factory workers maintenance and utility workers and new workers in supply chain industries is estimated as just north of 5,000    this adds up to $ 260 million in additional annual earnings within the wisconsin economy there is a lot more to be considered when looking at a project like this and there are a lot of ways wisconsin or foxconn can fuck this all up but it is n't out of the realm of possibility that attracting this new plant will end up being a worthwhile plan for wisconsin    also this quote   are calling this development he said speaking from the east room of the white house because we believe this will have a transformational effect on wisconsin just as silicon valley transformed the san francisco bay area   sounds like bullshit silicon valley is largely research and development not manufacturing saying that you 'll replicate the success of software engineers earning $ 120k a year by bringing in more $ 50k a year manufacturing jobs is misleading at best

the united states federal reserve has decided that interest rates should be low they think it may help the economy the details matter little here though it will enforce this low rate by buying treasury bonds at this very low interest rate bonds are future money so this means they pay a lot of money up front for very little interest in the future the fed will pay more than anyone who offers less money up front so they can set the price as long as they 're willing to buy at the end of the day treasury bonds pay nearly no interest    since there 's little money to be made with treasuries people who want better than zero returns will bid up the current price of any other bonds or similar loan like instruments to get what whatever rate of return that they can there 's really no more than one price for money you can think of the price of those bonds as basically treasury rate + some based on the risk percent   i realize thinking about bond prices is weird and different than other prices you 're measuring future money using present money and it 's easy to be confused and assure you it ultimately makes sense anyway your savings account money has to compete with everyone else willing to lend money to banks everyone else lends money for peanuts so you get peanuts on your savings account too your banking is probably worth more to your bank on account of your check card payment processing fees collected from the merchant than from the money they make lending out your savings notice how many places have promotional rates if you make your direct deposits or use your check card to make a purchase n times a month   in europe it 's similar except you 've got a different central bank if europe 's bank operated radically differently for an extended period of time you 'd expect to see a difference in the exchange rates which would ultimately make the returns from investing in those currencies pretty similar as well such a change may show up domestically as inflation in the country with the loose money policy and internationally as weakness against other currencies there 's really only one price for money around the entire world any difference boils down to a   difference in perceived risk

as others have explained defined contribution is when you or your employer contributes a specified amount and you reap all the investment returns   defined benefit is when your employer promises to pay you a specified amount benefit and is responsible for making the necessary investments to provide for it    is one better than the other we can argue this either way    defined benefit would seem to be more predictable and assured   the problem being of course that it is entirely reliant upon the employer to have saved enough money to pay that amount   if the employer fails in that responsibility then the only fallback is government guarantees   and of course the government has limitations on what it can guarantee   for example from wikipedia    the maximum pension benefit guaranteed by pbgc is set by law and adjusted yearly for plans that end in 2016 workers who retire at age 65 can receive up to $ per month or $ per year under pbgc 's insurance program for single employer plans benefit payments starting at ages other than 65 are adjusted which means the maximum guaranteed benefit is lower for those who retire early or when there is a benefit for a survivor and higher for those who retire after age 65 additionally the pbgc will not fully guarantee benefit improvements that were adopted within the five year period prior to a plan 's termination or benefits that are not payable over a retiree 's lifetime other limitations also apply to supplemental benefits in excess of normal retirement benefits benefit increases within the last five years before a plan 's termination and benefits earned after a plan sponsor 's bankruptcy by contrast people tend to control their own defined contribution accounts   so they control how much gets invested and where   defined contribution accounts are always 100 funded    defined benefit pension plans are often underfunded   they expect the employer to step forward and subsidize them when they run short   this allows the defined benefits to both be cheaper during the employment period and more generous in retirement   but it also means that employers have to subsidize the plans later when they no longer get a benefit from the relationship with the employee    if you want someone else to make promises to you and are n't worried that they wo n't keep them you probably prefer defined benefit    if you want to have personal control over the money you probably prefer defined contribution    my personal opinion is that defined benefit plans are a curse   they encourage risky behavior and false promises   defined contribution plans are more honest about what they provide and better match the production of employment with its compensation   others see defined benefit plans as the gold standard of pensions

yes you 're absolutely right for such small amounts and such large fees almost any investment choice is pointless some brokers allow for commission free etf trading   seek them out as you 've noticed bond interest rates are almost 0   this is a far cry from the days of benjamin graham where the usd acted more like gold with much more frequent booms and busts during graham 's heyday one could sell one 's bonds at super low interest rates and buy them back again when high   in his day interest rates would be very high one year like in 2008 and next to nothing the next like in 2009 cycling back and forth until the 1960s hit and he did n't know what to do graham preferred to wait for the reversion to the mean and act only when far from it   those opportunities are few and far between now since fiat currencies are far better managed than they were then the fed caused 2009 total destruction as an outlier to recent times in your case it 's best to leave the bonds to the insurance companies and buy equities   if you want less volatility buy a buy write etf   bonds will surely unless one is lucky enough to hold bonds while interest rates fall from ~6 to ~3 an eventuality that should n't be expected to occur again as bill gross is painfully discovering

gt just because you had 1 2 or a dozen children why should that be considered in what your unskilled labor is worth   1 child per person or 2 per couple should be factored in to what unskilled labor is worth   the reason is that we need unskilled labor to wash dishes or dig   since the system needs them the system needs to support them   support would mean that they can get a modest living working a full time job for their entire lives   a modest life would include one where basic needs are met and normal human experiences are available   this would include food water shelter clothes health care some entertainment retirement and a child to replace them after they die

all shares of the same class are considered equal each class of shares may have a different preference in order of repayment   after all company liabilities have been paid off including bank debt wages owing taxes outstanding etc etc the remaining cash value in a company is distributed to the shareholders in general there are 2 types of shares preferred shares and common shares   preferred shares generally have 3 characteristics 1 they get a stated dividend rate every year sometimes regardless of company performance 2 they get paid out first on liquidation and 3 they can only receive their stated value on liquidation that is $ 1 m of preferred shares will be redeemed for at most $ 1 m on liquidation assuming the corporation has at least that much cash left common shares generally have 4 characteristics 1 their dividends are not guaranteed or may be based on a calculation relative to company performance 2 they can vote for members of the board of directors who ultimately hire the ceo and make similar high level business decisions 3 they get paid last on liquidation and 4 they get all value remaining in the company once everyone else has been paid so it is not the order of share subscription that matters it is the class once you know how much each class gets based on the terms listed in that share subscription you simply divide the total class payout by number of shares and pay that much for each share a person holds for companies organized other than as corporations ie partnerships the calculation of who gets what will be both simpler and more complex simpler in that generally speaking a partnership interest can not be of a different class like shares can meaning all partners are equal relative to the size of their partnership interest more complex in that if the initiation of the company was done in an informal way it could easily become a legal fight as to who contributed what to the company

the reason why we have lots of idle capacity is because we have over capitalized   fed has kept rates far too low for far too long and it incorrectly encouraged producers to over build   if rates where not manipulated so much to the low side than producers would not have built so much capacity and utilization would n't be a issue   the low rates also encouraged consumers to take out loans and to also not save so that they could buy excess supply   but all it did was made everyone go into debt to levels and eventually bankruptcy over the last few decades gov and fed reserve have been stimulating printing lowering rates to prevent the vicious cycle from crashing but eventually it crashed under its own weight   we have n't seen the end yet because we need to go down more before we can start gong back up

first of all since you 're 16 you will not invest in anything you can not you 're a minor you can not enter contracts and as such you can not transact in property your bank accounts are all ugma accounts i.e. your guardian or someone else who 's the trustee on the account will be the one transacting not you you can ask them to do trades but they do n't have to they must make decisions in your best interest which trades may not necessarily be if however they decide to make trades or earn interest or make any other decision that results in gains these are your gains and you will be taxed on them the way taxes work is that you 're taxed on income you 're free to do with it whatever you want but you 're taxed on it so if you realized gains by selling stocks and reinvested them you had income the gains which you did with whatever you felt like reinvested the taxman does n't care what you did with the gains the taxman cares that you had them for losses it is a bit more complicated and while you can deduct losses there are limitations on how much you can deduct and some losses can not be deducted at all when realized like wash sale losses or passive activity losses when you have stock transactions you will probably need to file a tax return reporting the transactions and your gains losses on them you may end up not paying any tax at all but since the broker is reporting the transactions you should too if only to avoid irs asking why you did n't this again should be done by your guardian since you personally can not legally sign documents you asked if your gains can affect your parents taxes not exactly your parents taxes can affect you this is called kiddie tax unofficially of course you may want read about it and take it into account when discussing your investments with your guardian parents if kiddie tax provisions apply to you your parents should probably discuss it with their tax adviser

the car deal makes money 3 ways if you pay in one lump payment if the payment is greater than what they paid for the car plus their expenses they make a profit they loan you the money you make payments over months or years if the total amount you pay is greater than what they paid for the car plus their expenses plus their finance expenses they make money of course the money takes years to come in or they sell your loan to another business to get the money faster but in a smaller amount you trade in a car and they sell it at a profit of course that new transaction could be a lump sum or a loan on the used car they or course make money if you bring the car back for maintenance or you buy lots of expensive dealer options some dealers wave two deals in front of you get a 0 interest loan these tend to be shorter 12 months vs or even 72 months the shorter length makes it harder for many to afford if you ca n't swing the 12 large payments they offer you at x% loan for y years that keeps the payments in your budget pay cash and get a rebate if you take the rebate you ca n't get the 0 loan if you take the 0 loan you ca n't get the rebate the price you negotiate minus the rebate is enough to make a profit the key is not letting them know which offer you are interested in do n't even mention a trade in until the price of the new car has been finalized otherwise they will adjust the price rebate interest rate length of loan   and trade in value to maximize their profit the suggestion of running the numbers through a spreadsheet is a good one if you get a loan for 2 from your bank credit union for 3 years and the rebate from the dealer it will cost less in total than the 0 loan from the dealer the key is to get the loan approved by the bank credit union before meeting with the dealer the money from the bank looks like cash to the dealer

firstly you should yourself with your options for your pension fund they changed as of 6th april 2015 so it 's all quite new the government 's guidance on it is here if you have n't already taken a tax free lump sum from your pension fund you can take up to 25 totally tax free immediately that makes getting a house for 40 k very accessible beyond the 25 you can take any of it out whenever you want access drawdown or lump sum payment depending on whether you take the 25 out up front or not that 'll be taxed as if you earned it as income so if you did n't have any other income you can take another £ without tax this tax year and then another £ or whatever the allowance goes up to next tax year and so on above that you 'd have to pay 20 tax until you reach the higher rate tax threshold at about £ 40k year you say you do have other income so you 'll have to take that into account as well when calculating what tax you 'd have to pay if you 've reached state pension age that will add some more income of course or as you suggest you can buy an annuity you can do that with some or all of the money and you can still take the 25 tax free first if you do buy an annuity the income from it will all be taxed but again your personal allowance will apply essentially an annuity is the least risky option particularly if you get one that is with inflation with inflation makes the initial income even lower but protects you against cost of living rises as you get older in exchange for avoiding that risk you probably lose out on average compared to some more risky options you might choose to get an annuity large enough to cover your basic needs and take more chances with the rest

it is important to remember that the stock price in principle reflects the value of the company so the market cap should drop upon issuance of the the dividend however the above reasoning neglects to consider taxes which make the question a bit more interesting the key fact is that different investors are going to get taxed on the dividend to varying degrees ranging from 20 for qualified dividends in the usa for a high income individual in a taxable account and even worse for non qualified dividends to 0 for tax exempt nonprofits retirement accounts and low income individuals the high tax investors are going to be a bit averse to paying tax on that dividend whereas the tax free investors are not hence in a tax rational market the tax free investors are going to be the ones buying right before a dividend and the tax paying investors will be buying right afterwards tax exempt investors could in principle make some amount of money buying dividends to keep them off the tax paying investors books   of course the strategy could backfire if too many people did it all at once that said the tax payers have the tax disincentive to prevent them from fully exploiting the opposite strategy of selling just before a dividend   in particular they are subject to capital gains tax when they sell at a profit unless they have enough compensating capital losses and it is to their after tax profit to defer taxation by not trading that said the stock market has well known irrationality when it comes to considering tax consequences so logic based on assumed rationality of the market does not always apply to the extent one would expect    the foremost example of tax irrationality is the so called dividend paradox which basically states that corporations should favor stock buybacks or perhaps loan repayment to the complete exclusion of dividends because capital gains are taxed less harshly than dividends in a variety of ways some of which are subtle 1 historically although not currently in the usa for qualified dividends the tax rate was higher for dividends   in canada for example dividends are taxed at twice the rate of capital gains 2 if you die holding appreciated stock then you meaning your heirs completely escape us the capital gains tax on the accrual during your lifetime 3 capital gains tax can be deferred by simply not selling   in comparison to dividends this is roughly equivalent to getting a tax free loan from the government which is invested for profit and paid at a later date after inflation has eaten away at the real value of the loan   for example if all your stock investments increase by but you sell every year in a high tax bracket situation you 're total after tax return will be only 8 per year   in contrast if you hold the same investments for many many years and then sell your total return will be nearly 10 per year because you only pay 20 once at the end 4 a capital gain can often be by a capital loss in another stock so that no tax results   if you loose money on a stock that is paying dividends you 're still going to have to pay tax on that dividend   there are companies that borrow money to pay out that taxable dividend each quarter which seems like gross tax malpractice on the part of the cfo if the dividend paradox does n't make sense first consider the case that you owned all the shares of a company   it would n't matter to you at all on a pre tax basis whether you got a $ 1000 company buyback or a $ 1000 dividend because after the buyback dividend you 'd still own the entire company and $ 1000   the number of shares would be reduced but that you owned fewer shares after the buyback would be like saying you have become shorter if your height is measured in inches rather than of course in the case of many shareholders you can get burned by failing to sell into the buyback when the share price is too high but that is another matter

you make several good points   i 'll start with black scholes the arbitrage argument in black scholes is between the option and a hypothetical and portfolio with identical cash flows the replicating portfolio   we then value the replicating portfolio via an equilibrium model   when you use bs there is n't necessarily any observed security whose is guaranteed not imply some arbitrage opportunity because bs makes no reference to observed prices   a no arbitrage modification might look like this i observe the prices and implied volatilities of some options and use the implied volatilities to price another option maybe with a different strike   doing so ensures that there is no arbitrage between my price and the market prices implied by my model   realistically the problem arbitrage free models are addressing is that our models and assumptions are wrong even though they 're reasonable a lot of the time   a no arbitrage model removes some set of obvious deficiencies but at the cost of not being able to explain why things are priced as they are   so for instance wo n't reproduce the observed term structure and hull white fixes this but hull white does n't explain where the term structure comes from i.e. what the term structure should be

if you are just trying to curb impulse spending i 'd suggest the following   1 set up a separate bank account for your savings do not order checks or a debit card for this account 2 get your employer to split your paycheck to put the saving amount in the new account most employers will do this the trick to avoid impulse spending is to make it a chore to get at the money with the above arrangement you would have to physically go to the bank fill out a withdrawal slip and get cash this way you still can access the money in an emergency but it forces you to plan things out better

the deadline for contributing to a 401 k is the last paycheck paid in december that may not be the last pay period that ends in december for example if the last pay period ends on friday the 30th and you get paid on thursday january 5th that check is the first in the new year   the us government has rules regarding how quickly the money needs to be sent to the 401 k trustee it is possible that the money may get there after the first of the year but the important date for you is the date of the last paycheck in december the company form to set the contribution rate it could also be on a website will have a deadline to determine if the rate makes the next check or the one after that the form will also have a maximum amount as a percentage of the check some could allow up to 100 but yours might not so how much you can put in with the last paycheck or two is up to company policy and your pay rate the company forms or website will describe how the company match works if you were try and put as much as possible into a few checks it is possible to hit the $ 18,000 yearly limit in just a small part of the year in some companies that would mean that you could miss out on company match money because that would never be more than x% of each check for example if you were to put $ 3,000 per check with a base pay of $ 5,000 every two weeks and if the maximum company match was 5 after 6 checks you would be done you would have put in $ 18,000 and the company would have put in $ 250 x 6 or $ 1,500 if you were to spread the money over all 26 checks you would still put in $ 18,000 but the company would have put in $ 6,500

value investing is an investment approach that relies on buying securities below their intrinsic values there are two main concepts one is the intrinsic value and the other is margin of safety   intrinsic value is the value of the underlying business if we are talking about stocks that can be calculated through carefully analyzing the business looking at all aspects of it if there is an intrinsic value exists for a company then there is a price tag we can put on its shares as well value investing is looking to buy shares well below its intrinsic value   it is important to know that there is no correct intrinsic value exists for a company and two people can come up with different figures if they were presented the same data calculating the intrinsic value for a business is the hardest part of value investing   margin of safety is the difference between the buying price of a stock and its intrinsic value value investors are insisting on buying stocks well below their intrinsic value where the margin of safety is or even more this concepts is protecting them from poor decisions and market downturns it is also providing a room for error when calculating the intrinsic value   the approach was introduced by benjamin graham and david dodd in a book called security analysis in 1934 other famous investor using this approach is warren buffet books to read   i would start to read the first two book first

i started storing and summing all my receipts bills etc it has the advantage of letting me separate expenses by category but it 's messy and it takes a long time   it sounds from this like you are making your summaries far too detailed do n't instead start by painting with broad strokes for example if you spent $ at the grocery store do n't bother splitting that amount into categories like toiletries hygiene products food and snacks just categorize it as grocery spending and move on to the next line on your account statement similarly unless your finances are heavily reliant on cash do n't worry about categorizing each cash expense rather just categorize the withdrawal of cash as miscellaneous and do n't spend time trying to figure out exactly where the money went after that because honestly you probably spent it on something other than savings because really when you are just starting out getting a handle on your spending you do n't need all the nitty gritty details what you need rather is an idea of where your money is going figure out half a dozen or so categories which make sense for you to categorize your spending into you probably have some idea of where your money is going these could be loans cost of living mortgage rent utilities housing home insurance groceries transportation car payments fuel vehicle taxes savings and so on whatever fits your situation add a miscellaneous category for anything that does n't neatly fit into one of the categories you thought of go back something like 3 4 months among your account statements do a quick categorization for each line on your account statements into one of these categories and then sum them up per category and per month calculate the monthly average for each category that 's your starting point the budget you 've been living by intentionally or not after that you can decide how you want to allocate the money and perhaps dig a bit more deeply into some specific category turns out you are spending a lot of money on transportation which you did n't expect look more closely at those line items and see if there 's something you can cut are you spending more money at the grocery store than you thought then look more closely at that and so on once you know where you are and where you want to be such as for example bumping the savings category by $ 200 per month you can adjust your budget to take you closer to your goals chances are you wo n't realistically be able to do an about face turn on the spot but you can try to reduce some discretionary category by say 10 each month and transfer that into savings instead that way in 6 7 months you have cut that category in half

in the uk you have an allowance of £ 40,000 per annum for tax relief into a pension this amount includes both your and your employer 's contributions if you earn more than £ 150,000 per annum this allowance starts to reduce and if you earn less than the allowance your allowance is limited to what you earn you can also carry over unused allowance from up to 3 years previously if you stick within this allowance you wo n't pay tax on your pension contributions if you go over the excess will be subject to tax salary exchange normally lets you avoid the national insurance value of your contribution being taxed if you paid your own money into your pension without going through salary exchange your contributions would have the 20 basic rate of tax credited to them and if you 're a higher rate taxpayer you could reclaim the difference between the basic rate of tax and the higher rate of tax you pay but the national insurance you 've paid on your own money would not be you ca n't get the money back you 've paid into your pension till you are are 58 given that you are 27 now the minimum age has risen from its historic 55 for your age group   that 's the pension trade off you forgo tax now in the expectation that once retired you will be paying tax at a lower rate because your income will be lower and you are much less likely to be subject to higher rate taxation in return for locking in your money till you 're older your pension income will be subject to tax when you eventually take it there are other options such as isas which have lower annual limits £ 20,000 currently and on which your contributions do not attract tax relief but which are not taxed as income when you eventually spend them isas and pensions are not mutually exclusive so if you have the money you can do both it 's up to you to determine what mix of savings will be appropriate to generate income for your eventual retirement if you are living in some other country when you retire your pension will be paid net of uk tax you might then be able to claim or pay any difference between that and your local tax rate depending on what agreement exists between the uk government and the other country 's government

various types of corporate actions will a price adjustment   in the case of dividends the cash that will be paid out as a dividend to share holders forms part of a company 's equity   once the company pays a dividend that cash is no longer part of the company 's equity and the share price is adjusted accordingly for example if apple is trading at $ 101 per share at the close of business on the day prior to going ex dividend and a dividend of $ 1 per share has been declared then the closing price will be adjusted by $ 1 to give a closing quote of $ 100 although the dividend is not paid out until the dividend pay date the share price is adjusted at the close of business on the day prior to the ex dividend date since any new purchases on or after the ex dividend date are not entitled to receive the dividend distribution so in effect new purchases are buying on the basis of a reduced equity    it will be the exchange providing the quote that performs the price adjustment not google or yahoo   the exchange will perform the adjustment at the close prior to each ex dividend date so when you are looking at historical data you are looking at price data that includes each adjustment

no   this is too much for most individuals even some small to medium businesses   when you sell that investment and take the cheque into the foreign bank and wire it back to the usa in us dollars you will definitely obtain the final value of the investment converted to us$ that s what you wanted right   you 'll get that   if you also hedge unless you have a situation where it is a perfect hedge then you are gambling on what the currencies will do a perfect hedge is unusual for what most individuals are involved in it looks something like this   you know is going to pay you 10 million on dec 31   so you go to a bank probably a foreign bank i 've found they have lower limits for this kind of transaction and more customizable than what you might create trading futures contracts and tell them i have this contract for a 10 million receivable on dec 31 i 'd like to arrange a fx forward contract and lock in a rate for this in us$   they may have a credit check or a deposit for such an arrangement because as the rates change either the bank will owe you money or you will owe the bank money if they quote you 0.05 us$ then you know that when you hand the cheque over to the bank your contract payment will be worth us$ 500,000   the forward rate may differ from the current rate that s how the bank accounts for risk and includes a profit even with a perfect hedge you should be able to see the potential for trouble   if the bank does nt quite trust you and hey banks are nt known for trust then as the strengthens relative to the us$ they may suspect that you will walk away from the deal   this risk can be reduced by including terms in the contract requiring you to pay the bank some as that happens   if the falls you would get this money credited back to your account   this is also how futures contracts work there it is called mark to market accounting   trouble here   some people seeing how they are down money on the hedge cancel it   it is a classic mistake because it the protection that one was trying to achieve   often the rate will move back and the is left with less money than they would have had doing nothing even though they bought a perfect hedge

yes it 's possible however it 's not likely at least not for most people earning a million is not that difficult but when you talk about billions that 's an entirely different story i think the key point that you 're missing is leverage it 's common knowledge that warren buffett likes to have a huge cash at his disposal and does not soak himself in debt however in his early years buffett did not get to where he 's at by investing only his own money he ran what was basically a hedge fund and leveraged other peoples money in the market this magnified his returns quite substantially if you look at buffett 's investments you 'll notice that he had a handful of huge wins in his portfolio and many more just mediocre success stories not everything he invested in turned to gold but his portfolio was by the large wins that continued to compound over many years because he held them for so long also consider the fact that buffett 's wealth is largely measured in berkshire stock this stock is a reflection of anticipated future earnings by the company there 's no way that alone could turn    $ 10k in 1950 into $ 50b today could    it why not take the two founders of google for example they became billionaires in short order when google had it 's ipo and basically started in a garage with very little cash of course they did n't do this by buying and selling shares there are many paths to earnings enormous sums of money like the people you 're talking about but one characteristic that the richest people in society seem to have in common is that they all own their own companies

great question   a yield curve is a plot of the yields for different maturities of debt this can be for any debt but the most common used when discussing yield curves is the debt of the federal government the yield curve is observed by its slope   a curve with a positive slope up and to the right or a curve i.e. one that 's becoming more positively sloped or less negatively sloped may indicate several different situations the kansas city federal reserve has a nice paper that summarizes various economic theories about the yield curve and even though it 's a bit dated the theories are still valid i 'll summarize the major points here a positively sloped yield curve can indicate expectations of inflation in the future the longer a security has before it matures the more opportunities it has to be affected by changes in inflation so if investors expect inflation to occur in the future they may demand higher yields on longer term securities to compensate them for the additional inflationary risk a yield curve may indicate that investors are increasing their expectations of future inflation a positively sloped yield curve may also reflect expectations of in the dollar the publication linked before states that depreciation of the dollar may have increased the perceived risk of future exchange rate changes and discouraged purchases of long term treasury securities by japanese and other foreign investors forcing the yields on these securities higher supply shocks e.g. decreases in oil prices that lead to decreased production may cause the yield curve to because they affect short term inflation expectations significantly more than long term inflation for example a decrease in oil prices may decrease short term inflation expectations so short term nominal interest rates decline investors usually assume that long term inflation is governed more by fundamental macroeconomic factors than short term factors like commodity price swings so this price shock may lead short term yields to decrease but leave long term relatively unaffected thus the yield curve even if inflation expectations remain unchanged the yield curve can still change the supply of and demand for money affects the required real rate i.e. the price of credit loans etc the supply comes from private savings money coming from abroad and growth in the money supply while demand comes from private investors and the government the paper summarizes the effects on real rates by saying lower private saving declines in the real money supply and reduced capital inflows decrease the supply of funds and raise the required real rate a larger government deficit and stronger private investment raise the required real rate by increasing the demand for funds the upward pressure on future real interest rates contributes to the yield curve 's positive slope and a yield curve could indicate an increasing government deficit declines in private savings or reduced capital coming in from abroad for example because of a recession in europe that reduces their demand for us imports an easing of monetary policy when is economy is already producing near its capacity would initially expand the real money supply lowering required short term real interest rates with long term real interest rates unchanged the yield curve would lower interest rates in turn would stimulate domestic spending putting upward pressure on prices this upward price pressure would probably increase expected inflation and as the first bullet point describes this can cause long term nominal interest rates to rise the combination of the decline in short term rates and the rise in long term rates the yield curve   similarly an inverted yield curve or a positively sloped yield curve that is becoming less steep may indicate the reverse of some or all of the above situations for example a rise in oil prices may increase expectations of short term inflation so investors demand higher interest rates on short term debt because long term inflation expectations are governed more by fundamental macroeconomic factors than short term swings in commodity prices long term expectations may not rise nearly as much as short term expectations which leads to a yield curve that is becoming less steep or even negatively sloped forecasting based on the curve slope is not an exact science just one of many indicators used   note yield curve was not yet defined here and was key to my answer for what is the bernanke twist and operation twist what exactly does it do so i took the liberty of ask answer

alright so this is all out of the way   as a further note i have a degree in computer science so i 'm not oblivious to the technical aspects of bitcoin   i reject the idea that banning bitcoin is akin to banning the internet in fact i reject the notion that bitcoin is anywhere as revolutionary as the internet was which itself as a construct is far older than most people let on     i 've always acknowledged that there are many innovative technical aspects to bitcoin which are likely to find their way into our current system of money and transactions     the reality however goes back to my original that bitcoin is difficult if not nearly impossible to track and thus serves as a black market vehicle for those who wish to transact outside the power of the government   whether or not you see this as good or bad does n't matter the government within any defined national border is the power period and thus for lack of a better phrase resistance is mostly futile

aside from the calculations of how much you save through reducing interest you have two different types of loan here   the house that is mortgaged is not a wasting asset you can reasonably expect that in 2045 it will have retained its worth measured in houses against the other houses in the same neighbourhood in money terms it is likely to be worth more than its current value if only because of inflation to judge the real cost or benefit of the mortgage you need to consider those factors you did n't say whether the is a fixed or variable rate but you also need to consider how the rate might compare with inflation in the long term if you have a fixed rate mortgage and inflation rises above in future you are making money from the loan in the long term not losing what you pay in interest on the other hand your car is a wasting asset and your car loans are just a way of paying by installments over the life of the car if there are no penalties for early repayment the obvious choice there is to pay off the highest interest rates first you might also want to consider what happens if you need to get the $ 11,000 back to use for some other unplanned or emergency purpose if you pay it into your mortgage now there is no easy way to get it back before 2045 on the other hand if you pay down your car loans most likely you now have a car that is worth more than the loans on it in an emergency you could sell the car and recover at least some of the $ 11,000 of course you should keep enough cash available to cover normal emergencies without having to take this sort of action but abnormal emergencies do sometimes happen

the key to this is budgeting without a budget you do n't know what you are spending your money on   let 's say you would like to go to a movie with a friend   can you afford it   without a budget it is difficult to answer this question   yes you have enough money in your wallet but if you do n't go to the movies you could be saving that money for a house   but you might say to yourself surely one movie with my friend wo n't prevent me from saving my $ 10k for my house   and you might be right but when you add up all the movies coffees and other discretionary spending up it very well could    at this point you might be discouraged   do i seriously need to give up every single to make this work   i do n't have that kind of willpower   luckily here is where budgeting comes to the rescue budgeting is simply a plan for your money   you have some monthly expenses that are more or less fixed your rent your utility bills etc   you have other expenses that are not exactly fixed but are still necessary groceries fuel for your car etc   you also have longer range expenses such as insurance premiums that you only pay once or twice a year but need to be accounted for   list all of these expenses and figure out how much that comes to each month   what you have left over is available to you for other things next you need to figure out how fast you want to save for this house and balance that with the other things you might want to spend money on such as entertainment   if you start from $ 0 and want to save $ 10k you could do it by saving $ 100 a month in a little over 8 years you 'll have your $ 10k   if you can increase this to $ 300 a month you 'll be there in less than 3 years now that you have a plan and everything is accounted for very little willpower is needed   you do n't need to feel guilty every time you buy coffee if the money is there in your coffee snacks budget go for it   if you 've got extra money for the month in your entertainment budget take a date to the movies   your budget allows you to spend on those things because you have a plan in place and are not in danger of spending your rent money or your home savings this can all be done on paper in excel or even by placing cash in different envelopes   however it is easier to use budgeting software such as ynab mvelopes or everydollar

couple of to start off index funds and etf 's are essentially the same investments   etf 's allow you to trade during the day but also make you reinvest your dividends manually instead of doing it for you   compare vti and vtsax for example   basically the same returns with very slight differences in how they are run   because they are so similar it does n't matter which you choose either index funds and etf 's can be purchased through a regular taxable brokerage account or through an ira or roth ira   the decision of what fund to use and whether to use a brokerage or ira are separate whole market index funds will get you exposure to us equity but consider also diversifying into international equity bonds real estate reits and emerging markets   any broker can give you advice on that score or you can get free advice from for example future advisor   now the advice for most people in your situation you current tax rate is currently very low   this makes a roth ira a very reasonable idea   you can contribute $ 5,500 for 2015 if you do it before april 15 and you can contribute $ 5,500 for 2016   repeat each year   you wo n't be able to get all your money into a roth but anything you can do now will save you money on taxes in the long run   you put after tax money in a roth ira and then you do n't pay taxes on it or the gains when you take it out you can use roth ira funds for college for a first home or for retirement a traditional ira is not recommended in your case   that would save you money on taxes this year when presumably your taxes are already low since you wo n't be able to put all your money in the ira you can put the rest in a regular taxable brokerage account if you do n't just want to put it in a savings account   you can buy the same types of things as you have in your ira    note that if your stocks in your regular brokerage account go up over the course of a year and your income is low enough to be in the 10 or 15 tax bracket and you have held the stock for at least a year you should sell before the end of the year to lock in your gains and pay taxes on them at the capital gains rate of 0 this will prevent you from paying a higher rate on those gains later   conversely if you lose money in a year do n't sell you can sell and lock in losses during years when your taxes are high presumably after college to reduce your tax burden in those years this is called tax loss harvesting sounds like crazy but the name of the game is legally avoiding taxes   this is at least as important to your overall wealth as the decision of which funds to buy ok now the financial advisor   it 's up to you   you can make your own financial decisions and save the money but it requires you putting in the effort to be educated   for many of us this education is fun   also consider that if you use a regular broker like fidelity you can call up and they have people who for free will give you advice very similar to what you will get from the advisor you referred to   high priced financial advisors make more sense when you have a lot of money and complicated finances   based on your question you do n't strike me as having those   to me 1 sounds like a lot to pay for a simple situation like yours

if he asked you to invest his money with certain objectives which resulted in you buying specific stocks for him with his money then sell all the stocks which you bought with his money and the capital and profits to him you may want to calculate the trading fees that you incurred while buying these specific stocks and taxes from the sale of these stocks withholding them to over the trading fees that you have already paid and the taxes that you might still need to pay if you traded with his money no different than yours then i would think of your investment account as a black box calculate the initial money that you both invested at the time you added his capital to the account calculate how much it all is currently worth then liquidate and return a percentage equal to that of his initial investment you can account for trading fees and taxes subtracting by the same percentage

you 'd need to test the assumptions here in effect you 're saying that in 15 years your account will have a balance 10x your income but normally you 'd expect your income to grow over the years e.g. promotions and so you 'd hope that your income in 15 years would be significantly larger than what it is now    but even in the case where your account eventually does grow to 10x your salary at that time it may still be worth continuing to contribute in effect adding a further 1 to your account is boosting the compounding return on your account by 1 after fees and risk free this additional 1 return in effect makes your retirement plan safer you either get a higher total return for the same investment mix or you can get the same total return for a slightly safer investment mix in effect you 're treating your salary as a safe annuity and each year putting 10 of the return from that into your more risky retirement account

having all of the numbers you posted is a start it 's what you need to perform the calculation   the final word however comes from the company itself who are required to issue a determination on how the spin off is valued say a company is split into two instead of some number of shares of each new company imagine for this example it 's one for one i.e. one share of company a becomes a share each in company b and company c. this tell us nothing about relative valuation right was b worth 1/2 of the original company a or some other fraction say it is exactly a 50/50 split company a releases a statement that b and c each should have 1/2 the cost basis of your original a shares now b and c may very well trade ahead of the stock splitting as when issued shares at no point in time will b and c necessarily trade at exactly the same price and the day that b and c are officially trading with no more a shares they may have already in price that is there 's nothing you can pull from the trading data to identify that the basis should have been assigned as 50 to each new share this is my very long winded was of explaining that the company must issue a notice through your broker and on their investor section of their web site to spell out the way you should assign your basis to each new stock

let 's say i am able to pass the level 1 cfa exam would this allow me to pursue a career within the finance world without needing to look into a second bachelor 's in finance or an mba finance i know this is a long road ahead and one that will be full of difficult times    yeah my focus was school counseling   so this would allow me to graduate and look at a private practice license after i meet the hour requirements or give me the opportunity to become a school counselor as soon as i graduate   these positions do n't pay the most but they are at least something   i live in a rural area currently but would be looking to relocate to denver upon graduation   if i stopped the ms degree then i would only have my ba in psychology to fall back on until taking and passing the cfa   i 'm not sure i could make as much with that degree while i attempt to transition careers     as far as the emotionally taxing aspect working with children who come from broken homes all day every day is extremely exhausting mentally and for someone like me it is difficult to leave work at work in this line   i become emotionally invested in the outcome of my work and have a hard time and not caring when i am on my time     the main reason i am looking at switching into this type of career is n't based around the earning potential   although this is an added benefit the greatest reasoning is because a this helping profession has left me burned out and i want to continue to help but in a less intimate way and b my personality and strengths really fit with this type of career   i have had to work hard to develop as a counselor and i still struggle at times   i have a more concrete and factual mind and i process things in a critical and manner   ideal for careers that require critical evaluation behind the scenes work and a love for working with numbers and data   i 'll take a look at the wso site and ask for some advice on there as well   the largest decision that i will need to make is if finishing the ms is going to be worth the 20k investment for one more year or if i should cut out and focus on developing a career in this field while working full time and starting to pay off student loans   my student loan debt is unfortunately higher than i would like but i come from a family of users and i finished high school while living on friend 's for the last two years so it has been a necessary evil   having to pay on the loans if i were to stop the ms is also a factor but i know there are income driven repayment plans available that i can take advantage of if my earnings are n't as high as i would like     thank you again for your time it is greatly appreciated

generally investing in index tracking funds in the long term poses relatively low risk compared to short term investment aka speculation no one says differently however it is a higher risk than money market savings bonds the reason for that is that the return is not guaranteed and loss is not limited here volatility plays part as well as general market conditions although the volatility risk also affects bonds at some level as well while long term trend may be upwards short term trend may be significantly different take as an example year 2008 for s&p500 if by any chance you needed to liquidate your investment in november 2008 after investing in november 1998 you might have ended up with 0 gain or even loss had you waited just another year or liquidated a year earlier the result would be significantly different that 's the volatility risk you do n't invest indefinitely even when you invest long term at some point you 'll have to liquidate your investment higher volatility means that there 's a higher chance of downward spike just at that point of time killing your gains even if the general trend over the period around that point of time was upward as it was for s&p500 for example for the period 1998 2014 with the significant downward spikes in 2003 and 2008 if you invest in major indexes these kinds of risks are hard to avoid as they 're all tied together so you need to diversify between different kinds of investments bonds vs stocks as the books parrot and/or different markets not only us but also foreign

there is no simple answer to your question   it depends on many things perhaps most notably what college your daughter ends up going to and what kind of aid you hope to receive your daughter will probably fill out the fafsa as part of her financial aid application   here is one discussion of what parental assets count towards the expected family contribution on the fafsa   you can find many similar pages by googling   retirement accounts and primary residence are notable categories that do not count   so if you were looking to reduce your apparent assets for aid purposes dumping money into your mortgage or retirement account is a possibility however you should be cautious when doing this type of gaming because it 's not always clear exactly how it will affect financial aid   for one thing financial aid includes both grants and loans   everyone wants grants but sometimes increasing your eligibility may just make you or your daughter eligible for larger loans which may not be so great also each college has its own system for allocating financial aid   individual schools may ask for more detailed information such as the css profile   so strategies for minimizing your apparent assets that work for one school may not work for others   some elite schools with large endowments have generous aid policies that allow even families with sizable incomes to pay little or nothing e.g. stanford tuition for most families with incomes under $ 125,000 you should probably research the financial aid policies of schools your daughter is interested in   it can be helpful to talk to financial aid advisors at colleges as well as high school counselors not to mention general financial advisors if you really want to start getting technical about what assets to move around   needless to say it all begins with talking with your daughter about her thoughts on where to go

nobody can give you a definitive answer   to those who suggest it 's expensive at these prices i 'd point to this showing the price of gold versus the global money supply over the past decade or so   it 's not conclusive but it 's evidence that gold tracks the money supply relatively well   there might be a bit of risk premium baked in that it would shed in a stable economy but that premium is unknowable   it 's also imo probably worth the protection it provides   in an inflationary scenario euro devaluation gold will hold its buying power very well   it also fares well in a deflationary environment just not quite as well as holding physical currency   note that in such an environment bank defaults are a big danger that 50k might only be safe under your mattress rather than in a fractionally reserved bank account   if you 're buying gold certificates are n't exactly a bad option although there still exists the counterparty risk of the agent storing your gold as well as political risk of the nation where it 's being held   buying physical bullion these risks but then you face the problem of protecting it   safe deposit boxes a home safe or burying it in your backyard are all possible options   the merits of each i 'll leave as an to the reader   foreign currency might be a little bit better than the euro but as we 've seen in the past year or so the swiss franc has been devalued to match the euro in the proverbial race to the bottom   it 's probably not much better than another fiat currency   i do n't know anything about norway   edit depending on your time horizon my personal opinion would be to put no less than 5 10 of your savings in a hard store of value e.g. gold silver platinum   depending on your risk appetite you could probably stand to put a lot more into it especially given the eurozone turmoil   of course as with anything else your mileage may vary past performance does not guarantee future results this is not investment advice seek professional medical help if you experience an lasting longer than four hours

i 'll use similar logic to dave ramsey to answer this question because this is a popular question when we 're talking about paying off any debt early   also consider this tweet and what it means for student loans to you they 're debt to the government they 're assets if you had no debt at all and enough financial assets to cover the cost would you borrow money at interest rate to obtain a degree   put it in the housing way if you paid off your home would you pull out an equity loan line for a purchase when you have enough money in savings   i ca n't answer the question for you or anyone else as you can probably find many people who will see benefits to either i can tell you two observations i 've made about this question it comes a lot with housing over time   first it tends to come up a lot when stocks are in a bubble to the point where people begin to consider borrowing from 0 interest rate credit cards to buy stocks or float bills for a while   how quickly people forget what it feels and looks like when you see your financial assets drop 50 60   it 's not wall street that 's greedy it 's most average investors   second people asking this question generally overlook the behavior behind the action as carnegie said concentration is the key to wealth and concentrating your financial energy on something instead of throwing it all over the place can simplify your life   this is one reason why lottery winners do n't keep their winnings their financial behavior was rotten before winning and simply getting a lot of money seldom changes behavior   even if you get paid a lot or little that 's irrelevant to success because success requires behavior and when you master the behavior everything else like money happiness peace of mind etc follows

excellent question though any why question can be challenging to answer because it depends on the financial products in question   at least i have n't seen many target date retirement funds that include a high percent of foreign stocks so below explains the ones i 've seen which are primarily us stocks the united states before the last twenty years has been seen as a country of stability   this is not true anymore and it 's difficult for my generation to understand because we grew up in the u.s.a being challenged and tend to think that china and india have always been powers but when we read investors like benjamin graham who had significant influence with warren buffett we can see this bias the u.s.a to them is stable and other countries are risky   again with the national debt and the political game in our current time it does not feel this way   but that bias is often reflect in financial instruments the us dollar is still the reserve currency though it 's influence is declining and i would expect it to decline   contrary to my view because i could be wrong here is mish who argues that no one wants to have the reserve currency because having a reserve currency brings disadvantages see here bogus threats to us reserve currency status no country really wants it i present this to show that my view could be wrong finally there tends to be the go with what you know   many of these funds are managed by u.s. citizens so they tend to have a u.s. bias and feel more comfortable investing their money at home in fact a famous mutual fund manager peter lynch had a similar mentality buy the company behind the stock and what company do we tend to know best   the ones around us one final note i 'm not saying this mentality is correct just what the attitude is like   i think you may find that younger mutual fund managers tend to include more foreign stocks as they 've seen that different world

there are short term and long term aspects in the long term if you live and work in australia and plan to continue doing both indefinitely you might as well move all your cash investments there   there would be no point bearing the exchange rate risks   it may be worth keeping the account open with just enough credit to stop it being shut down   there is no point needing to think about filing foreign tax returns just because you have an account earning a small amount of interest in the short term i think the more important question is practicality rather than exchange rate risk   you want to have enough cash in both countries that if you suddenly have to pay say an apartment deposit or a bill you wo n't be caught short   so i would leave at least a few thousands dollars in a us bank account until at least a couple of months after the move when i was sure everything was settled good luck

for it looks something like this   to make it a bit clearer let 's also plot the difference in net income for self employment and a single person company compared to employment   self employment is slightly worse between £ and about £ 10,500 because class 2 ni kicks in before the employed person starts paying any tax after that self employment is better because you pay 9 class 4 ni rather than 12 class 1 ni once higher rate tax kicks in the saving stops growing the single person company is most tax efficient at all points ignoring any accountancy costs it incurs strange things happen between £ 100k and about £ because the withdrawal of the personal allowance kicks in at a different point when receiving dividends we can also plot the percentage of income paid as tax for each case   the strange for self employment below £ 10k is caused by class 2 ni again employment and self employment both gradually tend towards paying 47 reaching for £ 2 m gross income the company tends towards reaching for £ 2 m gross income

as other answers state selling the options contracts to the market is a definite way out and probably the best in most cases   if you 're determined to exercise your options or there 's not enough liquidity to reasonably sell your contracts to the market then you could plan ahead and exercise smaller number of contracts at a time and sell the resulting position in the underlying which will give you funds to exercise some more contracts and sell the underlying     if you think you 're going down this path however make sure that you take into account your broker 's rules for settlement   you may need to start the exercise sell cycle before the option 's expiration date

if you are looking at long term investments then you can look to dheer 's answer and see that it does n't matter whether the money is large or small the return will be the same   when it comes to shorter term investments it can actually pay to be a smaller investor consider a stock that may not be trading in high volume if i want to take a position for 2,000 shares i can probably buy it quite quickly without moving the market considerably   if i was managing your hypothetical portfolio opening a position for 1,000,000 shares it can cause the price to go up significantly because i have to execute the order very carefully in order to not tip my hand to the market that i want a million shares   algorithmic traders will see the volume increasing on those shares and will raise their asking price high speed traders and market makers will also cause a lot of purchasing overhead then later when it comes time to sell i will lose a percentage to the price drop as i start flooding the market with available shares

yes this happens a lot and in many cases companies do n't even know this is happening collateralized debt obligations frequently contain pieces of the same financial products where it is not obvious what the underlying asset is it gets complicated to explain but i can make an analogy to a portfolio of stocks you might create your portfolio contains companies and those companies also own some of the other companies in your same portfolio the value of all the companies in your portfolio are very even though you thought you made diversified investments under the idea that they ca n't all do poorly at the exact same time except they can if the value of the company 's shares are solely based on the value of other company 's shares but nobody noticed that none of them have an actual robust operations this was a key factor of the financial disaster around 2008 but this problem was solved with the addition of additional disclaimers that all investors agree to so they know what they are buying

this depends on the jurisdiction but such companies are typically subject to regulations and audits that require them to keep the customers accumulated premiums very strictly separated from the company 's own assets liabilities and expenses additionally they are typically only allowed to invest the capital in very safe things like government bonds so unless something truly catastrophic happens like the us government defaulting on its bonds or people in the company break the regulations which would all kinds of serious crimes and require or complete failure of the auditors your premiums and the contractual obligation to you would still be there and would be absorbed by a different insurance company that takes over the defunct company 's business   realistically what all this means is that insurance companies never go bankrupt if they do badly they are typically bought up by a competitor long before things get that bad

this is excellent advice i would make sure that you arm yourself with some solid questions about the company including some of the questions that they ask you interviews should be a two way conversation the more you get them talking the more comfortable they 'll be to recommend you some questions to ask 1 tell me a bit about your interviewer background this gets them talking a bit and allows you to relate with them 2 where do you see the company moving in the next 5 years 3 why is this job opening available 4 can you tell me a bit about the corporate culture 5 how can the company invest in me 6 what are the qualities that will make me successful in this job 7 tell me a bit about our competitors you should know some of them and what sets this company apart make sure you 're armed with as much information about the company as possible one of the things that set me apart when i interviewed at the company i 'm working at now was i came into the interview with the company 's financial report and started asking specific questions about details on that report also make sure to get a business card or contact information before you leave thank you letters are an annoying formality but it is necessary do n't rely on the recruiter to give you that information

the most important thing to remember is that being vat registered you must add vat to every bill so every bill will be 20 higher if the bill payer is a company they do n't care because they deduct the 20 vat from their own vat bill if the bill payer is a private person their cost of your services has just gone up by 20 and it is going to hurt your business so the question is what kind of customers do you have   but if your customers are companies then the flat rate scheme mentioned above is very little work and puts a nice little amount of extra cash in your pocket suitable if your bills are mostly for your work and not for parts that you buy for the customer and bill them for

another way to look at this is if we separate the owner 's account from the business 's account   at the start of the year the owner puts $ 9 into the business account to get the business started at the end of the first day the business account has $ 10 and at the end of the second day the business account has $ 11   the owner does n't need to add any more of his own money into the business account at the end of the day the business will have $ which is $ 365 profit + $ 9 investment   assuming the business has no other expenses the business will calculate profit for the year like this the author is making a strange point the two numbers he is talking about are two different quantities the business owner 's return on investment is $ 365 $ 9 =   but the business 's profit margin is $ 365 $ = 10   both are useful numbers when running the business i disagree with the author 's that a business is doing something tricky when calculating profit margin remember that in addition to the business owner 's monetary investment he worked every day for a year to earn that $ 365

i am not a financial advisor but i an tell you what i did in exactly this situation which is pretty much what you are proposing   i put money into the offset savings account until i had only a small amount of mortgage balance left less than a year 's worth of mortgage payments then i set it up so that each month i did the transfer from the offset savings pot into the mortgage itself this depleted the offset savings in line with the mortgage debt and the interest on the two balanced out almost to zero this was self sustaining and meant that i kept the same margin owing over time i.e. if i was in this situation for 5 years for the whole 5 years i would effectively have 1 year remaining on the mortgage meanwhile since i now did n't have any mortgage outgoings from my regular income i put any spare money into isa savings no need to withdraw money from the mortgage to move to the isa the benefits of this as opposed to just paying off the damn mortgage already were that i kept the full liquidity of the mortgage amount i could withdraw all the offset savings pot if i wanted to although i would then have to have funded the mortgage payments differently and as that liquidity went down over time i was building up other savings in parallel it worked well for me it almost does n't matter what the offset mortgage rate is since you are effectively paying it off by keeping the offset savings pot so high

what the other 's said is right you build credit by paying over time keeping your balance under the halfway mark of your limit and paying it down over the course of a fair amount of periods yields the best results so if you have a limit of $ 1500 then charge a $ 600 credit and pay $ 100 + interest over 6 months best yet are loans with fix installments this behavior tells the credit agencies you are responsible and you pay your debts in their eyes you are a low risk high roi statistically speaking

the original question was aimed at early payment on a student loan at 6 let 's look at some numbers   note the actual numbers were much lower i 've increased the debt to a level that 's more typical as well as more likely to keep the borrower worried and up at night   on a $ 50 k loan we see 2 potential payoffs a 6 year accelerated payoff which requires $ extra per month and the original payoff with a payment of $ next i show the 6 year balance on the original loan terms $ which we would need to exceed in the 401(k to consider we made the right choice   the last section reflects the 401(k balance with different rates of return i purposely offer a wide range of returns even if we had another lost decade averaging the 401(k balance is more than 50 higher than the current loan debt at a more reasonable 6 average it 's double note the $ deposit should really be adjusted adding 33 if one is in the 25 bracket or 17.6 if 15 bracket that opens the can of worms at withdrawal but let me add i coerced my sister to deposit to the match while married and a divorced and disabled her withdrawals are penalty free and $ 10 k is tax free due to std deduction and exemption note the chart and text above have been edited at the request of a member comment   what about an 18 credit card glad you asked   the same $ 50 k debt it 's tough to imagine a worse situation you budgeted and can afford $ because that 's the number for a 10 year payoff your spouse says she can grab a extra shift and add $ to the plan because that the number to get to a 6 year payoff   the balance after 6 years if we stick to the 10 year plan $ the 401(k balances at varying rates of return again appear above a bit less dramatic as that 18 is tough but even at a negative return the 401(k is still ahead you are welcome to run the numbers adjust deposits for your tax rate and same for withdrawals you 'll see -1 is still about break even   to be fair there are a number of variables debt owed original time for loan to be paid rate of loan rate of return assumed on the 401(k amount of potential extra payment and the 2 tax rates going in coming out combine a horrific loan rate the 18 with a longer payback 15 + years and you can a scenario where in fact even the matched funds have trouble keeping up i 'm not judging but i believe it 's fair to say that if one ca n't find a budget that allows them to pay their 18 debt over a 10 year period they need more help that we can offer here i 'm only offering the math that shows the power of the matched deposit    from a comment below the one warning i 'd offer is regarding vesting the matched funds may not be yours immediately companies are allowed to have a vesting schedule which means your right to this money may be tiered at say from year 2 6 for example it 's a good idea to check how your plan handles this on further reflection the comments of david need to be understood at zero return the matched money will lag the 18 payment after 4 years the reason my chart does n't reflect that is the match from the deposits younger than 4 years is still making up for that potential loss i 'd maintain my advice to grab the match regardless as there are other factors involved the more likely return of the tax differential should one lose their job and the hope that one would get their act together and pay the debt off faster

i work for a mortgage company but one that sells the loans we fund to banks i 've never heard of that risk mitigation incentive lower rate for auto payments but i know for a fact you will have a higher interest rate if you choose to pay your taxes and insurance out of your own pocket and not escrow them i would contact the cfpb instead of an attorney and they will be able to tell you very quickly whether this is an acceptable practice or not

well yes it does but just because the debt is trading at 80 cents on the dollar does n't mean that the company can actually legally get away with paying only 80 cents on the dollar they would have to come to an agreement with the debt holders first and perhaps they could but the more conservative approach is to use the book value of the debt   or what about debt that 's trading at a premium to its face value because say interest rates have come down relative to the time the debt was issued the amount that the owes to the debt holders has n't suddenly gone up

it depends on what kind of pension you get and your anticipated retirement income   if you have one of those nice defined benefit plans that pays 90 of your last 5 years average salary annually you might not want to bother with a separate rrsp and put your money into other use instead while most canadians should worry about not having enough to retire on some might end up with too much and costing them in the form current purchases and entitlements to government retirement benefits figuring out how much you need for retirement is not trivial either   a lot of people talks about planning for needing 70 of what you made now as a way to preserve your lifestyle   well my opinion is that those type of generalization might work for the people in the middle of the income band and is too little for those in the low income and possibly too much for those with high income   my own approach is estimate your retirement income requirement by listing out your anticipated expenses as if you were doing budget   i would agree that 's not the best approach either back to my comment about no one size fits all but it 's one that i feel most comfortable with once you have that figure factor in what you think you will get from the government oas cpp and etc and you will have the amount of money you need for retirement   i will warn against using average life expectancy to forecast your retirement needs 50 of the people will end up with extra money not a bad problem and the other 50 will run out of money bad but very true problem if you use that approach instead of going on and write an essay on this topic i will simply say this everyone 's situation is different and just like solving any other complex problems you need to start with end in mind and work things backward with a ton of different scenario to be able to cope with whatever life might throw at you   if you spend enough time in the library bookstore looking through books on the topic of estate planning and retirement planning you will find people arguing back and fro on these topics this is a sign that this is complex and no one has the one good answer for   do a bit of reading by yourself and if still unsure or just want to be sure go spend the money and review your plan with a fee only advisor   they will be able to provide another opinion on your situation after thoroughly studying your situation

the economy is not zero sum just because one group is experiencing exponential growth does n't mean they 're exploiting others to achieve it    to figure out whether or not those people deserve their wealth we have to examine exactly how it was accomplished did they lobby to shut out competitors did they take advantage of ip laws did they receive subsidies did they benefit from tax credits did they use eminent domain and for each of these questions follow up with the question of how much these actions affected their bottom line profitability   anything less than this level of examination is lazy analysis and should be regarded as such

i believe the answer is that to protect yourself it is good to get credit protection so you will be notified when new credit is taken in your name    also you can use to look at your credit report hint   while you do that and while you are in the transunion report you will have the option to dispute adverse items    i always suggest that people dispute everything adverse   that puts the onus on the other parties to produce evidence to transunion within 30 days to the validity of the adverse item    you would be surprised how many will simply drop off your report after doing that   everybody should do this here is a direct address for transunion = = >   once the disputes are finalized the results get communicated to the other two bureaus it is amazing how well it works   it can raise your credit score significantly it really helps to watch your credit report yourself and also to get whatever protection is offered that may help protect you against others opening new accounts in your name

you are not the only one with this problem when intuit changed their pricing and services structure in 2015 a lot of people got angry facing larger fees and having to go through an annoying upgrade just to get the same functionality such as schedule d capital gains you have several options 1 forget turbo tax and just use paper forms that is what i do paper is reliable 2 use forms mode in turbo tax of course that may be even more complicated than simply filing out paper forms 3 use a different service if your income is below $ the irs has a free electronic filing service other online vendors have full taxes services for less than turbo tax 4 add the amount to ordinary income technically as long as you report the income you can not be penalized so if you add the capital gain to your ordinary income then you have paid taxes on the income even if they send you a letter you can send an answer that you added it to ordinary income and that will satisfy them of course you pay a higher rate on your $ 26 if you do that 5 if you are in the 15 or below income bracket you are exempt from capital gains and you can omit it do n't believe the nervous who say the irs will burn your house down if you do n't report $ 26 in capital gains penalties are assessed on the percentage of taxes you did not pay 0.5 penalty per month since 0.5 of $ 0 is $ 0 your penalty is $ 0 the irs knows this the irs does not send out assessment letters for $ 0 6 even if you are above the 15 bracket there is likelihood it is still a no tax situation see 5 above 7 worst case scenario you are making a million dollars per year and you omit your $ 26 capital gains from your return the irs will send you an assessment letter for about $ 10 you can then send them a separate check or money order to pay it in all honesty i have omitted documented tax items like taxable interest that the irs knows about many times and never gotten an assessment letter once i made a serious math error on my return and they sent me an assessment letter which i just paid end of story and that was for a lot more than $ 26 the technical verbiage for something like this in irs lingo is income as you can see from this official irs web page basically what they do is guess how much they think you owe and send you a bill then you pay it if you do so in time you do n't even get a 0.5 interest penalty on your $ owed or whatever it is 8) go hog wild as long as you are risking an assessment on your $ 26 why not go hog wild and just let the irs compute all your taxes for you make a copy of your income statements then mail them to the irs with a letter that says hi i am mr. my ssn is xxx xx xxxx my address is xyz i am unable to compute my taxes due to a confused state of mind i am hereby requesting a tax assessment for the 2016 tax year make sure you sign and date the letter in all probability they will compute the full assessment and send you a bill or refund

sorry my response was supposed to be to the above comment not yours my main point was that in africa where there was already a large population did not require bringing in people which you would need to incentivize to move to hence offering the free carrot of property rights to settlers of na to extract resources instead the british and other european powers just used the local populace to extract the resources the main reason the us and canada are well off is that property rights were established very early on and this encouraged people to invest and produce more because the higher production accrued to the producer and the producer would have legal recourse should a negative externality be put upon them by someone else obviously there were other reasons as well but property rights are huge this is true globally now in encouraging people to grow their assets part of the reason africa is still so screwed up is that many of their institutions and governments are too corrupt to protect their citizens property rights thereby discouraging investment and production

you could not have two stocks both at $ 40 both with p e 2 but one an eps of $ 5 and the other $ 10   eps = earnings per share p e = price per share earnings per share so in your example the stock with eps of $ 5 has a p e of 8 and the stock with an eps of $ 10 has a p e of 4   so no it 's not valid way of looking at things because your understanding of eps and p e is incorrect update ok with that fixed i think i understand your question better this is n't a valid way of looking at p e. you nailed one problem yourself at the end of the post the tricky part is that you have to assume certain values remain    constant i suppose but besides that it still does n't work it seems to make sense in the context of investor psychology if a stock is supposed to trade at a low p e like a utility that it would stay at that low p e and thus a $ 1 worth of eps increase would result in lower $ $ price increase than a stock that was supposed to have a high p e. and that would be true but let 's game it out scenario say you have two stocks abc and xyz both have $ 5 eps abc is a utility so it has a low p e of 5 and thus trades at $ xyz is a high flying tech company so it has a p e of 10 thus trading at $ 50/share if both companies increase their eps by $ 1 to $ 6 and the p es remain the same that means company abc rises to $ 30 and company xyz rises to $ 60 hey one went up $ 5 and the other $ 10 twice as much that means xyz was the better investment right nope you see shares are not tokens and you do n't get an identical arbitrary number of them you make an investment and that 's in dollars so say you 'd invested $ 1,000 in each $ 1,000 in abc buys you 40 shares $ 1,000 in xyz buys you 20 shares their eps adds that buck the shares rise to maintain p e and you have abc $ 6 eps at p e 5 = $ 30/share position value = 40 shares x $ 30/share = $ 1,200 xyz $ 6 eps at p e 10 = $ position value = 20 shares x $ = $ 1,200 they both make you the exact same 20 profit it makes sense when you think about it this way a 20 increase in eps is going to give you a 20 increase in price if the p e is to remain constant it does n't matter what the dollar amount of the eps or the share price is

this is your best answer so far a detail left out is that derivatives are mostly known for the amount of leverage allowed which is typically about 20 1 or 5 down this is legal because it 's generally assumed that someone is not going to buy or sell the underlying asset that they will offset their long or short position long before the contract 's delivery date your derivative futures instead of forwards because they 're a standardized size traded on an exchange and more liquid will call you when you lose about half of your 5 to tell you to either transfer some money to cover your position or to ask you to exit your position at a loss   are traded through clearinghouses not exchanges and they can be for any underlying asset for any delivery date for any price so long as parties agree on it just think of it as a contract

the first thing you should do is write a letter to the collection company telling them that you dispute all charges and demand per section 809 of the fair debt collection practices act that they immediately validate and confirm any and all debts they you owe you should further request that that they only communicate with you by mail section 809 requires them to examine the legal documents showing you allegedly owe a debt and they are required to send this to you this all creates a useful paper trail when you send the letter be sure to send it as certified mail with a return receipt from your description it does n't sound like this will do anything but it 's important you do it within 30 days of them contacting you this is because the law allows them to assume the debt is valid if you do n't do it within 30 days of their initial contact i recommend you speak with an attorney most states have a statute of limitation on debt of about 4 or 5 years i do n't know if that applies to courts though whatever you do be very careful of the language you use when speaking with them always refer to it as the alleged debt or the debt you i owe you do n't want them your words later on as far as proving you paid it i would look through every scrap of paper i 'd ever touched looking for it if that proves fruitless try going to the courthouse and looking through their records if they 're saying you did n't pay that 's a long shot but still worth a try you could also try bank records from that time like if you have a visa statement showing $ paid to the nevada court or something like that if all else fails the law allows you to send the collector a letter saying that you refuse to pay the debt the collection company then legally must stop contacting you unless it 's to tell you they are suing you or to tell you they wo n't contact you again i strongly advise against this though your best bet is going to be speaking with a qualified attorney edit you should also pull your credit reports to make sure this is n't being reported there federal law gives you the right to have a free copy of each of your credit reports once every year if it is being reported send a certified letter with return receipt to each bureau which is reporting it telling them you dispute the information they then are required to confirm the information if they ca n't confirm it they must remove it if they do confirm it you are legally entitled to put a statement disputing the information next to it on your credit report i am not an attorney this is not legal advise you should consult an attorney who is licensed to practice law in your particular jurisdiction

i fear this question may be impossible to answer beyond the options you already seem to know about   it depends too much on the details of your situation some of which you say you do n't know   if you do n't even know how much debt you have i think you 're going to need some kind of professional advice to assess your situation   one place to start is the national foundation for credit counseling   this organization can provide free or low cost advice about your situation including bankruptcy options that said the main missing piece i see in your question is your expenses   the first thing you should ask yourself is what am i spending money on and can i stop spending on money on that in order to save and/or pay off debt instead   you say that you can live comfortably paycheck to paycheck and routinely put money into savings   can you start living and thus put a lot more into savings or towards debt repayment   whether this will work or not depends on how much debt you have but it definitely needs to be part of your thought process likewise if you continually are wiped out by expenses start budgeting for them

are you talking about a country besides the us   and you 're talking about a commercial bank right   in the us banks do n't buy gold from consumers   the last time they sort of did in the early 1900s they were trading gold coins for gold certificates and then they later stopped allowing consumers to trade them back   this is known by a well known financial term gotcha suckers if someone were naive enough to deposit a $ 50 gold american eagle today in a bank the depositor will get a credit of $ 50 on their account and later some clever person will ask the teller if they have any strange money lying around and that lucky person will be able to withdraw a $ coin for $ 50 if it lasted for even a second in the teller 's drawer but let 's say you 're going to a place that does indeed still buy gold coins the discount depends on the type of coin and the type of damage   an old collectible coin has a part of its value set by the gold value and part by the collector 's premium   better command better collector 's premiums so a damaged coin as long as it is n't a chunk of the coin missing wo n't be worth less than the melt value   you may not get that much from a dealer but it should be fairly close   if part of the coin is missing then the person buying it should weigh the coin and adjust the price proportionately   it 's likely though that if you have the items in a safe you may have a or of gold but it should still all be there unless someone takes it   gold at about 1850 degrees but it would take half the surface temperature of the sun for it to boil away   if it 's it may need to be again

# 122485
its hard to write much in those comment boxes so i 'll just make an answer although its really not a formal answer regarding commissions it costs me $ 5 per trade so that 's actually $ 10 per trade $ 5 to buy $ 5 to sell   an etf like $ 58 per share currently fluctuates $ 1 or $ 2 per day   ixc is $ 40 per share and fluctuates nearly 50 cents per day a little less   so to make any decent money per trade would mean a share size of 50 shares which means i need $ in cash is not marginable if it goes up $ 1 and i sell that 's $ 10 for the broker and $ 40 for me   i would consider this to be the minimum share size for   for ixc 100 shares would cost me $ 4000 2 = $ 2000 since ixc is marginable   if ixc goes up 50 cents that 's $ 10 for the broker and $ 40 for me   ixc also pays a decent dividend   does not   you 'll notice the amount of cash needed to capture these gains is roughly the same actually to capture daily moves in ixc you 'll need a bit more than $ 2000 because it does n't vary quite a full 50 cents each day at first i thought you were describing range trading or stock but those systems require stop losses when the range or channel is broken   you 're now talking about holding forever until you get 1 or 2 points of profit   therefore i would n't trade stocks at all   stocks could go to zero etfs will not   it seems to me you 're looking for a way to generate small consistent returns and you 're not seeking to strike it rich in one trade   therefore buying something that pays a dividend would be a good idea if you plan to hold forever while waiting for your 1 or 2 points in your system you 're also going to have to define when to get back in the trade   if you buy ixc now at $ 40 and it goes to $ 41 and you sell do you wait for it to come back to $ 40   what if it never does   are you happy with having only made one trade for $ 40 profit in your lifetime   what if it goes up to $ 45 and then dips to $ 42 do you buy at $ 42   if so what stops you from eventually buying at the top   or even worse what stops you from feeling even more confident at the top and buying bigger lots   if it gets to $ 49 surely it will cover that last buck to $ 50 right what if you bought ixc at $ 40 and it went down   now what   do you take up gardening as a hobby while waiting for ixc to come back   do you buy more at lower prices and average down   do you find other stocks to trade   if so how long until you run out of money and you start getting margin calls   then you 'll be forced to sell at the bottom when you should be buying more all these systems seem easy but when you actually get in there and try to use them you 'll find they 're not so easy   anything that is obvious wo n't work anymore   and even when you find something that is obvious and bet that it stops working you 'll be wrong then too   the thing is if you think of it many others just like you also think of it therefore it ca n't work because everyone ca n't make money in stocks just like everyone at the poker table ca n't make money   if you can make 1 or 2 per day on your money that 's actually quite good and not too many people can do that   or maybe its better to say if you can make 2 per trade and not take a 50 loss per 10 trades you 're doing quite well if you make $ 40 per trade profit while working with $ 2 3k and you do that 50 times per year 50 trades is not a lot in a year you 've doubled your money for the year   who does that on a consistent basis   to expect that kind of performance is just unrealistic   it much easier to earn $ 2k with $ 100k than it is to double $ 2k in a year   in stocks money flows to those who have it and from those who do n't you have to plan for all possibilities form a system then stick to it and not take on too much risk or expect big unrealistic rewards daytrading you make 4 in 5 days that broker labels you a pattern   once you 're labeled its for life at that brokerage   if you switch to a new broker the new broker does n't know your dealings with the old broker therefore you 'll have to establish a new pattern with the new broker in order to be labeled   if the sec were to ask the broker would have to say yes or no if you established a pattern of daytrading at that brokerage suppose you make the 4 and then you make a 5th that triggers the call   the broker will call you up and say you either need to deposit enough to bring your account to $ 25k or you need to never make another at that firm ever   that 's the only warning you 'll ever get   if you 're in violation again they lock your account to closing positions until you send in funds to bring the balance up to $ 25k   all you need to do is have the money hit your account you can take it right back out again   once your account has $ 25k you 're allowed to trade again even if you remove $ 15k of it that same day   if you trigger the call again you have to send the $ 15k back in then take it back out having the label is not all bad they give you 4x margin   so with $ 25k you can buy $ 100k of marginable stock   i do n't know that could be a bad thing too   you could get a margin call at the end of the day for owning $ 100k of stock when you 're only allowed to own $ 50k overnight   i believe that 's a fed call and its a pretty big deal

microsoft does n't do salary negotiations   the way the salary structure works at microsoft is similar to how it works in many other huge companies you have a rank level title eg developer senior developer principal developer and upwards and your salary is based solely on that for example every new college hire starts at a certain rank whether foreign or not and every new college hire starts at the same level of pay when you get a promotion you get a new title and a corresponding pay increase you ca n't negotiate for bonuses or salary increases it 's set in stone for everyone   this is for engineering positions obviously sales marketing etc all have different structures

imo almost any sensible decision is better than parking money in a retirement account when you are young some better choices 1 invest in yourself your skills your education grad school is one option within that 2 start a small business build a customer base 3 travel adventure see the world meet and talk to lots of different people note that all my advice revolves around investing in yourself growing your skills and/or your experiences this is worth far more to you than a few percent a year take big risks when you are young you will need maybe $ valued at today 's money to retire comfortably how will you get there most people can only achieve that by taking bigger risks and investing in themselves

well the article does go into certain tax schemes you can use the debt as a write off to lower your tax rate that 's just a legal tax scheme in the uk and many other countries the problem though is that the uk department of starbucks is apparently very profitable   gt us executives of the seattle company claiming in telephone calls with investors that the uk business was profitable   and   gt howard told investors the business here was so successful he planned to apply the lessons to the company 's biggest market in the us   it 's just that the books tell a different story   gt accounts filed with companies house showed a 10th consecutive annual loss   so no it 's not a just a matter of revenue vs sales it 's a matter of boosting your losses with outside sometimes artificial debt just so you can run with a negative on the books this lowers the tax rate on the true sales to a whopping 0.3 even though the business is perfectly healthy    that 's a tax scheme aimed at easing the tax burden on national businesses which are n't profitable

the number you are trying to calculate is called the internal rate of return irr   google spreadsheets and excel both have an xirr function that can do this for you fairly simply setup a spreadsheet with 1 column for dates 1 column for investment mark your investments as negative numbers payment to invest   all investments will be negative mark your last row with today 's date and today 's valuation positive all withdrawals will be positive so you are pretending to withdrawal your entire account for the purpose of calculation do not record dividends or other interim returns unless you are actually withdrawing money the xirr function will calculate your internal rate of return with timed investments links article explaining xirr function sample spreadsheet in google docs to modify

the offset account is the way to go the rate is higher and even if interest rates fall further when you go to renew your term deposit the interest rate for that will be lower as well also with a term deposit you will be penalised if you take the money out before the end of the term regarding tax you will pay tax at your marginal tax rate on every dollar earned from the term deposit as long as your income is above the $ 18,000 tax free threshold if the mortgage is for your primary residence then you will not pay any tax on the money in your offset account as you are not earning any interest in this account you are saving interest on your mortgage so definitely the way to go would be with the offset account you 'll get an effective higher interest rate it will help you pay off your mortgage sooner the money is always on call and you will pay no tax

mostly true very few plans allow for in service withdrawal options in most cases plans that do only allow pure after tax sources to be withdrawn prior to age 59.5 the other case would be if you had rolled money from another k plan into your current plan in almost all plans that money is always accessible   otherwise you generally will have to wait to request a distribution until you turn 59.5 years of age

this is what your car loan would look like if you paid it off in 14 months at the existing rate you 'll pay a total of about $ in interest    if you do a balance transfer of the $ 10,000 at 3 it 'll cost you $ 300 up front and your payment on the remaining $ 5,000 will be $ to pay it off in the 14 month period   your total monthly payment will be $ $ 5,000 amortized at for 14 months plus $ 10,300 divided by 14 $ +   your interest will be about $ $ 300 from the balance transfer and $ 92 from the remaining $ 5,000 on the car loan at even if your lender does n't credit your additional payment to principal and instead simply credits future payments you 'd still be done in 15 months with a total interest expense of about $   so this additional administration and additional loan will save you maybe about $ 55 over 14 or 15 months

very interesting read but i feel like the bitcoin stocks are just a bit too volatile to place your future security and livelihood in them to those who are thinking about going this route i would strongly suggest you hedge your bets with a more stable entity in addition to the bitcoin stock then again we all know the risks of placing money in the stockmarket it 's unpredictable and risky the higher the risk the higher the reward but that 's just my two cents may feel like a contradiction to some based on what i 've said previously but i actually love what bitcoin are doing

the banks countrywide was the worst about this failed to uphold lending standards when they were giving out mortgages because it was n't in their self interest   is there such thing as lending standards as in by law or by regulations not ethics   as far as i know the major regulations banks have to follow are the capital ratio requirements basel i ii and the min 4 leverage ratio i 'm assuming the banks kept to the ratios by keeping illiquid loans off their balance sheet   gt;after the banks would give someone a mortgage the banks would make their fees off the mortgage and then bundle these mortgages into securities the banks then had these sub prime mortgages that are now bundled together as securities    from my understanding the bank did originate the loan and they will assign this loan to a trust fund who will the loans into cdos or mortgage backed securities i have 2 questions from this   1 what is wrong with this and   2 if it is unethical or greedy what can be done to solve this stop them from these loans would n't that destroy the reinsurance market   gt;then s&amp;p and other ratings agencies gave them aaa ratings despite nearly everyone in the industry knowing they were time bombs waiting to go off goldman sachs and everyone else knew what was going on but they did n't want to get stuck holding the bag per se so they committed fraud by knowingly misleading their clients to buy these securities   so the responsibility lies more with these guys then goldman sachs were the ones committing fraud and now the sec is going after fannie and freddie the banks did n't break any laws or regulations

first off i think you are on the right path not paying 3 to a broker that sort of fee reduces the money you earn significantly in the long term for your fund investing approach 10 funds seems like a lot one of the point of funds is that they are diversified so i would expect that the 10th fund would give relatively little diversification over the other 9 i would think about targeting only 5 funds to invest in the funds rather than trying to invest in all funds every month put all of the money into a single fund and rotate the fund month to month that reduces your transaction costs significantly

from your comment my salary through could pass for an annual salary for the    industry i suppose that ’s relevant that information would certainly be relevant if you were the owner since the beginning of the year if that were the case then i would say you 'd be fine skipping the salary for the rest of the year it would be equivalent to simply front loading your salary however since you did n't own any part of the company during the time you received the salary i believe you should think of that salary as if it came from an entirely different company this means that during the 5 months you owned the company you will have taken $ 0 in salary and i believe that would not be reasonable if this job is your main source of income as a side note regarding this statement you made during this time i 'd like to avoid the employer half of fica taxes incurred by paying myself through payroll you 'd actually be avoiding both the employer and employee portion of fica since both sides of fica are paid for employee compensation fica is not paid by either side on company profits

lets say that college costs 100 k per kid and they you have 3 ages and expect tuition and fees inflation of 8 per year you are 40 and want to retire at age 65 and would have to replace 80 of you final years salary and expect your salary to increase 2 above inflation but you do have a pension that based on the number of years of service you will have if you do n't switch companies will replace 40 of you final salary but if you leave now will only cover 15 the equivalent of social security will replace 10 your spouse works part time and has no company provided pension your big single bucket of long term savings has are you on target you ca n't answer the question without first determining how much money each of those individual buckets kid 1 kid 2 kid 3 pension social security and retirement needs to have today and in the future then you take the money you do have and assign it to the buckets of course different accounts have different tax age deposit and use rules also what happens after the last child graduates so the amount of money available each year will change significantly the key to not stealing money from long term savings goals is to realize you also need an emergency fund and a life happens fund that way an engine repair does require you to pull money from the education fund
