most businesses want to grow and there are a variety of ways to raise the money needed to hire new employees and otherwise invest in the business to increase the rate of that growth you as a stock holder should hope that management is choosing the least expensive option for growth some of the options are debt selling equity to venture capitalists or selling equity on the open market going public if they choose debt they pay interest on that debt if they choose to sell equity to venture capitalists then your shares get diluted but hopefully the growth makes up for some of that dilution if they choose to go public dilution is still a concern but the terms are usually a little more favorable for the company selling because the market is so liquid   in the us current regulations for publicly traded companies cost somewhere in the neighborhood of $ year so that 's the rule of thumb for considering whether going public makes sense when calculating the cost of fundraising but as mentioned regulations make it less advantageous for executives who choose to sell their shares after the company goes public they ca n't sell when good spot prices appear going public is often considered the next step for a company that has grown past the initial venture funding phase but if cash flow is good plenty of companies decide to just reinvest profits and skip the equity markets altogether

the reason to go public is to get money not to be snarky but your question is like asking why should a company try to sell its products when if they just piled them up in a warehouse they would n't have to worry about shipping and customer complaints and collecting sales tax the answer of course is because they want the money sure there are disadvantages to going public like more regulation required financial disclosures and having to answer to stockholders that 's the price you pay for accepting money from people they 're not going to give you money for nothing

you go public to raise money to invest in the business and/or pay off the existing shareholders it 's really as simple as that the advantage of being public is that your shares can easily be bought and sold and so you can issue and sell new ones and your existing shareholders can sell out if they want to the disadvantage is that you are much more tightly regulated with more disclosure requirements and also that you are exposed to much more pressure from your shareholders to maintain and increase your share price

the purpose is to go public but also to generate more wealth the real money comes when market values you at a price more than your cash flow if a company brings in $ 1000 of cash flow then that is what the employees and owners have to distribute among themselves but if they are likely to increase to $ 2000 next and $ 4000 next year and they go public then the stock will do well in this case the promoters and employees with options rsus will benefit as well the increased visibility is also very useful look at google or fb they did n't need the ipo proceed when they went public they had enough cash from their business but then they would only have $ 1 10 billion a year but due to the ipo their investors and employees have a huge net worth   basically with just a small of shares in the public you can value the company at a high price valuing in the future cash flows with a discount rate etc so instead of realizing the profit over the next 15 years you get to enjoy it right away

first the recipient is not responsible for any gift tax the giver pays the tax the gift is not taxable income to the recipient and so the recipient does not pay any income tax on the gift either more than that and they tap into their lifetime exclusion currently 2015 $ all that 's needed is a simple form more convoluted would be to lend you the full amount and then forgive $ 14,000 per year paperwork in my opinion

borrowing to invest is almost always a bad idea   you 'd have to take out an unsecured loan which has a higher interest rate or a secured loan and put at risk whatever you are securing the loan with you need some means to make payments on the loan or if interest is being added to the balance then take the compounding effect into account with regards to the cost of the money and how much you will really end up owning in order to come out ahead you need to invest in something that will yield a return that is higher than the cost of borrowing the money such high yields always come with higher risk meaning that you will actually get that return is less and less of a sure thing so now you are talking about the chance to make money or a chance your investment could fail perhaps badly   meaning you could well do nothing but end up in debt with little to nothing to show for it if someone claims to have a sure thing and is encouraging you to borrow money to invest in it i 'd be checking their back for a fin and remembering the when the shark bites start to spread

one explanation is that movie patrons are considering their total willingness to pay for the movie experience so that if the ticket price plus the market price of popcorn is less than their willingness to pay the theater has an opportunity to extract more consumer surplus by charging higher than market prices for the popcorn that is price discrimination there is a working paper on the subject by and 2008 the abstract of which reads prices for goods such as blades for razors ink for printers and concessions at movies are often     set well above cost   theory has shown that this could yield   a profitable price discrimination     strategy often termed metering   the idea is that a customer ’s intensity of demand for     aftermarket goods e.g. the concessions provides a meter of how much the customer is willing to     pay for the primary good e.g. admission   if this correlation in tastes for the two goods is     positive a high price on the aftermarket good allows firms to extract a greater total price     admissions plus concessions from higher type   customers   this paper develops a simple     aggregate model of discrete continuous demand to motivate how this correlation can be tested     using simple regression techniques and readily available firm data   model simulations illustrate     that the can be used to predict whether aftermarket prices should be above below or     equal to their marginal cost   we then apply the approach to box office and concession data from     a chain of spanish theaters and find that high priced concessions do extract more surplus from     customers with a greater willingness to pay for the admission ticket   and 1992 make a similar argument in a article   they essentially argue that purchases of things like movie tickets are made by groups once individuals are constrained by the group 's choice the firm has additional market power we present models in which price discrimination in the context of   a    two part price can occur in some competitive markets purchases   take    place in groups which choose which firms to patronize while   firms    are perfectly competitive with respect to   groups they have   some    market power over individual consumers who are constrained   by their    groups choices we find that firms will charge an entry fee   that is     below marginal cost   and   the   second part of   the   price is   marked    up   above marginal cost the   markup not only is positive   but    increases with the quality of the product the quote you are looking for is similar and again attributes the discrepancy to price discrimination   from the armchair economist p. the purpose of expensive popcorn is not to extract a lot of money from    customers that purpose would be better served by cheap popcorn and    expensive movie tickets instead the purpose of expensive popcorn is    to extract different sums from   different customers popcorn lovers    who have more fun at the movies pay more for their additional    pleasure that is some people like popcorn more than others   the latter idea is that the movie experience for popcorn lovers is worth more than the sum of its parts that a movie ticket + popcorn is worth more than either of them separately for some people

afaik money is a fiat currency the penny is only worth what the us government says it it worth if i choose to have my coin material made into pennies then i face an opportunity cost because i could of used that copper elsewhere if a penny worth of copper is worth 1.8 cents and i choose to make it into a a coin with a value of 1 cent then my opportunity cost is .8 cents   the whole point of a fiat currency is to take the actual material value of the money out of the equation a gold coin back before fiat currencies was worth its weight in gold this would be like saying that you are going to nominally change the value of your gold coin into a coin worth half of its weight its is equal to 1 gold coin but its spending power is equal to 1/2 a gold coin   do you lose value of course not do you lose spending power yes fiat currency is all about spending power the value is fictional    when i make the spending power less than the value the purpose of a fiat currency breaks down

i can see your point   there are more investors than investment banks so the power of each investment bank is substantially more than each individual investor   it would take a lot of coordinated effort on the part of investors to alter the balance of power   and to an extent a new or existing and improved ratings agency would be a proxy war between investors and investment banks even though the direct competition would be with other ratings agencies   at the same time ratings agencies as an industry have never had less credibility nor have the investment banks for that matter   i have to believe there is a realistic way to exploit that reality

for some people it 's easier to stick to a budget if they have separate checking and savings accounts because they can deposit funds directly into their savings account and not have those funds accessible by debit credit card checks etc this allows people to pay themselves first and accumulate savings while making it slightly more difficult to spend those savings on a whim one a more technical legal note one key difference in the united states comes from regulation d. of the law limits you to six withdrawals from savings and money market accounts no such limit exists for checking accounts regulation d also forbids banks from paying interest on business checking accounts   in the simplest case checking accounts and savings accounts are a tradeoff between liquidity and return checking accounts are much more liquid but wo n't necessarily earn interest while savings accounts are less liquid because of the withdrawal limits but earn interest nowadays however sweep accounts blur this line somewhat because they function like checking accounts in that you can write an unlimited number of checks make an unlimited number of withdrawals etc but you can also earn interest on your account balance because some or all of the funds are swept into an investment account when not in use the definition of in use can vary from business to business and bank to bank

there 's no need for an index to have a currency as its purpose is not to act as an asset but rather to signal investors about the performance of a collection of stocks an index can be price weighted meaning that its value equals the arithmetic average of the prices of each stock in the index with no stock splits the return on this index is the same as the return on a portfolio composed of one share of each stock if there is a stock split however instead of dividing by the number of stocks as you normally would when taking the arithmetic average you divide it by the number that will make the value of the index pre stock split arithmetic average equal to the value post stock split then use that dividing number for all periods until a new stock split occurs   an index can be value weighted meaning that its changes in value track the percentage changes in total market capitalization of the stocks in the index price weighted indexes ignore for firm size and percentage changes in price weighted indexes are not robust to stock splits value weighted indexes take firm size into account and are robust to stock splits djia is price weighted s&p 500 is value weighted

gt that is in large part do to insane healthcare costs passed on to the consumers by the aca healthcare spending has increased on average 1.5 annually since 2009 where as the highest growth in spending from 1991 until 2006 was 1.3   health care costs have actually been on the rise for decades now it was only noticed by the majority party i.e. the gop who had held the majority for 16 of the years prior to 2009 when the aca was enacted suddenly health care costs started to explode the truth is that health care costs have been on a steady rise in the time period from 1972 to 1982 costs rose on average 14 per causes of rising healthcare keep in mind this was prior to the expansion of medicare from 1983 1992 costs grew at a rate of 9 per year 3 times faster than inflation from 1993 to 2010 cost rose at a rate of 6.4 per year the aca of course was passed in 2009 but did n't start to take effect until 2011 since 2010 health care costs has risen about 4 per year that is a 2 drop in a short amount of time compared to the previous years however the numbers are already so big just like the national debt that the gop who had as much part to play in the health care costs as they did in the debt had tons of numbers they could use to make it seem like health care costs have exploded    in reality what happened is that people who never had health insurance before were forced to get it and started to realize how expensive it is when it actually covers what it was intended to cover preventative care as well as emergent care the gop has been on a steady march to undermine the new law as much as possible since it passed because it made some of their biggest donors and health care insurance providers uncomfortable the fact that they had to share their cost information and that the health care exchange required them to do a line item by line item comparison with other companies out there    so here we are the aca is going to be cut and millions of people are going back to be uninsured or what you are going to see is the rate of costs growth start to increase again after decades of slowly decreasing rates why because of the renewed ability of insurance providers to hide the costs to hide costs increases it will also cause hospitals to greatly overcharge the uninsured as they were doing before but there will be many more of them the goal being that the uninsured are unlikely to pay for the very large medical bills so knowing this hospitals artificially inflate the bill in the hopes of getting a larger portion of that unpaid bill liquidated through medicare    uninsured populations also lead to more unhealthy people you would think that not having health insurance would make people want to remain more healthy however studies show the opposite to be articles business in actuality people stress more about their health and avoid periodic checkups both of which lead to bad health results    trying to blame the cost increases in health care on government meddling or say it is a problem brought on by the aca is weird since there are so many examples of government sites s healthcare ranked dead last compared health care programs out there which are so much more efficient less costly and have resulted in much healthier populations    gt i do nt have health insurance and an er visit with costs me less out of pocket than 90 of the country why is that    i am going to call bs number one that is a huge claim to make without supporting evidence number two you would have to demonstrate how much that same visit would cost to those with health insurance    gt do you think it has to do with the fact that with the aca hospitals know they are getting paid with 0 questioning on pricing so charge whatever they want and with me they think shit this guy might not ever pay us lets just give him a decent price and get some money from him because all we can do is send his bill to collections    actually no the exact opposite they now because you are uninsured that you are unlikely to pay so they overcharge you for the same services because they know that they will only be reimbursed a percentage of the costs if it goes to medicare for non payment    gt the swiss do everything better   you keep referring back to switzerland do n't get me wrong they are a very good country and have the number 2 ranked health care system in the world however i do n't think they are the low tax haven that you think they are they have an average corporate tax rate of wiki whereas the us has it at 32 their highest income tax bracket is whereas the us is at 39 their sales tax goes at high as 8 where ours go as high as 11 their average effective rate is around 11 while ours is around 18 including social security puts switzerland at 17 and the us at 24    so they are definitely a lower tax rate country but in no way are they a no tax rate country then again switzerland has no military to speak of while the us spends more on military then the next 7 countries put together    gt this is the dumbest statement you ve made this entire time    i have been very patient i have stuck with this conversation in spite of the put downs and remarks i have a little too but you can go back to most of my remarks and see that i have been more i have given you some leeway because of your age and i am almost twice as old as you    so you gave me your background i will give you mine i am closer to 50 then i would prefer i left the house at 17 enlisted in the navy and spent the next 15 years serving in the military i ended my career in a select community i have been out for ten years this july i am now owner of a company that does r&amp;d and works with the government a lot of my knowledge about inventions and how commercial works with government comes from my own personal experiences i have seen the best and worst of government as well as seen the same on the commercial side of the house anyone comes to this game with the that government ca n't get anything done as well as commercial quickly learns that is not true anyone comes thinking that commercial equals efficient learns that is not always true too    gt take apple for instance where is all the government funding they recieved to be one of the most innovative companies in human history or microsoft   as i said previously that you thought was a dumb comment commercial is very good at taking existing systems and finding ways to make them efficient and better apple and microsoft is the same they both made their mark in history by expanding on and creating innovation with existing technologies that had their foundation in government r&amp;d projects including the digital wiki as well as computers like the and the issues and the advancements into tech ibm invent the personal computer answer which lead to the first efficient and cost effective personal computers the touchscreen was actually first invented in by engineers at wiki and of course we know that the internet started as a government funded project called news ask history who invented the internet    i think you would be surprised how much many if not most of the things we take for granted today have a foundation in government funded r&amp;d. my company is a commercial company and we do a great job creating our own products and innovation and yet still our best selling product is a design of a national laboratory that we license from them commercial industry is great at manufacturing and producing something the government is not as good at and so often they will license out designs for production to companies like ours some of the biggest commercial companies out there do the same

shit article that displays the author has no farming idea of how warren buffet operates     the man has metrics that tell him when shares are too expensive when this happens he does n't buy and dividends can tend to accumulate when you have almost $ 500 billion in assets which could just be 2 years of 5 dividend yields    if they are expensive he wo n't buy and money will accumulate when there is a crash he buys on the cheap that how you get 23 of year on year gains for 40 years    the fact that he is not buying does indicate that the market is overvalued which is consistent with the fact that there is still a substantial amount of qe the question is what will happen as the fed winds it down they are aiming for a small decrease or leveling out of the stock market if that happens and the market for a couple of years maybe the metrics will catch up and he will buy again without a crash happening

but how does the quantity matching happen for example if i want to buy 1000 shares at $ 100 but there is only one seller to sell 10 shares at $ 100 what happens then this depends on the type of order you 've placed if you placed a fill or kill order your order to buy or sell a certain number of shares is routed to the trading floor for immediate execution if the order can not be immediately filled it is cancelled killed automatically note that the order must be filled in its entirety partial fills are not allowed in your example your buy order would n't be filled because it could n't be matched to a sell order of the same volume this is similar to an all or none order which is an order that contains   a condition instructing the broker to fill the order completely or not at all if there is insufficient supply to meet the quantity requested by the order then it is canceled at the close of the market in this case if your order was n't matched to an order of the same volume by the time the market closes it 's cancelled if you simply placed a market limit order and in the case of the limit order part of your order was matched to another order with the right price that part of your order will be filled while the rest will remained unfilled

this is how i 've understood this concept fibonacci nos levels is based on concept of sequential increment you may find lot of info about fibonacci on net in stock market this concept is used to predict psychological level while a trend is form usually price tend to accumulate consolidate at these level how the ratio make impact is   check any long trend now draw a retracement from immediate previous high and connect it 's low you will see new levels of intermediate trend in broader term you will find after reversal a leg trend is formed then body and then head which is smaller then price reverses the first leg that forms if it refuses to break or 38.2 then the previous trend may continue 50 is normal usually this level is indecision phase even is seen as indecision but it is crucial level as it is breakout level towards 100 now if the stock 100 then it is sign a new big trend is forming now for day trader and 50 level are very crucial from trading purpose this concept is so realistic that every level is considered and respected suppose if a candle or bar starts at level and crosses 38.2 and directly hits 50 then the next bar or candle will revert and first hit 38.2 and then continue with the trend it means price comes back forms it area at this level and then continue whichever direction the force it you never trade alone you need help of or other tools to confirm it

what you put that money into is quite relevant it depends on how soon you will need some or all of that money   it has been very useful to me to divide my savings into three areas   1 very short term oops funds this is for when you forget to put something in your budget or when a monthly bill is very high this month put this money into passbook savings   2 emergency funds that are needed quite infrequently used for such things as when you go to the hospital or an appliance breaks down put this money in higher yeald savings but where it can be accessed   3 retirement savings put this money into a never draw on it till you retire make no loans against it when you change jobs roll over into a self directed ira and invest in an etf that pays dividends reinvest the dividend each month   so like i said where you put that money depends on how soon you will need it

this started as a comment but then really go too long so i am posting an answer i am also using gnucash just like you as a non accountant but i think it really pays off to get to know more about accounting via gnucash it is so useful and you learn a lot about this hundreds of years old double entry system that all accountants know so start learning about 5 main accounts and debits and credits imho it is far easier than one can think now the answer even without balancing amounts exactly program is very useful as you still can track your monthly outgoings very well just make adjust some reports and save their so you can re run quickly when new data comes in after you have classified your transactions properly if i still did not know what some transactions were happens a lot at first import i just put them under expenses unaccounted expenses thus you will be able to see how much money went who knows where if later you learn what those transactions were you still can move them to the right account and you will be pleased that your reports show less unaccounted money how many transactions to import at first for me half a year or a year is quite enough once you start tracking regularly you accumulate more date and this becomes a non issue reflecting that personal finance is more about behaviour than maths and that it is more for the future where your overview of money is useful gnucash wil learn from import to import what transactions go where so you could import say 1 or 3 month intervals to start with instead of a while year no matter what i still glance at every transaction on import and still sometimes petrol expense lands in grocery because of the same seller but to spot things like that you use reports and if one month is abnormal you can drill down to transactions and learn correct things note that reports are easy to modify and you can save the report with names you can remember they are saved on the machine you do the accounting not within the gnucash file so if you open the file or mysql database on another computer you will miss your custom reports you can transfer them but it is a bit hence it makes sense to use gnucash on your laptop as that you probably will have around most often once you start entering transactions into gnucash on the day or the week you incur the expense you are getting more control and it is perhaps then you would need the balance to match the bank 's balance then you can adjust the equity opening balances to manipulate the starting sums so that current balances match those of your bank this is easy   when you have entered transactions proactively on the day or the week and then later do an import from bank statement the transactions are matched automatically and then they are said to be reconciled i.e. your manual entry gets matched by the entry from your statement so for beginning it is something like that if any questions feel free to ask imho this is a process rather a one off thing i began once got bored but started again and now i find it immensely useful

sell the house in the scenario you describe he is using the property as an investment with a $ 250 per month buy in this investment does n't make a return right now and when you add in the cost of dealing with the tenant even if he does n't have those cost now he will when they move is out of more than $ 250 a month and he has no direct knowledge that the value will definitely increase he would be better spent selling the house and putting the funds into an investment even a risky investment it will have less maintenance cost associated with the risky investment than the rental property   besides sitting on the property for 10 15 years would cost him 30 45k plus the cost of re renting the house when empty not to mention the inevitable increases in taxes over that time which will either increase his deficit or eat up the rent increase he is able to charge do n't take the loss on the sale just short sale it and take the money and invest one last thought an alternative is to creatively finance a sale take payments from a buyer until they can buy outright that will cover the full mortgage and get him the price he needs you can look up owner financing to find out more on how to do this hope this helps

you will maximize your expected wealth by investing all the money you intend to invest as soon as you have it available do n't let the of dollar cost averaging induce you to allocate more much money to a savings account than is optimal   if you want the positive expected return of the market do n't put your money in a savings account   that 's especially true now when you are certainly earning a negative real interest rate on your savings account dollar cost averaging and putting all your money in at the beginning would have the same expected return except that if you put all your money in earlier it spends more time in the market so your expected return is higher   your volatility is also higher because your savings account would have very low volatility but your preference for investment tells me that you view the expected return and volatility tradeoff of the stock market as acceptable if you need something to help you feel less stress about investing right away think of it as dollar cost averaging on a yearly basis instead of monthly   further you take take comfort in knowing that you have allocated your wealth as you can instead of letting it away in real terms in a bank account

i think you are aiming your crony capitalism shotgun in the wrong direction   oil industry subsidies dwarf those to the ev and the bailouts to the us car manufacturers was the clearest example you could imagine of picking winners and losers     far worse both the car manufacturers and oil industry represent the entrenched interests which are fighting the future changes in the industry as opposed to the other way around   the money went directly to the companies involved without a lick of good capitalist competition   now compare that to a personal ev tax credit   1 you encourage the clearly visible future of cheap electrical power and driverless evs 2 you set up the subsidy as a personal tax break to the buyer so any company is free to up their game and make better products to win part of it   3 its a much smaller amount and much more cost effective per tax dollar than giant checks to monster oil companies   once the government stops amounts of money into oil and traditional car companies then it might be time to at saving taxpayer money spent on evs

's original answer and the   example with proportionate application of the payment to the two balances is not quite what will happen with us credit cards by us law card act of 2009 if you make only the minimum   required payment or less the credit card company can choose which part of the balance that sum is applied to i am not aware of any company that chooses to apply such payments to anything other than that part of the balance which carries the least interest rate   including the 0 rate that results from acceptance of balance transfer   offers if you make more than the minimum required payment then the excess must by law be applied to paying off the highest rate balance if the highest rate balance gets paid off completely any remaining amount must be applied to second highest rate balance and so on   thus it is not the case that that $ 600 payment in joe 's example is applied proportionately to the $ 5000 and $ 1000 balances owed it depends on what the required minimum payment is so what would be the minimum required payment the minimum payment is the total of i all finance charges incurred during that month ii all service fees and penalties e.g. fee for exceeding credit limit fee for taking a cash advance late payment penalty and other charges e.g. annual card fee and iii a fraction of the outstanding balance that by law must be large enough to allow the customer to pay off the entire balance in a reasonable length of time the law is silent on what is reasonable but most companies use 1 which would pay off the balance over years   consider the numbers in joe 's example together with the following assumptions $ 5000 and $ 1000 are the balances owed at the beginning of the month no new charges or service fees during that month and the previous month 's minimum monthly payment was made on the day that the statement paid so that the finance charge for the current month is on the balances stated the finance charge on the $ 5000 balance is $ while the finance charge on the $ 1000 balance is $ giving a minimum required payment of $ + + 60 = $ of the $ 600 payment $ would be applied to the lower rate balance $ 5000 + $ = $ and reduce it to $ the excess $ would be applied to the high rate balance of $ 1000 + = $ and reduce it to $ in general it is a bad idea to take a cash advance from a credit card do n't do it unless you absolutely must have cash then and there to buy something from a merchant who does not accept credit cards only cash and do n't be tempted to use the convenience checks that credit card companies send you from time to time all such cash advances not only carry larger rates of interest there may also be upfront fees for taking an advance but any purchases made during the rest of the month also become subject to finance charge in other words there is no grace period for new charges and this state of affairs will last for one month beyond the first credit card statement whose statement is paid off in full in timely fashion finally turning to the question asked i am trying to determine how much i need to pay monthly to zero the balance as per the above calculations if the op makes the minimum required payment of $ plus $ that $ will be applied to the low rate balance and the rest $ will pay off the high rate balance in full if the payment is made on the day the statement is issued if payment is made later but before the due date that $ will be accruing finance charges until the date the payment is made and these will appear as 22 rate balance on next month 's statement similarly for the low rate balance what if several monthly payments will be required the best calculator known to me is at free but it is necessary to set up a username and password   enter in all the credit card balances and the different interest rates and the total amount of   money that can be used to pay off the balances and the site will lay out a payment plan   basically pay off the highest interest rate balance as much as possible while making minimum required payments on the rest most people are surprised at how much can be saved and how much shorter the time to be debt free is if one is willing to pay just a little bit more each month

transferring the balance of a credit card is what they call moving your debt from one credit card to another credit card or loan   a debit card however is not debt it is a card that is tied to a checking account with money in it you ca n't transfer debt to your checking account if you have enough money in your checking account to cover the balance of your credit card you can pay it off   that is a really good thing to do because the balance on your credit card is costing you a lot in interest charges each month   were you perhaps thinking of transferring a balance from your debit card 's checking account to a new credit card where you would then have a new debt on the credit card and extra cash in your debit card 's checking account this is possible with most credit cards and is usually called a cash advance however just to caution you cash advances typically have high interest rates often you will see promotions where they will offer low or no interest rate for a short time but this is just a trick to entice you to borrow extra knowing that if you need the money now you 'll most likely still need it in 6 months when the promotion expires i do n't recommend it

gt;if everyone in auto manufacturing labor was replaced by a cheap robot tomorrow then cars would be cheaper   why   all the auto manufacturers installed robots so they 've all got the same incentive to keep prices the same and pocket the additional productivity as profits   auto manufacturers have switched largely to robotic labor   prices have stayed mostly the same adjusted for inflation   quality has increased which is good but fewer and fewer people can afford the higher quality vehicles due to lack of jobs and other factors in the cost of living rising housing health care education energy   game and plastic surgery business robot manufacturing and robot programming   actually programmers work more than auto workers   auto workers were unionized and thus had a 40-hour work week sometimes even with lunch breaks out of work hours instead of leisure hours

one of the best answers to this question that i 've ever read is in a paper published by robert lucas in the journal of economic perspectives that journal is meant to a be a place for experts to write about their area of expertise in economics for a general but still technically minded audience they recently opened up the journal as free to the public which is a fantastic resource you no longer need a subscription to or whatever to read it   you can read the abstract to the paper and find a link to it here one of the things that i like a lot about this paper is that it strips out absolutely everything even slightly unnecessary to thinking about a and just discusses what one can arrive at with a very very simple model of course with great simplicity come sacrifice about details however it does a great job of answering your question why do people care about growth a quick note the key to understanding the answer to your question is to think about things in terms of the long term   not even looking forward to the future because we 'll be dead by then but looking back to the past the key to the importance of growth is that for the last years the us has on average had maybe 2 3 real growth per year i 'm pulling these numbers out of my head i think much better numbers are in that paper somewhere on average over that period of time this growth has meant that the quality of life that one has if one lives in a country experiencing this growth is enormous compared to countries that do not experience this average growth over that period   statistically speaking growth is also somewhat auto correlated roughly speaking if it was low the last few periods you can expect it to be low the next period same thing if it 's high    then the reason we care about growth right now if you have too many periods of low growth pretty soon the average over the long term growth will be pulled down and then quality of life ca n't be higher in the future which quickly becomes someone 's present the paper above makes this point with a very simple model of course none of this touches on issues which are another issue entirely with respect to the economy needs to grow to just keep up with its debt repayments i think the answer is along the lines of sometimes countries get into debt expecting that growth will increase their resources in the future and thus they can pay back their debt that strategy is of course the strategy that anyone borrowing taking out a loan should be employing you should expect that your future income will be enough to pay back your on a loan you took otherwise you 're irresponsible at the aggregate level production is the nation 's income it is what you have all that you have as a nation to pay back any debt you 've incurred at the national level

gt though i 'd counter that if your goal is to manipulate economic exchanges between individuals with the intention of guiding the economy at large to a specific desired outcome i think that capitalism is not the economic system for you :p       i will say that to your point i have come to believe that there are two forces at odds that are required for a robust and long lived prosperous society   1   a capitalist system that encourages innovation through competition and   2   a government to check the inevitable concentration of wealth that capitalism naturally trends toward   they most effective ways for a government to check that concentration is through a progressive tax system and a check on the power that the concentration of wealth creates eg forcing employers to pay a living wage instead of using a bully to extract the maximum effort for the lowest possible cost as shown by the robber barons etc of the 1900s   either way i 'll admit that i am not talking about pure capitalism   however like the philosopher all ideas go through a process of thesis the first idea aka capitalism the idea in this case socialism and then synthesis the resulting compromise   the synthesis then becomes the new thesis for the system to further evolve upon   it 's time for american capitalism to evolve

you can take a shortcut and make a few cumulative transactions maybe just estimate how much of your spending landed in each of your budget categories but you will lose a lot of the value that you were building for yourself by tracking your spending during the earlier months i reconcile my budget and categorize my spending on a monthly basis it 's always a chore to pull out the big stack of receipts and plow through them but i 've learned the value of having an accurate picture of where all my money went there is no clean way to fake it you can either take the time and reconcile your spending or you can take a short cut it probably renders your efforts to track everything from the beginning of the year invalid though if you want to start over this month as you did at the beginning of the year that would probably be a cleaner way to reconcile things

i expect the company wanted to pay you for a product on a purchase order rather than as   a contract laborer whatever would they be willing to re issue the check to you as a sole proprietor of a business named abc consulting or anything like that you can register your sole proprietor business with the state using a doing business as dba or fictitious name and then open the bank account for your business using the check provided by the customer as the first deposit there is likely a smaller registration fee for the dba if they wo n't re issue the check and you have to go the llc route up $ 125 doing odd jobs or borrowing from a friend or parents seriously anyone can earn that amount of money in a week or two besides the filing fee for the llc your bank may require you to provide an operating agreement which is not required by the state the operating agreement can be simple or more complex if you have a partner even if it 's a spouse if you do have a partner it is essential to have such an agreement because it would specify the responsibilities and benefits allocated to each partner particularly in the event of equity distributions taking money out of the business or liquidating and ending the llc there are websites that will provide you a boilerplate form for operating agreements but if your business is anything more than just single member llc you should pay an attorney to draw one up for you so the wording is right it 's a safeguard against potential future lawsuits and while we 're at it do n't forget to obtain a ein equivalent to a ssn from the irs for your llc there 's no cost but you 'll have to have it to file taxes as a business for every year the llc exists and has income good luck

in some cases we when we see an opportunity to save our clients money without risking valuable coverage or diminishing benefits we make certain recommendations for more affordable life insurance one of these strategies is laddering or term lengths or term maturities the strategy is simple while most people who are considering longer terms such as 20 or 30 year term purchase a single policy to fit their needs the laddering strategy has you purchase two policies totaling the same amount of coverage you currently need but with a shorter length term mixed with the longer term for example instead of purchasing a 30 year term for $ 1 million dollars you might purchase two policies for $ 500,000 each one with a 15 year term and the other with a 30 year term the result is typically a savings of on your term life insurance just be aware that the plan going in is to let the first policy go the one with the shorter term length when its level term has expired for example in a 15 year term the premiums will be guaranteed to stay level the first 15 years and then increase every year thereafter there is typically a sizable jump in rates in that 16th year clients often see rates increase 8 10 times or more therefore it ’s important you understand that going in and realize you will most likely let that first policy go when the premiums increase leaving you with the second policy through the end of its longer level term you can crunch some numbers with our laddering calculator

it 's just money in an account somewhere with no tax shelter or string attached to help maturing children 18 get a kick start in life whether they go to college or not   basically the money can be used for anything for you or them   or you can put it in a ugma type account where it 's technically the child 's funds and not yours but check how college loans are calculated before dumping a bunch of money in those i believe they are looked at differently maybe as the first source of funds that gets tapped and could impact loan qualification

this is not shocking news actually nothing happened to these banks that made them lose their ratings rather it 's the rating agencies that have set up more strict rules especially when it comes to triple a status   specifically it 's no longer possible that banks or similar institutions can have a triple a status this effectively means that only the richer countries can be triple a.

in the united states most residential real estate transactions employ a title company to process all the paperwork and transfer all the funds some paperwork has to be filed with the local government but they also have to deal with the banks mortgage companies on the two ends of the transaction at closing both parties will sign a ton of paperwork all of which was coordinated by the title company as for the funds the buyer will write a check the lender will send over the loan commitment papers for the rest of the money   how much money that depends on the purchase price the deposit the down payment the taxes and fees an other closing costs they are responsible for initial escrow inspection title insurance   the seller hopefully does n't have to write a check but if they underwater they will have to bring funds to closing from the incoming funds the title company will send money to the old lender the real estate agents the local government to record the deed   the sellers escrow money with the old lender may end up being sent back to the seller or some of the funds could be transferred to the buyer to help cover the portion of the real estate taxes from the perspective of the buyer they will only write two checks one at the start of the process for the deposit and one on closing day for their portion of the transaction the seller will hopefully walk away with a check of course determining if they will owe taxes for the transaction depends on a lot more information

yes you can certainly keep it in a savings account until you spend it you 'll get much less interest than you will be paying on the loan but it will be better than nothing however you may want to ask if you can use the loan flexibly instead i.e. only draw down the money you need when you need it and not start paying interest until that happens that would save you a lot more money note that the isa limit is currently £ and the limit is on total deposits so you wo n't be able to reuse the amount later in the tax year since that ends on april 5th that probably wo n't be an issue for you

the biggest problem with the company was that they had really good employees for a long time who were passionate about their jobs but they then made progressing through the company awful in certain regions for instance at one point if you wanted to become an assistant manager of your department you had to agree to a rotation within your metro stores for what was basically a two dollar raise you might start at a store two miles from your home and then end up 30 miles from home then six months later be 40 miles away so a lot of people who were intelligent looked at that and said yeah i can just stay here and make two dollars less i live down the street   but the worst part was their employees were able to make the shitty systems work most of the time so they were never viewed as shitty despite the fact that their employees routinely told them of their and how awful they were to use   then they laid off the several thousand people they used some very interesting calculations to come up with their 1500 person layoff figure a while back who were responsible for keeping the ship afloat and put all those duties on the backs of other people   disclosure i was out before the layoffs left of my own free will and still like the people i worked with i left because i looked at moving up and was like nope these people are morons

you are correct a possible dead cat bounce is forming on the stock markets if it does form it will mean that prices have not reached their bottom as this pattern is a bearish continuation pattern for a dead cat bounce to form prices will need to break through support formed by the lows last week if prices bounce off the support and go back up it could become a double bottom pattern which is a reversal pattern the double bottom would be confirmed if prices break above the recent high a couple of days ago regarding the psychology of the dead cat bounce pattern is that after a distinct and quick reversal of prices from recent highs you have 2 groups of market participants who create demand in the market firstly you have those who were short covering their short positions to take profits and secondly you have those who are looking for a bargain buying at what they think is the low so for a few days you have the bulls taking over the bears   then as more less positive news comes in the bears hit the market again these are more participants opening short positions but more so those who missed out in selling previously because prices fell too quickly seeing another opportunity to sell at a better price so the bears take over again   unless there is very good news around the corner it is likely that the bears will stay in control and prices will fall further how to trade a dead cat bounce assuming you have been stopped out of your long already if you are aggressive you can go short as prices start reversing from the top of the bounce with your stop loss just above the top of the bounce if you are more conservative you would place your entry for a short position just below the support at the start of the bounce with your stop above the top of the bounce you could also place an order for a long position above the top of the bounce if a double bottom a one cancels the other oco would be an appropriate order for such a situation

banks and energy are fundamental requirements for modern and there are plenty of both who contribute a great deal to society 's well being but i do know where you are coming from   the nature of the system we have is that the largest organisations tend to attract the most ruthless leaders who are prepared to screw over people and the environment in pursuit of their own selfish interest sociopaths enough to not get caught out are rewarded and those who social benefits over the growth of their organisation are out competed and make themselves less relevant in theory that should be kept in check by culture of social responsibility a strong free press and good government but those things have been eroding for a long time   there are mutual funds who seek to invest only in ethical companies ethics are subjective so there 's always the possibility that you 'd disagree with their choices or they make errors of judgement but it 's a better option than a fund that only considers returns you 've got a better chance that it is run by people who think ethics are important so they might not see their clients as to be fleeced like goldman sachs apparently does   alternatively you could invest in a fund that contributes to growing a developing nation 's economy or only invests in renewable energy or agriculture or whatever you consider important

you are young and therefore have a very long time horizon for investing absolutely nothing you do should involve paying any attention to your investments more than once a year if that first off you can only deposit money in an ira of whatever kind if you have taxable income if you do n't you can still invest just without the tax benefits of a roth my suggestion would be to open an account with a discount brokerage schwab fidelity etrade etc the advantage of a brokerage ira is that you can invest in whatever you want within the account then either buy an s&p 500 or total market index fund within the account or buy an index based etf like a mutual fund but trades like a stock the latter might be better since many mutual funds have minimum limits which etfs do not set the account up to reinvest the dividends automatically s&p 500 yields will far outstrip current savings account yields and sit back and do nothing for the next 40 or 50 years well except for continuing to make annual contributions to the account which you should continue to invest in pretty much the same thing until you have enough money and experience and knowledge to diversify into bond funds international funds individual stocks etc disclaimer i am not a financial planner i just manage my own money and this strategy has mostly kept me from stressing too badly over the last few years of market turmoil

the cash is not penalty free if you take up loans from the policy to pay for retirement growth essentially stops and the interest will eat away policy value over time so instead of gaining 7 8 per year and taking withdrawals you would be taking loans and losing whatever the interest rate is   dividends are just the profits made from the company which is why its tax free its considered a return of premium you are just overpaying for the policy by its dividend rate    whole life is a great vehicle for some situations but it always comes after a 401k or other retirement savings whole life does nt even begin to make sense imo until you are making a few hundred thousand a year and need it for a business buy sell agreement or legacy money to leave children grandchildren   it does nt scale well to lower incomes

when you invest in an etf or mutual fund you 're not investing in stocks or bonds you 're buying shares of a company that invests in stocks or bonds this level of is what makes it so bond funds do not mature bonds inside of etfs or mutual funds do have a maturity date when they mature the fund manager uses the principal value that is returned to purchase another bond that meets the investment objectives of the fund so the fund never matures since it is always investing in more bonds when the old ones mature unit investment trusts made of bonds do have a maturity date as well since the portfolio does not change once the uit is issued as the individual bonds in the portfolio mature the principle value is returned to investors so the overall maturity date is effectively the maturity date of the last bond in the trust all of the statements quoted above are accurate in explaining why there is no guarantee of a return of principle when investing in bond funds etf or open ended mutual fund the bonds they hold do mature but are replaced within the fund as needed the investor will never see it happen unless they watch the holdings reports filed by the funds   the only way to have an assurance of the return of principle is to invest in individual bonds or in unit trusts made up of bonds

in my opinion you should pay off the student loans as soon as possible before you start saving for the house downpayment $ is a big number but you have a great salary   nice   up until now you have been a poor college student accustomed to a relatively low standard of living   your $ 800 per month plan would have you pay off the loan in 3 years but i would challenge you to pay off this entire student loan in 1 year or less   a monthly loan payment of $ will pay off your loan in 12 months after that is done if you take the same amount you had been paying toward your student loans and save it for your condo in less than two years you 'll have a 10 down payment saved $ 50k   the whole thing will take less than three years there are three reasons why i recommend paying off the loan first before saving for the condo one is practical and two are philosophical practical you will save money on interest   paying off the loan in 1 year vs. 3 years will save you $   you wo n't find a short term safe investment that will beat 5 in interest philosophical the loan is something current and concrete that you can focus on   your condo is a dream at this point and there is lots of time to change your mind   if the $ per month amount is at all a sacrifice for you then in a few months you might be tempted to say to yourself this month i really want a vacation so i 'll just skip this month of saving   for the loan however if you establish a concrete goal of 12 months to pay off the loan it will hopefully help motivate you to allocate this money and stick to your plan philosophical getting used to borrowing money making payments to a bank and paying interest is not a great way to live   it is better in my opinion to eliminate your debt as fast as possible and start getting accustomed to saving cash for what you want   clean up your debt and resolve not to borrow any more money except for a reasonably sized mortgage on your home

property taxes are levied by the local authorities to pay for their services since the services are continuous so are the charges you need someone to a road to your house to build infrastructure to maintain the police force fire department local schools etc that 's what your property taxes are going to however at times the property taxes become more than what the owners have actually paid for the house think of a house bought in the midst of a recession at a bargain price of $ 20 k but at the top of the market bubble costs $ the poor guy who bought it for $ 20 k should pay as if he had ever had $ 2 m    it can certainly be the case that the property taxes change drastically over the years and sometimes people have to give up their property because they can not afford the taxes that is exactly the thought that had led californians to amend the constitution in prop 13

there are way too many details missing to be able to give you an accurate answer and it would be too localized in terms of time location anyway the rules change every year and your local taxes make the answer useless to other people instead here 's how to figure out the answer for yourself use a tax estimate calculator to get a ballpark figure and keep in mind that these only provide estimates because there are still a lot of variables that are only considered when you 're actually filling out your real tax return there are a number of calculators if you search for something like tax estimator calculator some are more sophisticated than others fair warning i used several of these and they told me a range of $ 2k $ 25k worth of taxes owed for a situation like yours here 's an estimator from turbotax it 's handy because it lets you enter business income when i plug in $ 140 k $ 70 40 hours 50 weeks for business income in 2010 married filing jointly no spouse income and 4 dependents i get $ 30 k owed in federal taxes that does n't include local taxes any itemized deductions you might be eligible for ira deductions etc you may also be able to claim some expenses as business deductions that will reduce your taxable business income so you 'd net $ 110 k after taxes or about $ $ 110k 50 40 of course you could get an answer from the calculator and congress could change the rules through the year you might come out better or worse depending on the nature of the rule changes that 's why i stress that it 's an estimate if you take the job do n't forget to make estimated tax payments edit some additional info if you plan on doing this on an ongoing basis i.e. you are going into business as a contractor for this line of work there are some tax shelters that you can take advantage of most of these wo n't be worth doing if you are only going to be doing contract work for a short period of time 1 2 years these may or may not all be applicable to you and do your research into these areas before diving in i 'm just scratching the surface in the notes below

hedging you have an investment and are worried that the price might drop in the near future you do n't want to sell as this will realise a capital gain for which you may have to pay capital gains tax so instead you make an investment in another instrument sometimes called insurance to offset falls in your investment   an example may be that you own shares in xyz you feel the price has risen sharply over the last month and is due for a steep fall so you buy some put option over xyz you pay a small premium and if the price of xyz falls you will lose money on the shares but will make money on the put option thus limiting your losses if the price continues to go up you will only lose the premium you paid for the option very similar to an insurance policy diversification this is when you may have say $ 100,000 to invest and spread your investments over a portfolio of shares some units in a property fund and some bonds so you are spreading your risks and returns over a range of products the idea is if one stock or one sector goes down you will not lose a large portion of your investment as it is unlikely that all the different sectors will all go down at the same time

i was in a similar but not quite as bad situation a couple years ago and i had a stroke of luck that helped me but your friend might be able to force a similar situation my parents refused to take out the huge parent loan understandably so but my dad made enough money that i was n't eligible for much aid   my stroke of luck came when they got divorced i could my fafsa with only one parent using my mom with very little income my aid shot through the roof and nearly covered my undergrad this happened in california i do n't know if this works in other states my advice for your friend would be to take the 6 units part time job option but do what she can to earn enough to pay her own rent food other bills   i think the requirement for filing as an independent is that you supply > 50 of your own income   it wo n't kick in right away but for next school year this would end up getting her a lot more money from the state federal governments   for me it was enough to cover my school food rent gas car payment and still have a little left over i do n't know if this is still possible and i know it does n't work for graduate school or if it applies to every state   it might be an option worth pursuing though

first off your commitment to paying down debt and apparent strong relationship with your brother is admirable however i think you are your situation and potentially your relationship by attempting to combine debts in this way you could consider a simple example where you have interest bearing at 5 and your brother has interest bearing debt at 10 if you both pay down his higher interest debt first and then both pay down your debt after then clearly you will have paid less interest combined but by waiting to pay off your debt until later you have accrued more interest yourself so who has saved money by doing this your brother you will have paid let 's say without getting into balances $ 50 extra interest to save your brother $ 70 in interest so why would you want to give your brother $ 50 total interest savings between both of you in this simplified example are $ 20 so in theory your brother could pay you $ 60 after the fact effectively meaning you end up $ 10 ahead and your brother ends up $ 10 ahead here you end up in a position where you could still say in theory we both came out ahead but what if your brother loses his job while you 're both paying off your debt and he ca n't help any more does he accrue some type of calculated interest until he pays you back what if he 's off work for 2 years and still owes you 30k what if he just never makes his payments to you on time at what point do you resent your brother for failing to uphold his end of the deal money and friends do n't mix money and family mixes even worse in rare circumstances where you absolutely must mix family and money get everything in writing get it signed make it legal outline all details of the transaction including interest rates and examples of how the balances calculate in 5 years when things go following the letter of the law is what will keep you from becoming enemies but with family often people have an expectation that while we agreed i would pay x he 's my brother so he should take pity on me and allow me to pay only y if i need to finally to your question about how to calculate amounts to pay it will be very complicated you will need to track minimum balance payments interest rates and even potentially the lost income which one of you gives up to pay down the other 's debt you could do these things in a simplified way close to what i 've set out above but then ultimately one of you will lose out if you pay down your debts first how can you calculate the lost living potential for your brother who might want to buy a house but ca n't save for a down payment for an extra year what if he has to move and without sufficient down payment he needs to pay extra mortgage insurance on his loan from the bank will you compensate him for that my recommendation if you have n't caught it yet is do not do this your potential savings are not going to be worth the potential of breaking your relationship with your brother   instead look at joining your minds not your money set goals for yourselves individually and hold each other accountable make this an open conversation between yourselves as it can be difficult to talk about finances with other people your support will help the other person and hopefully help keep you on track as well to provide numerical context for potential savings which you appear to still want consider the numbers you 've provided you have 40k debt at 10 your brother has 20k of debt at 5 let 's assume you each can pay up to 20k against the principal of your loans each year finally assume for simplicity that you also have enough to pay off interest as it gets charged so no compounding and you pay in even instalments each year mathematically that means your interest each year is equal to your interest rate your average annual balance if you each go alone then you will accrue 10 on an average balance of = 30k per year which equals 3,000 in interest in year 1 then = 10k .10 = 1,000 interest in year 2 total interest for you = 4,000 your brother will accrue = 10k .05 = 500 in interest in total total interest for both of you combined would be 4,500 if you pool your debt snowball then you will clear your debt first so the interest on your debt would be = 20k .1 = 2,000 your brother 's debt would fully accrue 5 of interest on the full balance in year 1 so interest in year 1 would be 20k .05 = 1,000 in year 2 your brother 's debt would be cleared half way through the year interest charged would be = 10k .05 50 = 250 you would then owe your brother 10k which you would pay him over the remainder of year 2 his total interest paid to the bank would be 1,000 + 250 = 1,250 total interest for both of you combined would be   in a simplified payment example using your numbers maximum interest savings would be about $ 1,250 combined how you allocate those savings would be pretty subjective assuming a 50:50 split this yields $ in savings to each of you if you are n't able to each save 20k per year then savings would be greater for snowballing because otherwise it will take you even longer to pay off your high interest debt this is similar to your brother loaning you 20k today that you can use to pay off your debts after which you pay him back so he can pay off his because you will owe him 20k for 2 years but an average of at any one time because he slowly advances it to you today and you slowly pay him back until the end of year 2 at $ 650 in benefit passed to your brother this is roughly equivalent to him loaning you money at 6.5 interest

do n't forget inflation    with a roth 401k or ira you do n't pay any taxes on inflationary or real gains   you pay taxes at the beginning and then no more taxes unless you invest money after you distributed from it    with a regular taxable investment account not a 401k or ira you pay taxes on the initial amount   and then you pay taxes on the gains both inflationary and real   so you effectively pay taxes on the inflated principal twice   once at initial earning and once when it shows up as inflationary gains   i 'll give an example later    with a traditional 401k or ira you pay no taxes on the initial amount   you pay taxes on the distributed amount   that includes taxes on gains but it only taxes them once not twice   all the taxes are paid at distribution time    here 's a example   this is not a real example with real numbers but the numbers should n't be ridiculously off   they could happen   i 'm going to ignore variation and pretend that all the numbers will be the same each year so as to simplify the math    so you pay a 25 marginal tax rate and want to invest $ 12,000 plus any tax savings    roth   $ 12,000 principal traditional ira trad   $ 16,000 principal with $ 4000 in tax savings taxable investment account tia   $ 12,000 principal let 's assume that you make an 8 rate of return and inflation is 3   both numbers are possible although higher and lower numbers have occurred in the past   that gives you returns of $ for the roth and tia cases and a return of $ for the trad case   pay no annual taxes on the roth or trad cases   pay 25 marginal tax on the tia case that 's $ 240    balances after one year    roth   $ trad   $ tia   $ inflation decreases the value of the roth and tia cases by $ 360 in the roth and tia cases   and by $ 480 in the trad case    ten years of inflationary gains cumulative    roth   $ trad   $ tia   $ net buildup including inflationary gains roth   $ trad   $ tia   $ real value minus inflation to maintain spending power    roth   $ trad   $ tia   $ now take out $ 3000 per year after taxes   that 's $ 3000 in the the roth and tia cases as you already paid the taxes   in the trad case that 's $ 4000 because you have to pay 25 tax which will cost $ 1000    do that for five years and the new balances are   roth   $ trad   $ tia   $ the tia will run out in the 8th year   the roth and trad will both run out in the 9th year    so to summarize   the traditional ira initially grows the most   the tia grows the least   the tia is tax advantaged over the traditional ira at that point but it still runs out first   the roth ira grows about the same as the traditional after taxes are included    note that i left out the matching contribution from a 401k   that would help both those options   i assumed that the marginal tax rate would be 25 on the traditional ira distributions   it might be only 15 which would increase the advantage of the traditional ira   i assumed that the 15 rate on capital returns would still be true for the entire period   if that is increased the tia option gets a lot worse    inflation could be higher or lower   as stated earlier the tia account is hit the worst by inflation

ponzi schemes or pyramid schemes are based on paying earlier investors from the money invested by the later ones for ponzi scheme the idea is generally to distribute some high consistent dividend payout based on the inflow of money from new investors as long as new investors are coming the scheme can be sustained for quite some time see the madoff 's example that over decades in the mean time the scheme operator can take some of the investment money to himself legally as fees and salary illegally as the scheme operator does n't actually have to put in any money other than some organizational expenses however at some point the new investors money wo n't be enough to pay all the existing investors inevitably sooner or later since the dividend payout grows with each new investor and there are no infinite exponential amount of new investors to cover for it that 's when the $ + hits the fan and sons of the start ending up hanging from the ceiling pyramid scheme is built on similar idea but the dividend payout varies based on the level of the investor i.e. the investor gets paid based on how many new ones he brought in and how many new ones rooted from them thus the incentive to bring new investors is directly shifted to the investors themselves the here are at the top and get the most payouts from all the rest of the participants they themselves usually put no or very little investment however the end result is the same could n't possibly be enough investors to sustain this model forever and it will inevitably fail at some point when such a scheme fails the paying fund ends up being bankrupt either due to cashflow problems not enough money in to pay money out or because all the money dries out usually both how to detect if the reports are not falsified which in most cases they are you 'll see clearly that there 's no actual investment income in the cash flow but the reports are usually falsified to conceal this exact fact so that 's where the independent auditors and regulatory oversight come in handy generally if an investment fund does n't have a reputable independent auditor stay away

the short answer is that there are no great personal finance programs out there any more in the past i found microsoft money to be slick and feature rich but unfortunately it has been discontinued a few years ago   your choices now are quicken and mint along with the several open source programs that have been listed by others in the past i found the open source programs to be both clunky and not feature complete for my every day use it 's possible they have improved significantly since i had last looked at them the biggest limitation i saw with them is weakness of integration with financial service providers banks credit card companies brokerage accounts etc let 's start with mint mint is a web based tool owned by the same company as quicken whose main feature is its ability to connect to nearly every financial institution you 're likely to use mint aggregates that data for you and presents it on the homepage this makes it very easy to see your net worth and changes to it over time spending trends track your progress on budgets and long term goals etc mint allows you to do all of this with little or no data entry it has support for your investments but does not allow for deep analysis of them quicken is a desktop program it is extremely feature rich in terms of supporting different types of accounts transactions reports reconciliation etc one could use quicken to do everything that i just described about mint but the power of quicken is in its more manual features for example while mint is on showing you your status quicken allows you to enter transactions in real time as you 're writing a check initiating a transfer etc and later them with data from your financial institutions link mint quicken has good integration with financial companies so you can generally get away with as little or as much data entry as you want for example you can manually enter large checks and transfers and later match to automatically downloaded data but allow small entries like credit card purchases to download automatically   bottom line if you 're just looking to keep track of where you are at try mint it 's very simple and free if you need more power and want to manage your finances on a more transactional level try quicken though i believe they do not have a trial version i do n't understand why the learning curve is steep although probably than that of gnucash last note on why mint.com is free it 's the usual ad supported model plus mint sells aggregated consumer behaviour reports to other institutions since mint has everyone 's transactions it can identify consumer trends if you 're not comfortable with that or with the idea of giving a website passwords to all your financial accounts you will find quicken easier to accept hope this helps

one reason is that it is not possible at vanguard and at many other brokerages to auto invest into etfs   because the etf trades like a stock you typically must buy a whole number of shares   this makes it difficult to do auto investing where you invest say a fixed dollar amount each month   if you 're investing $ 100 and the etf trades for $ 30 a share you must either buy 3 shares and leave $ 10 or buy 4 and spend $ 20 more than you planned   this makes auto investing with dollar amounts difficult   it would be cool if there were brokerages that handled this for you for instance by accumulating leftover cash until an additional whole share could be purchased but i do n't know of any a difference of 0.12 in the expense ratios is real but small   it may be outweighed by the psychological gains of being able to adopt a hands off auto investing plan   with etfs you generally must remember to manually buy the shares yourself every so often   for many average investors the advantage of being able to invest without having to think about it at all is worth a small increase in expense ratio   the 0.12 savings do n't do you any good if you never remember to buy shares until the market is already up

fyi prices do n't always go up   inflation is a monetary phenomenon   i 'm simplifying greatly here if more money is printed or the money supply increases through fractional reserve banking and it is chasing the same amount of goods then prices will go up   conversely if money is held constant and the economy becomes more productive producing more goods then a constant amount of money is chasing an increasing amount of goods and prices go down after the civil war the greenback went back to being on a gold standard in   after could be redeemed for gold   gold restricts money growth since it is difficult to obtain here are the price and wage indexes from from here   notice from to that wholesale and consumer prices fall but wages start to increase   imagine your salary staying the same or even increasing but the prices of items falling still do n't think inflation is a monetary phenomenon   here is a cpi chart from 1800 to 2007   notice how the curve starts to go drastically up around 1970   what happen then   the us dollar went off the gold exchange standard and the us dollar became a purely fiat currency backed by nothing but government decree which allows the federal reserve to print money ad

do you have direct deposit of your paycheck if so almost every employer will allow you to split the paycheck into two accounts you could open one account for savings and one for spending put $ x from each paycheck into the savings account and the rest into the spending account keep the savings account totally separate with its own atm card there should be no way to get money out of this account except by using the separate atm card now get a dish of water put the atm card in the dish of water put the dish of water in the freezer   if you are ever tempted to spend your savings you 'll have to wait for the block of ice to hopefully while the ice is the urge to waste money will pass

that depends on your bank my credit union clears intra account transfers immediately the delay therefore is based on bank policy it is possible that in the system the accounts are not really linked and so it treats transfers between accounts that you own and accounts between people the same and further in the case of your bank that they decided to have s one day hold i believe that 'll have heard some banks advertise that you can electronically transfer money to another account holder at the same bank in just 15 min   i would also make sure that you are selecting immediate transfer instead of a future date transfer mine has those as two different options and if you select the other you just select the date of action to be at least one in the future

on top of the given answers the type of referral will also factor in when you 're up for renewal and go to a comparison site in the uk confused and struggle accurately through all their lists of questions you see that some of the data differs e.g. not all the same jobs can be entered if you have had an accident not all ask whose fault it was and/or do n't leave the option not yet resolved forcing you to guess which way it will be and/or what the total repair cost was   so as these feed slightly different data to roughly the same set of insurance providers you will get slightly different quotes on the same providers and expect your own provider to offer a slightly better quote than you 'll get in reality for renewing the 's one time cut has to be still taken off but they count it as a new client so somebody gets a bonus for that you they disregard as a captive client and give what boils down to a loyalty penalty case in point i had an car accident resolved months later in my favour with all honest data including claim and its cost and putting my accident free years factor at 0 instead of 7 my old provider quoted about 8 more than the previous year on comparison sites but my renewal papers quoted me 290 more upon telephone enquiry the promised to refund the difference if court found in my favour though they refused to give this in writing so no thanks then the other set of referrals they get is from you directly going to their website asking for a quote they know what type of link you 've followed banner or google result etc they may know some info from your browser 's cookies time spent where or other tracking service and from your data they may guess how tech savvy and shop wise you are and scale your offer accordingly comparison site shoppers are lumped together at a relatively high savvy level of course companies breaking down your data and their own in a particular way can find advantages and hence offer you better terms as said in the main answer this is like arbitration in stock exchanges ensuring a certain amount of sanity if there 's something to exploit somebody will and everybody will follow it may be that they find a certain group of people maybe more accident prone but cheaper to deal with more flexible in repair times or easy to bully in accepting shared fault when they were n't at fault or they want a certain client for women for civil servants for drivers for homeowners often for cross selling other insurance services or they claim to want pensioners because the company can offer them a familiar voice same account manager always contacting them while they 're easier to and less likely to shop around when offered a rubbish deal also 100 straight comparison of competing offers is n't possible as the fine details of the t&cs terms conditions would differ as well as various little in the claims handling process   and depreciation of a car and various ways of dealing with it you insure it for the buying prices but two years later it 's worth about 40 less on paper so in case of total loss replacing like for like will cost you still at least 80 of the value for which you 've been insuring it while they 'll probably offer you the 100 60 mostly because instead of your trusted car you have something unknown that may have hidden defects or been mistreated and about to die case in point my old dealer bought car 's died just outside the warranty period notwithstanding its inspection you can rely on in the end the national brand agreed to refund the parts 15 of what i paid for the car but not the labour a few hours and any car model 's value differs in descending order from its price private selling price part exchange price and auction price depending on your may happily insure you for price = what you paid to dealer but then point out that the value of that car is the theoretical p x value i.e. the car without anybody 's profit far less than you 've been paying for conversely if you crash it after insuring below market value they can pay you your stupidly low figure

it is not right to force people to buy any product or service period do you see how wrong this is i 'd wager that you and i both agree that getting health insurance is a responsible thing to do ok good but i do not agree that anyone should be forced to buy anything this is tyranny   regardless of what is responsible or not the government or anyone else for that matter has no right to force you to buy anything just for the simple fact that you breathe air obama signed into law a tax on all living people with the signing of obamacare so because you 're alive you are slapped with a tax until the day you die it 's a complete this mandate is just one of the terrible things about obamacare imagine what we could be forced to buy next the federal government forcing us to go to college or perhaps the federal government forcing all employers to employ no less than 20 people or maybe they want everyone to buy cable mandating that anyone buy anything is not right in the least and there is much more wrong with obamacare than just the mandate and these other points i made   forcing insurance companies to cover pre existing pe conditions without being able to charge more is another blow to our liberty and freedom when the government mandates that insurance companies must cover pre existing conditions and must do so without charging more you leave the door open for consumers to abuse this system obama effectively gave people the option to get insurance after they get sick without consequence of higher prices that is by definition not insurance and then when that person is no longer sick they can hop off their plan do you understand the economic effect of this this is the reason why insurance premiums are skyrocketing when someone hops on with a pe condition and then hops off during open enrollment that person is paying $ 100 for $ 1,000 worth of medical care my numbers of fictitious but the concept remains the same imagine if you had a business where customers paid a monthly fee of $ 50 so that at any time they may withdraw $ 1,200 when they needed it well the federal government decides to pass a law that says you can not deny people that do n't have a monthly subscription and need immediate financing and now people can come in and give you $ 100 and in return you give them $ 1,000 your business would be an epic fail except you did two things to combat this new law 1 you raised your customers monthly subscriptions from $ 50 to $ 75 and 2 you now require that monthly customers pay a $ 25 deductible before they are allowed to have their $ 1,200 as a business person these changes were necessary because you were not allowed to deny walk in customers that were exchanging their $ 100 for your $ 1,000 this is how obamacare is affecting the insurance market insurance companies have to find a way to not lose money raising premiums and deductibles for paying customers is the only way to do it   in a perfect world everyone buys health insurance before they are sick and despite the fact that we do n't live in a perfect world there were still ways to get health insurance and i 'm talking pre obamacare if you did n't have it before getting sick you could have gotten a job that offered medical coverage in a group insurance plan these plans always covered pe conditions these plans are still required to cover pe conditions   i am not a bad person i 'm not greedy either i believe in social support system for those that truly need it sometimes people are born into bad situations or sometimes people can slip up and hit some bad luck i am more than fine with helping those people out but when the government puts their hands too deep into my pockets it is n't just money they are grabbing i spend over 40 hours a week at a job that job is where i obviously make my money time is money and so when the government is constantly creating new welfare programs the government is taking time from my life this is time that i want to spend with my friends wife mother father sister and daughter time is limited for everyone and i want my time outside of my 40 hours at work that is my right that is all of our rights   you know even the crazy socialist bernie sanders says that those people that work 40 hours a week deserve to make a living wage well if companies were n't regulated so much we 'd sure as hell have more money in our pockets less government regulations means more competition more availability more choices and better prices look at the grocery store industry i do n't know the proper industry term we have shop rite acme whole foods publix wegmans 's costco traders joe 's and so many more look at how stocked our supermarket shelves are all the time the only shortages that ever happen are when forecasts call for and all the ice melt is gone other than that shelves are stocked food is fresh and prices are excellent and you do n't have just one brand of sliced bread or a single brand of peanut butter or regular butter or lettuce or soup meats on and on and on you have many brands for many products we have 13 different kinds of milk in our grocery stores milk soy milk whole milk 1 2 organic milk organic 1 the government did n't do any of this people did smart hard working people did this there is a market of consumers that want that stuff and people made business to supply the demand this is how things work this is why we are the greatest country on this planet in the history of this world   running water in your home central air life saving surgery drugs and physical therapy being able to turn on

reading and analyzing financial statements is one of the most important tasks of equity analysts which look at a company from a fundamental perspective   however analyzing a company and its financial statements is much more than just reading the absolute dollar figures provided in financial statements you need to calculate financial ratios which can be compared over multiple periods and companies to be able to gauge the development of a company over time and compare it to its competitors for instance for an equity analyst the absolute dollar figures of a company 's operating profit is less important than the ratio of the operating profit to revenue which is called the operating margin   another very important figure is free cash flow which can be set in relation to sales (= free cash flow sales   the following working capital related metrics can be used as a health check for a company and give you early warning signs when they deviate too much you can either calculate those metrics yourself using a spreadsheet e.g. excel or use a professional solution e.g. bloomberg professional reuters or worldcap

creating a corporation is not necessarily less taxes in fact you 'll face the problem of double taxation and since you must pay yourself a reasonable salary if your corporation does n't earn much to give you as dividend after the salary and/or your tax bracket is low you 'll in fact may end up paying more taxes also there 's a lot of bureaucracy involved in managing a corporation liability on the other hand is important and what 's more important is asset separation and limiting the liability to the corporation assets keeping your personal assets safe to achieve that you do n't have to create a corporation but you can create a limited liability company llc llc are disregarded entities for tax purposes i.e. you wo n't have to pay taxes twice only once as a sole proprietor partner but provide the liability limitation and asset separation llc 's are much less formal and require much less paperwork reducing the risk of corporate veil piercing because of non compliance i myself decided to manage my investments through llc 's for that very reason asset separation

bond mf etf comes in many flavour one way to look at them is corporate govt gilt money market short term overnight lending etc govt backed bonds the etf that invest money in these are also different types one way to evaluate an etf mf is to see where they invest your money corporate debts are by the highest coupon paying bonds however the chance of default is also greater if you wish to invest in these it is preferable to look at the etf mf 's debt portfolio financial ratings etc govt bonds are more stable and unless the govt defaults which happens more often than we would like to think here also look for higher rating bonds portfolio that the fund scheme carries the govt backed bonds are somewhat similar to bonds however these are by institutions which are backed by govt e.g. national railways municipal bodies etc any fund scheme that invests in these bonds could also be considered and similarly measured the last are the short term money market related which provides the least return but are very liquid it is very difficult to answer how you should invest large sum on etf that are bond oriented however from any investment perspective it is better to spread your money if i take your case of i would divide it into pieces and invest in 10 different etf mf schemes of different flavour hope this helps

gt it 's been years since my finance classes but it seems to me the best course of action after selling the property and paying corporate taxes would be to reinvest the money at the corporate level to then pay out dividends rather than pay each of the 3 shareholders out and have us then pay personal tax on a large amount   full disclaimer no one here is or is acting in capacity as a tax accountant or lawyer    my understanding is as follows assuming you 're in the us   1 the c corp owns the property if you sell the property the corporation will receive the proceeds of that sale if a capital gain is recognized the corporation will pay the appropriate tax rate that rate is apparently the same as normal income    2 if you then issue a dividend with the proceeds of that sale you are actually not reinvesting the proceeds you 're distributing them to shareholders shareholders will then need to pay tax on the dividends at their personal rates as income   if you reinvest the cash it will stay in the business it will not go directly to shareholders the cash will need to be invested somewhere else within the company you will get hit with taxes regardless at least once if you distribute to shareholders those proceeds will be taxed twice    example   both cases   sale proceeds $ 100   less corporate tax of 35 $ 35   after tax proceeds $ 65     if distributed   distributed to shareholders $ 65   less income taxes at 25 $   after tax distribution to shareholders $     if retained   no distributions   retained earnings + $ 65   cash + $ 65   book value of equity + $ 65   shareholder wealth increase $ 65

when property changes hands the sale prices may or may not be used to determine the appraised value of the property and they may or may not be used to determine the appraised value of other properties because of the nature of the transaction you already have an existing business relationship the local government is likely to ignore the data point provided by your transaction when determining values of similar properties they have no idea if there was some other factor used to determine the price they will also not include in the calculation transactions that are a result of foreclosure becasue the target price is the loan value not the true value   california and some other jurisdictions do add another wrinkle you will need to determine if the transaction will trigger a of the property value in some states the existing laws of the state limited the annual growth of the assessment but that could now be recaptured if the jurisdiction rules that this is a new ownership california board of equalization change in ownership frequently asked questions how does a change in ownership affect property taxes each county assessor 's office reviews all recorded deeds for that    county to determine which properties require under the    law the county assessors may also discover changes in ownership    through other means such as taxpayer self reporting field    inspections review of building permits and newspapers once the    county assessor has determined that a change in ownership has    occurred proposition 13 requires the county assessor to reassess the    property to its current fair market value as of the date ownership    changed since property taxes are based on the assessed value of a property at    the time of acquisition a current market value that is higher than    the previously assessed proposition 13 adjusted base year value will    increase the property taxes conversely if the current market value    is lower than the previously assessed proposition 13 adjusted base    year value then the property taxes on that property will decrease only that portion of the property that changes ownership however is    subject to for example if 50 percent of the property is    transferred the assessor will reassess only 50 percent of the    property at its current fair market value as of the date of the    transfer and deduct 50 percent from any existing proposition 13 base    year value in most cases when a person buys a residence the entire    property a change in ownership and 100 percent of the    property is to its current market value

great work so far and good question   i think a lot of it depends on how risky your financial life is    for example lets say that you are working a temp or contract job that ends in 3 months   that is also the same month your savings and student loan will be equal   i think most would agree that it would be foolish to empty out your savings in such a risky month    now same situation one month later   the company you were working for takes you on as a full time employee   i would go ahead and empty out my savings and make the student loan go away    there could be other risks to consider like needing a different car moving to a new place potential medical bills or a needing to travel   anything like that on the horizon i would hold off out my savings   however once it is smooth sailing go for it being debt free is wonderful and it is a worthy goal

my recommendation is to pay off your student loans as quickly as possible it sounds like you 're already doing this but do n't incur any other large debts until you have this taken care of   i 'd also recommend not buying a car especially an expensive one on credit or lease either back during the dotcom boom i and many friends bought or leased expensive cars only to lose them or struggle paying for them when the bottom dropped out a car instantly depreciates and it 's quite rare for them to ever gain value again stick with reliable older used cars that you can purchase for cash if you do borrow for a car shop around for the best deal and avoid 3 + year terms if at all possible do n't lease unless you have a business structure where this might create a clear financial advantage avoid credit cards as much as possible although if you do plan to buy a house with a mortgage you 'll need to maintain some credit history if you have the discipline to keep your balance small and paid down you can use a credit card to build credit history however these things can quickly get out of hand and you 'll wonder why you suddenly owe $ 10 k $ 20 k or even more on them so be very careful with them as for the house speaking of us markets here save up for at least a 20 down payment if you can based on what you said this would be about $ 20 25k. this will give you a lot more flexibility to take advantage of deals that might come your way even if you do n't put it all into the house stretching to buy a house that 's too expensive can quickly lead to financial ruin as for house size i recommend purchasing a 4 bedroom house even if you are n't planning on kids right away it will resell better and you 'll appreciate having the extra space for storage home office hobbies etc also life has a way of changing your plans for having kids and such

first let 's define some terms your accrued benefit is a monthly benefit payable at your normal retirement age usually 65 it is usually a life only benefit but may have a number of years guaranteed or may have a survivor piece it is defined by a plan formula ie it is a defined benefit a lump sum is how much that accrued benefit is worth right now lump sums are based on applicable interest rates and mortality tables specified by the irs interest rates are released monthly mortality annually your plan can either use the same interest rates for a whole year or they can use new ones each month affecting your lump sum is whether your accrued benefit is payable now immediately you are age 65 or later deferred you are now age 30 for example instead of being paid an annuity assume you are paid just one payment of $ 1,000 on your birthday the lump sum of that for a 65 year old would be $ 1,000 since there would be no interest discount and no chance of dying before payment for a 30 year old at 4 interest the lump sum would be about $ 237 including mortality discount at age 36 the lump sum is $ so the lump sum will get bigger just because you get older very important is the interest discount at age 30 in the example 2 interest would produce a $ lump sum and at 6 $ the bigger the rate the smaller the lump sum because interest helps an amount now grow bigger in the future to complicate things since 2008 the irs bases lump sums on 3 different interest rates the annuity payments made within 5 years of the lump sum date use the 1st rate past 5 and within 20 years use the 2nd rate and past that use the 3rd rate since you are age 30 all of your monthly annuity payments would be made after 20 years so that makes it simple since we 'll only have to look at the 3rd rate when you reach age 45 the 2nd rate will kick in here is the table of interest rates published by the irs you 'll find your rates above on the 2013 line for that means your lump sum is being made in 2013 and it is being based on the month august 2012 most likely your plan will use the same rates for its entire plan year but what is your plan year if it is the calendar year then you would have a 5 month for the rates but if is a september to august plan year with a 1 month the rates would have changed between august and september your august lump sum would be based on your september on would be based on see the all line for for comparison a 30 year old with a $ 100 annuity payable at age 65 would have a lump sum value of $ at but a lump sum value of $ at the change in your accrued benefit by month will obviously have some impact on the lump sum value but not as much as the change in interest rates if there is one the amount they actually contribute to the plan has nothing to do with the value of the lump sum though

a lot of there e.g. comfortable selection bias etc but regardless this is a bit of a strawman i 'm not at all arguing that success is n't correlated with effort it 's a question of the degree of correlation and the amount of attribution i 'm in a engineering startup myself and i would hardly be motivated in any commercial endeavor if i believed there was n't a correlation between effort and outcome   i would actually grant you that engineering is probably one of the better examples of meritocracy out there today but there 's a lot of caveats to that and many engineers i know in large corporate environments are an underclass to much less technical much less hard working superiors    and from personal experience high level academia breaks down rapidly beyond the undergraduate level

the best way to save on clothes is up to you   i have friends who save all year for two yearly shopping trips to update anything that may need updating at the time   by allowing themselves only two trips they control the money spent   bring it in cash and stop buying when you run out on the other hand in my family we shop sales   when we determine that we need something we wait until we find a sale   when we see an exceptionally good sale on something we know we will need basic work dress shoes for example we 'll purchase it and save it until the existing item it is replacing has worn out   our strategy is to know what we need and buy it when the price is right   we tend to wait on anything that is n't on sale until we can find the right item at a price we like which sometimes means stretching the existing piece of clothing it is replacing until well after its prime if you 've got a list you 're shopping from you know what you need   the question becomes how will you control your spending best   carefully shopping sales and using coupons or budgeting for a spree within limits

patrick ceo of ran a somewhat interesting website awhile back called deep capture which focused heavily on naked short selling and bear raids he was called all sorts of names and many serious journalist types his allegations off    his basic argument was that a cabal of hedge funds would simultaneously naked short a specific equity and then a coordinated group of journalists and message board would the company as loudly and publicly as possible driving the price down naked shorting is supposed to be illegal since you can hold the types of positions like in the linked article about citigroup where the number of shares sold short actually exceeds the number of shares in existence   the group he named was essentially a who 's who of hedge funds and fraudsters and included many names of prominent politically active reformed criminals from the days on wall st. i ca n't remember how the cards fell but the scheme allegedly involved michael sam from crazy eddie 's fraud gary weiss jim cramer etc etc    it was a fascinating story    actually followed through with several lawsuits one of which was settled after a partners paid $ 5 million dollars to settle    the deep capture site is down but i found a decent that sums up some of the shenanigans including a journalist sock to edit wikipedia repeatedly denying it being ip traced to inside the building the wall st. entity responsible for clearing trades including naked shorts

ca n't totally agree with that volatility trading is just one trading type of many in my opinion it does n't depend on whether you are a professional trader or not   as you might have heard retail traders are said to create noise on the market mainly due to the fact that they are n't professional in their majority so i would assume if an average retail trader decided to trade volatility he would create as much noise as if would have been betting on stock directions basically most types of trading would require a considerable amount of effort spent on fundamental analysis of the underlying be it volatility or directional trading arbitrage trading would be an exception here i guess however volatility trading relies more on trader 's subjective expectations about future deviations whereas trading stock directions requires deeper research of the underlying is it a drawback or an advantage on the other hand side volatility trading strategies cover both upward and downward movements but you can set similar hedging strategies when going short or long on stocks is n't it to i think it is a matter of preference imagine yourself going long on s&p500 since 2009 do you think there are many volatility traders who have outperformed that

ok you 're looking at this in a very confusing way first as said by the dividend yield is the dividends paid in the year as a percent of the stock price given this fact then if the stock price moves down and the dividend stays the same then the yield increases company 's do n't usually pay out on a yield basis that 's mostly just a calculation to measure how strong a dividend is this could mean either a. the stock is underpriced and will rise which will lower the yield to a more normal level or b. the company is not doing as well and eventually the dividends will decrease to a point where the yield again looks more normal    second off let 's look at it in a more realistic way that still takes into account your assumptions   year 1 1 instead of assuming buying 35 let 's put this into a share amount let 's say there are 1,000,000 shares so you just bought 350k shares for $ 700k you paid a price of $ 2/share let 's assume the market decides that 's a fair price and it stays that way through the end of year 1 this gives us a market capitalization of $ 2 million   2 the dividend paid out at year 1 is $ 60k so you could calculate on a per share basis which would be a dividend of $ 60k 1 million shares or a $ 0.06 dividend per share our stock price is still at $ 2.00 so our yield comes out to $ 0.06 $ 2.00 or 3.0   year 2 assuming no additional shares issued there are still a total of 1 million shares outstanding you owned 350k and now want to purchase another 50k 5 of outstanding share float the market price you are able to purchase the 50k shares at has now changed which means that share price is now valued at $ 1.50 share we have a dividend paid out at $ 100k which comes out to a dividend per share of $ 0.10 we have a share value of $ 1.50 and the $ 0.10 dividend per share giving us a new yield of    conclusion there are many factors that can cause a company 's stock price to fluctuate some of it is hype based but some of it is a result of material changes in your case the stock went down 25 in most scenarios where a stock would have that much decline it would likely either not have been paying a dividend in the first place or would maybe not be paying one for much longer most companies that pay dividends are larger and more mature companies with a steady healthy and predictable cash flow also most companies that are that size would not trade a stock under $ 3.00 i know this is just an example but the scenario is definitely a bit extreme in terms of the price drop and dividend increase again the yield is just a calculation that depends on the dividend that is usually planned in advance and the stock price that can fluctuate for many reasons i hope this made everything more clear and let me know if you have any other questions

my buddy was recruited hard by mckinsey and i use him as a reference point whenever someone asks because they want him so badly   briefly he 's a physicist and we did grad school together in london i in neuroscience   he later went on to cambridge to do a course called part iii which some consider the hardest math course in the world   afterward he went on to do a phd in theoretical particle physics but went to a recruiting session just on a whim   we talked about this at length   mckinsey likes people who have extremely strong analytical and math skills but not necessarily from a finance background   they like this because you do n't use most of what you learn in school with respect to economics or finance but you do use lots of math and you do use lots of logic   basically they 're looking for people that really good investors look for people who are academic   you do not need to transfer   you should not actually because you 're going into junior year and have a good gpa   what you should do instead is try to do a   plan for it now   you can apply for a marshall too   and a   you want your resume to look like you 're someone that should n't be ignored

a derivative contract can be an option and you can take a short sell position much the same way you would in a stock when buying options you risk only the money you put in however when selling do n't have the securities or cash to cover all potential losses options you are borrowing brokers force you to maintain a required amount of cash called a maintenance requirement when selling naked calls theoretically you are able to lose an infinite amount of money so in order to sell this type of options you have to maintain a certain level of cash in your account if you fail to maintain this level you will enter into what s often referred to as a margin call and yes they will call your phone and tell you your broker has the right to liquidate your positions in order to meet requirements ps from experience my broker has never liquidated any of my holdings but then again i 've never been in a margin call for longer then a few days and never with a severe amount the margin requirement for investors is regulated and brokers follow these regulations

large companies whose shares i was looking at had dividends of the order of ~1 2 such as or 1.2 or some such my savings account provides me with an annual return of 4 as interest firstly inflation interest increases the numeric value of your bank balance but inflation reduces what that means in real terms from a quick google it looks like inflation in india is currently 6 so your savings account is losing 2 in real terms on the other hand you would expect a stable company to maintain a similar value in real terms so the dividend can be seen as real terms income secondly investors generally hope that their companies will not merely be stable but grow in value over time whether that hope is rational is another question   why not just invest in options instead for higher potential profits it 's possible to make a lot of money this way it 's also possible to lose a lot of money this way if your of money is so poor you do n't even understand why people buy stocks there is no way you should be going near the more complicated financial products

there are 2 basic ways to have someone buy partial ownership of your company or if they buy shares that you already own then their shares will have the same rights as yours same voting rights same dividend rights etc if they buy shares newly created from the company they could be either identical shares to what you already own or they could be a new class of shares you may need to adjust the articles of incorporation if you did not plan ahead with multiple share classes you really need to talk to a lawyer tax accountant about this there are a lot of questions you need to consider here for example do you want to use the money in the business or would you rather have it personally are you concerned about losing some control of how the business is run what are the short term and long term tax consequences of each method what does your new partner want in terms of their share class the answers to these questions will be highly valuable and likely worth much more than the fees you will need to pay at the very least you will likely need a lawyer and accountant anyway to ensure the filings taxes are done correctly so better to involve them now rather than later there are many other situations to consider here and an online forum is not the best place to get advice that might put you in a sticky legal situation later on

you are not perfectly clear but i will assume that your ex girlfriend owns the car and that her name is the only one on the title the fact that you paid off the loan and repaired the car is completely irrelevant from a court 's point of view you gifted the car to your girlfriend if you are listed on the title then your best move is to steal the car and hide it so she ca n't steal it back note that you are not actually stealing it if you are listed on the title since you own the car try to steal it when it is parked in some public place avoid going onto her property wait until she gets hungry then offer her $ 500 if she agrees to remove her name from the title by the way after you steal the car send a certified letter to her informing her that you have possession of the car this is so that she has no grounds to report it stolen check with the police periodically to make sure she does n't report it stolen anyway if she reports it stolen after you have notified her that you have possession then it is a crime making a false report

why do people keep talking about 401 k 's at work   that is not dollar cost averaging   dca refers to when you have a large sum of money   do you invest it all at once or spread it out over several smaller purchases over a period of time   there really is n't a when should i use it   it is simply a matter of where your preferences lie on the risk reward   dca has lower risk and lower reward than lump sum investing   in my opinion i do n't like it   dca only works better than lump sum investing if the price drops   but if you think the price is going to drop why are you buying the stock in the first place example your uncle wins the lottery and gives you $ 50,000   do you buy $ 50,000 worth of apple now or do you buy $ 10,000 now and $ 10,000 a quarter for the next four quarters if the stock goes up you will make more with lump than you will with dca if the stock goes down you will lose more with ls than you will with dca if the stock goes up then down you will lose more with dca than you will with ls if the stock goes down then up you will make more with dca than you will with ls so it 's a tradeoff   but like i said the whole point of you buying the stock is that you think it 's going to go up so why pick the strategy that performs worse in that scenario

this is going to depend on the tax jurisdiction and i have no knowledge of the rules in illinois   but i 'd like to give you some direction about how to think about this    the biggest problem that you might hit is that if you collect a single check and then distribute to the tutors you may be considered their employer   as an employer you would be responsible for things like   this is not meant as an exhaustive list    even if not an employer you are still paying them   you would be responsible for issuing 1099 forms to anyone who goes above $ 600 for the year source    you would need to file for a taxpayer identification number for your organization as it is acting as a business   you need to give this number to the school so that they can issue the correct form to you   you might have to register a doing business as name   it 's conceivable that you could get away with having the school write the check to you as an individual   but if you do that it will show up as income on your taxes and you will have to deduct payments to the other tutors    if the organization already has a separate tax identity then you could use that   note that the organization will be responsible for paying income tax   it should be able to deduct payments to the tutors as well as marketing expenses etc    if the school will go for it consider structuring things with a payment to your organization for your organization duties   then you tell the school how much to pay each tutor   you would be responsible for giving the school the necessary information like name address social security number and cost or possibly hours worked

it 's only a loss if you believe the purpose of indexes is to represent the basket of underlying companies with the highest returns   but that 's simply not true   an index is just a rules based way to track measure a thing   that thing could be the largest us companies all the companies in a specific sector all of the companies in the world a commodity or basket of commodities pretty much anything   somebody just has to write down the explanation of what an index tracks then create etfs to track the index   by being a passive investor you are still making active investing decisions to some degree in that you need to decide which indexes to passively invest in   if people are not going to attempt to understand the companies they invest in because they 're almost certainly better off indexing which is fine then the responsibility must fall on someone to make decisions about what are the best rules for the indexes   for most of the history of capital markets good corporate governance has been enforced by shareholders   if management did something bad shareholders could vote to replace the board of directors and in general they had tools to hold management accountable   only in recent years founders of companies like google facebook snap etc have attempted to this relationship public shareholders give a company money and in return the company must answer to the shareholders and essentially take money for nothing   so far it 's still a pretty short experiment this has worked as long as the share price is going up but what happens when it does n't   what happens when these companies screw up and stop performing well and there 's nothing shareholders can do about it   investors who intentionally own individual shares will have little to no leverage to demand change and passive investors would be stuck with some of their money in these companies with terrible governance and the precedent would only make dual class and non voting shares more attractive for future ipos making the problem more prevalent   if you think it is in your best interest to own the entire s&amp;p 500 plus snap then just do that   for every dollar you invest into spdr or something similar allocate something like $ 0.01 into snap   it 's that simple   but do n't make this out to be a story about how s&amp;p is anti free markets or doing a disservice to investors   that 's ridiculous   if most americans are just going to blindly put their retirement savings into index funds without bothering to understand them again which is fine then somebody needs to make sure the companies in said indexes are good companies   historically a company with zero corporate governance and entrenched management = /= a good company   s&amp;p realized this and decided to set a good precedent for us equity markets rather than a very bad precedent   you wanna buy shares with no voting rights   go for it   but that should be your decision not a default inclusion in major indexes

i think this question is very nearly off topic for this site but i also believe that a basic understanding of the why the tax structure is what it is can help someone new to investing to understand their actual tax liability the attempt at an answer i provide below is from a canadian us context but should be similar to how this is viewed elsewhere in the world first note that capital gains today are much more fluid in concept than even 100 years ago when the personal income tax was first introduced to pay for wwi a capital gain was viewed as a very deliberate action the permanent sale of property capital gains were not taxed at all initially in canada until 1971 under the view that income taxes would have been paid on income earning assets all along through interest dividends and rent and therefore taxing capital gains would be a form of double taxation this active permanent sale was also viewed as an action that an investor would need to work for therefore it was seen as foolish to prevent investors from taking positive economic action redistributing their capital in the most effective way simply to avoid the tax however today because of favourable taxation on capital gains many financial products attempt to package and sell capital gains to investors for example many canadian mutual funds buy and sell investments to earn capital gains and distribute those capital gains to the owners of the mutual fund this is no longer an active action taken by the investor it is simply a function of passive investing the line between what is a dividend and what is a capital gain has been blurred by these and similar advanced financial products to the casual investor there is no practical difference between receiving dividends or capital gain distributions except for the tax impact the notional gain realized on the sale of property includes inflation consider a rental property bought in 1930 for $ 100,000 and sold in 1960 for $ 180,000 assuming inflation between 1930 and 1960 was 70 in 1960 dollars the property was effectively bought for this means the true gain after accounting for inflation is only $ 10k but the notional gain is $ 80k meaning a tax on that capital gain would be almost entirely a tax on inflation this is viewed by many as being unfair as it does not actually represent true income i will pause to note that any tax on any investment at all taxes inflation interest for example is taxed in full even though it can be almost entirely inflationary depending on economic conditions a tax on capital gains may restrict market liquidity a key difference between capital gains and interest rent dividends is that other forms of investment income are taxed annually if you hold a bond you get taxed on interest from that bond you can not gain value from a bond deferring tax until the date it matures at least in canada you are deemed to accrue bond interest annually even if it is a 0 coupon bond   however what if interest rates have gone down increasing the value of your bond and you want to sell it to invest in a business you may choose not to do this to avoid tax on that capital gain if it were taxed as much as regular income you might be even more inclined to never sell any asset until you absolutely have to thus restricting the flow of capital in the market i will pause here again to note that laws could be enacted to minimize capital gains tax as long as the money is reinvested immediately thus reducing this impact   political inertia lobbying from key interests has a significant impact on the tax structure for investments the fact remains that the capital gains tax is most significantly an impact on those with accrued wealth it would take significant public support to increase capital gain tax rates for any political party to enact such laws when you get right down to it tax laws are complex and hard to push in the public eye the general public barely understands that their effective tax rate is far lower than their top marginal tax rate any tax increases at all are often viewed negatively even by those who would never personally pay any of that tax due to lack of investment income therefore such changes are typically made quietly and with some level of bi partisan support if you feel the capital gains tax rules are illogical just add it to the pile of such tax laws that exist today

they work within the system you guys created your desire for heavily regulated everything leads to some really fucked up incentives these guys have no need to please the consumer they only have to please the government they do n't have to worry about competition because the barriers to entry are so incredibly high that a good alternative has nearly zero chance of entering the market to compete with better service then you guys come along and go see i told you the market does n't work lets regulate it some more in response to that these massive corporations that i assure you i hate just as much respond by merging to fight off the threat 's the threats being both the customer and the government but only one of those can actually put them out of business the guys who regulate them because they have made the rest of us a captive audience through regulatory control    all these regulations have accomplished is to put the smaller businesses who support the majority of real people and jobs out of business   leaving government jobs like the military or positions that extract money from the populace like police organizations have become they are so focused on making money and property now that they are killing citizens left right and center while avoiding real police work because it does n't pay the bills so to speak but maybe more of the same will be the solution to the problem but i highly doubt it   you should actually listen to those video 's i suggested and you likely ignored i want the same things i just want far more options without having to become a drone i own myself i can not support a system which allows others to dominate me for the good of all this utopian dream where people think they run the government and that the government is accountable to the people is honestly a fairy tale at best everytime power is concentrated it will be corrupted it is inevitable and dangerous to think differently if you can honestly look at your government and feel like you control it then you have far more faith than i do and many others do there is no such thing as a one size fits all solution to any problem we need many ideas with many solutions and the right to choose the ones that best fit us and are within our means your rights end where my rights begin if that ca nt be sacred then it can be turned on you just as easily as it is turned onto the people you want to control forced socialism is a sentence not a solution figure out how to make it voluntary then i might sign up

there is a lot misinformation in this thread that i 'd like to clear up in fact you 're more than welcomed to pm me if you wish to see any backup to the statements i 'm about to make    first i 'd like to say that as an uber lyft driver the experience has been nothing short of i normally work in the l.a. and areas of so cal and the amount of interesting super successful and wonderful people i meet on a daily basis is off the charts it 's as if i 'm some sort of talk show host on wheels    initially i applied for lyft as the social and community angle of its service intrigued the hell out of me i 'm an outgoing guy and i 'm also an artist of some type who receives a royalty check only once a month instead of doing and begging for money i thought doing lyft would be a great idea instead so far my customers have been nothing short of an inspiration anyway after passing a background check a driving test with my mentor a driving record check alongside submitting all my documentation license registration insurance and a quick vehicle inspection my car is rather new and in great condition i was hired quickly    that same day i decided to get to work quickly see how the whole system works as soon as i got to the destination i wanted to get to i got my first call on my phone within 5 minutes i use my gps and rush to pick my customer up while obeying all traffic laws of course after a couple of minutes of chit chat i come to find out my first lyft customer ever is an uber recruiter she likes my car and my approach so she hands me a uber black bag with an iphone a car charger and a mount i asked her if this means i have to work exclusively for uber she says nope   my eyes then light up like some medieval lights in the sky chicken little for the ancient aliens approved phenomena when i realize i 'll have access to both customer bases just one week removed from not being able to pay my phone bill    after submitting a background check a driving record check and pretty much all the stuff lyft asked for i was driving for both uber and lyft a week after i was hired for lyft    the good news for you the consumer is that both companies are being cut throat because they want your money there 's never been a better time to hitch a ride on the cheap both companies have thrown millions of dollars over the past couple of months through social media   driver bonuses and other venues so you 're able to get a free ride or a deep discount off a long ride   if you have n't tried both services now 's the time do n't want to risk getting a dui just for driving down a couple of blocks to your favorite bar this weekend you 'll probably be able to get a free ride there if you gently for specials and pay between $ 7 13 for the trip back better than getting your car losing your license and paying $ 10,000 + in penalties and court fees eh you have no idea how many poor i take to and from work who ca n't drive because they just got a and who are now $ 25 35 per ride just to get to where they got ta go      insurance   as for insurance both companies have given me supplemental insurance i have full coverage on my car for when i 'm off the clock which was required at time of hiring btw so here 's how the insurance for lyft and uber works    for    when app is turned on on the way to pick up client contingent liability    1 up to $ 50k person bodily injury   1 up to $ 100k accident bodily injury   1 up to $ 25k accident property damage    when you pick up in the car and you 're on your way to the destination    excessive liability amp um   1 up to $   contingent collision amp comprehensive    1 up to $   $ 2500 deductible    for    when app is turned on on the way to pick up client contingent liability   1 up to $ 50k person bodily injury 1 up to $ 100k accident bodily injury 1 up to $ 25k accident property damage    when you pick up in the car and you 're on your way to the destination   excessive liability amp um   up to $   contingent collision amp comprehensive   up to $ $ 1000 deductible   other than the deductible as you can see both plans are pretty much the same which in my opinion should be more than enough    services amp expectations   both apps are easy to use and within 5 10 minutes sometimes much sooner there 've been many times where i get a call and the customer is on the sidewalk a few feet from where i was parked waiting for my next call both passengers and drivers adhere to a rating system as of today if either driver or passenger fail to maintain a rating of 4.6 and above they risk being booted from using the app so it 's important that drivers know what the hell they are doing like being courteous respectful professional clean and know how to use a gps while driving accurately and safely and/or knowing their routes and passengers should also be polite respectful very important since drivers are n't also do n't be so drunk that you either pass out or throw up in the back and make sure that if your bring your friends along for the ride that they adhere to the code of conduct expected of passengers i 've run into numerous instances where an otherwise perfect passenger gets dinged for their drunk and/or rude friends     also as a driver for your insurance to work do n't ever end a drive early because you made a wrong turn or were late for a pick up you 're risking an insurance hiccup in the event of an incident and passengers should also make sure that their driver has their app online throughout the entire trip as well as making sure the driver 's pic of him her and his her car match the profile you see on the app    as for safety i 've yet to hear from a passenger they felt they were ever in immediate danger did they get a creepy vibe from one of their drivers sure not everyone is a social butterfly and there has been an of ex cab drivers going over to uber which is good cause the service is getting pro drivers with experience but could prove detrimental since they 're gon na have a hard time competing with lyft on the charisma side of things    however i 've already numerous accounts from young women in hollywood who are now refusing to call for a yellow cab or taxis on hollywood blvd and sunset and the surrounding areas due to unwelcome sexual advances by drivers looking to take advantage of their sometimes solitary and drive home it 's and great to hear whenever you drop one of these young women off at their places and they thank you for being both professional courteous welcoming and above all else trustworthy all while paying a fraction of the cost of what a cab would normally run at that time of night    my personal experience in summary   i 'm literally having the time of my life my other job requires me to interact with humanity pick its brain and then express those experiences to everyone else in an positive and inspirational manner what better way to do it while earning some decent money than driving around for uber and lyft    these services are without a doubt revolutionary and are being used and employed by both young and old men and women struggling students and strategically utilized by incredibly wealthy and successful hollywood types and investment bankers it 's cheap reliable and very fun too it 's also bringing back the long lost art of human interaction and conversation back into our daily lives    so far so good and it breaks my heart whenever i hear misinformation and astroturfing about these services throughout the internet and i 'm supremely as to how certain municipalities are colluding with taxi cab lobbies to prevent uber and lyft and other ride share services from competing fairly at a time where cities are desperate to ease reduce dui 's and make sure their citizens are happy and are left with more money in their

you 're interpreting this correctly furthermore if your total tax liability is less than $ 1000 you can not pay estimates at all just pay at the tax day see this safe harbor rule in the irs publication 17 general rule     in most cases you must pay estimated tax for 2016 if    both of the following apply you expect to owe at least $ 1,000 in tax for 2016 after subtracting your withholding and refundable credits you expect your withholding plus your refundable credits to be less than the smaller of 90 of the tax to be shown on your 2016 tax return or 100 of the tax shown on your 2015 tax return but see special rules for farmers fishermen and higher income taxpayers later    your 2015 tax return must cover all 12 months

unfortunately the thieves do n't have to be all that sophisticated to make the money unrecoverable   what they typically do is open a phony bank account in the name of the victim   they receive the refund into the fraudulent account and they immediately withdraw it   by the time anyone notices that the refund was fraudulent the thief is long gone and there is no money in the account to reclaim it 's not just the irs who gets ripped off this way by the way   thieves use a similar technique to cash stolen credit cards   the thief will open a phony merchant account and a phony bank account in the victim 's name   they will run the stolen cards on the merchant account and deposit the proceeds in the phony account   they are able to withdraw the funds before the fraudulent charges are noticed and reversed and the processing company that the merchant account was opened with ends up eating the loss or passing it along to their legitimate customers in the form of higher rates preventing this kind of fraud has costs   there are monetary costs associated with putting measures in place and there are costs to the customers in the form of having to wait longer for their financial transactions to go through   basically everyone involved the banks the irs etc has to balance the losses against with the costs of preventing them   when fraud is rare it 's cheaper for them to eat the loss than to prevent it    if fraud starts to become more common you will see the institutions involved put into place additional checks to prevent improper transfers   tax return fraud has become common enough that the irs has instituted prevention measures such as requiring information from previous year tax returns in order to receive your refund   if that does n't curb the problem then they will probably add more measures and perhaps they will slow down the payment process   however they probably wo n't ever get the fraud losses down to zero because that would mean both taxpayers by delaying refunds and spending more money on fraud prevention than they save in avoided losses

an endowment is a large chunk of capital i.e. money held by   a university or other nonprofit   it is meant to hold its value forever against inflation and invested to generate income from interest dividends and appreciation    they seem like a contradiction closely scrutinized by boards of directors managed to a high and accountable standard closely regulated and yet invested aggressively for growth ignoring short term volatility to get the highest growth long term   the law p for prudent requires growth investment and says taking up to 7 of current value per year is prudent even in down times when total value is shrinking   on average this lets the endowment grow with inflation   7 is the high end of prudent   an endowment is watched and the taken income is adjusted to keep the endowment healthy 5 is very safe assuming the endowment must pace inflation until the heat death of the universe if you plan to die someday drawing an extra 1 2 is appropriate   there you go   invest like a university endowment and count on up to 7 per year of income   that 's $ a year there 'll be taxes but the long term capital gain rate at $ is pretty low   that 's pretty tight but possible if your idea of entertaining is netflix   it would work very effectively for or the british version living on a

there is n't a single rate that works in both directions   there are two rates one for each direction   so if $ 1 = inr you may find that 100 inr = $    in fact it 's even worse than that   the rates are just the average values at which transactions occur   what happens in the real world is that someone presumably your bank in this instance offers to sell 100 inr for some amount perhaps $   other traders may either accept this price or refuse to trade   if they refuse to trade the bank may accept one of their offers perhaps $    anyway the answer to your question is that whomever does the actual conversion keeps the difference   of course they may then lose that money if the value falls before they sell   more either your bank or your friend 's bank could do the conversion itself   either or both could hold balances in various currencies so that they do n't have to rely on the of the exchange market   this is called a money market account and banks let their customers invest in them    it is a bit more likely to be your bank that gets the money than your friend 's bank   your friend 's bank does n't actually need to know that your account is in usd   they just transfer the amount in inr   it 's your bank that has to convert that into usd to deposit in your account

you got some answers that essentially inform you that ceos that have £ 200k written on their may in fact get much more i 'll take the opposite point of view and talk about people who according to whatever definition have a £ 200k year income   how can they afford it guess no 1 not all of them can in the sense that it is quite possible to end up with negative net worth at £ 200k year income particularly if you immediately want to show off with brand new luxury cars luxury holidays and a large house in a very representative region   guess no 2 not all of the £ 200k year ceos are equally visible there is a trade off between going for wealth large house and luxury car i deliberately ordered the three points according to increased display of wealth however display of wealth usually comes at a cost in a very monetary sense and there are ways to get much display without having much wealth see below lease the car also the mortgage on the house usually is n't displayed on the outside    you also need to take into account how long they are already building up wealth i guess the typical ceo with £ 200k year you 're asking about did not just finish school and enter his work life in this position it would be very interesting to see how income accumulating wealth and possibly displayed wealth correlate my guess is that the correlation between income and accumulated wealth is n't that high and the correlation between displayed and actual wealth is probably even lower they possess luxury cars large house and huge savings are you sure these are the same managers e.g. the ones with the huge savings   are and the ones with the luxury cars i 'm asking particularly about the luxury cars because such cars loose value very quickly and/or are often not owned by the driver but rather by the bank or leasing company which on the other hand offers the more savings oriented ceo who is not that much interested in having a brand new luxury car the possibility to go for a one year old and save the rest knowing that your ceo should be able to buy a one year old mercedes sl 350 year or a new one every 1 1/2 years without building up savings or buying a house however building up wealth will be much faster with the ceo going for the one year old as the brand new car option amounts to loosing ca £ 20 30k within a year an even more savings oriented ceo who keeps his existing mercedes 300 td for another few years thinking that this conservative choice of car will be trust inspiring to the customers or goes for the thinking that most people anyways do n't know that the k between sl and halves the price   however if you just want to be seen with the car after an initial payment of say £ 8 10k you can get a decent 350 not the base model either at a monthly rate of ca or less than £ 7k year note however that this money does not count towards any kind of wealth it 's just renting a nice car   in other words if driving the 350 is your absolute goal you could in theory have that with a net salary of £ 25k year according to your tax calculation that should be somewhere around £ 35k year gross if you have the savings for the initial payment being able to make the initial payment may also help the leasing company that you 're serious about it and able to pay your rates    there are also huge differences in value between large houses compare e.g. these 2 and last but not least there is a decided one way component in the timing of priorities here it is much easier to go and get a luxury car when you have savings than first going for the luxury car and then trying to make up with the savings     i forgot to answer the question in the of your question how do i build wealth by going on to live as if your income were only £ 50k as far as that is compatible with your job i gather the median gross income in the uk is about £ 30k so aiming at £ 50k leaves you a very comfortable budget for luxury spending   if you want to build up wealth faster adjust that in general if you can manage to withhold much of any income increase from spending that will help trivial but powerful truth from the leasing calculation you can conclude that you basically have no chance to show off your wealth by luxury cars that is you 'd need to go for luxury cars that are completely incompatible with with building if you want to show your built up wealth by the car there are too many people who even destroy their existing wealth in order to display luxury   at least if anyone is around who has either a correct idea what luxury cars cost or do n't cost or will look that up in the internet also people who know such things may also have the idea that the probability that such a car was downright paid wealth is small compared to the probability of meeting a   leased or mortgaged car which means the plan to show off does n't work out that well with the people you 'd want to impress as for the other people just a bit of display you can get far cheaper if you really want to drive the rent it for an occasion weekend rather than for years i met a sales manager who told me which rental cars they get when important customers from far east are visiting the rest of the year they drive normal business cars you may want to choose a rental company that does n't write their name on the license plate apply the same ideas to the decision of buying a house think about what you want for yourself and then look where you can get how much of that for how much money oh and by the way if i understand correctly the average uk ceo wage is   £ 120k not £ 200k

buying pressure is when there are more buy orders than sell orders outstanding   just because someone wants to buy a stock does n't mean there 's a seller ready to fill that order   when there 's buying pressure stock prices rise   when there 's selling pressure stock prices fall there can be high volume where buying and selling are roughly equal in which case share prices would n't move much the market makers who actually fill buy and sell orders for stock will raise share prices in the face of buying pressure and lower them in the face of selling pressure   that 's because they get to keep the margin between what they bought shares from a seller for and what they can sell them to a new buyer for   here 's an explanation from about buying pressure buying pressure can basically be defined as increasingly higher demand for a particular stock 's shares this demand for shares exceeds the supply and causes the price to rise the strength or weakness of a stock determines how much buying or selling interest will be required to break support and resistance areas i hope this helps

firstly comparing debt to gdp is comparing a stock to a flow you 're committing a that is warned about in econ 101   secondly i appreciate your concern about the height of debt but it 's really just a measure of the flow of capital debt is an investment too and the headline debt number mixes government corporate and consumer debt which have very different attributes in fact the holders of most government debt are normal citizens and pensioners more concerning might be the levels of consumer debt but i would argue that only becomes an issue if debt starts being issued fraudulently to people who should n't be receiving it e.g. ahead of the mortgage crisis    there may be nothing i can say to convince you otherwise and i 'm not saying that is n't something to be concerned about but i 'm trying to remind you that the story is more complicated than you 're letting on   finally respectfully please do n't about derivatives the notional value is very high but derivatives are a zero sum market unlike the stock market e.g. and in fact the majority of derivatives are for hedging and reducing risk while it 's certainly possible to use derivatives to leverage oneself this really only happens with hedge fund type operations and even if the derivative market blew up i highly doubt it would affect average people very much   tl;dr if there 's another crash in the next 5 years i doubt it will be due to debt outside of perhaps china but i think that 'd lead to more of a recession than a full blown crisis it definitely will not be because of derivatives

amortization is the process by which your loan balance decreases over time for both mortgages and credit card balances your interest charges are based on what you owe   the calculation of the balance is a little different but it still is based on what you owe you 're observing correctly that most of the first payments on a mortgage are interest   this stands to reason since an amortization schedule for a fixed rate mortgage is constructed on the assumption that you 're making your payments equally over the course of the mortgage   since you owe more at the beginning you accrue more interest and a larger fraction of your payment is interest   near the end you owe little and most of your payment therefore is principal

i think your question might be coming from a misunderstanding of how corporate structures work specifically that a corporation is a legal entity sort of like a person that can have its own assets and debts to make it clear let 's look at your example we have two founders albert and brian and they start a corporation called corptech when they start the company it has no assets just like you would if you owned nothing and had no bank account in order to do anything corptech is going to need some money so albert and brian give it some they can give it as much as they want they can give it property if they want too usually people do n't just put money into a corporation without some sort of agreement in place though in most cases the agreement says something like each member will own a fraction of the company that is in proportion to this initial investment the way that is done varies depending on the type of corporation but in general if albert ends up owning 75 and brian ends up owning 25 then they probably valued their contributions at 75 and 25 of the total value these contributions do n't have to be money or property though they could just be general know how or connections or an expectation that they will do some work the important thing is that they agree on the value of these contributions and assign ownership of the company according to that agreement if they do n't have an agreement then the laws of the state that the company is registered in will say how the ownership is assigned now what ownership means can be different depending on the context when it comes to decision making you could own one percentage of the company in terms of votes but when it comes to shares of future profits you could own a different amount this is why you can have voting and non voting versions of a company 's stock for example so this is a critical point the ownership of a company is independent of the individual contributions to the company the next part of your question is related to this what happens when corptech sees an opportunity to make an investment if it has enough cash on hand because of the initial investment or through financing or reinvested profits then the decision to make the investment is made according to albert and brian 's ownership agreement and they spend it the money does n't belong to them individually anymore it belongs to corptech and so corptech is spending it they are just making the decision for corptech to spend it this is why people say the owners are not financially liable beyond their initial investment if the deal is bad and they lose the money the most they can lose is what they initially put in on the other hand if corptech does n't have the money then they have to figure out a way to get it they might decide to each put in an amount in proportion to their ownership so that their stake does n't change or albert might agree to finance the deal 100 in exchange for a larger share of ownership or he could agree to fund all of it without a larger stake because brian is the one who set the deal up or they might take out a loan and not need to invest any new money or they might find an investor who agrees to put in the needed money in exchange for a a 51 share in which case albert and brian will have to figure out how to split the remaining 49 if they agree to the deal the details of how all of this would work depend on the structure llc llp c corp s corp etc but in general the idea is that the company has assets and debts and the owners can have voting rights equity rights and rights to future profits in any type of split that they want regardless of what the companies assets and debts are or what their initial investment was

an asset is something which you own that has a monetary value some examples would be your car your house the money in your wallet and yes the pile of gold in your garage assets also include intangible things such as money owed to you for instance although these are calculated somewhat differently liabilities are what you owe for instance your car loan your mortgage and your student loan liabilities can also include future debts which you may not be paying at the moment

in steady state the refrigerator only has to pump out the heat that has leaked in from outside   the amount of heat leaked is related to the difference between interior and exterior temperatures and the overall insulation quality   thus a refrigerator full of cold food uses the same amount of energy as a refrigerator full of cold air    in practice people open the door take cold food out put warm food in and the unit may also make ice dispense cold water and itself   aside from tweaking those uses e.g. minimizing time with the door open a useful trick is to use empty milk cartons or similar containers to fill up unused space   this helps by reducing the amount of cold air that escapes when the door is opened and the air in the cartons has low thermal mass so it cools down rapidly   when you need the space you can remove the cartons and set them aside similarly water filled cartons may be used as a sort of thermal leveling out the temperature fluctuations within the refrigerator particularly if the electric utilities are erratic   however they increase the cost of when cooling the water in the first place and when you eventually dump out the water the expense of cooling it goes down the drain

dude you are totally moving the goal posts first of all the fact that you had to crawl through my comment history and came up with a completely unrelated response rather than addressing my point is pretty pathetic and a pretty common behavior who are wrong and do n't want to admit it i do n't hate california i think it 's overrated and i think it 's overrated because what you get is n't worth what you pay that is n't being biased it 's cause and effect if it did n't cost 3x as much to live in california as anywhere else i would like it a lot more   and the math does n't work out you in your original comment said the typical salary is now that you have been proven wrong you are now claiming it 's 200k+ that is n't the math working out that 's distorting reality until it lines up with your preconceived notions   and now you are restricting nature to mountains since apparently anything that is n't red river is hills and therefore not worth anything again moving the goalposts and even if your idea of things to do in nature means i like in the mountains exclusively you would be much better off in places like utah than california   repeatedly saying i 've done the math i 've been offered a job does n't mean anything when i 've already shown you the math does n't work out and i too have been offered a 6 figure job in sf   i 'm clearly not the one that 's biased you are look if you have built up california into some mythical place so sacred that you are so clearly willing to do mental gymnastics you are demonstrating in order to make reality conform with your personal notions great but for everyone else the math as in actual math not changing the numbers around until it makes sense does nt work out

as more actively managed funds are driven out of the market the pricing of individual stocks should become less rational i.e. more stocks will become underpriced relative to their peers as stock prices become less rational the reward for active investing will increase since it will become easier to pick a winner eventually the market will reach a new equilibrium where only active investors who are good enough to turn a profit will remain even then passive investment will still do roughly as well as the market since it has low overhead and minimal investment lag there is no reason to expect the system to collapse since it is characterized primarily by negative feedback loops rather than positive feedback   the last few decades have seen a shift from active to passive investment because increased market transparency and efficiency have reduced the labor required to keep pricing rational basically as people have gotten better at predicting stock performance less active investment has been required to keep prices rational

back when they started discover undercut visa and amex fees by about a point this was also true when i worked for a mail order computer retailer in the 90s if a customer asked us which credit cards we took we were told to list discover first and amex last because discover had the lowest merchant charges possibly this is no longer true today but for quite a while it was a significant selling point of the discover card to merchants and a reason why many did sign on a reason some stores did not sign on was that discover was owned by sears and many businesses that competed with sears did n't like the idea of sending any of their profits to the competition today discover also owns diners club and the fees for those cards are higher

i just wanted to give you a different perspective as i own a house purchased with a mortgage with my girlfriend i think it can be done safely and fairly but you do need to involve legal help to do it right there really is nothing to be terrified about the extra cost to set this up was almost irrelevant in the bigger picture of legal costs around purchasing and the documents describing the ownership scheme are quite straightforward maybe it 's a uk thing but it seems rather commonplace here   we 've chosen to hold this as tenants in common and use a trust deed for this when we purchased we had a solicitor write the trust deed and it clearly states what percentage of the house is owned by either party and exactly what the steps would be taken should we decide to end the trust e.g. in case of a split up this includes things like the right to buy out the other person before selling on the market etc   we also had to make wills separately to indicate what should happen with our percentage of the property in case one of us died as with this type of ownership it does n't automatically go to the other person   finally we 're both on the mortgage which i guess is the main difference versus your situation but again you could get legal advice as to how this should best be handled

if you can afford to max out an hsa and cover out of pocket expenses without withdrawing from it it makes sense to do so   it might sound initially risky to tie too much money to healthcare expenses perhaps you 'll enjoy exceptional health and not need those funds however the annual contribution limit $ for an individual is low enough that it 's unlikely you 'd your hsa but even if you did n't need it all for healthcare after 65 you can withdraw hsa funds without the 20 withdrawal penalty that you 're hit with if under 65 so best case it 's tax free worst case it 's like an ira   from a tax perspective your contributions are a tax deduction like a traditional ira there 's no tax on the gains and you withdraw it tax free as well so long as you have healthcare expenses the tricky bit is you can get reimbursed for your expenses at any time if you pay out of pocket now in 20 years you can get a reimbursement from your hsa from hsa bank 's faq can i use my tax free hsa savings to pay for or reimburse myself for    irs qualified medical expenses from a previous year     yes as long as    the irs qualified medical expenses were incurred after your hsa was    established you can pay them or reimburse yourself with hsa funds at    any time just be sure to keep sufficient records to show that these    expenses were not previously paid for by another source or taken as an    itemized deduction in any prior tax year

there are multiple reasons why this may have happened 1 i could n't tell in your question whether or not you had already paid off the loan before requesting the rollover but if the loan was defaulted then the $ 9k left in your account is not but is there to pay back the remaining balance on your loan the $ 9k will be treated as income and will be taxed you will receive   a 1099-r detailing the taxes you 'll owe i do n't know why this was n't done when they did your rollover distribution typically it all happens at the same time but it can vary depending on the administrator 2 do you get some type of safe harbor discretionary match or profit sharing contribution if so perhaps this contribution was made after your account was liquidated so now there is residual money in your account and it is treated as a new distribution which incurs a new $ 60 distribution fee 3 stock if some of your investments were in stock these take a few extra days to liquidate typically a tpa recordkeeper would wait until all of the funds are liquidated before issuing the rollover but some companies may be shady and do it separately incurring an additional $ 60 distribution fee if this was the case i would go to your former employer 's hr and tell them what s happening and to start looking for a new 401(k administrator i hope this helps good luck

i disagree sponsorship is the problem or more specifically where it comes from with of advertising what happens is that any small player with a keyboard can become a news source lowering the bar on what we consider news though this goes for all content really in turn this makes good content providers have far more competition and essentially lowers the bar for all sources because most people will not pay a premium for great content in the case of news how does a news agency with researchers fact checkers and overhead compete with a guy in his bedroom if clicks and eyeballs are the only source of comparison    the buying of content or native advertising as its being called is a direct byproduct of this slippery slope and the ultimate desire of each person or entity to be successful which in some cases means offering new this is nothing new but has just grown exponentially as the barriers to entry have all but been removed   at the end of the day this goes back to trust if consumers put a premium on trusted content and channels because they want something like facts vs. and echo chamber to reinforce a particular mindset then it would be a different situation free is what everyone one wants but they forget one important thing if your not paying for something then your not the consumer your probably the product obviously this in turn means it ’s less important to get the reader real content vs. content that will keep them on site just a little longer than their competitors for which they are rewarded   so going back to the millennials good for them for apparently being among the first group to collectively realize that they need to question everything and rely on their own research they are natives of the misinformation age

my wife and i use a digital form of the envelope system we call it a budget we record how much we want to allocate each month to spend for each category of expense in a spread sheet why use prepaid cards why not open a bunch of bank accounts and use debit cards from each if you want to separate the money you could also keep a ledger for each account that you spend from on a smart phone or even in a physical ledger   the reason for the envelope method is that it psychologically hurts some people to physically part with cash once you it in some factor you lose what is the primary touted benefit and it 's no longer the envelope system the secondary benefit that once the budget for one category is gone it 's gone is only as good as the discipline you have to not rob cash from another envelope why is this any easier than the discipline of not debiting beyond the bottom of the ledger so a budget is a digital version of the envelope system once the physical cash is removed from the equation it 's definitely not the envelope system sorry for the contrarian take on this question but i 've never been a fan of the envelope system for many of the reasons you have described i guess i 'm too young for the cash psychology to work for me

it would be the sales revenue less everything else when he says reinvest that is to say they keep all of the post tax earnings and place it in retained earnings this means that it is still the companies money to invest and use to fulfill their goals if they did n't have any worthy investing opportunities they could issue dividends so say your cost of capital is 15 and the best investment you can make will earn you 12 that 's a loss of value so the company acting in the investors best interests will give those funds back so that the investors can allocate that money to more efficient areas dividends are one mechanism a company has to control their rate of growth

not really   they did n't account for the fact that the income would first be spread out over 8 billion people   i do n't know if anyone in keynes time was thinking about dozens of industries closed in america and moved directly to china   had you suggested that to them i think they would have thought it ridiculous but that is in fact what happened   also theories on trade suggest that it makes everyone better off   so if you ask any economist at any given point if more free trade is better they will probably say yes   that was all fine until about the 1980s when computer networks made it possible to supply chains   suddenly vast cad cam systems sprung up and suddenly you could pay a worker a $ 1 a day to do what someone in the us was getting $ 45 an hour to do   the economics of it for corporations were absolutely and they lobbied hard to make sure noting got in the way note that free trade passed under both parties   in order to mask the fact that this was happening a giant credit bubble was created in the developed world using the newfound savings of the developing world   living standards were temporarily maintained in developed countries by borrowing money from the people they had sent their jobs to   the effects of this are all pretty clear   most developed nations are now burdened under a mountain of debt   central banks are having a difficult time maintaining enough liquidity to support the illusion of buying power in developed nations that is no longer present without enormous artificial support   many americans alive today can not even remember a time when america 's current account deficit was not deeply in the red   so far the only thing propping up developed nations is the use and threat of use of vastly superior military force   that has n't really changed but every day the developing nations a little bit more on the resources of the world for consumption rather than just production   as that happens the out of the developed world start to feel more and more pressured as they come to realize they really do n't have much of value to trade   america 's biggest exports are food and services   food is surely important but one farmer can farm like 100,000 acres   and services just means we can export the time of a wall street douchebag at a high rate of pay

i think that mbhunter hit the nail on the head regarding your question i just want to add that having a policy that is n't sponsored by your employer is a good idea employer policies are regulated by the federal government via erisa independent policies are state regulated and usually have better protections also look for a policy that allows you to increase your coverage later without medical qualification so you do n't need to insurance initially

i get the sense that this is a the world is unfair there 's no way i can succeed question so let 's back up a few steps income is the starting point to all of this   that could be a job or jobs or running your own business from there you can do four things with your income obviously spend and give do not provide a monetary return they give a return in other ways such as quality of life helping others etc save gives you reserves for future expenses but it does not provide growth so that just leaves invest   you seem to be focused on stock market investments which you are right take a very long time to grow although you can get returns of up to 12 depending on how much volatility you 're willing to absorb but there are other ways to invest   you can invest in yourself by getting a degree or other training to improve your income   you can invest by starting a business which can dramatically increase your income in fact this is the most common path to millionaire in the us and probably in other free markets you can invest by growing your own existing business   you can invest in someone else 's business you can invest in real estate that can provide both value appreciation and rental income   so yes investment is a key aspect of wealth building but it is not limited to just stock market investment you can also look at reducing expenses in order to have more money to invest also keep in mind that investment with higher returns come with higher risk both in terms of volatility and risk of complete loss and that borrowing money to invest is almost always unwise since the interest paid directly reduces the return without reducing the risk

although this has been touched upon in comments i think the following line from the currently accepted answer shows the biggest issue there is a clear difference between investing and gambling the reality is that the difference is n't that clear at all tens of comments have been written arguing in both directions and looking around the internet entire essays have been written arguing both positions the underlying emotion that seems to shape this discussion primarily is whether investing especially in the stock market is a form of gambling people who do invest in this way tend to get relatively emotional whenever someone argues that this is a form of gambling as gambling is considered a negative thing the simple reality of human communication is that words can be ambiguous and the way investors will use the words investments and gambles will differ from the way it is used by gamblers and once again different from the way it 's commonly used what i definitely think is made clear by all the different discussions however is that there is no single distinctive trait that allows us to differentiate investing and gambling the result of this is that when you take dictionary definitions for both terms you will likely end up including lottery tickets as a valid form of investment   that still however leaves us with a situation where we have two terms with a strong overlap which have a distinctive meaning in communication and the original question whether buying lottery tickets is an investment over on there is an absolutely amazing strongly recommended essay which explores countless of different traits in search of a difference between investing and gambling and they came up with the following two definitions investing any activity in which money is put at risk for the purpose of making a profit and which is characterized by some or most of the following in approximately descending order of importance sufficient research has been conducted the odds are favorable the behavior is risk averse a systematic approach is being taken emotions such as greed and fear play no role the activity is ongoing and done as part of a long term plan the activity is not motivated solely by entertainment or compulsion ownership of something tangible is involved a net positive economic effect results gambling any activity in which money is put at risk for the purpose of making a profit and which is characterized by some or most of the following in approximately descending order of importance little or no research has been conducted the odds are unfavorable the behavior is risk seeking an approach is being taken emotions such as greed and fear play a role the activity is a discrete event or series of discrete events not done as part of a long term plan the activity is significantly motivated by entertainment or compulsion ownership of something tangible is not involved no net economic effect results the very interesting thing about those definitions is that they capture very well the way those terms are used by most people and they even acknowledge that a lot of investors are gambling and that a few gamblers are investing read the essay for more on that and this fits well with the way those two concepts are understood by the public so in those definitions normally buying a lottery ticket would indeed not be an investment but if we take for example 's operation example if you have $ 1000 and need $ 2000 by next week or else you ca n't have an operation and you will die and you ca n't find anyone to give you a loan your optimal strategy is to gamble your $ 1000 at the best odds you can get with a possible outcome of $ 2000 so even if you only have a 1/3 chance of winning and getting that operation it 's still the right bet if you ca n't find a better one this can suddenly change the perception and turn gambling into high risk investing

there 's nothing particularly special about a two million dollar cheque while they are n't commonplace the bank certainly has experience with them many atms wo n't allow a deposit of that size but the bank cashiers will certainly accept them they will typically get a supervisor to sign off on the deposit and may ask about the source of the money for fraud prevention reasons they may be held for longer than a smaller cheque if the bank manager chooses to do so if there 's nothing remotely suspicious for example it is a cheque from an insurance company for an expected payout you should expect it will clear in about a week on the other hand if it is a cheque from a bank in another country and the bank manager has any reason to suspect it may not be legitimate they may hold it for a month or more even then you are not guaranteed the cheque was legitimate this is used in a common scam

do all most unit trusts have policy it is really that some value of the fund is given to the investor so the fund value goes down by that much per unit it depends on the type of mutual funds for example there are growth type mutual funds that do not give any dividend and the total value of the fund is reflected in its price do the companies whose stocks we owned directly apply policy on their dividends as well why not as far a stock price is concerned it usually decrease by the same amount of the dividend payout at ex date so in effect the market in a way does the equalization the company directly does not do it

interest is calculated daily doing the math between 6 17 and 7 25 are 38 days 38 = interest per day between 7 25 and 8 17 are 23 days 23 = interest per day the minimal difference is because the principal has already gone down a little bit so you should expect x number of days for the next interest number coming up slowly decreasing as the remaining principal debt decreases note that this is equivalent of an annual interest rate of over 20 which is beyond acceptable in the current economy this is ridiculously high i recommend trying to get a refinancing with another provider you should be able to get it for a third of that

with every caveat that rick said plus many many more lets have some fun   one common way to measure risk is volatility of returns roughly how much the value of your asset jumps around   interestingly the following ordering is fairly similar for many other common measures of risk the first three on the list would be mostly interchangeable   generally putting your money in cash investments has no real day to day price variability and the main risk is that the bank wo n't give you your money back at the end   money market funds are last as they can break the buck to get a feel for the next few on the list i 'm using previous 360 day volatility numbers for representative broad indices 2014 10 27   while these volatility values can move around quite a bit the order is actually remarkably stable hedge funds might seem out of place here but remember that hedge funds can hold be long and short at the same time and this can cancel out daily variation   however hedge funds do have plenty of risks that may not be well accounted for by this measure    for derivatives i 'll refer to back to rick 's answer this is a measure for broad investment in these categories your particular investment in long term capital management or bonds may vary it is important to note that your return on your investment generally grows as you go toward more risky investments down this list as people generally expect to be rewarded   in the long term for risky investments

it depends   dividends and fees are usually unrelated if the etf holds a lot of stocks which pay significant dividends e.g. an s&p500 index fund these will probably cover the cost of the fees pretty readily if the etf holds a lot of stocks which do not pay significant dividends e.g. growth stocks there may not be any dividends though hopefully there will be capital appreciation some etfs do n't contain stocks at all but rather some other instruments e.g. commodity trust etfs which hold precious metals like gold and silver or daily leveraged etfs which hold options in those cases there will never be any dividends and depending on the performance of the market the capital appreciation may or may not cover the expenses of the fund either if you look up qqq 's financials you 'll find it most recently paid out a dividend at an annualized rate of its expense ratio is 0.20 so the dividends more than cover its expense ratio   you could also ask why would i care because unless you 're doing some pretty darned specific tax related modeling it does n't matter much whether the etf covers its expense ratio via dividends or whether it comes out of capital gains you should probably be more concerned with overall returns for qqq in the most recent year 8.50 which easily the dividends

there is no absolute answer to this as it depends on your particular situation but some tips as to investing versus saving you need to do some of both be careful about stockpiling too much in bank accounts inflation will eat that money up over time to the tune of 3 you are young and have a longer investment horizon for retirement take advantage of that and accept a little more risk while you can

let 's start from the premise that the mortgage is something you will have anyway because you need it to live as opposed to say getting a bigger mortgage initially in the expectation of paying it down faster than scheduled in that case i think paying down a mortgage certainly is an investment one with a well defined interest rate and maturity that depends on the precise terms of the mortgage for example i have a uk mortgage that 's fixed for the next two years at about 5 and allows overpayments of £ 500 per month which can be withdrawn at any time so i treat those overpayments as equivalent to savings with quite a nice interest rate especially since mortgage interest is n't tax deductible and so i actually get the full benefit of that interest rate

the does care a lot you are very very very unlikely to be busted by the for following your states laws you re talking about one family     edit looked more into this article it does nt mention the anywhere and this is on their closing remarks this page to be taken with a of salt   in the mainstream media is at a historic low and rightfully so given the behavior of many journalists in washington d.c.   since donald trump was elected president it is painfully clear that the mainstream media covers liberals and conservatives critically   journalists spread false negative rumors about president trump before any evidence is even produced

this is a question i asked myself while considering an hsa and i could n't find any answers so now that i have one i 'm answering it myself i asked a family friend investment banker about it and he suggested you could only make distributions when on an eligible hdhp but was n't completely sure i was about to post the question here to confirm or contradict his statement when i ran across irs publication 969 referenced in another se question in it i found this statement under the distributions from an hsa heading     if you are no longer an eligible individual you can still receive tax free distributions to pay or reimburse your qualified medical expenses which indicates that you can still make qualified tax free distributions even when you are no longer eligible to contribute unless someone else has evidence to the contrary

agreed it is n't fair but large businesses multinationals will always have the advantage of choosing which legal jurisdiction to do business in   this creates an incentive for such loopholes in order to attract the businesses to do business there at all   it needs to be harder for legislators to write such specialized tax laws as the more complex specialized the tax law becomes the more unfair it inevitably turns out

about two years ago i went to bb giving them the benefit of the doubt   they refused to price match another local retailer on the grounds they were n't local and bb gets to decide what constitutes local   it will take a miracle to get me back in their store   incidentally the other retailer has big prominent signs outside inside and on its ads saying it will price match including online retailers
