you most definitely can invest such an amount profitably but it makes it even more important to avoid fees um at all costs because fees tend to have a fixed component that will be much worse for you than for someone investing € 200k so   edit the above assumes that you actually want to invest in the long run for modest but relatively certain gains maybe 5 above inflation while accepting temporary downswings of up to 30 if those € 2000 are funny money that you do n't mind losing but would be really excited about maybe getting 100 return in less than 5 years well feel free to put them into an individual stock of an obscure small company but be aware that you 'd be gambling not investing and you can probably get better quotes playing roulette

you might want to consider investing a portion of that money into educating yourself the payoff might not be as immediately obvious or but with appropriate determination in the long term it will generate you a much greater return if you would like to learn about investing a great starting point would be to buy and read the book the intelligent investor by benjamin graham this will be a great barometer for how ready you are to invest in the stock market if you are able to understand the concepts discussed and comprehend why they are important you will have gone far in ensuring that you will make adequate returns over your lifetime and will more importantly increase the odds of safeguarding your capital

if i donate $ 10,000 to charity then i can deduct that $ 10,000 from my income and not pay income taxes on it   so if i make $ 50,000 a year then i will only pay income taxes on $ 40,000 instead of $ 50,000 since i donated $ 10,000 to charity   this is what is meant when charity contributions are said to be tax deductible do n't feel like you have to donate to charity   you owe no one anything   you do more for others by working assuming you work in the private sector if you know of someone personally that is in need of aid then you could give them some help directly   i find this more effective then blindly dumping money in a bureaucratic inefficient charity   i also find there are very few people in need of charity personally i think charity donations are a way for people to feel good about themselves   they rarely care if their donations are effective

for getting    it is fact that we do n't have a minimum wage in germany and that we developed a pretty large low income sector over the last ten years that often pays wages that are in fact illegal in the us and there are cases which involve workers receiving state benefits and essentially working for free in order to get back into the primary job market this last sector has a lot of fraud often times to the sole disadvantage of the person working   but germany also has a tradition of less transparency compared to the us this includes all aspects of life and has benefits much more privacy for example but also severe drawbacks like this one where a lot of people simply choose to ignore a huge part of the population though it is n't 25 of the workforce that gets such low wages it 's still big though   your karma is outrageous

you 've already done everything i would suggest contact the collections agency being careful in what personal information you provide check all three of your credit reports for any trace of incorrect information at this point since you 've confirmed that the social security number that the collections agency has does not match yours and you 've confirmed that you have nothing in your credit report about this debt i do n't think you need to worry about it collections agencies employ a number of tactics to try to collect on bad debt   the first dilemma they have is finding the debtor   sometimes this is easier than other times   in this case they obviously do n't know where this person is so they just started contacting people that have the same name as the debtor hoping that they will get lucky   intimidation is a major collections agency tactic so i 'm sure the letter you got was strongly worded your phone call to them may or may not have convinced them that they have the wrong person   believe it or not people sometimes lie to collections agencies   so the biggest thing you may have to deal with is continued harassment by the agency   if they think you are lying to them you can expect more phone calls and more harassment the ftc has a faq page about debt collection   if you hear from them again do n't fall for any intimidation tactics that they might say to you   just tell them not to contact you again and report them if they do   they will eventually get the message and go away

it depends completely on the car   some cars retain their value much better and others drop in value like a rock no pun intended   the mileage and condition on a car also has a huge impact on value    according to this site cars on average lose 46 of their value in three years so seeing one that drops 62 in roughly 3 years does not seem impossible that value could also have been trade in value which is significantly lower than what you could get with a private party sale or what you 'd pay to get that same car from a dealer one example a new ford lowest model has a kelly blue book value of $ 28,000   a 2014 lowest model with average mileage and in fair condition has a private party value of about $ 12,000 for a 57 drop in value note i picked because it 's a car that should not have exceptional resale value unlike bmw trucks suvs not to make any kind of judgement of the quality or of the car

the decision whether this test is or is not met seems to be highly dependent on the specific situation of the employer and the employee   i think that you wo n't find a lot of general references meeting your needs there is such a thing as a private ruling letter where individuals provide specific information about their situation and request the irs to rule in advance on how the situation falls with respect to the tax law   i do n't know a lot about that process or what you need to do to qualify to get a private ruling   i do know that versions of at least some of the rulings are published   you might look for such rulings that are close to your situation i did a quick search and found two that are somewhat related as regards your situation my non expert understanding is that you will not pass in this case unless either a the employer specifies that you must live on the west coast or you 'll be fired b the employer would refuse to provide space for you if you moved to boston or another company location or c you can show that you could not possibly do your job out of boston   for c that might mean for example you need to make visits to client locations in sf on short notice to meet business requirements   if you are only physically needed in sf occasionally and with reasonable notice i do n't think you could make it under c although if the employer does n't want to pay travel costs then you might still make it under a in this case

you 're right the asset allocation is one fundamental thing you want to get right in your portfolio   i agree 110   if you really want to understand asset allocation i suggest any and all of the following three books all by the same author william j. bernstein they are excellent and yes i 've read each   from a theory perspective and being about asset allocation specifically the intelligent asset allocator is a good choice   whereas the next two books are more accessible and more complete covering topics including investor psychology history financial products you can use to implement a strategy etc   got the time read them all i finished reading his latest book the investor 's manifesto two weeks ago   here are some choice quotes from chapter 3 the nature of the portfolio that address some of the points you 've asked about   all emphasis below is mine page 74 the good news is the asset allocation    process is not really that hard   the    investor only makes two important    decisions page 76 rather younger investors should own a    higher portion of stocks because they    have the ability to apply their    regular savings to the markets at    depressed prices   more precisely    young investors possess more human capital than financial capital    that is their total future earnings    dwarf their savings and investments     from a financial perspective human    capital looks like a bond whose    coupons escalate with inflation page 78 the most important asset allocation    decision is the overall stock bind    mix start with age = bond allocation    rule of thumb i.e. because the younger you are you already have bond like income from anticipated employment earnings the older you get the less bond like income you have in your future so buy more bonds in your portfolio he also mentions adjusting that with respect to one 's risk tolerance   if you ca n't take the ups and downs of the market adjust the stock portion down up to 20 less if you can stomach the risk without a problem adjust the stock portion up up to 20 more page 86 in reference to a specific example where two assets that and are    purchased in a 50/50 split and adjusted back to targets this process called rebalancing    provides the investor with an    automatic buy low sell high bias that over the long run usually    but not always improves returns page 87 the essence of portfolio construction    is the combination of asset classes    that move in different directions at    least some of the time finally this gem on pages 88 and 89 is there a way of scientifically picking the very best future    allocation which offers the maximum    return for the minimum risk   no but    people still try       continues with description of    markowitz 's mean variance analysis    technique    it took    investment professionals quite a while    to realize that limitation of    mean variance analysis and other    black box techniques for allocating    assets i could go on quoting relevant pieces he even goes into much detail on constructing an asset allocation suitable for a large portfolio containing a variety of different stock asset classes but i suggest you read the book

credit cards are often more fool proof against over drawing consider bill has solid cash flow but most of their money is in his high interest savings account earning interest an account that does n't have a card but is accessible via online banking bill keeps enough in the debit transactions account for regular spending much of which comes out automatically e.g. rent utilities some of which he spends as needed eg shopping lunch on top of the day to day money bill keeps an overhead amount so if something happens he does n't overdraw the account which would incur significant fees now bill sees that the giant tv he has been saving for is on sale half price and there is just one left it costs more than he would normally spend in a week much more but bill knows that his pay should have just gone in and his rent not yet come out plus the overhead he keep in the account so there is money in his debit account when he gets home he can open up online banking and transfer from his savings after all the tv is what he was saving for what bill forgets is that there was a public holiday last week in the state where payroll is operated and that his pay is going to go in a day late so now he might have over drawn the account buying the tv or maybe that was fine but paying the rent over draws the account now he has a overdraft fee probably on the order of $ 50 most banks at least where i am will happily allow you to overdraw you account giving you a loan at high interest and with an immediate overdraft fee they do this cos the fee is so high that they can tolerate the risk of the non assessed loan sometimes if you ask they do n't let you do it with your own eg buying the tv but they do let you do it on automated eg the rent on the other hand banks will not let you over draw a credit card they know exactly how much loan and risk they were going to take if bill had most of his transactions going on his credit card then it would have just bounced at the cash register and bill would have remembered what was going on and then transferred the money there are many ways you can accidentally overdraw your account particularly if it is a shared account

this is n't as rigorous as it should be but may offer some useful insight into how big and small companies differ operationally putting apple aside larger companies tend to sell larger volumes of products even if they 're devices or turbines relative to what smaller companies can sell obviously in absolute terms as well   they are also able to negotiate volume discounts as well as payment terms   this allows them to finance sales through their supply chain   however their large direct competitors are able to do the same thing as well   competitive forces then drive prices down smaller businesses without these advantages of scale tend to have to charge higher margins since they have to pay directly and if their clients are large businesses finance the sale small businesses still have higher proportional costs of operation   sadly my reference here is a study i performed for the south african revenue service about ten years ago and not available online however the time taken by a small business to manage admin tax hr is a greater proportion of revenue than for larger companies if the small business is a start up with big investment from venture finance then they could subsidise their selling price run at a loss and try and gain scale   enough there is a fantastic article on this by joel ben and jerry 's vs. amazon for the average highly competitive smaller company the best choice is to chase design quality premium markets in order to justify the higher margins they have to charge    and that 's what makes apple interesting as a case study   they were a small company in the presence of giants intel microsoft ibm   they were forced to concentrate on design and premium markets in order to justify their need for higher margins   it almost did n't work but then they broke through   now they 're in the unique position of having gained scale but are still small enough relative to other electronics manufacturers to continue charging that premium by volume their sales are still relatively small but their margins make them a giant this type of variation from market to market makes developing some sort of solution very unlikely but the general requirement holds that smaller companies must charge higher margins in order to create equivalent profits to larger companies which must gain scale through volume

yes and no this really should be taught at junior school level in a capitalist country but that is a different argument a company is influenced by its shareholders but not in the way you are hoping this is the only area where a company must behave democratically with one share one vote if you own one share in a company specifically a voting share then you are entitled to attend an agm where you will have a vote on issues presented by the board you might have an opportunity to make a statement or ask a question at the agm but i would n't rely on it you will not be able to influence the companies behavior beyond that unless you control enough shares to influence the board notice i said control not own if you get other shareholders to agree to vote with you then you effectively control their shares shareholders are there to get a return on their investment so you must convince them that they will get a better return by agreeing with you then by following the board that they put there convince them that for example a lawsuit will rob the company of more value then the profit to be made and they might agree to not morals ethics justice etc are human attributes and since most shareholders are other corporations not humans they have no place in your arguments with one exception goodwill is a value that appears on a balance sheet and you might be able to use emotional arguments to show that there is a risk of a loss of goodwill from the proposed actions you can make your argument stronger by generating media pressure on customers and suppliers of the company to make critical public comments

what you are describing is called following or going over a budget there is no debt or loans in the scenario you are describing simply put a budget is when you allocate a certain amount of your income for expenses in various categories and a certain amount for savings   so lets say you earn $ 100 a month if you budget $ 50 in expenses every month then that means you try not to spend more then $ 50 a month and the rest you save in any given month you may go over your self imposed budgeted amount for expenses that simply means you are over the amount for that month but that does not make you in debt it just means you did n't meet your goal for that month or whatever time period you created however if you do this then you clearly do n't have a realistic budget because the idea behind a budget is a plan that you can realistically meet on a consistent basis sometimes you may have to break it but it should be made in such a way that if you work at it it is consistently achievable if not then you need to rethink your budget instead of thinking in terms of taking loans from yourself i would encourage you to think in terms of saving up for goals and only spending money from those goal funds in this way you are not arbitrarily spending money that would instead go into savings but rather explicitly setting money aside for those goals this will also help you to see where exactly your money is going and also help you to prioritize your financial goals

there would be multiple competing courts looking for people 's business based upon who could best interpret laws and contracts on the contrary courts exist because people do want to be there they are people who can not come to an agreement on their own if a person is a criminal they are n't going to want the court system at all those people are in the vast minority   the notion of a market monopoly is a myth the market by and large does not and examples of monopoly do n't last long   in terms of the court system and justice no states do not work police often get away with actions that would be considered criminal for the rest of us and politicians get the same treatment the examples of police going or political action being widely opposed and still being pushed through are too numerous to list   again those who would loot and destroy are in the minority if a person has the mindset that they want to harm person and property then they do n't care about whether or not there is a state they can only be stopped by force and force can come from any entity with the legitimacy of using it in that arena there is nothing special about the state   they would n't have any right to restrict your freedom except to the extent of stopping you from violating the person and property of others they do n't need a constitution for that   gt everything would just devolve into constant warfare between groups until a single group outperformed the others of course and boom you 've got a government again   this is pure fiction you have no evidence nor reason to actually support this we 're talking about reality not conjecture if you want to claim such nonsense then you have to prove library take over you ca n't just throw out such propaganda and expect it to be taken as fact

yes you can make contributions to your hsa for 2013 until april 15 2014   however when you make the contribution you need to explicitly tell the financial institution that your deposit is for tax year 2013 as they will be reporting to the irs your total 2013 contributions after april 15 if you have n't filed your tax return for 2013 yet you can wait until you make your final hsa contribution for 2013 and then file before april 15   otherwise if you have already filed for 2013 and you make another hsa contribution for 2013 you 'll need to file an amended return in order to claim the additional deduction one more piece of advice do n't wait until the last day to make this contribution   make your final contribution at least a week early   each year here on the site we get some questions from people who made an hsa or ira contribution on april 15 only to be told by the bank that they missed some internal bank deadline by a few hours   there is no need to wait until the last day do n't cut it too close

hi i am assuming you are doing this in the us   i run a social media content marketing agency in the uk   some of our very first clients were real estate agents the idea we had was to market properties through facebook using interior and exterior video shots to commercial music   this took off with some estate agents and not so much with others   my biggest piece of advice find a chain and start there that way you will get a hell of a lot of recognition by the smaller firms   you need to find a realistic price point for your clients that is measurable on the roi and ultimately pays for your lifestyle i started at £ 200 which is $ dollars arguably very underpriced but it gave me the opportunity to work with a cluster of people   i even went to the extreme of offering free work so i could get work for the portfolio   in terms of who to contact and how to find them enter your new best friend connect with real estate developers buyers owners you name it then informally introduce yourself and ask when they are free for a coffee post an article about why video and drone footage is the next big thing for real estate do n't be afraid to ask for the business at the end of the day you are providing cold hard value   i 've always tried to get retainer deals with clients in the real estate sector but to achieve this you have to talk to the big boys and not independent firms i could be wrong though i have n't done business with a lot of people in the states so definitely something to keep in mind   a good lot of this business idea is trial and error but i agree with it 100 just go and do basically   hope this helps i am happy to show you some of my work if you want to shoot me over a private message

there is a mathematical way to determine the answer if you know all the variables and that 's a big if for example suppose you rent for 4 years and the price of rent never increases the total amount you will have paid is 600 48 = if you currently have money sitting in the bank earning only a negligible amount of interest and you can purchase the house for x and then sell it for exactly what you paid 4 years from now and you have 0 expenses otherwise then purchasing it will save you compared to renting obviously that makes some assumptions which are not possible now you need to calculate the variables all of these variables can drastically effect the profit margin and unfortunately they will vary greatly depending on your country location and the condition of the home once you estimate each of the variables it 's important to realize that if you purchase your profit or loss can swing unexpectedly in either direction based on appreciation depreciation which can be difficult to predict in part because it is somewhat tied to the overall macro economy of where you live state or country on the flip side if you rent it 's pretty easy to calculate your cost as approximately over 4 years perhaps slightly more for modest rent increases lastly if you elect to purchase the house realize that you 're investing that money in real estate you could just as easily rent and invest that money elsewhere if you want to choose a more aggressive or conservative investment with your money

i would like to establish credit history have heard it 's useful to    gain employment and makes it easy to rent an apartment higher credit scores will make it easier with landlords that 's true as to employment they do background checks which means that they usually wo n't like bad things but wo n't care about the good things or no things they 'll know you 're a foreigner anyway is it safe to assume that this implies i have no history whatsoever probably but you can verify pulling through do n't go around giving your personal information everywhere is taking out a secured loan the only way for me no but it 's one of the easiest better would be getting a secured credit card not loan for loan you 'll have to pay interest for a credit card assuming you pay off all your purchases immediately you will only pay the credit card fees for secured credit cards they charge 100 yearly fees so do shop around the prices vary a lot if you 're using it wisely after a year it will be converted to a regular credit card and the collateral will be returned to you with interest which is actually very competitive last i heard it was around 2 twice as much as the online savings accounts as to a secured loan you 'll be paying 4 to cu for your own money does n't make any sense at all for me for credit cards you 'll at least get some value for your money convenience additional fraud protection etc the end result will be the same usually the credit starts to build up after ~6 12 months that 's why after a year your secured cc will be converted to a regular one make sure to have the statement balance in the range of 10 30 of your credit limit to get the best results would it make much better sense to wait till i get a job then i would    have a fixed monthly salary and can apply for a regular cc directly you can apply but you 'll probably be rejected as i mentioned in another answer elsewhere the system in the us is such that you 're unable to get credit if you do n't already have credit which is kindof a magic circle which you can break with the secured credit card as the least costly solution

i think the discrepancy you are seeing is in the detail of what happens once you pay off your student loan   if you take your monthly payment for your student loan and apply that to your mortgage once the student loan is payed off paying the highest interest loan will out ahead    if on the other hand you take your student loan payment and do something else with it not pay down your mortgage you would be better off paying on your mortgage   say you have $ 1000 to put towards either loan and there is 5 years to pay on the student loan and 25 years to pay on the mortgage   by paying on the student loan you are roughly saving 5 years of 5 interest on that $ 1000   by paying on the mortgage you are saving 25 years of 3 interest

the problem with commodities is that they do n't produce income with a stock or bond even if you never sold it to anyone or it was n't publicly traded you know you can collect the money the company makes or collect interest that 's a quantifiable income from the security by computing the present value of that income cf you can have at least a rough sense of the value of the stock or bond investment commodities on the other hand eat income insurance and storage their value comes from their practical uses e.g. in manufacturing which eventually results in income for someone and from psychological factors the psychological factors are inherently unpredictable demand due to practical uses should keep up with inflation since in principle the prices on whatever products you make from the commodity would keep up with inflation but even here there 's a danger because it may be that over time some popular uses for a given commodity become obsolete for example this commodity used to be a bigger deal than now i guess the reverse is also possible that new uses for a commodity drive up demand and prices   to the extent that metals such as silver and gold bounce around wildly much more so than inflation i find it hard to believe the bouncing is mostly due to changes in uses of the metals it seems far more likely that it 's due to psychological factors and momentum traders to me this makes metals a speculative investment and identifying a bubble in metals is even harder than identifying one in income producing assets that can more easily be valued to identify a bubble you have to figure out what will go on in the minds of a horde of other people and when it seems safest for individual investors to just assume commodities are always in a bubble and stay away the one arguable reason to own commodities is to treat them as a random bouncing number which may enhance returns as long as you rebalance even if on average commodities do n't make money over inflation this is what people are saying when they suggest owning a small slice of commodities as part of an asset allocation if you do this you have to be careful not to expect to make money on the commodities themselves i.e. they are just something to sell some of rebalance out of whenever they 've happened to go up a lot

you 're correct there 's always a conflict of interest in private professions whether you 're a cpa doctor or lawyer there 's always a possibility of backroom dealings   the only true response is that governmental bodies like the sec irs and otherwise affiliated private organizations like the can take away your license to practice send you to jail or fine you thousands of dollars and ruin your life if you 're caught   i would personally draw a line between publicly traded corporations amoral as you said and public accounting a cpa firm 's responsibility is to the public even though they are n't a governmental body accounting records are required to do business with banks and the irs without public confidence in the profession cpa firms would n't exist it 's truly an incentive to do a good job and continually gain confidence they incidentally make money along the way

disclaimer i am not canadian and have no experience with their laws and regulations there really are n't any safe short term investment options at the moment with interest rates being close to zero so just put the money aside you will need for the car and the computer maybe on a callable savings account to make at least a few dollars do not take out any loans it is very unlikely you will earn more than the cost of the loan you did n't say how much will be left but unfortunately it really is not much to go on anyway considering that you seem to have enough income to cover your expenses you could transfer the rest to your rrsp invest and just forget about it i suggest to follow this rule of thumb the growth portion of your portfolio which for you means equities should be directly related to the number of years you wo n't need to touch these funds 1 year 0 equity 2 years 10 3 years 20 and so on what 's not in equities you could put in short term bonds meaning an average duration of about 3 years needless to say single stocks bonds are out of question ideally you can find 2 etfs one for stocks and one for bonds respectively however if there is any possibility you did not mention that you could suddenly depend on this money you have to keep your equity exposure and thus your potential earnings low just a humble thought i really do n't know your specific situation my apologies if i 'm out of line often disability means that you are not capable of doing one particular thing anymore i.e. work physically just maybe you would still be capable to do some other type of work maybe even from the comfort of your home that would allow you to generate a certain income and also keep you busy   i hope this helps good luck

tax cuts do lead to economic growth and why not   more money circulating in the private economy is good for everybody   it ’s why the stock market is up big on the prospect for tax cuts   the problem is the rosy growth projections that accompany these plans   the growth will occur but the pace of growth is a big question and very hard to model   so a prudent policy proposal would be to cut spending as well while the growth   then hopefully that spending cut becomes permanent as the economy grows so the private economy grows at the expense of the state

i doubt you will get an answer equal to you ca n't save when you have debt because most mortgages are for decades very few people would be able to save for retirement if they had to wait to be mortgage free the difficulty in saving occurs when the interest rate is very high 18 or more and the interest is not deductible such as with credit cards the minimum payment for your mortgage is 30 of your income if that does n't include taxes and homeowners insurance in the 30 then for the united states that would be considered too large while the general plan to pay down the mortgage is a good idea make sure that you are able to handle the minimum payments before starting to increase the payments try the minimum for a year or two before getting aggressive the calculation is based on the interest rate of the mortgage the interest rate of the savings account and the potential tax deduction of the mortgage and the tax rate on the earned interest putting extra money into a mortgage but missing out on matching retirement money would also have to be figured into the calculation make sure you do save for retirement kids education and emergencies unless your country has a complex system where the money can flow in and out of the mortgage then once you put extra money into the mortgage you ca n't get it back when the car dies   the nice thing about putting extra money into a mortgage is that you can do it either in an organized way or only when you feel comfortable so it is not urgent for you to commit to a plan immediately one thing to avoid is a plan that charges you a fee to add extra money or charges a fee to switch to a bi weekly mortgage while your ideas is good these plans should never cost any money to start and may be a scam if a 3rd party gets between you and the lender

you 're right about your suspicions i 'm not a professional i suggest you talk to a real one a one with cpa ea or attorney credentials and license in your state but i would be very cautious in this case the irs will look at all the facts and circumstances to make a claim but my guess would be that the initial claim would be for this to be taxable income for your husband he 'd have to prove it to be otherwise it does seem to be related to his performance and i doubt that had they not known him through his employment they 'd give him such a gift i may be wrong so may be an irs revenue officer but i 'd bet he 'd think the same did they give gifts like that to anyone else if they did was it to other employees or they gave similar gifts to all their friends and family did those who gave your husband a gift file a gift tax return had they paid the gift tax were they principles in the partnership or they were limited partners i.e. not the ones with authority to make any decision was your husband instrumental in making their extraordinary profit or his job was not related to the profits these people made these questions are about the facts and circumstances of the transaction based on what he can find out and other potential information your husband will have to decide whether he can reasonably claim that it was a gift beware unreasonable claims lead to equally unreasonable penalties and charges irs and your state will definitely want to know more about this transaction its not an amount to slide under the radar this is not a matter where you can rely on a free opinions written by amateurs who do n't know the whole story you or rather your husband are highly encouraged to hire a paid professional a cpa ea enrolled agent or tax attorney with enough experience in fighting gift vs income characterization issues against the irs and the state do n't forget your state an experienced professional may be able to identify something in the facts and the circumstances of the situation that would lead to reducing the tax bill or shifting it to the partners but it is not something you do on your own

you will find lots of rules of thumb but there is no universal truth to how much you should save there are factors you do need to consider though you should start as early as possible to set money aside for retirement you should then use a retirement calculator to at least get an understanding of the amount you need to set aside each month to achieve the desired retirement income your default should be not to spend money and only spend money when you must leisure travel and eating out should come last after you have saved up you should have funds for different terms for example my wife and i have an emergency fund for unexpected expenses or losses in income the rule of thumb here generally is to have 3 6 months of salary saved up a longer term fund should be created for larger expenses like buying a car or preparing the on a property finally the retirement fund which should cover your needs after you have retired

first of all kudos to you for seeing the value in saving at a young age there are several different things you can mean by this and i 'm not sure which is accurate so i am going to address the first two that i thought of if you are selling your investments because you need the money emergency expenses saved enough for a short term goal whatever the reason then this may not be the best solution for your savings   investing in mutual funds etfs stocks 401k ira etc are typically for longer term goals such as a goal that is 10 + years away maybe buying a home paying for college for your children retirement etc if you are selling your investments because you believe that another investment is performing better and you want to get in on that one instead what i would suggest is leaving the money you have invested where it is and starting future investments in the new fund etf you are interested in   for example if you have $ 2000 invested in fund x and now you do some research and fund q looks more appealing that is great start investing in fund q with your next deposit   any research you do will be based on past results there is nothing that guarantees that fund q will continue doing better than the fund x you already have   trying to time the market rarely ends well for the investor i would encourage you to continue saving money a bit at a time just like you have been doing   avoid selling your investments until it is time to sell them for whatever goal you intended them for   set aside some cash to cover any unexpected expenses so you wo n't have to sell your investments to cover the costs even at 18 unplanned things happen

being the geek that i am i actually developed a financial model of a few different career salary scenarios when i graduated in 2000 while it may not matter from a financial pov it 's a nice thing to reference later on to help you stick with your financial goals my recommendation would be to not factor in inflation upfront build a model based on the current value of money you course correct things in the future when inflation starts kicking in also your retirement income requirements will vary dramatically depending on other decisions that you make ie kids mortgage college etc if achieving the lifestyle that you desire 10 20 or 30 years down the road looks difficult because your salary is n't keeping up with your earnings savings goals you need to either re evaluate your priorities or look for better compensation

last question first   the amount borrowed will not transfer to your loved ones upon death   even if you were age 50 it is somewhat unlikely you will die in 30 years first question   are you okay with having a student loan that long   keep in mind that making payments for that long will hinder your ability to build wealth buy a home and have disposable income presumably you are used to living like a college student   if you continue to do so and maybe take on another job for the time you used to spend in school you could be done with this much sooner   2k month is doable and retires this in 5 years but i would shoot for a shorter time frame than that hopefully by purposely incurring that much debt you bought yourself a high paying career

if you have complicated taxes own a business many houses you are self employed you are a contractor etc etc a person can make the most of your situation if you are a w-2 single job maybe with a family the programs are going to be so close to spot on that the extra fees are n't worth it i would never bother using hr block or liberty or those tax places that pop up   use the software or in my state sometimes municipalities put on tax help days at the library to assist in filling out the forms if you have tough taxes get a dedicated professional based on at least a few recommendations

like keshlam mentioned insurance and investment should not generally be mixed term insurance is the best and cheapest insurance this would work out better than money back option you have i.e. take a term insurance for the same amount invest the difference between the premium of term insurance and money back option even if you invest this difference in bank fd 's the return is much more than what your money back policy gives pension plans are not advisable although has in recent times streamlined quite a bit of it there is still some amount that goes into commission plus the returns from annuity providers the yearly payment you get after retirement is less than what you get from fd 's i.e. currently the annuity rates are in the range of 5 6 and one year fd 's are in the range of 7 8 the only reason one need to go with pension plan or money bank plan would be if one is not financially disciplined or ca n't   reconcile to the fact that term insurance in spite of not giving any returns is much better

i 'm not saying that they should n't be allowed to default   what i 'm saying is that if they ca n't pay back their debts then they should default   the article makes it sound like argentina deserves to be let off the hook and pay back only a portion of its debt   in the short term this seems appealing because the investors get back some of the money as opposed to none and argentina gets to keep it 's economy intact   however this sets a dangerous precedent in the long run because countries know they have this out and may issue bonds expecting not to pay the full amount   i think it is good that argentina is being made an example of this way countries will think twice before borrowing money they may not be able to pay back and will lead to more stability in the long run

forex trading contracts are generally fairly short dated as you mention   months to weeks   professional forex traders often extend the length of their bet by rolling monthly or quarterly contracts   closing a contract out a few days before it would expire and a new contract for the next quarter month   this process can be rather expensive and time consuming for a retail investor however a more practical but also not great method would be to look into currency etfs   the etfs generally do the above process for you and are significantly more convenient   however depending on the broker these may not be available and when available can be illiquid and/or expensive even in major currency pairs   it 's worth a bunch of research before you buy note in both cases you are in a practical sense doubling your nok exposure as your home currency is nok as well   this may be riskier than many people would care to be with their retirement money   an adverse move would at the same time you would lose money make it much to buy foreign goods which frankly is most goods in a small open country like norway the most simple solution would be to overweight local nok stocks or if you believe stocks are overvalued as you mention nok denominated bonds   with this you keep your nok exposure a currency you believe will appreciate without doubling it as well as add expected returns above inflation from the stock growth dividends or bond real interest rates

that may be true but what will happen is that every carrier raises prices in an oligopoly it will be an opportunity to act as an so maybe after a while costs will be driven down but in the short it will probably only raise prices and also it creates a situation where the a service that was previously accessible to all customers will now only be available to the ones willing to pay whatever the cost of an actual human behind the telephone is   so in the short run it will only increase telecom costs also since having a phone or internet in something you can just opt out of everyone will be more or less forced to accept this practice again the oligopoly is where can find the cause

i fear this question may be impossible to answer beyond the options you already seem to know about   it depends too much on the details of your situation some of which you say you do n't know   if you do n't even know how much debt you have i think you 're going to need some kind of professional advice to assess your situation   one place to start is the national foundation for credit counseling   this organization can provide free or low cost advice about your situation including bankruptcy options that said the main missing piece i see in your question is your expenses   the first thing you should ask yourself is what am i spending money on and can i stop spending on money on that in order to save and/or pay off debt instead   you say that you can live comfortably paycheck to paycheck and routinely put money into savings   can you start living and thus put a lot more into savings or towards debt repayment   whether this will work or not depends on how much debt you have but it definitely needs to be part of your thought process likewise if you continually are wiped out by expenses start budgeting for them

based on my research the answer is both you would pay taxes on the bitcoin you mine as income and then capital gains tax when you sell them for a profit or capital loss if you lose value on the sale   you can write off a portion of your electricity bill and hardware purchased for the use of mining as a business expense but it 's recommended that you consult a tax professional for determining the proper amount that is eligible for a deduction   from forbes new bitcoin are being issued by the system roughly every 10 minutes by    a process called mining in mining computers running the bitcoin    software around the world attempt to solve math problems and the first    computer to come up with the solution adds the most recent    transactions to the ledger of all bitcoin transactions plus receives    the new bitcoins created by the system called the block reward if you are a miner and win the block reward you must record the fair    market value of bitcoin that day and mark that as an addition to your    personal or business income also note the date and timestamp at which    your coins were mined later when you dispose of those bitcoin you    will subtract the date of acquisition from the date of disposal and    you will be taxed a long term capital gains rate on any bitcoin you    held for more than a year and a short term capital gains rate on any    bitcoin you held for a year or less the timestamp is n’t absolutely    necessary but is helpful to validate the order of multiple    acquisitions or within a day the amount you pay in taxes on a long term capital gain will depend on    your income tax bracket while short term capital gains are taxed the    same as ordinary income from   another clarification in the irs 's march notice was how mining should    be treated mining is income on the day of receipt of any coins and    at the fair value of those coins this means that if you mined any    bitcoins or alt coins either solo as part of a pool or through a    cloud provider you need to report any coins you received as income where it is less clear is what that dollar value might be since the    fair value is not always as easy to determine   bitcoins    are all examples of where there is a direct usd market and    so you can easily find out their value of any given day however a    newly created alt coin that was mined in its early days has no direct    market and so how do you determine its value or for any alt coin    e.g. abc coin that has no direct usd market but does have a btc    market does it have a value do you have to make a conversion from    abc to btc to usd   since there is no clarification yet from the irs on    this issue you should discuss how to proceed with your own tax    professional has taken a prudent approach and calculates    value where a fiat or btc market exists converting an alt coin to btc    to usd as necessary and from bitcoin magazine the irs also stated mined bitcoins are treated as immediate income at    the market value of those mined coins on their date of mining most do n’t know they can write off any losses they have said    founder the irs allows you to offset income by up to    $ 3,000 per year on capital losses   if you have losses and you are n’t    writing them off then it ’s like throwing money away nobody likes    doing taxes but if you can owe less or increase your return then    doing your bitcoin taxes often results in a benefit in fact the    majority of our users are filing a capital loss which means they ’ve    actually saved money by using our tool   also gives insight for miners   mining is considered income so know the price of bitcoin at the time    you mined it he said if you make money on bitcoin trading the irs    requires that you report gains with line level detail   the    appropriate form for that is 8949 a sub form of schedule d. gains and    losses as outlined above are treated like every other capital asset

yes two years after your first contribution to the simple ira you can roll it to a traditional ira   you can still contribute pre tax but the mechanism will be slightly different since with an employer plan the contribution was automatically deducted from your paycheck   with an individual plan you make the contributions yourself and then get a tax deduction when you file   since contributions to traditional and roth iras combined are capped at $ 5,500 if you 're under 50 some sort of employer sponsored plan might be better from a contribution standpoint if your institution offers some sort of plan other than a 401(k you might still want to roll to a traditional ira since you will have much more flexibility in the investments you choose on the flip side if that thought is overwhelming having a smaller set of options might be better for your peace of mind

this is a complicated subject because professional traders do n't rely on brokers for stock quotes   they have access to market data using level ii terminals which show them all of the prices buy and sell for a given stock    every publicly traded stock at least in the u.s. relies on firms called market makers   market makers are the ones who ultimately actually buy and sell the shares of companies making their money on the difference between what they bought the stock at and what they can sell it for   sometimes those margins can be in hundreds of a cent per share but if you trade enough shares well it adds up the most widely traded stocks apple microsoft bp etc may have hundreds of market makers who are willing to handle share trades   each market maker sets their own price on what they 'll pay the bid to buy someone 's stock who wants to sell and what they 'll sell the ask that share for to someone who wants to buy it    when a market maker wants to be competitive he may price his bid ask pretty aggressively because automated trading systems are designed to seek out the best bid ask prices for their trade   as such you might get a huge chunk of market makers in a popular stock to all set their prices almost identically to one another   other market makers who are n't as enthusiastic will set less competitive prices so they do n't get much maybe no business   in any case what you see when you pull up a stock quote is called the best bid ask price   in other words you 're seeing the highest price a market maker will pay to buy that stock and the lowest price that a market maker will sell that stock   you may get a best bid from one market maker and a best ask from a different one   in any case consumers must be given best bid ask prices market makers actually control the prices of shares   they can see what 's out there in terms of what people want to buy or sell and they modify their prices accordingly   if they see a bunch of sell orders coming into the system they 'll start dropping prices and if people are in a buying mood then they 'll raise prices market makers can actually ignore requests for trades whether buy or sell if they choose to and sometimes they do which is why a limit order a request to buy sell a stock at a specific price regardless of its current actual price that someone places may go unfilled and die at the end of the trading session   no market maker is willing to fill the order nowadays these systems are largely automated so they operate according to complex rules defined by their owners   very few trades actually involve human intervention because people ca n't digest the information at a fast enough pace to keep up with automated platforms so that 's the basics of how share prices work   i hope this answered your question without being too confusing good luck

there are people well companies who make money doing roughly what you describe but not exactly they 're called market makers their value for x% is somewhere on the scale of 1 that is to say a scale at which almost everything is volatile but they use leverage shorting and hedging to complicate things to the point where it 's nothing like a simple as making a 1 profit every time they trade their actions tend to reduce volatility and increase liquidity the reason you ca n't do this is that you do n't have enough capital to do what market makers do and you do n't receive any advantages that the exchange might offer to official market makers in return for them contracting to always make both buy bids and sell offers at different prices hence the bid offer spread they have to be able to cover large short term losses on individual stocks but when the stock does n't move too much they do make profits from the spread the reason you ca n't just buy a lot of volatile stocks assuming i do n't make too many poor choices is that the reason the stocks are volatile is that nobody knows which ones are the good choices and which ones are the poor choices so if you buy volatile stocks then you will buy a bunch of losers so what 's your strategy for ensuring there are n't too many supposing that you 're going to hold 10 stocks with 10 of your money in each what do you do the first time all 10 of them fall the day after you bought them or maybe not all 10 but suppose 75 of your holdings give no impression that they 're going to hit your target any time soon do you just sit tight and stop trading until one of them hits your x% target in which case you start to look a little bit more like a long term investor after all or are you tempted to change your strategy as the months and years roll by if you will eventually sell things at a loss to make cash available for new trades then you can not assess your strategy as if you always make an x% gain since that is n't true if you do n't ever sell at a loss then you 'll inevitably sometimes have no cash to trade with through picking losers the big practical question then is when that state of affairs persists for how long and whether it 's in force when you want to spend the money on something other than investing so sure if you used a short term time machine to know in advance which volatile stocks are the good ones today then it would be more profitable to day trade those than it would be to invest for the long term investing on the assumption that you 'll only pick short term winners is basically the same as assuming you have that time machine there are various strategies for analysing the market and trying to find ways to more modestly do what market makers do which is to take profit from the inherent volatility of the market the simple strategy you describe is n't complete and can not be assessed since you do n't say how to decide what to buy but the selling strategy sell as soon as i 've made x% but not otherwise can certainly be improved if you 're keen you can test a give strategy for yourself using historical share price data or current share price data run an imaginary account and see how you 're doing in 12 months when using historical data you have to be realistic about how you 'd choose what stocks to buy each day or else you 're just cheating at when using current data you have to beware that there might not be a major market slump in the next 12 months in which case you wo n't know how your strategy performs under conditions that it inevitably will meet eventually if you run it for real you also have to be sure in either case to factor in the transaction costs you 'd be paying and the fact that you 're buying at the offer price and selling at the bid price you ca n't trade at the headline mid market price finally you have to consider that to do pure technical analysis as an individual you are in effect competing against a bank that 's on top of the exchange to get fastest possible access to trade it has a and a team of kids and it 's trying to find and extract the same opportunities you are this is not to say the ca n't do well but there are systematic reasons not to just assume you will so folks investing for their retirement generally prefer a low risk strategy that plays the averages and settles for taking long term trends

these are all factually correct claims s corporation is a pass through entity so whatever gain you have on the corporate level is passed to the shareholders if your s corp has capital gains you 'll get your pro rata share of the capital gains interest the same dividends you get it on your k-1 earned income taxed as such to you i.e. whether you earn income as a s corp or as a sole proprietor matters not that 's the answer to your bottom line question the big issue however is this you can not have more than 25 passive income in your s corp you pass that limit three consecutive years one off is ok your s corp automatically converts to c corp and you 're taxed at the corporate level at the corporate rates you then lose the capital gains rates personal brackets etc this means that an s corp can not be an investment company most of its income has to be earned not passive another problem with s corp is that people who work as self proprietors incorporated as s corp try to abuse it and claim that the income they earned by the virtue of their own personal performance should n't be taxed as self employed income irs upon such a position and if considerable amounts are at stake will take you all the way up to the tax court to prove you wrong this has happened before you should talk to a licensed tax adviser ea cpa attorney licensed in your state to educate you about what s corp is and how it is taxed and whether or not it is appropriate for you

there 's no reason for the employer not to deduct the whole amount before you leave the fsa salary deduction has to be periodical but it does n't have to be calculated over a year it just means that an equal amount will be deducted from your every paycheck and if the employer and you know that your last paycheck is on june 30th even before the year starts there 's nothing to stop the employer from calculating the periodic payments so that it will cover your full fsa amount before you leave that is of course other than mere convenience it may be easier cheaper to just give you the extra $ than to deal with the special case deduction calculation this is different from unexpected termination resignation where the employer could n't have made such an assumption and thus the periodic payments were calculated over a year see pub 969 the selection is annual the deductions are periodical

indeed there is conservation of money   if the insurance companies have those big buildings and television commercials and ceos then that money comes from only one place the insurance premiums of customers   to say insurance is a good deal is either the benefit and cost of insurance for most indeed of all the answers here james 's is best   if you ca n't afford to lose something it is vital to insure it   ideally insurance would be a non profit operation to best cover this   such that people would as a whole lose nothing   theoretically it could even be slightly for profit by making wise investment decisions and benefiting from the future value of money by beating inflation   but they do n't see this writeup for slightly dated information on health and this wikipedia article for more direction but even if you are taking an average loss by using a profit making insurance company by taking insurance you avoid the situation where you 're crippled by a catastrophe   you are paying a fee to hedge your losses   like james said insure what you can not afford to lose   but realize you 're going into a situation where the overall net is an average loss of between 10 50 of your money on average   basically you 're playing the lottery except your net losses mostly go to fund the company and the ceos rather than nominally support education but you sounded like you understood those ideas well so    can you self insure as others noted yes there is the option of self insurance in most places   even even often when insurance is considered as required   for example in the us basically car insurance coverage is required   but generally you are legally able to self insure to cover this requirement    the cost of self insuring there is one cost to self insure time   it takes time to research the laws time to to satisfy those requirements and then time to find setup all the care providers doctors mechanics lawyers etc when is it worth it   first again you must satisfy the prerequisite you are able to financially handle the loss of the topic under consideration at a commenter 's request here is an attempt to better spell out this requirement though it does n't appear pertinent to the question asked it is indeed very important not to mistakenly assume you satisfy this requirement can you comfortably cover the level of insurance you would otherwise be taking out   $ is a common reasonable insurance level so that would be $ 200,000   basically have enough money to cover the loss of your car your possible injury expenses and most importantly the damage and medical of anyone else you hit   you would need to have that value available optimally in your accounts   alternatively you could weigh it against your assets such that if you had low accounts but a paid off $ 200,000 house you could conceivably sell your property and still be able to survive financially afterwards   however it is indeed dangerous to make this assumption as there may be additional costs and troubles in selling assets and you may fail to recognize how precious the property is to you   having at least double or triple in property you 'd be willing to part with might be a more comfortable number   again the main idea is can you afford to lose the insured value tomorrow   though you hope it would n't happen if someone came and took $ 200,000 + of yours tomorrow would you be able to adjust to it relatively easily   if the answer is yes you 've satisfied this requirement   in many states it 's easier to understand whether you can meet this requirement it instead becomes can you take out the liability bond required if you 've met that requirement then it comes down to the time you 'd lose versus the savings you 'd gain   to get a fair idea you 'll need the premium you would pay to purchase the insurance since you are likely losing 10 50 of your premiums it should be fair to make a rough estimate of value lost by using 25 for most purposes especially given that this still ignores the future value opportunity cost of your money which could often be 5 10 if invested well the value of your time   you must properly identify either    a rough estimate of how much time it will take you to research the legal requirements and meet them and then to research handle the subsequent needs that come up which the insurance would take care of in an average year   so try to balance those typical years where you would n't have a lot of work to do with a year where you 'd need to call repair mechanics or find health practitioners   perhaps aim high research calling usually takes more time than we think    is this calculation positive your estimated net annual benefit or cost from self insuring is 0.25 insurance premium per year estimated value of your hours of to self insure per year   this is a rough estimate   but if the result is quite positive and you can afford to cover the hit the insurance would otherwise cover you 're likely better off self insuring if the result is quite negative or you ca n't cover the possible costs insurance would cover you 're probably better off buying insurance finally indeed there are still a few other factors on each side to consider most often those additional pluses and minuses probably are smaller than the primary cost benefits out earlier   but if you 're rich enough to have the money you 're in a situation where you can likely sacrifice a little income to have your peace of mind   so there 's certainly a lot to consider in it   but if you 're a self starter i believe you 're right that you 'll find it 's more worthwhile to self insure if you indeed have the resources

one idea if you came up with a model to calculate a fair price range for a stock then any time the market price were to go below the range it could be a buy signal and above the range it could be a sell signal there are many ways to do stock valuation using fundamental analysis tools and ratios dividend discount model peg etc see wikipedia stock valuation and while many of the inputs to such a fair price range calculation might only change once per quarter market prices and peer sector statistics move more frequently or at different times and could generate signals to buy sell the stock even if its own inputs to the calculation remain static over the period for multinationals that have a lot of assets and income denominated in other currencies foreign exchange rates provide another set of interesting inputs i also think it 's important to recognize that with fundamental analysis there will be extended periods when there are no buy signals for a stock because the stocks of many popular profitable companies never go on sale except perhaps during a panic moreover during a bull market and especially during a bubble there may be very few stocks worth buying fundamental analysis is designed to prevent one from overpaying for a stock so even if there is interesting volume and price movement for the stock there should still be no signal if that action happens well beyond the stock 's fair price otherwise it is n't fundamental analysis it 's technical analysis whereas technical analysis can by definition generate far more signals because it largely ignores the fundamentals which can make even an overvalued stock 's movement interesting enough to generate signals

this depends in part on who officially owns the account federally 529 plan contributions are not tax deductible regardless of ownership   anyone can contribute to a 529 plan though the earnings of the 529 plan are tax deferred and are tax free if they are used for qualified educational expenses in the state of new york the account owner is entitled to deduct up to 10,000 married filing jointly from their state taxes however that 's limited to the account owner only   if they 're not in the state of new york they may be able to have similar benefits from their home state check their rules you may have multiple accounts for one child though so if you and they both want to contribute for your child that 's perfectly fine the limits are at the taxpayer level so you can deduct $ 10k for all contributions to all children 's accounts in sum 5k per kid if you have 2 and want to contribute equally for example but they can do the same gift tax is the other relevant thing to consider   you can contribute $ 14k per year without either paying gift tax or adding it to the lifetime maximum which is currently $ but could change at any time either up or down   you can also make a one time contribution of 70k 5 years worth and have that amount exempt as if it were contributed over five years for more information on all of this see the new york 529 page for more details

while many answers correctly cite the effect of monopoly power there is a cost issue that no one has yet posted   i first recall seeing this cost effect in a managerial econ textbook perhaps 's    the theater must clean up the popcorn mess   the sales of popcorn elsewhere does not usually include the costs of disposal because that cost is not borne by the vendor    in a theater the cost of disposal which is a variable cost depending on the amount and type of sold is borne by the vendor who must pay employees to clean up between shows and at the end of the night   while most people are responsible with popcorn there is a long tail of more and more costly messes left by the customer   and if the theater the cost of cleaning the messes then rats with long tails will bite into future customer demand for tickets whether this cost effect is as large as the monopoly power effect and the synergy in willingness to pay between entertainment and is not clear   all of these effects may be in operation

gt;no it has the intellectual rigor of saying that if you want to claim something then you have to prove it not parrot some propaganda that has been repeated endlessly without any proof   where 's my proof where 's my proof    you 're the one arguing for a change away from the status quo here to something that not only is entirely untested but requires everyone to do it at once and everyone to think just like you do for it to work properly it 's nothing but hypotheticals yet you 're saying the burden of proof is on me to prove that your hypothetical scenarios wo n't work    that 's not a thing you can do you ca n't prove a negative all i can do is say look around at all the free markets and populations we have now living in perfect harmony with each other and the environment oh wait they do n't exist because they do n't work in the real world    any advantage is going to be used to the competition with until you have a monopoly quasi state and it relies on the population being informed in and believing in the system enough to make a conscious effort to not buy the cheaper goods at the store with the bad business practices or potentially drive further to a different store if it 's the store doing the bad practice    charter free market you can only have one    so you 're saying there can never be a truly free market then because it strikes me that companies trading without regulatory oversight as the british dutch portuguese spanish etc did is pretty much as close as we can get they made huge huge profits of course but at the cost of a lot of human misery in fact you can look at a lot of what the british did in the 19th century as semi case studies for this as they had a proper hard on for the free market no government bailout for the famine in ireland because they did n't want to foster dependency on the state let private charities do it instead look it up people donated but not anywhere near enough to alleviate the human misery it also got all caught up in religious bullshit which did n't help matters you had little kids getting their arms ripped off by textile looms for fucks sake people working 14 hour days but it made more money than working in the fields so worth right    gt;in what way people do n't suddenly cease to have resources to deal with these things just because their resources are not forcibly centralized that does n't follow   because the pooling of vast resources for disaster relief is something that states do because there are efficiencies of scale to be had with the military the us military was a huge player in the disaster response to disasters like the boxing day tsunami and hurricane you have like and the red cross doing great and very quickly but they just ca n't provide the same resources a modern navy can in the same time wiki it turns out you face a lot of the same problems in a modern as you do in a humanitarian crisis again charities just do n't get the funding to do this sort of thing on the same scale there was a huge amount of funding dropped on the 2004 tsunami from many countries but you ca n't build a hospital ship in two weeks or a nuclear reactor to provide monumental amounts of fresh water or the helicopters and operational procedures to tie everything together many thousands more would have died without their presence    gt;what evidence or reason you have to believe that hundreds of millions of people would have died in a century without governments   this is my point neither you nor i have any evidence to base this off rather than a tendency for people to be utter bastards to each other looking at history you 're that if all governments in a puff of smoke there would n't be huge conflict in the resulting power vacuum    did not try to carry out genocide   yeah good one there were n't any anarchists in a position to do any of that great straw man    and that statement by is just that a statement why is the burden of proof on the statists it 's the anarchists who are arguing for the change in the status quo you 're the one making the claim that it would be a better system here with nothing to back it up but well people probably would n't start murdering each other pretty low bar there tbh   but if you want reasoning see my previous point if it 's such a better system if people wo n't exploit every advantage they can get and distort the free market if people would n't try and the system for their own personal gain why do we have states right now would any anarchist state region not have simply outperformed neighbours if it 's so much more efficient

there are certain allowable reasons to withdraw money from a 401k.   the desire to free your money from a bad plan is not one of them    a rollover is a special type of withdrawal that is only available after one leaves their current employer   so as long as you stay with your current company you can not rollover   exception if you are over age   59.5 one option is to talk to hr see if they can get a expansion of offerings   you might have some suggestions for mutual funds that you would like to see   the smaller the company the more likely you will have success here   that being said there is some research to support having few choices   too many choices people it 's quite popular to have target funds   that is funds that target a certain retirement year   being that i will be 50 in 2016 i should invest in either a 2030 or fund   these are a collection of funds that rebalances the investment as they age   the closer one gets to retirement the more goes into bonds and less into stocks    however i think such rebalancing is not as smart as the experts say   imho is almost always better off heavily invested in equity funds   so this becomes a second option   invest in a target fund that is meant for younger people   in my case i would put into a 2060 or even target as joetaxpayer pointed out even in a plan that has high fees and poor choices one is often better off contributing up to the match   then one would go outside and contribute to an individual roth or ira income restrictions may apply then back into the 401 k until the desired amount is invested    you could always move on to a different employer and ask some really good questions about their 401k.   which leads me back to talking with hr   with the current technology shortage making a few tweaks to the 401 k is a very cheap way to make their employees happy if you can score a 1099 contracting gig you can do a sep which allows up to a whopping 53 k per year   no match but with typically higher pay sometimes overtime and a high contribution limit you can easily make up for it

4.7 is a pretty low rate especially if you are deducting that from your taxes   if you reduce the number by your marginal tax rate to get the real cost of the money you end up with a number that is n't far off from inflation and also represents a pretty low yield in terms of paying off the loan early   e.g.   if your marginal tax rate is 28 then the net you are paying in interest after the tax deduction is 4.7 = while i 'm all for paying off loans with higher rates since it 's in effect the same as making that much risk free on the money it does n't make a lot of sense when you are down at 3.4 unless there is a strong security factor which really makes a difference to some folks to be had that really helps you sleep at night   to be realistic for some folks close to retirement there can be a lot to be said for the security of not having to worry about house payments although you do n't seem to be in that situation yet   as others have said first make sure you have enough liquid emergency money in something like a money market account or a ladder of short term cd 's   if you are sure that the sprouts will be going to college then there 's a lot to be said for kicking a decent amount into a 529 coverdell esa educational savings account uniform gift to minors account or some combination of those   i 'm not sure if any of those plans can be used for a kid that has not been born yet however   i 'd recommend as a good starting point to get more information on your various options    as with retirement savings money put in earlier has a lot more power over the final balance due to compounding interest so there 's a lot to be said for starting early although depending on what it takes to qualify for the plans there could be such a thing as too early there 's nothing wrong with managed mutual funds as long as the fund objective and investing style is in alignment with your objectives and risk tolerance the fund is giving you a good return relative to the market as a whole you are not paying high fees or load charges you are not losing a lot to taxes   i would always look at the return after expenses when comparing to other options and if the money is not in a tax deferred account also look at what sort of tax burden you will be faced with   a fund that trades a lot will generate more short term gains which means more taxes than compared to a more passive fund   anything lost to taxes is money lost to you so needs to come out of the total return when you calculate that   sometimes such funds are better off as a choice inside an ira or 401 k and you can instead use more tax efficient vehicles for money where you have to pay the taxes every year on the gains the reason a lot of folks like index funds better is that given your described age it 's not appropriate now but in the long run as you get closer to retirement you may want to start looking at building up some investments that are geared more towards generating income such as bonds or depending on taxes where you live municipal bonds   in any case the more money you can set aside for retirement now both inside and outside of tax deferred accounts the sooner you will get to the point of the critical mass you need to retire at that point you can work because you want to not because you have to

this is a simple solution because you do n't have to monitor a person 's trades over time or even their frequency implementing this in the modern computer exchanges seems trivial to me asking an exchange to monitor each trader 's trades to ensure no hfts seems full of loopholes ask a computer to execute hfts across multiple trader ids for example and i think is a distraction suggestion   the reason that i think these taxes do n't get is as correctly states these taxes empower the government which is something that a lot of political players republicans libertarians and anarchists do n't want i have always wondered what would happen if these fees were imposed by the government implemented by the exchanges but all money went to say the american red cross i think that that would be a pretty good idea   finally i also want to mention that the government plays a large role in markets already for example enforcing contracts managing and preventing fraud are all things that the government does to ensure that markets work well this is another simple thing the the government can do to reduce market uncertainty and make our financial markets work better

this answer relies on why you are holding shares of a company in the first place so let 's address that so does this mean you would like to vote with your shares on the directions the company takes if so your reasons for selling would be different from the next speculator who only is interested in share price volatility regardless of your participation in potential voting rights associated with your share ownership a different reason to sell is based on if your fundamental reasons for investing in the company have changed   enhancements on this topic include trade management how to deal with position sizes buying and selling partial positions based on price action while keeping a core long term position but this is not something long term investors generally put too much effort in price targets start your long term investment with a price target in mind derived from a future market cap based on your initial fundamental analysis of the company 's prospects and finally there are a lot of things you can do with a profitable investment in shares

the optimal time period is zero seconds   put it all in immediately   dollar cost averaging reduces the risk that you will be buying at a bad time no one knows whether now is a bad or great time but brings with it reduction in expected return because you will be keeping a lot of money in cash for a long time   you are reducing your risk and your expected return by dollar cost averaging it 's not crazy to trade expected returns for lower risk   people do it all the time   however if you have a pot of money you intend to invest and you do so over a period of time then you are changing your risk profile over time in a way that does n't correspond to changes in your risk preferences   this is contrary to finance theory and is not optimal   the optimal percentage of your wealth invested in risky assets is proportional to your tolerance for risk and should not change over time unless that tolerance changes dollar cost averaging makes sense if you are setting aside some of your income each month to invest   in that case it is simply a way of being invested for as long as possible   having a pile of money sitting around while you invest it little by little over time is a misuse of dollar cost averaging bottom line forcing dollar cost averaging on a pile of money you intend to invest is not based in sound finance theory   if you want to invest all that money do so now   if you are too risk averse to put it all in then decide how much you will invest invest that much now and keep the rest in a savings account indefinitely   do n't change your investment allocation proportion unless your risk aversion changes there are many people on the internet and elsewhere who preach the gospel of dollar cost averaging but their belief in it is not based on sound principles   it 's just a dogma the language of your question implies that you may be interested in sound principles so i have given you the real answer

i know that both lowes and home depot in canada at least will offer a 6 month deferred interest payment on all purchases over a certain dollar amount iirc $ 500 + and sometimes run product specific 1 year deferred interest specials this is a very effective way of financing renovations details you 've probably seen deferred interest it 's very commonly used in furniture sales no money down no interest do not pay for 1 full year   personally i think it 's a plot by the point manufacturers it works like this typically i manage these types of purchases by dividing the principal by 6 and then adding 5 and paying that amount each month   pay close attention to the end date because you do not want to pay 22 interest on the entire amount    this also requires that you watch your card balance carefully   all payments are usually put to current purchases i.e. those not under a plan first before they are applied to the plan balance   so if you are paying 250 a month on the new floor and run up another $ 150 on paint you need to pay the entire new balance and then the $ 250 floor payment in order for it to be applied correctly   also < shameless plug > < plug >   consider doing it yourself

congratulations you 're making enough money to invest there are two easy places to start i recommend against savings accounts because they will quite safely lose your money the inflation rate is usually higher than the interest rate on a savings account you may have twice as much money after 50 years but if everything costs four times as much then you 've lost buying power if in the course of learning about investing you 'd like to try buying individual stocks do it only with money you would n't mind losing index funds will go down slightly if one of the companies in that index fails entirely but the stock of a failed company is worthless

they do n't actually need to they accept deposits for historical reasons and because they make money doing so but there 's nothing key to their business that requires them to do so here 's a decent summary but i 'll explain in great detail below by making loans banks create money this is what we mean when we say the monetary supply is at least if you believe sir king who used to run england 's central bank the only real checks on this are regulatory capitalization requirements and reserve requirements which impose a sort of tax on a bank 's circulating loans i 'll get into that later let 's start with why should you believe that story that loans create deposits it seems like a bizarre assertion but it actually matches how banks behave in practice if you go borrow money from a bank the loan officer will do many things she 'll want to look at your credit history she 'll want to look at your income and assets she 'll want to look at what kind of collateral or guarantees you 're providing that the loan will be repaid what she will not do is call down to the vaults and make sure that there 's enough bills stacked up for them to lend out loans are judged based on a profitability function determined by the interest rate and the loan risk if those add up to profitable the bank makes the loan so the limiting factor on the loans a bank makes are the available creditworthy borrowers not the bank 's stock of cash further the story makes sense because loans are how banks make money if a bank that was short of money suddenly stopped making loans it 'd be screwed no new loans = no way to make money to pay back depositors and also keep the lights on = no more bank and the story is believable because of the way banks make so little effort to solicit commercial deposit business oh sure they used to give you a free toaster if you opened an account but now it 's really quite challenging to find a no fee checking account that does n't impose a super high deposit limit and the interest paid on savings deposits is approaching zero if banks actually needed your deposits they 'd be making a lot more of effort to get them i mean they wo n't turn up their noses your deposited allowance is a couple basis points cheaper to the bank than borrowing from the fed but banks seem to value small potatoes depositors more as a source of fees and sales opportunities for services and consumer credit than as a source of cash it 's a bit different if you get north of seven figures but smaller depositors are n't really worth the hassle just for their cash this is where someone will mention the regulatory requirements of fractional reserve banking banks are obliged by regulators to keep enough cash on hand to pay out a certain percentage of deposits note nothing about loans was said in that statement this requirement does not serve as a check on the bank making bad loans because the bank is ultimately liable to all its depositors for the full value of their deposits it 's more making sure they have enough liquidity to prevent bank runs the self fulfilling prophecy in which an bank could be forced into bankruptcy as you noted in your question banks can always borrow from the fed at the fed discount rate or from other banks at the interbank overnight rate which is a little lower to meet this requirement they do have to pledge collateral but loans themselves are collateral so this does n't present much of a problem in terms of paying off depositors if the bank should collapse and minimizing the amount of fdic insurance payout from the government it 's really capital requirements that are actually important i.e. the bank has to have investors who do n't have a right to be paid back and whose investment is on the hook if the bank goes belly up but that 's just a safeguard for the depositors it does n't really have anything to do with loans other than that bad loans are the main reason a bank might go under banks like any other private business have assets things of value and liabilities obligations to other people but banking assets and liabilities are counterintuitive the bank 's assets are loans because they are theoretically recoverable the principal and also generate a revenue stream the interest payments the money the bank holds in deposits is actually a liability because it has to pay that money out to depositors on demand and the deposited money will never by itself bring the bank any revenue at all in fact it 's a drain because the bank needs to pay interest to its depositors well they used to anyway so what happens when a bank makes a loan from a balance sheet perspective strangely enough the answer is nothing at all if i grant you a loan the minute we shake hands and you sign the paperwork a teller types on a keyboard and money appears in your account your account with my bank my bank has simultaneously created an asset the loan you now have to repay me and an equal sized liability the funds i loaned you which are now deposited in your account i 'll make money on the deal because the interest you owe me is a much higher rate than the interest i pay on your deposits or the rate i 'd have to pay if i need to borrow cash to cover your withdrawal i might just have the cash on hand anyway from interest and origination fees and whatnot from previous loans from an accounting perspective nothing has happened to my balance sheet but suddenly you owe me closing costs and a stream of extraneous interest payments nice work if you can get it okay so i 've demonstrated that i do n't need to take deposits to make loans but we live in a world where banks do here 's a few reasons you can probably think of more but at the end of the day a bank should be designed so that if every single non borrowing depositor withdrew their deposits the bank would n't collapse or cease to exist

shorting stocks borrowing the shares to sell now then buying them back when the price drops   risk if you are wrong the stock can go up and if there are a lot of people shorting the stock you can get stuck in a short squeeze   that means that so many people need to buy the stock to return the ones they borrowed that the price goes up even further and faster   also whoever you borrowed the stock from will often make the decision to sell for you put options risk put values do n't always drop when the underlying price of the stock drops this is because when the stock drops volatility goes up and volatility can raise the value of an option and you need to check each stock for whether or not these options are available lists whether a stock is optional or not and for shorting you also need to find a broker that owns shares that they are willing to lend out

an increased pool of workers demanding the same quality of life we have fair labor and wage laws throughout the world which is how they 'd get that would result in a global middle class with countries like china india etc no longer desperately us workers for cost of production which means it will be commercially viable to have production occurring in the us again on a large scale plus more people with more money means greater demand for goods what needs to happen is in the artificial deflation of the value of labor whether that will happen or not i 'm not particularly optimistic

i answered a similar question before essentially you should n't trust a site you find on the internet merely because it looks professional and real   before signing up with any new service provider you found online you should verify the authenticity of both the organization itself and their web site address even if the name displayed by a web site represents a legitimate brokerage firm any site you happen to come across on the internet could be an elaborate of a real company intended to capture your personal details or worse first to check if a brokerage firm is in fact registered to trade securities in the united states you can consult finra 's online service   this might be the first of many checks you should undertake after you convince yourself that finra is legitimate   a meta problem then if you want to know if the web site address is authentic one way is to contact that broker offline using the contact information found from a trusted source such as the finra details   unfortunately those details do not currently appear to contain the broker 's web site url   else that could be useful another thing to look at is the site 's login or sign up page for a valid ssl certificate that is both issued to the correct legal name of the brokerage firm as well as has been signed by a well known certificate authority e.g. for a financial services firm of any kind you should look for and expect to see an extended validation certificate   any other kind of certificate might only assert that the certificate was issued to the domain name owner and not necessarily to an organization with the registered legal name   yes anybody can register a domain with a similar name and then acquire a basic ssl certificate for that domain fwiw scottrade and sharebuilder are both legitimate brokers i was aware already of each but i also just checked in the finra tool and the urls currently linked to by the question are legitimate web site addresses for each   also you can see their ev certificates in action on secured pages here and here as to whether your investments with those brokers would be safe in the event of the broker failing e.g. goes bankrupt you 'll want to know that they are members of the securities investor protection corporation wikipedia   of course this kind of protection does n't protect you if your investments simply go down in value but do your own due diligence always

unless you 're an active trader 30 trades per month is a number you 'll probably never hit so you might as well take advantage of the offer while you have it but do n't trade more than you normally would discount brokerages make money on the arbitrage between the bid and ask prices on the exchanges legal as long as you get a price that was available on the open market they disclose this in the fine print in your account paperwork so they want you to trade as often as they can get you to as you say it 's really just a mind game there is always a cost to doing business with a bank or brokerage they charge you fees for services and they make money on your deposits while you 're not using them so while it looks like they 're paying you interest which they are they 're not paying you all the interest they 've earned using your money so there 's the cost it was only when interest rates dropped so low that they were starting to feel it that they started rolling out more overt fees for services if you 'll notice the conditions that cause the fees to be waived in your account all lead to increased deposits or transactions either directly or indirectly if your main concern is the efficiency of your investments which by your description appear to be rather modest you should consider dollar cost averaging dca into a mutual fund of which there are plenty of high quality no load no fee options around or into a stock if your brokerage offers a lower fee dca program for stocks where you can often buy partial shares

i would disagree with your analysis   to me there are two purposes for a money market mm your emergency fund should be from 3 to 6 months of expenses   think of it of an insurance policy against murphy   you may want to have some money designated for big expenses or even sinking funds   for example i keep some money in a mm for a car as both the wife daughter and i driver older vehicles   i may need to replace them if you were planning on making a larger purchase car house boat engagement ring i would put the money in a mm fund so you are not subject to the whims of the market    after that you are free to invest all your money   its likely that you should have some money outside of tax advantaged funds so if you want to start a business you will not have to do high cost withdrawals

no virtually ever item in the cpi is adjusted using hedonics which by definition can only be used to lower inflation not adjust it up   hedonics is not necessarily bad but it does n't actually reflect inflation it reflects standard of living vs. purchasing power which is not useful for a purely monetary measure   it also does not correctly reflect that despite the fact that a 1970 's 20 tv can not from an economic standpoint be directly compared to a 2012 20 tv if the price is the same adjusted for inflation inflation represents how the value of the dollar has accrued vs the value of a 20 tv which is what the definition of inflation is   so no i do n't think you 're correct on this this is also kind of glossing over the fact that the cpi essentially makes the bold argument that energy and transportation prices never affect inflation

fund rebalancing typically refers to changing the investment mix to stay within the guidelines of the mutual fund objective   for example lets say a fund is supposed to have at least 20 in bonds   because of a dramatic increase in stock price and decrease in bond values it finds itself with only 19.9 in bonds at the end of the trading day   the fund manager would sell sufficient equities to reduce its equity holdings and buy more bonds    rebalancing is not always preferential because it could cause capital gain distribution typically once per year without selling the fund   and really any trading within the fun could do the same in the case you cite the verbiage is confusing   often times i wonder if the author knows less then the reader   it might also be a bit of a rush to get the article out and the author did not write correctly i agree that the etfs cited are suitable for short term traders   however that is because the market has increased in value over the long term   if you bet it will go down over the long term you are almost certain to lose money like you i can not figure out how rebalancing makes this suitable only for short term traders   if the etfs distribute capital gains events much more frequently then once per year that is worth mentioning but does not provide a case for short versus long term traders    secondly i do n't think these funds are doing true rebalancing   they might change investments daily for the most likely profitable outcome but that really is n't rebalancing    it seems the author is confused

when you withdraw from your rrsp you lose that contribution room and you will never get it back let 's say you have room to contribute a total of $ 50,000 to rrsps if you withdraw $ 5000 from one institution and deposit it in another you will now have a total contribution room of $ 45,000 this will only matter to you if you hope to max out your rrsp contributions sometime in your life of course but almost everyone should be aiming for this otherwise you are correct your extra income will be mitigated by your immediate to your rrsp note that there are two circumstances where withdrawing from your rrsp does not reduce your contribution limit the home buyers plan lets you withdraw up to $ 25,000 to buy a home you have to repay this over no more than 15 years the second is the lifelong learning plan which lets you withdraw up to $ 20,000 up to $ 10,000 annually to be repaid over a 10-year period any other withdrawals or failure to repay under the hbp or llp will lower your rrsp contribution room in summary it 's almost certainly worth paying the $ 125 fee unless you are certain you will not be maxing out your rrsp contributions in your lifetime

i think you will find it hard to do there are money laundering regulations which require you to provide proof of address when opening an account i do n't know for certain if they require an uk address but even if they do n't it 's very likely that individual banks etc will require that i doubt that they will view you as a profitable customer for them since you would not be using the account as your main account although having a job is n't a legal requirement in practice i think it 's the only way you can get an account without having been resident in the country for a while my company employs a significant number of people from abroad and they typically need support from the company to open an account when they first move one thing you could investigate is opening an account with some international bank with branches both in hungary and the uk and asking them to arrange the uk account for you one example of such a bank is hsbc however such banks will typically charge you a significant amount for the privilege for example with hsbc you need a premier account to get this kind of service

paypal is free for buyers taking their profit from the sellers in much the same way that credit cards take a percentage from the seller though they will also charge you interest if you do n't pay off the entire balance every month as far as i know there 's nothing that keeps a vendor from having a different price for paypal customers than cash customers but that would show up in the number displayed by paypal before you authorize the purchase so if you 're paying attention it should n't be possible to sneak it by you paypal has several modes of operation i 'm not aware of one where they hold your balance normally you either give them your credit card info or you give them information about one of your bank account(s and authorize them to do electronic funds transfer from and to that account on your behalf i 've always stuck with the credit card approach i trust paypal but i do n't trust them that far on principle if i was going to link them to an account it would be a small account i 'd create for that purpose not my main savings checking accounts hm actually i do have one account which normally floats around $ 500 it 's the one i dump accumulated pocket change into and i could use that if i ever feel a need to do so paypal does reduce the risk of credit card numbers being abused by reducing how many people you 've given the number to depending on what kinds of purchases you make that may be a security advantage it certainly does n't hurt personally i have no problem with giving my card number directly to a serious business but on ebay or sites of that sort where i 'm dealing with individuals who are complete strangers i do like the isolation that paypal provides in other words ebay is exactly the environment where i do use paypal after all that 's exactly what paypal was created for

your question is missing too much to be answered directly instead here are some points to consider short term gains taxed at your marginal rates whereas long term gains have preferable capital gains rates up to 20 tax rate instead of your marginal rate so if you 're selling at gain you might want to consider to sell fifo and pay lower capital gains tax rate instead of the short term marginal rate if you 're selling at loss and have other short term gains you would probably be better selling lifo so that the loss could offset other short term gains that you might have   if you 're selling at loss and do n't have short term gains to offset you can still offset your long term gains with short term losses but the tax benefit will be lower in this case fifo might be a better choice again if you 're selling at loss beware of the wash sale rules as you might not be able to deduct the loss if you buy sell within too short a window

when i say dark navy i just mean that conservatively for an interview etc that something like thumbs is more appropriate than media cache    what you mention as lightly is called and on a black suit can be ok but it is a tougher look to pull off and you have a better chance of looking like a someone trying to dress like their media catalog product than looking like professional media cache suit chris they are also a bold choice for an interview and may draw attention to you as someone who wants to stand out in the wrong way or have the interviewer focusing on your suit rather than the content of your talking points    getting back to black i would n't suggest a black suit period unless you 've already amassed a mid gray mid dark navy light gray and even brown or other statement color or unless you are buying a if you do wear black you should only wear a white wp content black because blue does not contrast well with media cache these are some basic rules which can be broken but in general you 'll look objectively better from a pure fashion geek sense which tends to align with public perceptions if you stick to them    this is a really good primer from 2013 in /r on suits

where are you getting the idea that i think there is any altruism whatsoever in what whole foods does you are missing the point entirely let me make it perfectly clear they are selling me what i personally want and selling it to me in the way i personally want it     every single grocery store is consumerist i 've been shopping at whole foods for almost 30 years and the reason is because whole foods has put its research into discovering what and how to serve me and then delivering the experience of shopping in a safeway 's or the like is ugly uncomfortable cold and smelly they are too big and take forever to get from one item i want to another they are filled with junk they are trying to trick me into thinking is nutritious    what makes you think whole foods is in any way more deceptive than walmart publix costco etc because they responded to a market that wanted quality food that could be traced back to it 's source why would n't they respond to that    it is a myth that wf is selling only luxury food and drink items i can go into a wf and see local produce what is so extravagant about that   gt;do you ever wonder if maybe that passion is appealed to and marketer towards by businesses   i 'm thrilled that it is that means i can access food that i want and enjoy and it costs less than it would otherwise i can buy sugar free bacon at whole foods yay i feel great about that i ca n't get that at safeway     do you think commercial food producers and other grocery outlets do n't collectively far whole foods to promote less nutritious food that is as inexpensive as possible to produce that they do n't sacrifice quality for profits     where do you live that commercial grocery chains are somehow operating from the goodness of their hearts tell yourself whatever you want but if you have the impression that wf has somehow fooling me thanks for your concern but i 'm good i love that they figured out what i want to eat and how i want to shop for it

account statements and the account information provided by your personal finance software should be coming from the same source namely your bank 's internal accounting records so in theory one is just as good as the other that being said an account statement is a snapshot of your account on the date the statement was created while with your personal finance application is dynamically generated upon request usually once a day or upon login   so what are the implications of this your account statement will not show transactions that may have taken place during that period but were n't posted until after the period ended common with credit card transactions and checks instead they 'd appear on the next statement because electronic account are more frequent and not limited to a specific time period those transactions will show up shortly after they are posted so it is far easier to keep track of your accounts electronically every personal finance software i 've ever used supports manual entries so what i like to do is on a daily basis i manually enter any transaction which was n't posted automatically this usually only takes a few minutes each evening then when the transaction eventually shows up it 's usually reconciled with my manually entered one automatically   aside from finding infrequent bank errors this has the benefit of keeping me aware of how much i 'm spending and how much i have left i 've also caught a number of cashier errors this way noticing i was double charged for an item while entering the receipt total and its the best defense against fraud and identity theft i can think of if you 're looking at your accounts on a daily basis you 're far more likely to notice an unusual transaction than any monitoring service

there are no risk free high liquidity instruments that pay a significant amount of interest   there are some money market accounts around that pay but they often have minimum balance or transaction limits    even if you could get 3 on a $ 4 k balance that would be $ 120 per year or $ 10 per month   you can do much better than that by just going to $ two less times per month or whatever you can cut from your expenses and putting that into the savings account or work a few extra hours and increase your income i appreciate the desire to maximize the return on your money but in reality increasing income and reducing expenses have a much greater impact until you build up significant savings and are able to absorb more risk   emergency funds should be highly liquid and risk free so traditional investments are n't appropriate vehicles for them

the key for you   this year 2015 be aggressive in paying the taxes quarterly so that you do not have to do the quarterly filings or pay penalties for owing too much in taxes in future years   the tax system has a safe harbor provision if you have withheld or sent via the estimated quarterly   taxes an amount equal to 100 of the previous years taxes then you are safe that means that if you end to the irs in 2015 an amount equal to 100 of your 2014 taxes then in april 2016 you can avoid the penalties you should note that the required percentage is 110 for high income individual   because you can never be sure about your side income use your ability to adjust your w-4 to cover your taxes you will know early in 2016 how much you need to cover via withholding so make the adjustments yes the risk is what you over pay but that may be what you need to do to avoid the quarterly filing requirements from irs pub 17 if you owe additional tax for 2014 you may have to pay estimated tax    for 2015 you can use the following general rule as a guide during the year to    see if you will have enough withholding or if you should increase    your withholding or make estimated tax payments   general rule     in    most cases you must pay estimated tax for 2015 if both of the    following apply you expect to owe at least $ 1,000 in tax for 2015 after subtracting your withholding and refundable credits you expect your withholding plus your refundable credits to be less than the smaller of 90 of the tax to be shown on your 2015 tax return or 100 of the tax shown on your 2014 tax return but see special rules for farmers fishermen and higher income taxpayers later your 2014 tax return must cover all 12 months and   estimated tax safe harbor for higher income taxpayers if your 2014    adjusted gross income was more than $ 150,000 $ 75,000 if you are    married filing a separate return you must pay the smaller of 90 of    your expected tax for 2015 or 110 of the tax shown on your 2014    return to avoid an estimated tax penalty

investing in gold without having physical gold is not really a hedge against inflation gld is really more for speculation not protection against serious inflation if there is any kind of inflation worth really protecting yourself against then one thing you will notice at its onset is a divergence in the price of physical and gld with gld offering very little protection if any against inflation ultimately holders of gld will demand physical metal and the physical price will rise and the paper price will fall i would advise you to study physical gold before you purchase gld for that reason edit just adding this to my answer i do n't know why i did n't put it in before and i to add that i 'm not an expert though a little investigation will show you that this is at least one option for owning gold if you think of having the physical gold yourself at one end of the spectrum and buying gld at the other so that you do n't need to take physical delivery there is another scenario which i understand is in between and sorry i do n't actually know what it 's referred to as but it 's where you buy the physical gold but instead of taking delivery the bars are stored for you in a vault these bars are numbered and you actually own what you have paid for and theoretically you could go and visit your gold and actually remove it because it 's your gold as opposed to having paper gld which in my understanding is a right to take physical delivery of gold and this is slightly different of course unlike gld you actually have to pay a storage fee and of course unlike having the physical gold buried in your garden or something you are not entirely secure against say a robbery of the vault and you are also depending on the company not to sell the same bar to more than one person but that 's the only think that their reputation is built on and a company like that would live or die by the reputation and of course you might lose the proverbial gold buried in the garden either so nothing 's 100 secure anyway really

each of us makes our own way in life making choices based upon or own needs and desires some of us choose to live simple lives others choose more complex lives where we earn and spend more there are several points which one should examine and consider consider that the market for new cars is not the entire population but only the fraction of the population that can afford to spend $ 20,000 + for a new car at $ payments you quickly realize that most people making below median income can not afford to purchase a new car they buy used cars from the pool of cars left after depreciation has reduced the price of the car by half or more one rule of thumb might be to spend < 10 of your income on transportation which might allow for a $ 400 500/month car payment for half of families and when you keep a car for 10 years that can mean two cars one payment free consider that a new honda accord or toyota camry is $ 20 30,000 which is 2/3 to 3/4 the price of a new luxury car when i purchased my used civic several years ago the price was nearly 1/2 the price of a new luxury car i recently purchased a used luxury car 7 year old 70,000 miles less than 1/3 the new price the leather interior looks new more amenities better performance than my civic the car runs well and with proper maintenance i expect to drive it for 2 3 years and pass it along to one of my children

all good points so far to build on what 's already been said remember that the market is pricing in future earnings if facebook and cisco were for the sake of argument the same book value and out the same net income the market could price facebook much higher than cisco 's because the market believes fb can return more than cisco can the idea is that facebook 's competitive position relative to its competitors and is a much more stable and defensible position than cisco 's    you 're right though that the market could be facebook 's future and being overly optimistic how do you price the fact that most people around the world who are getting access to the internet for the very first time are doing so only through facebook this probably partially explains its inflated market cap

i 'm going to assume that you will spend the money to fix the mold problem correctly   using your numbers after that is done the home is worth perhaps $ 280k to evaluate whether or not to sell the amount you have spent on the house is irrelevant the only thing you need to ask yourself is this would i spend $ 280k to buy this house today you might if you were happy with the rental income that you were getting if the house is fully rented it earns you $ 24k year which is an 8.6 return if you had purchased the house today at $ 280k of course you will have vacancies taxes and other expenses bringing that return number down figure out what that is and see if you are happy with the return based on those numbers   if you decide it would be a bad investment for you at $ 280k then sell the house   by the way this question works for any investment not just real estate when deciding whether or not to sell stock the same thing applies it is irrelevant what your cost basis is you only need to ask yourself if the stock would be a good buy for you at the current price
