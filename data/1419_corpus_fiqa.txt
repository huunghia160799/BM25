i think the answer to your question is no in theory by screening out funds you must actively manage the investments to then try to ensure you track the index closely enough you have to do further management either you spend your own time to do this or you pay someone else   this is ok but it seems contrary to the primary reasons most people choose an index fund and why the product exists you want a specific type of ethical that has lower fees and performs well i think you can get close it just wo n't be like an index fund do n't expect equal results

it sounds like you need an index fund that follows so called sustainability index a sustainability index does not simply select socially responsible industries it attempts to replicate the target market in terms of countries industries and company sizes but it also aims to select most sustainable companies from each category this document explains how dow jones sustainability world index is constructed emphasis mine an example of a fund following such index is ishares dow jones global sustainability screened etf which also excludes sin stocks

you could certainly look at the holdings of index funds and choose index funds that meet your qualifications   funds allow you to see their holdings and in most cases you can tell from the description whether certain companies would qualify for their fund or not based on that description particularly if you have a small set of companies that would be problems you could also pick a fund category that is industry specific i invest in part in a healthcare focused fund for example   pick a few industries that are relatively diverse from each other in terms of topics but are still specific in terms of industry a healthcare fund a commodities fund an reit fund   then you could be confident that they were n't investing in defense contractors or big banks or whatever you object to however if you do n't feel like you know enough to filter on your own and want the diversity from non industry specific funds your best option is likely a socially screened fund like is likely your best option given there are many similar funds in that area you might simply pick the one that is most similar to you in philosophy

it would involve manual effort but there is just a handful of exclusions   buy the fund you want plug into a tool like morningstar instant x ray   find out your $ 10k position includes $ of defense contractor lockheed martin   and sell short $ of lockheed martin   check you 're in sync periodically the fund or index balance may change when you sell the fund close your shorts too

hmm this would seem to be impossible by definition   the definition of an index fund is that it includes exactly the stocks that make up the index once you say except for then what you want is not an index fund but something else it 's like asking can i be a vegetarian but still eat beef umm no there might be someone offering a mutual fund that has the particular combination of stocks that you want resembling the stocks making up the index except with these exclusions that would n't be an index fund at that point but etc there are lots of funds out there with various ideological criteria i do n't know of one that matches your criteria i 'd say search for the closest approximation you can find you could always buy individual stocks yourself and create your own pseudo index fund depending on how many stock are in the index you are trying to match and how much money you have to invest it may not be possible to exactly match it mathematically if you would have to buy fractions of shares if the number of shares you had to buy was very small you might get killed on broker fees and i 'll upvote 's answer for being a pretty close approximation to what you want

i also do n't know the specific details for finland and/or belgium however many countries have tax treaties which generally prevent double taxation i.e. paying tax in both countries on the same base income being that both finland and belgium are eu member states i 'm quite certain there 's a provision that covers this and the same would apply you pay taxes on what you earn while in finland to finland and to belgium what you earn while in belgium all of this is similar to what you presented however there 's also a section where you 'd declare how much taxes were paid in other countries one other thing to note which will be the determining factor in the above is whether eu law requires you to change residence to be for the time you 're there if not   then you 'll be paying taxes in finland the entire time on the entire amount this comes from an irish governmental site by working in another member state and by transferring your residence there you are likely to become resident for tax purposes there the definition of fiscal residence varies from one member state to another you must comply with the laws of the country where you have established your residence the laws on personal taxation vary considerably from one member state to another and you may be liable for taxation in more than one country in general you are subject to income tax in the country where you are living but this may not be the case if you are a posted worker see below in general property is taxed in the country in which it is situated but again there are variations tax agreements have been concluded between most of the member states of the eu which are intended to avoid double taxation if you derive income from different countries in general national fiscal rules must respect the fundamental principle of non discrimination against nationals of another eu country

if you had n't done it already cut up the cards do n't close the accounts because it could hurt your credit score even more switching some or all of the cc debt onto low rate cards or a debt consolidation loan is a way that some people use to reduce their credit card payments   the biggest risk is that you become less aggressive with the loan payback if you were planning on paying $ 800 in minimum payments plus $ 200 extra each month then still pay $ 1000 with the new loan and remaining credit cards   another risk is that you start the credit card again because you have available credit on the card that was paid off with the loan the third risk which you have n't proposed occurs when people switch unsecured credit card dept to a secured 2nd mortgage debt this then puts the family home at risk

paying off your mortgage early being good is a myth   it is great for the chronic to have their mortgage paid off so when they rack up credit card bills and get behind well they still a place to stay but for those who are more logical with their money paying off your mortgage early in current conditions makes no sense   you can get a 30 year loan well below 4   discounting taxes for your average family you would have a rate floating below 3    so reasons that paying off your mortgage should be almost last given current low long term interest rates the first thing you should do is take care of any high interest debt   i would say that anything more than 7 8 including all credit card debt should be focus 1 putting money into your retirement savings is 1   you will earn way more than 3 over the long run   you can earn a higher return in the market   even with a very conservative portfolio you can clear 5 6 which will still clear more than 3 after taxes for those who say you ca n't be sure about the market well if the market did bad for 30 years in a row no one will have money and the house will also be worthless if a disaster happens to your house and you own it your money is gone   in many cases you would be able to declare bankruptcy and let the bank take the property as is    there are just too many examples but if you are paying off your house early you lose the flexible liquid money that you now have tied up in the house now the reasons for paying down your mortgage are really easy too you do n't trust your spending habits you want to move up in houses and you want to make sure that you have at least 20 down on future house to skip pmi

what you are saying is a very valid concern   after the flash crash many institutions in the us replaced true market orders where tag and has no price with deep in the money limit orders under the hood after the cftc sec joint advisory commission raised concerns about the use of market orders in the case of large hft traders and concerns on the lack of liquidity that caused market orders that found no limit orders to execute on the other side of the trade driving the prices of blue chip stocks into the pennies   we also applaud the cftc requesting comment regarding whether it is    appropriate to restrict large order execution design that results in    disruptive trading in particular we believe there are questions    whether it is ever appropriate to permit large order algorithms that    employ unlimited use of market orders or that permit at    prices which are a dramatic percentage below the present market price    without a pause for human review so although you still see a market order on the front end it is transformed to a very aggressive limit in the back end however doing this change manually by selling at price 0 or buying at may backfire since it may trigger fat finger checks and prevent your order from reaching the market   for example bats exchange   rejects orders that are priced too aggressively and do n't comply with the range of valid prices   if you want your trade to execute right now and you are willing to take slippage in order to get fast execution sending a market order is still the best alternative

shareholder 's equity consists of two main things the initial capitalization of the company when the shares were first sold plus extra share issues and retained earnings which is the amount of money the company has made over and above capitalization which has not been re distributed back to shareholders so yes it is the firm 's total equity the initial capitalization is the equity that was put into the company when it was founded plus subsequent increases in equity due to share issues and retained earnings is the increase in equity that has occurred since then which has not yet been re distributed to shareholders though it belongs to them as the residual claimants both accounts are credited when they increase because they represent an increase in cash that is debited so in order to make credits = debits they must be credits it does n't mean that the company has that much cash on hand as the cash will likely be re invested shareholder 's equity is neither an asset nor a liability it is used to purchase assets and to reduce liabilities and is simply a measure of assets minus liabilities that is necessary to make the accounting equation balance since the book value of stocks does n't change that often because it represents the price the company sold it for not the current value on the stock market and would therefore only change when there were new share issues almost all changes in total assets or in total liabilities are reflected in retained earnings

yes you can do this yourself   i can not speak for all the credit repair companies but generally they are not reputable   even if they are trustworthy they can not do anything you can not do yourself freeze your credit   lock it down and prevent any new activity   this is for safety and i want you to do it so you know where you stand get a copy of your free copies of the three credit reports from this is the only free official place to get your reports sign up for a free credit score estimation site like http://www creditkarma.com or http://www   these sites make money by selling affiliate offers but you can easily ignore them   you ca n't get your exact fico score but they letter grades they provide help you understand where you stand dispute anything that is not accurate   get wrong items corrected with the credit agency ignore collectors who are not showing up on your report   if they are n't reporting you so what   let your own moral compass be your guide if you pay those debts or not negotiate a payment amount with the debtors you owe   if you are dealing with a debt collector there is n't any point in paying the full amount   you owed the money to somebody else and they sold it to the debt collector therefore in my mind they are as whole as they feel like being   it is up to you how much you pay but you are already going to suffer   and have suffered the credit ramifications   no sense in wasting money when they will very likely settle for dimes on the dollar   do n't let them bully you around   i suggest understand your rights and protections as offered by the fair debt collection practices act before you pay anybody anything get it in writing wait and follow up   make sure they report it correctly i would probably tackle them in order of age newest first    do n't bother with debts that are more than or nearly seven years old   anything that old is or will fall off of the credit report soon and your score will start to rise   paying on those debts will refresh them and they will harm you longer   we can debate the ethics of that advice in the comments but if you want your score to raise i suggest just waiting about anything over six years old while you tackle the newer ones this is a slow process   your credit score will still take a couple years to heal once you fix your report   but that is the point of the score after all   it is a history of how you handle money and debt

first look at the local housing market and the price to rent ratios if you are comfortable that a house can be had for near to the cost of renting and are not still dropping is price then focus on the down payment i do n't imagine housing prices to start picking up any time soon so you do n't be too rushed if you feel like you have a longer time to save before you want to buy i would focus as much money as i can into a retirement account while still saving for a down payment since you are young you really want your retirement accounts working for you as soon as possible you should not be investing in 3 stable funds but the stock market index funds retirement is for 40 years in the future using funds for a down payment from a retirement account should be a last resort remember this money is to provide you security later in life not to get you into a house when you take out money and put it into a house it will not be appreciating nearly as fast it is easy to say you will save later but the money you save early in life will make up 50 or more of your funds when you retire that is why it is critical to save for retirement as soon as possible

the terms debit and credit come from double entry book keeping in this system every transaction is applied against two accounts it debits one and credits the other by equal amounts or more technically it affects two or more accounts and the total of the credits equals the total of the debits whether a debit or a credit adds or subtracts from the balance depends on the type of account the types of accounts were defined so that it is always possible to have these matching debits and credits assets like cash or property that you own are debit accounts that is a debit is an increase in the balance of the account liabilities like money you owe are credit accounts that is a credit is an increase to get into all the details would require giving a tutorial on double entry book keeping which i think is beyond the scope of a forum post by a quick bing search i find this one i have n't gone through it so i ca n't say if it 's a particularly good tutorial there are plenty of others on the web and in bookstores note that the terminology can be backwards when someone you 're doing business with is describing the account because their viewpoint may be the opposite of yours for example to me my credit card is a liability i owe the bank money so when i post a charge that 's a credit and when i pay it off that 's a debit but to the bank my account is an asset the customer me owes them money so to the bank a charge is a debit and a payment is a credit

in addition to the other answers which cover the risks of what is essentially leveraged investing i 'd like to point out that the 2.6 penalty is a flat rate if you are responsible for withholding your own taxes then you are paying tax four times a year so any underpayment on your first quarterly tax payment will have much more time to accrue in the stock market than your last payment although each underpayment will be penalized by the 2.6 it may make sense for someone to make full payments on later payments but underpay on earlier ones

they did n't have enough money to cash everybody out and at a $ 100b valuation a lot of people wanted out note that they only earn a billion dollars only 1 of the initial speculated valuation and most of that needs to be reinvested into the company to keep it going they need to spend money buying instagram and other patents startups etc to ward of competitors

i recommend an online savings account    the money is more liquid without early withdrawal fees and frequently you can get a visa mastercard check card to access the funds looking at interest rates ing is currently paying 1.10 and bankrate reports the best interest rate in the country on a 1 year cd is 1.33    the difference is not enough to convince me to invest in cds at a fixed rate vs. an online savings account at a variable rate when we are at or near the bottom of cd savings interest rates

congrats on making it this far debt free it is rare but nice to be in the situation that you are in   the important thing here is that you want to remain debt free that 's really what the emergency fund is all about it keeps you from needing to go into debt should something unexpected happen   you 've got 1.5 months worth of expenses saved up and that 's great if you do n't have a family or other responsibilities that might be enough but think about this how are you paying for school and what would happen if those funds stopped coming in if you are paying for school out of your own income what happens if you lose your job if someone else perhaps your parents is paying for school what happens if they are suddenly no longer able to do so   while you have extra cash you want to be saving it up for situations like this   if i were you i would build up that emergency fund until it got to the point where it could pay all your expenses and tuition until graduation hopefully you wo n't need to touch it but it will be there if you need it   since you need to be able to access your money quickly it is generally recommended to park this money in a savings account where it is very safe mutual funds are a great way to invest but they are not safe in the short term   do n't stress out about not being able to start retirement investing just yet making sure you can finish school debt free is the best investment you can make right now after you graduate and land a job you can start investing aggressively

you are in the perfect window for making an ira contribution the irs allows you to make ira contributions for last year until tax day so you know that for 2014 you did n't have access to a 401 k at work you want to avoid making a deductible ira contribution for this year 2015 until you are sure that you wo nt have a 401 k at work this year take your time and decide if the ira or the roth works best for your situation having a ira now will be good becasue you have many years for it to grow keep in mind that it is not unusual to have multiple retirement accounts current 401 k rolled over into a ira   roth ira each has different rules limits and benefits there is no reason to pick one way of investing for retirement becasue you never know if the next employer will have the type of plan you like i am assuming that your spouse if you are married does n't have access to a 401 k otherwise you would have to consider the applicable limits

eh it 's not an excuse while economic reasons are major ones saying that people do n't manipulate and exploit others for non economic reasons is a little too rosy some people are inherently evil and will step on and over others for personal gains beyond solely monetary    it sounds like you 're trying to say capitalism is the evil here but i do n't think you 're going to be able to provide one that is n't similar communism tribal socialism fascism whatever are all twisted and perverted by many involved in them for personal gain    the one constant in any system is humans and their nature so i have to disagree that it 's solely the economic system that we live under because there just is n't another one that has proven to operate differently in actual execution

winning an election and then going head to head with the most entrenched state in american history without building support for your turnaround agenda is stupid    declaring in an open forum in 2013 that the ideal political strategy would be to put pressure on the most vulnerable populations in illinois in order to drive a political wedge between your opposition and their constituents is cruel and stupid   stating publicly that the most recent budget proposal contains 90 of what you want and then proceeding to veto it because of the final 10 is stupid and counter to the goals of our political system   he around the capitol wearing his jacket and in a way and it 's a joke   he is personally responsible for 's personal fortune and both of them should go far far away

if you have maxed out your ira contribution for 2017 already and it all went into your roth ira then until the 2017 tax day in april 2018 you can remove any part of this contribution and the earnings from your roth ira without any tax consequences or penalties if you discover in early 2018 that you are not eligible or only partially eligible to contribute to a roth ira then of course you must remove all or part of your 2017 contributions and the earnings from your roth ira by the 2017 tax day in april 2018 indeed if you have filed for an extension of time to submit your 2017 tax return then you have until the extended due date to make the withdrawal as 's answer points out for 2017 you and withdraw and re contribute as many times as you like though if you push this idea to excess with the same ira custodian the custodian may start charging fees   note that irs publication 590b says in the roth ira section withdrawals of contributions by due date    if you withdraw contributions including any net earnings on the contributions by the due date of your return for the year in which you made the contribution the contributions are treated as if you never made them if you have an extension of time to file your return you can withdraw the contributions and earnings by the extended due date the withdrawal of contributions is tax free but you must include the earnings on the contributions in income for the year in which you made the contributions now if in the middle of all these transactions you need to take a distribution from your roth ira during 2017 say because you have a cash flow problem then it makes a lot of sense to first withdraw all your 2017 contributions and the earnings if more money is needed than you can take a distribution from your roth ira what the distribution consists of is described in great detail in publication 590b and you might have to pay a tax penalty for a   premature distribution depending on how much the distribution is the first dollars coming are assumed to be previous contributions in the order in which you made them and these are tax free and penalty free after that the rollover and conversion amounts start to come out and are penalized if they have not spent 5 years in the ira etc but you can put the money back into your roth ira within 60 days and avoid penalties   important notes regarding rollover transactions

they do but you 're missing some calculations needed to gain an understanding intro to stock index weighting methods notes in part market cap is the most common weighting method used by an index    market cap or market capitalization is the standard way to measure the    size of the company you might have heard of large mid or small cap    stocks large cap stocks carry a higher weighting in this index and    most of the major indices like the s&p 500 use the market cap    weighting method stocks are weighted by the proportion of their market cap to the total    market cap of all the stocks in the index as a stock ’s price and    market cap rises it gains a bigger weighting in the index in turn    the opposite lower stock price and market cap pushes its weighting    down in the index   pros proponents argue that large companies have a bigger effect on the    economy and are more widely owned so they should have a bigger    representation when measuring the performance of the market which is    true cons it does n’t make sense as an investment strategy according to a market    cap weighted index investors would buy more of a stock as its price    rises and sell the stock as the price falls this is the exact    opposite of the buy low sell high mentality investors should use eventually you would have more money in overpriced stocks and less in    underpriced stocks yet most index funds follow this weighting method thus there was likely a point in time where the s p 500 's initial sum was equated to a specific value though this is the part you may be missing here also how do you handle when constituents change over time for example suppose in the s p 500 that a $ 100,000,000 company is taken out and replaced with a $ company that should n't suddenly make the index jump by a bunch of points because the underlying security was swapped or would you be cool with there being jumps when companies change or shares outstanding are rebalanced consider carefully how you answer that question in terms of histories dow jones industrial average and s p 500 index would be covered on wikipedia where from the latter link the composite as the s&p 500 was first called when it    introduced its first stock index in began tracking a small    number of stocks three years later in 1926 the composite index    expanded to 90 stocks and then in 1957 it expanded to its current    standard poor 's a company that out financial information and analysis was founded in 1860 by henry poor in    poor 's publishing henry poor 's original company merged    with standard statistics founded in as the standard statistics    bureau and therein assumed the name standard and poor 's corporation    the s&p 500 index in its present form began on march 4 1957    technology has allowed the index to be calculated and in    real time the s&p 500 is widely used as a measure of the general    level of stock prices as it includes both growth stocks and value    stocks in september 1962 systems corp. entered into an agreement    with standard and poor 's under the terms of this agreement    computed the s&p 500 stock composite index the stock industrial    index the 50 stock utility index and the 25 stock rail index    throughout the market day these statistics were furnished to standard    poor 's in addition also computed and reported the 94 s&p    sub there are also articles like business insider that have this graphic that may be interesting s p changes over the years the makeup of the s&p 500 is constantly changing notes in part in most years 25 to 30 stocks in the s&p 500 are replaced said    david s&p 's chairman of the index committee and while there    are strict guidelines for what companies are added the final decision    and timing of that decision depends on what 's going through the heads    of a handful of people employed by dow jones

in this case trust the real estate agent negotiating experience is one of the things you selected them for especially if they 're suggesting a lower number than you expected since they get paid on commission and so may be biased the other way   part of their job is to look for hints about how motivated this seller is and what price they might accept as opposed to what price they hope to get   and remember that the default assumption is that the two parties will meet in the middle somewhere which means it 's customary to offer 10 less to signal that you could probably be talked into it if they drop the price about 5 this is like bridge hand bidding it 's a semi formalized system of hints about levels of interest except with fewer conventions and less rationality as far as the seller paying the closing costs that 's really part of the same negotiation and doing it that way makes the discussion more complicated for the seller since they need to figure out how much more to charge you to cover this cost if they offer great factor that into what you are willing to pay but i would n't assume it or ask for it edit yes unless you have engaged a buyer 's agent which i recommend for first time buyers and maybe all their fiduciary duty is to the seller but part of that duty is to make the sale happen if the price goes too high and you walk away neither the agent nor the seller make money a bad agent can be as bad as a bad car salesman sure but if you do n't like and mostly trust your agent you are working with the wrong agent that does n't mean you give them every bit of information the seller might want but it does mean you probably want to listen to their input and understand their before deciding what your own strategy will be

yeah me too as i said actually what i 'd really prefer is single payer but failing that getting health insurance separated from employment would be a big step forward if people really knew how much they are paying for health insurance things would change   i 've never worked for an employer that did n't renegotiate health insurance every year often changing insurance providers every year to the extent that hr departments are competent in finding the best value the current environment is pretty dynamic and competitive are individuals going to be as competent and well informed as hr departments i do n't know but i do know that simply making a market free does n't guarantee lower prices if consumers are ill informed and bad at making decisions   as for wages currently companies are not required to carry health insurance and many have dropped it already without increasing wages so i do n't see an upward pressure on wages from greater employee mobility   but it 's true that if there were a single large pool for insurance to be based off of large businesses would no longer get the pool advantage of health insurance over small businesses hence my preference for single payer or single group multi payer

the ultimate reason to own stock is to receive cash or cash equivalents from the underlying security you can argue that you make money when stock is valued higher by the market but the valuation should though clearly not necessarily is be based on the expected payout of the underlying security there are only three ways money can be returned to the shareholder as you can see if you do n't ask for dividends you are basically asking for one of the top two too occur which happens in the future at the end of the company 's life as an independent entity if you think about the time value of money money in the hand now as dividends can be worth more than the ultimate appreciation of liquidation or acquisition value add in uncertainty as a factor for ultimate value and my feeling is that dividends are underpaid in today 's markets

imagine you have a bank account with $ 100 in it you are thinking about selling this bank account so ask for some bids on what it 's worth you get quotes of around $ 100 you decide to sell it but before you do you take $ 50 out of it to have in cash would you expect the market to still pay $ 100 for the account the dividend is effectively the cash being withdrawn the stock had on account a large amount of cash which was factored into it 's share price it moved that cash out of it 's account to its shareholders and as a result the stock instantly becomes priced lower as this cash is no longer part of it just as it is in the bank account example

let me summarize your question for you i do not have the down payment that the lender requires for a mortgage how can i still acquire the mortgage short answer find another lender or find more cash do n't overly complicate the scenario the correct answer is that the lender is free to do what they want they deem it too risky to lend you $ 1.1 m against this $ 1.8 m property unless they have $ 700k up front you want their money so you must accept their terms if other lenders have the same outlook consider that you can not afford this house find a cheaper house

gt you ca n't find anyone else who would pay you more or you would have left that 's a reflection of what you have to offer the world   your comment was thoughtful and this last bit in particular i feel is like something that i 've been wrestling with for a while    it 's a very libertarian view as you probably know it makes a lot of sense to me but i ca n't help to think of some possible flaws and wonder what you think   1 availability of work if somebody has a choice between no job and being grossly underpaid would n't the choice be between having no money and a little money at that point does n't that run the risk of exploitation would n't exploitation be working for less than what you 're worth   2 value unskilled pretty much means replaceable they do n't give a shit if you come or go and vice versa that 's not a reflection of a job 's worth to the company nor is a real reflection of how difficult it is there 's no competition for wages eventually workers get sick of it and leave not expecting improved wages elsewhere but a job they can deal with for 40 hours per week but there are always more people in need to take their place so the company has no incentive to raise wages     like you said it is a reflection of what you have to offer to the world in a sense that your skills are not uncommon however is this everything the world needs unskilled labor to run is there something wrong with being a cashier a a guy who the trucks that carry the things we all use no the world needs these people should people who are needed have jobs that do n't allow for them to meet basic living standards     3 expectation the only reason why most people wo n't work for less than 8 or 9 dollars hr expect reasonable flexibility to balance work and personal life do n't expect to be forced to work more than 8 9 hours per day have weekends off and those working 40 hrs week demand holiday pay sick days access to insurance vacation time is because that 's what people expect out of a job in this day and age none of these things are law i think people used to be treated considerably worse by their employers and likely there will be a time when people will think that the people of our day were stupid for settling for less the labor movement has done much in this regard   gt maybe instead of bitching that you are paid shit wages you should ask why you ever expected to earn more after failing to acquire any skill a teenager could n't master in a week    4 everyone 's solution let 's say everyone learns to do a skilled job who will be left to do the unskilled jobs someone will have to do them some countries have hordes of college educated workers working unskilled jobs because of the high that go to college ok so then leave it to merit does merit always work though what about nepotism personality when it does n't matter for the job age race sex ethnicity think these play any part in the hiring process    if all else fails not everyone can be expected to be a successful entrepreneur   5 life life can throw you some and people make mistakes some tend to pay for them more than others some have talent others do n't some are born with money some not some have a large and caring family others have no family at all     again i 'm not saying these things necessarily invalidate your original point but it 's something to consider your thoughts

i 'll try to give you some clues on how to find an answer to your question rather than answering directly the question asked   why not answer it directly well i can but it wo n't help you or anyone else much in two months when the rates change again generally you wo n't find such in brick and mortar banks you can save some time and only look at online banks examples ing direct capitalone capitalone amex e*trade ally etc there are plenty go to their web sites look for promotions and compare sometimes you can find coupons promotions which will yield more than the actual savings rate for example ing frequently have a $ 50 promotion for opening a new account you need to understand that rates change frequently and the highest rate account today may become barely average in a week there are plenty of sites that offer various levels of comparison information one of the most comprehensive ones imho is bankrate.com another place to look is these sites provide various comparisons and you can also find some promotions advertised there there are more similar sites also search the internet and you can find various blog posts with additional promotions frequently banks give referral bonuses to provide incentive for clients to promote the banks do some due diligence on the results that appear promising not much you wo n't find any savings account that would keep the value purchasing power of your money over the long term keeping money in savings accounts is a sure way to lose value because the inflation rate is much higher than even high yield savings accounts but savings accounts are safe insured by fdic ncua up to the limit and very convenient to keep short term savings such as an emergency fund that you can not afford to lose to investments sometimes you 'll get slightly better rates by locking up your money in a certificate of deposit cd but not significantly higher when the cd is short term

so you have $ 100k to invest want a low maintenance investment and personal finance you to death investment companies are gon na love you   you 'll hand them a wad of cash and more or less say do what you want   you 're making someone 's day   just probably not yours mutual fund companies make money off of you regardless of whether you make money or not   they do n't care one bit how carefully you look at your investments   as long as the money is in their hands they get their fee if i had that much cash i 'd be looking around for a couple of distressed homes in good neighborhoods to buy as rentals   i could put down payments on two of them lock in fixed 30-year mortgages at 4 do you realize how stupid low that is and tenants in there   lots of tax write offs cash flow the works   it 's a 10 return if you learn about it and do it correctly or there have been a number of really great websites that were sold on that ran into five figures   you could probably pay those back in a year   but that requires some knowledge too anything worthwhile requires learning maintenance and effort you 'll have to research stocks mutual funds bonds anything if you want a better than average chance of getting worthwhile returns that is something that beats inflation which savings accounts and cds are unlikely to do   there is no magic bullet   if someone does manage to find a magic bullet what happens   everyone piles on drives the price up and the return goes down your thing might not be real estate but what is your thing   what you i.e. does n't bore you to death there are lots of investments out there but you 'll get out of it what you put into it

hopefully is a very good term    it remains a fact because in the current scenario of low growth companies do n't see much of a reason to invest and all evidence points agrees    so what are companies doing with all the extra cash they are getting from the rich they are either buying back their own shares which is a or they are doing mergers and buyouts which are both at record highs at the moment here too evidence points that neither of these are actual productive activities share buy backs only inflate the share price without actually changing the market cap as there are less shares in the market mergers have a strong track record of being expensive and ultimately bad investments that do more to erode value than they do to increase it    then of course there are the fees from the finance industry that are from these investments share buy backs and mergers that are just added into the spinning wheel without actually impacting the real economy

gt as i currently understand we owe much of our national debt to ourselves    debtors owe creditors creditors are by and large the banks forget about we ourselves   one thing we are taught in school is that banks earn money on the spread between what a creditor pays minus what a saver earns in interest on his deposit in reality such private savings pretty much do not exist when someone borrows from the bank they mostly are n't borrowing another person 's savings the bank is creating new currency through the issuance of debt   gt the reason for this is that people are being charged interest that does not exist in the system    i 'm not sure what you mean by does not exist in the system the way it works is you borrow a dollar and now you owe a dollar plus the interest on the dollar since each new loan creates more debt than currency the monetary system can never shrink or it if you mean that the currency is by any objective measure of value that is correct    gt therefore if we tried to pay the debt like some conservative politicians are fighting for it would be a massive transfer of wealth from the 99 to the 1 since most of the debt is owed to the 1 banks   there is no possibility of repaying it both the red team and the blue team are in on this if you 're worried about the 99 you should be advocating commodity money because that is the only way to stop theft by inflation if you 're worried about yourself get informed as to how these plans have played out in history and how you might protect yourself

investing is really about learning your own comfort level   you will make money and lose money you will make mistakes but you will also learn a great deal first off invest in your own financial knowledge this does n't require capital at all but a commitment no one will watch or care for your own money better than yourself read books and follow some companies in a google finance virtual portfolio track how they 're doing over time you can do this as a virtual portfolio without actually spending or losing money   have you ever invested before what is your knowledge level investing long term is about trying to balance risk while reducing losses and trying not to get screwed along the way by people   my personal advice go to an independent financial planner go to one that charges you per hour only financial planners that do n't charge you hourly get paid in commissions they will be biased to sell you what puts the most money in their pockets do not go to the banks investment people they are employed by the banks who have sales and quota requirements to have you invest and push their own investment vehicles like mutual funds take $ 15k to the financial planner and see what they suggest keep the other $ 5 k in something slow and boring and $ 1k under your mattress in actual cash as an emergency while you 're young compound interest is the magic that will make that $ 25k increase hand over fist in time but you need to have it consistently make money i 'm young too and more risk tolerant because i have time while i get older i can start to scale back my risk because i 'm nearing retirement and preserve instead of try to make returns

imo what it seems like you 've done is nothing more than having screened out a company worth further investigation the next step would be a thorough analysis of the company 's past financials and current statements to arrive at your own opinion forecast of the immediate and far future of the company 's prospects   typically this is done by looking at the company 's regulatory filings and maybe some additional searching on comparison businesses   there are many sources of instruction for how one might value or analyze a company or that provide help on reading a balance sheet   this is not an easy skill to learn but it is one that will prove invaluable over a lifetime of investing it is possible that you 'll uncover a deteriorating business where the latest selling and subsequent drop in price that caused the high yield is well deserved   in which case you know to stay away and move on to the next idea on the other hand you might end up confident that the company is not suffering from a drop in sales rise in expenses growing debt payments loss of moat etc   in which case you 've found a great investment candidate   i say candidate because you still may decide this company is n't for you even if the financials are right because you might find better opportunities for an equal or acceptable return at lower risk while you 're researching as to the yield being high when there are no problems with the fundamentals of the business this may simply be because of panic selling during this past few week 's downturn or some other sort of temporary and superficial scare   however be warned that the masses can remain irrational and thus the price stay suppressed or even drop further for longer than you 're willing to wait for your roi   the good news is that in that case you 're being well compensated to wait at a yield

firstly i think you need to separate your question into two parts if you are chinese live in china and intend to stay in china for most of your life then the default answer to question 1 should be   question 2 is not as important you can hold usd in almost any country in the world any investment you hold has risk which may include market risk credit risk liquidity risk inflation risk etc holding usd will expose you to exchange rate fluctuations as well   if the rises in value against the dollar your returns in usd will be reduced by the same amount remember that for currency fluctuations you have to multiply the percentages see here for a good explanation the first thing you probably want to do is find out exactly what the assets are in the you have invested in   the fact that there is a risk level even if it is only 2 would suggest to me that the fund is investing in some combination of bonds and stocks which means that your returns are not guaranteed and could make a loss interest rates on deposit accounts are mandated by the government in china and the current 12 month deposit rate on rmb is 3   to earn over 3 must be investing your assets in something else i 'm guessing bonds   bear in mind that 1.5 years is a very short amount of time in investments so do n't assume this return will continue   i 'm afraid i 've only been studying chinese for a year so i ca n't really help you much with the link you 've sent through you may want to check if there is any guaranteed minimum return which can be the case in more complex structured products ultimately you will need to pick an investment which you feel gives you the best combination of risk and return for your situation there are a huge amount of options to choose between   the 4 5 you are earning right now is not a huge risk premium on the 3 you could earn in china from a time deposit but in the current environment you may struggle to beat it without taking on more risk   before considering that though understand how much risk you already have with

any publicly traded financial instrument can be sold short in theory   there are however many regulations associated with short sales of us equities that may prevent certain stocks from being sold short at certain times or through certain brokers some examples the most basic requirement this is n't a regulation it 's just the definition of a short sale is that you or your broker must have access to someone willing to loan you his her shares   if you are interested in shorting a security with few shares outstanding or low trade volume there may simply not be enough people in the world willing to loan you theirs   alternatively there may be a shareholder willing to loan shares but your broker may not have a relationship with the clearing house that shareholder is using   a larger better different broker might be able to help threshold securities list since 2005 each day certain securities are not allowed to be sold short based on their recent history of liquidity   basically if a certain number of transactions in a security have not been correctly settled over the past few days then the sec has reason to believe that short sales which require extra transactions are at higher risk of falling through circuit breaker a.k.a alternative uptick since 2011 during certain market conditions exchanges are now required to reject short sales for certain securities in order to prevent market crashes market abuse

ben already covered most of this in his answer but i want to emphasize the most important part of getting a loan with limited credit history go into a credit union or community bank and talk to the loan officer there in person ask for recommendations on how much they would lend based on your income to get the best interest rate that they can offer sometimes shortening the length of the loan will get you a lower rate sometimes it wo n't in any case make sure you can pay it off quickly no matter the term that you sign with   each bank may have different policies talk to at least two of them even if the first one offers you terms that you like talking to a loan officer is valuable life experience and if you discuss your goals directly with them then they will be able to give you feedback about whether they think a small loan is worth their time

from some background reading i 'm doing it sounds like the union has people by the proverbial balls anyway even in an agency shop where union membership is optional non members must pay for the collective bargaining done by the union and union shop just means that the employer can hire anybody but they must join the union in order to be employed all of those seem to indicate that every worker in the represented class must accept the terms of the collective bargaining wiki   part of the reason that i 'm curious is that once i 've decided that i 'm done being an engineer i think it might be fun to teach but every time i hear about union negotiations it makes me think that operating in that system would be lame going from a world where merit is the primary differentiator to a world where years in the system count for more would kinda suck

at the most basic level of financing a business you are trying to acquire capital as cheaply as you can to invest in your projects   the measure for how expensive your capital is to acquire is weighted average cost of capital     the formula for wacc   equity ratio cost of equity + debt ratio cost of debt 1 tax rate this is also your discount rate when you 're making a dcf model   debt tends to be cheaper than equity when you do n't already have any and is also advantaged by tax rates since you do n't pay taxes on interest   in the real world banks and lenders will ratchet up rates the more debt you acquire or shut you out once you 've taken on too much and your debt service coverage is too low for them   in a classroom though most teachers are too lazy to make a formula for borrowing and will just state a rate for borrowing so you can load up on debt so long as you do n't fall below being able to service your debt cash flow to make your debt payments   this will ultimately juice the returns on equity   realistically you would find lenders would let you have ~20 equity in the business and debt without raising your teacher 's   if you have n't taken accounting yet be careful about the difference between cash and revenue in your analyses   revenue is recognition for work done not cash in hand   you can have all the revenue in the world but if no one 's paid you for it yet you ca n't pay anyone

as other people have posted starting with fictional money is the best way to test a strategy learn about the platform you are using etc that being said i would about how fundamental analysis works fundamental analysis is the very basis of learning about an assets true value is priced however in my humble opinion i personally just stick with index funds in layman 's terms index funds are essentially computer programs that buy or sell the underlying assets based on the index they are associated with in the portion of the underlying index therefore you will usually be doing as good or as bad as the market i personally have the background education and skillsets to build very complex models to do fundamental analysis but even i invest primarily in index funds because a well made and well researched stock model could take 8 hours or more and modern portfolio theory would suggest that most investors will inevitably have a regression to the mean and have gains equal to the market rate or return over time which is what an index fund already does but without the hours of work and transaction cost

tl;dr i think you can find a much better deal doing a refi will cost you some amount of money   however a 2.5 fee top of closing costs seems really high   you can get a quote from quicken loans pretty quick and compare their fee   also i would check with a local bank preferably one you already do business with   the 2.5 is probably their commission for originating the loan   if you are in the southeast i have had great luck with regions bank   they are large enough but also small enough   please know that i have no affiliation with either company btw the rate also seems high   doing a quick search of bank rate it seems you can get 3.25 with zero fee as of this writing   the worse deal they show is with a .75 fee much better than you were quoted if you can afford it i would also encourage you to think outside the box   a client of mine was able to obtain a home equity loan not line of credit to replace their mortgage   they went for a 7 year pay off with the loan in first position at a rate about .75 below the then current 15 year rate   the key was there was zero closing costs   it saved them quite a bit of money also look at a 10 year fixed   it might not be much more than you are paying now

not specifically a stream but there are royalty companies that operate based on a similar concept with a royalty a party will pay upfront to a another party usually a product manufacturer oil gas producer or miner and in return they will receive a percentage of the proceeds from the sale of the goods   for example company a owns 100 sections of land which carry mineral rights and they would like to drill on the land to produce oil gas however company a does not have the capital to produce the resource company b a royalty company agrees to provide upfront capital to company a in return for a royalty sometimes fixed sometimes sliding scale based on other factors the royalty is calculated based on a percentage of the sales proceeds that company a receives from the sale of their oil gas production   in this way royalty companies act similarly to streaming companies where they provide upfront capital and in return receive a cash flow stream that is dependant on another party 's actions what is different is that the selling price is not fixed instead it is the of proceeds that is fixed at least in the short term   in canada royalty and freehold royalties do exactly this

you should also consider what the cost of the put is especially if the strike price is set at the current price vs the average price delta of the security during the period between when you buy the put and the expiration date   also note the prices for puts on stocks with a lot of price volatility there are a good number of situations where you may come out behind if the stock stays the same price you are out the premium you paid for the put if the stock price rises less than the premium you are out the difference between the two if the stock price falls less than the premium you are out the difference between the two in order to be in the money when writing a protective put the stock has to either rise more than the premium you paid for the put and you must sell or hold and write off the expense of the put or the stock price has to fall below the strike price to a level lower   than the premium you paid and you must sell via the exercising the option and you 've protected yourself from a loss presuming you were going to sell and not hold and see if the stock recovers   and since selling is required in both cases if you 've held the stock less than a year then pay on any profits at short term rates taxed as regular income and if the price went down you ca n't claim any loss unless strike price was below your buy price and would still need to pay if you had a net gain and you likely ca n't deduct the price you paid for the put

your first scenario involving shareholders in a private corp being limited by a contractual agreement is common in practice frequent clauses include methods of valuing the shares if someone wants to sell first right of refusal you have to attempt to sell to the other shareholders before you can sell to a 3rd party and many others these clauses are governed by contract law ie some clauses may be illegal in contract law and therefore could n't be applied here a universal shareholders agreement is just the same as the above but applied to more people you would never get an already public company to convert to a universal shareholders agreement because even 1 share voting no would block it due to corporate law limiting the power of a corporation from abusing minority shareholder value in practice these agreements universally exist at the start of incorporation or at least at the first moment shares become available an example is the canadian mega construction company which is employee owned when the original owner transferred the corporation to his employees there was a usa in place which still today governs how the corporation operates   in theory you could have a public company where most shares are already owned by the founders and 100 of remaining shares are owned by a specific group of individuals in which case you may be able to get a usa signed but it would n't really happen in practice   note that while is broadly owned by a large group of employees it is not a public company because any random schmuck ca n't simply buy a share on the toronto stock exchange i assume most exchanges would prevent corporations from being listed if they had ownership restrictions like this

the real answer why the government is allowed to do something is because they are the government and they make the rules there are lots of laws that i think make no sense i ran into a similar situation to yours i bought a house during a time when the market in my area was way down the previous owner had paid $ 140,000 but i got it for only $ 80,000 the government appraised it for i forget the exact number but over $ 100,000 i appealed and the argument i made to the appeal board was that the law says it is supposed to be appraised for fair market value the definition of fair market value is the amount that a willing buyer would pay to a willing seller absent special conditions like a sweetheart sale to a relative the house had been advertised for a higher price and the seller had to drop the price several times before getting an offer and finally accepting mine this is pretty much the definition of fair market value the appeals board replied that it was not fmv because the market was bad at this particular time and so i got a good deal i said that that 's the definition of market value it goes up and down as market conditions change if the market happened to be up when someone bought a house and they had to pay a high price would the government assess the house at a lower value because that was an unusually high price i doubt it they ended up reducing the assessed value but not to what i actually paid all that said arguably a foreclosure sale might be considered special conditions prices at a foreclosure sale tend to be lower than ordinary sales in a foreclosure the bank is usually trying to get rid of the property quickly because they do n't want to be in the property management business they want to be in the money lending and management business of course you could say that sort of thing about conditions surrounding many sales maybe the price is low because the seller needed cash now to start a business maybe the price is high because the buyer was too lazy to shop around maybe the price is low because the buyer is a very skilled negotiator etc etc   my watch just broke and while i was shopping for a new one i found two listings for the exact same watch i mean exact same manufacturer and model number identical picture on the same web site one giving the price as $ 24 and the other as $ 99 what is the market value of that watch i presume anyone who saw both listings would pick the $ 24 one but i presume some number of people pay the higher price because they never see the lower price in real life there is n't really one exact fair market value that 's an abstraction

let 's say two companies make 5 profit every year company a pays 5 dividend every year but company b pays no dividend but grows its business by 5 and both spend the money needed to keep the business up to date that 's before profits are calculated   you are right that with company b the company will grow so if you had $ 1000 shares in each company after 20 years company a has given you $ 1000 in dividends and is worth $ 1000 while company b has given you no dividends but is worth a lot more than $ 2000 $ if my calculation is right which looks a lot better than company a.   however company a has paid $ 50 every year and if you put that money into a savings account giving 5 interest you would make exactly the same money either way

at this point i want to tell you two things   1 i truly believe that you are very concerned about racial hate and damage to society you truly want germany to help those in serious need you are a fine person i have the same concerns and approach   2 i am a jew with many original family members in germany now almost all my family ran away from germany and czech republic before wwii few got hurt and after wwii some returned back and to germany   so all this argument i have with you is not so much about germans who some of them risked their lives to save few members of my family yes germans almost died to saved some of my family    it 's about a concern for a misguided policy in germany to allow again the rise of intolerance and racial problems of which for sure jews will be the victims again but mostly other minorities but not muslims    if you did not know the word anti was invented by germans and it is supposed to be against the race european jews are hardly but all muslims and arabs are pure true yet hitler and muslims worked together and against jews muslims were not killed by germany   if you did not know yes all jews were but 2000 years in europe after expelled from ancient israel 2000 years ago by the romans made the jews in europe hardly meanwhile most jews 60 in israel are not of european descent as they ended up in northern africa and asia and all of them expelled from the arabs muslim countries when israel was established in 1948 do you know that hitler sent the jews of libya and other north africa arab muslim countries to concentration camps but not any or other arab muslims   so allow me go the other direction with you now do migrants get fined houses raided and sent to jail over racist and intolerant and actions how about their religious leaders   abu speaking at the al in berlin called upon allah to destroy the jews and nothing was done to him by the german government   however an old german lady was fined and her house was raided   think about it   this will not end good with germany think it 's early 1930 in germany nobody could predict what happened 10 years later   i highly respect germans as they have very high and good standards in every respect something to admire but because of that shown many times in the past not only the 1930s germany is the last country that should be experimented in regards to racial tensions and rising problems crime intolerance fanatic religious people etc   crime by migrants in germany is up considerably read    read about abu in germany news warns against hate speech after

if you 're in the 25 tax bracket then you probably should n't be doing a roth conversion right now   you 'd prefer to do roth conversions when you can do so at a 15 rate   you could contribute some of your current annual contributions to roth directly but even that is n't a great idea except to diversify your holdings odds are you wo n't be paying 25 average tax rate on your retirement unless you 're doing very well in your retirement account   odds are you 'll be somewhere around 15   converting at a 15 rate therefore is fine basically you 'll have something like this based on some assumptions i 'm making up dollars brackets etc obviously these will change doing this you pay 0 15 tax on up to 75k then pay 0 tax after that on the roth which you paid 15 tax on already   therefore you do n't end up paying more than 15 on any single dollar and you pay less on the total sum   but you also do n't really want to be paying 25 on any of it since that wo n't really help you out any and could hurt you will hurt you if you end up getting some of that 15 bracket income from the roth if you 're in the 25 bracket now then you probably are better off just keeping everything in regular ira unless you 're expecting to be in the 28 bracket after retirement   putting some in roth is n't a terrible idea just for diversification 's sake but it 's probably going to cost you money unless tax rates rise dramatically which they certainly could though not as likely to rise on the middle class 0 100k range   they 'd have to double for you to be worse off this way and finally do not ever withdraw from the 401k to pay taxes on a conversion you 're subject to a 10 penalty for doing that as it 's an early withdrawal and also have to pay taxes on that withdrawal      for more information about when roth makes sense read site joetaxpayer 's blog article on the subject which explains this in great detail

you seem to be treating your roth ira as a sort of savings account for use in emergency situations   i would use a savings account for savings as withdrawing money from an ira will have penalties under various circumstances more than contributions roth ira less than 5 years old more than $ 10k for a down payment also you mention folding your ira into your 401k so that it will grow faster   however this will not have that effect   imagine you have $ 30k in an ira and $ 100k in a 401k and you are averaging a return of 8 year on each   this will be identical to having a single 401k with $ 130k and an 8 year return this is not one of your questions but employer matches are not counted in the 401k contribution limit   if your 22 calculation of your salary includes the match to reach the max contribution you can still contribute more

if you are just starting out i would say there is no disadvantage to using a personal card for business expenses in fact the advantage of doing so is that the consumer protections are better on personal cards than on business cards   one possible advantage to business credit cards is that many but not all will not show up on your personal credit report unless you default this might help with average age of accounts if you have a thin credit file but otherwise it wo n't make much difference issuers also expect higher charge volumes on business cards so as your business grows might question a lot of heavy charges on a personal card whether this would ever happen is speculation but it 's worth being aware of it

the basis of homeowner 's insurance pricing is the or amount of insurance   this pertains to the cost to rebuild the dwelling in the event of a total loss   the standard coverages e.g. contents loss of use medical payments liability are calculated relative to this amount   consequently the is selected by the value of the dwelling   this is why it is important that if parts of the dwelling are upgraded that the cost of those upgrades are taken into account the question is not one of denying claims should a loss occur unless the nature of the upgrade is such that policy should not have been underwritten in the first place   this can happen if for example the homeowner builds an extension onto the house that damages the structural integrity of the dwelling in the end the is still just an estimate but the takeaway is that like scheduled personal property jewelry rare collectibles or other endorsements every home and homeowner has slightly different insurance needs and it is in your interest to tailor your coverage to be as accurate as possible in reflecting your needs   insurance is not a one size fits all product consequently the selection of sufficient coverage for your mix of risks is only prudent   now if after you get a quote back and you find that the premium is too high you can typically select a deductible that can reduce it but you have to consider what amount of exposure you are willing to retain   you should shop around too   different insurers use different methods and criteria to price their products so even if the coverage is substantially similar the premiums may vary   for example some insurers ask whether you own a dog exposure to liability claims but others do not   some insurers put more weight on your dwelling 's geographic location exposure to fire theft wind hail than others

impact of the american taxpayer relief act of 2012   in general states with rolling conformity will follow this change states with specific date conformity will continue   to follow the date of conformity currently in effect and will not follow the change a few states may have their own   rules and will not conform to or be impacted by this provision of the act the chart that follows summarizes   these principles as applied to the states   state exclusion conformity   california statutes refer to the irc provisions but modify and limit their   and would not be impacted by this provision of the act however california ’s provisions were ruled unconstitutional in recent litigation and the california franchise tax board has recently taken the position that gain exclusions   and deferrals will be denied for all open tax years florida florida does not impose an income tax on individuals and therefore this provision of   the act is and will have no impact   illinois due to its rolling conformity illinois follows this provision of the act   because new york effectively provides for rolling conformity to the irc through   reference to federal adjusted gross income as the state starting point new york   effectively follows this provision of the act   texas does not impose an income tax on individuals

one thing you may be missing is the possibility of a special assessment on the condo if the foundation cracks you may be looking at tens of thousands to cover it this would largely depend on the condo board 's reserve funds speaking of reserve funds have you remembered to factor in condo fees you may also be forgetting to factor in property taxes and closing costs legal fees and realtor fees the latter you 'll have to pay when buying and when selling now ten years is a good length of time if your mother really will live in the condo for ten years there 's a very good chance it does indeed make more sense to buy than to rent it 's very possible you already factored in everything i mentioned above

follow the instructions on the w-4 it says exactly how you are supposed to calculate the number of allowances you should n't have to figure out how to get the right number just follow the instructions the only part at all complex is if you have large deductions in that case you 're supposed to subtract a standard amount from your actual deductions for 2017 $ if married filing jointly divide by $ 4,050 and then add the result to the number of allowances in general following the instructions on the w-4 should result in slightly more tax being withheld from your paycheck than you actually owe so that you get a modest refund next april 15 in the long run it does n't matter if you have too much withheld as you 'll get it all back eventually anyway i suppose the withholding could be so high that it does n't leave you enough to live on while waiting for your refund but that should n't normally be the case if you pay too little you could be subject to penalties and interest so you really want to avoid that

taxed at higher rates is taxed at in ontario as the article mentioned but if you pay all the net income to yourself as salary you expense it and zero it out on the corporate level so who cares what tax rate it is if the taxable income is zero no one same goes for the us by the way personal service corporations are taxed at flat 35 federal tax rate but if you pour all the income into your salary its moot because there 's no net income to pay tax of if it 's too complicated to figure out maybe it would be wise to hire a tax accountant to provide counsel to you before you make decisions about your business

one way to look at insurance is that it replaces an unpredictable expenses with a predictable fees that is you pay a set monthly amount premium instead of the sudden costs associated with a collision or other covered event insurance works as a business which means they intend to make a substantial profit for providing that service they put a lot of effort in to measuring probabilities and carefully set the premiums to get make a steady the odds are in their favor you have to ask yourself if x happened tomorrow how would i feel about the financial impact also how much will it cost me to buy insurance to cover x if you have a lot of savings plenty of available credit a bright financial future and you take the bus to work anyway then totaling your car may not be a big deal money wise skip the insurance if you have no savings plenty of debt little prospects for that improving and you depend on your car to get to work just so you can pay what you already owe then totaling your car would probably be a big problem for you stick with insurance there is a middle ground you can adjust your deductible raise it as high as you can comfortably handle you cover the small stuff out of pocket and save the insurance for the big ticket items insurance companies also invest the money they take as premiums until they pay out a claim that 's not relevant to this discussion though

you would put your earnings and expenses do n't forget on schedule c and then do a schedule se for self employment tax 1040es is n't used to compute taxes it 's used to pay taxes generally you are supposed to pay taxes as you go rather than when you file there are exceptions where you wo n't be penalized for paying when you file most taxpayers will avoid this penalty if they owe less than $ 1,000 in tax after subtracting their withholdings and credits or if they paid at least 90 of the tax for the current year or 100 of the tax shown on the return for the prior year whichever is smaller from   i.e. there 's a safe harbor as long as you pay as much as you owed the year before if you owe a lot at the end of the year a second time in a row then you get penalized

the short answer is no you can only deduct actual expenses the long answer is that it would be impossible for the irs to determine the value of your time and it would open the tax system to an enormous amount of fraud think of being able to make up time spent or writing off time spent volunteering at a soup kitchen or any other charity now you can write off expenses you have involved in doing the work equipment and supplies used to do the work along with any wages you paid an employee or contractor to do said work

some features to be aware of are how you prioritize these features will depend on your specific circumstances   for instance if your credit score is poor you may have to choose among cards you can get with that score and not have much choice on other dimensions   if you frequently travel abroad a low or zero foreign transaction fee may be important if you never do it probably does n't matter   if you always pay the balance in full interest rate is less important than it is if you carry a balance   if you frequently travel by air an airline card may be useful to you if you do n't you may prefer some other kind of rewards or cash back cards differ along numerous dimensions especially in the extra benefits area which is often the most difficult area to assess because in many cases you ca n't get a full description of these extra benefits until after you get the card   a lot of the choice depends on your personal preferences e.g. whether you want airline miles rewards points of some sort or cash back   lower fees and interest rates are always better but it 's up to you to decide if a higher fee of some sort outweighs the accompanying benefits e.g. a better rewards rate   a useful site for finding good offers is nerdwallet

do n’t take the cash deposit whatever you do this is a retirement savings vehicle after all and you want to keep this money designated as such    you have 3 options   1 rollover the old 401k to the new 401k once your new plan is setup you can call who ever runs that plan and ask them how to get started it will require you filling out a form with the old 401k provider and they ’ll transfer the balance of your account directly to the new 401k   2 rollover the old 401k to a traditional ira this involves opening a new traditional ira if you do n’t already have one i assume you do n’t vanguard is a reddit favorite and i can vouch for them as well other shops like fidelity and schwab are also good but since vanguard is very low cost and has great service it ’s usually a good choice especially for beginners   3 convert the old 401k to a roth ira this is essentially the same as step 2 the difference is you ’ll owe taxes on the balance you convert why would you voluntarily want to pay taxes f you can avoid them with options 1 or 2 the beauty of the roth is you only pay taxes on the money you contribute to the roth then it grows tax free and when you ’re retired you get to withdraw it tax free as well the money contained in a 401k or a traditional ira is taxed when you withdraw in retirement    my $ .02 401k accounts typically have higher fees than iras even if they own the same mutual funds the expense ratios are usually more in the 401k the last 2 times i ’ve changed jobs i ’ve converted the 401k money into my roth ira if it ’s a small sum of money and/or you can afford to pay the taxes on the money i ’d suggest doing the same   you can read up heavily on the pros cons of   roth vs traditional but my personal strategy is to have 2 buckets or money when i retire some in roth and some in traditional i can withdraw as much money from the traditional account until i max out the lowest tax bracket and then pull any other money i need from the roth accounts that are tax free this allows you to keep taxes fairly low in retirement   if you do n’t have a roth now this is a great way to start one

if you are splitting rent it is not income because you are reducing the amount of space you have available to you and reducing your rent it 's the same as if you moved to a smaller apartment you ca n't claim a deduction for rent paid so there really are no tax implications in this arrangement if you own a house and someone helps pay the mortgage that does become a rental situation if the other party has no ownership stake in the house could you find other ways to disguise it like having your brother pay utilities or buy groceries sure but i think it 's technically taxable income by the letter of the law i also do n't think the irs is going to come after you for trading a place to sleep for groceries cable

you have some good points but get this it will certainly come a point of time where say 80 of the working population can provide 100 of the goods services everyone needs then this will get to 70 60 this can result in two things either huge unemployment problem or overproduction and all that comes with it spoilage lower prices cost cutting i.e. again unemployment it may not be soon but i think it 's inevitable the problem with that is so far employment is a great way to redistribute wealth a fair way let 's say which is the actual problem at hand jobs would n't matter if we had another efficient mechanism to do that in fact it would be better if humans did n't have to work at all and focus on leisure science art w e but we do n't have such a mechanism unfortunately and as the need for a labor force shrinks things are going to get ugly even than now since the supply of labor will grow with human population the price of labor inevitably will go down which means even more transfer of wealth from middle lower class to the capital owners

this is a reasonable requirement which many banks probably have the reason is that after you deposit a check ach or direct deposit they may be reversed after a couple of days check bounced payment canceled etc if you wire the money out and then the check by which you got the money gets bounced the bank is left hanging because money wired out is very hard to return wire transfers are generally irreversible unless its a mistake in the wire   after 10 days these transactions can not be reversed and the money is bound to remain on the account so you can wire it out by the way it also goes for cashier 's checks as well i had a similar discussion with my banker do n't remember if it was wf or chase when i needed one based on a ach transfer from my savings account elsewhere they gave me the check but said that its because i proved that the transfer was from my own account

first let me say that $ 1000 is not that much of amount to invest in stocks you need to remember that each transaction buy sell has fees which vary between $ depending on the broker you mentioned scottrade they charge $ 7 per transaction for stocks and about twice as much for some mutual funds consider this you invest $ 1000 you gain $ 100 you 'll pay $ 15 in fees just to buy sell that 's 1.5 expense ratio if you invest in more than 1 stock multiply your fees to avoid that you can look into mutual funds different brokers offer different funds for free and almost all of them carry many of the rest for a fee when looking into funds you can find their expense ratio and compare remember that a fund with 1 expense ratio diversifies and invests in many stocks while for you 1.5 expense ratio is for investing in a single stock is it a good idea to invest only in us or diversify worldwide you can invest in the us but in funds that diversify worldwide or across industries generally it is a good idea to diversify i am 28 should i be a conservative investor or take some risks depends on how bad of a shape will you be if you lose all your principle what online brokerage service is the best i have heard a lot about    but want to be sure before i start it seems to be the    least expensive and most user friendly to me best is a problematic term scottrade is ok e*trade is ok you can try sharebuilder ameritrade there are several discount online brokers and plenty of on line reviews and comparisons amongst them what is a margin account and how would it affect my investing from    what i understand it comes into play when an investor borrows money    from the broker do i need to use it at all as i wo n't be investing on a big scale yet you understand right there are rules to use margin accounts and with the amount you have i 'd advise against them even if you get approved read through the brokers faq 's on their requirement should i keep adding money on a monthly basis to my brokerage account    to give me more money to invest or keep it at a certain amount for an    extended period of time sharebuilder has a mechanism to purchase monthly at discounted prices but be careful they give you discounted prices to buy but not to sell you may end up with a lot of positions and the discounts you 've gotten to buy will cause you spend much more on selling generally averaging investing monthly is a good way to save and mitigate some risks but the risks are still there this is good only for long term savings how should my breakdown my investments in terms of bonds vs stocks depends on your vulnerability and risk thresholds

wire transfers are not the same as ach transfers   i regular transfer money between chase ally capital one 360 and fidelity and have never been charged a fee because i never do wire transfers   the default for all these banks is ach you must explicitly choose wire transfers edit to answer the modified question one of the fastest ways to send money is via wire transfer although a wire transfer can take days in most cases a wire transfer takes place within minutes it is a direct bank to bank transaction that allows you to move money from your account directly into the account of someone else while it may seem similar to a wire transfer a transaction accomplished with the help of an automated clearing house ach is not the same thing when you arrange for the electronic transfer of funds all of the information is included in a batch which is then sent to the clearing house all of the transactions in the batch are then handled by the clearing house rather than as a direct bank to bank transaction as a result your money is not available as quickly as it often is with a wire transfer the ach process can be more convenient and is less expensive but it also takes a little bit longer

just to get the ball rolling here 's an answer it wo n't affect you in the slightest the pound happened to be anyway   if you read in the papers that brexit is making the pound fall that 's as valuable as anything else you 've ever read in the papers currencies go up and down drastically all the time and there 's nothing you can do about it we by fluke once bought a house in australia when that currency was very low over the next couple years the currency basically doubled i mean per the usd and we happened to sell it we made a 1/2 million measured in usd just a fluke i 've had the opposite happen on other occasions over the decades but currency changes mean absolutely nothing if you 're in that country the example from 2 was only relevant because we happened to be moving in and out of aus my various australian friends did n't even notice that their dollar went from .5 to 1 in terms of usd how could it matter to them all sorts of things drastically affect the general economy of a given country indeed note that a falling currency is often seen as a very good thing for a given nation 's economy conspiracy theorists in the states are forever complaining that nobody has the slightest clue if brexit will be good bad or indifferent for the uk anything could happen it could be the beginning of an incredible period of growth for the uk after all why does brussels not want your country to leave goodwill and your house could triple in value in a year or your house price could tumble to half in a year nobody has the slightest clue whatsoever about the effects on the economy of a country going forward of various inputs

nobody here really answered your question   the custodian of the 401k determines what funds and investment options are available within that 401k   so if they 're eliminating company stock as an option then they can absolutely make you sell out of it     you may be able to do an in service rollover and transfer your funds to an individual ira but that 's not particularly common among 401k administrators    aside from that i 'd ask why do you want to hold company stock anyway   generally i 'd advise against this as its imposing a ton of risk on your financial future   if your company tanks you 're out of a job which sucks   but it sucks even more if your company tanks and your 401k loses a ton of value at the same time    edit i see you asked who benefits as well   it may just be a situation of no benefit at all   perhaps the plan did n't have enough people investing in company stock to make the option cost effective   maybe the administrator decided that allowing people to take on that amount of risk was not in their best 's not   could be a ton of reasons but it 's unlikely the company did so out of greed   there is n't a lot of financial benefit for them there

the barclay 's 20 + year treasury bond inception date was july 21 2002 you are n't going to find treasury bond information going back to 1900 because treasury bills have only been issued since 1929 the u.s. department of the treasury will give you data back to 1990 there 's a good article in the globe and mail which covers why you may want to buy bonds as part of your portfolio the key is diversification historically stocks have done better than bonds long term but when stocks fall bonds tend to though do not always go up if you are investing for 30 years the risk of putting money into bonds is that you will not make as much money as if you had put the money into stocks historically in the us or canada you 'd have seen positive returns just not as high as investing in the stock market there are many investment strategies i live in canada and personally favour the one described in the canadian couch potato a passive index investment strategy where i invest my money in canadian u.s. and international equity stock market mutual funds and also in a canadian bond fund there are of course plenty of people who will tell you to take a radically different strategy with your investments

keep in mind that all of the information below assumes that being said here are some examples of national tax laws relating to barter transactions obviously this is n't an exhaustive list but based on my grossly non representative sample i think it 's fairly safe to assume that barter transactions are more likely taxable than not   you 're referring to a barter system in the united states the irs is very specific about this see the section titled bartering   bartering is an exchange of property or services the fair market    value of goods and services exchanged is fully taxable and must be    included on form 1040 in the income of both parties the irs also provides more details bartering occurs when you exchange goods or services without    exchanging money an example of bartering is a plumber doing repair    work for a dentist in exchange for dental services you must include    in gross income in the year of receipt the fair market value of goods    and services received in exchange for goods or services you provide or    may provide under the bartering arrangement generally you report this income on form 1040 schedule c pdf    profit or loss from business or form 1040 schedule c ez pdf net    profit from business if you failed to report this income correct    your return by filing a form 1040x pdf refer to topic for    amended return information so yes the net value of goods or services is most likely taxable according to the australian tax office barter transactions are and deductible for income tax    purposes to the same extent as other cash or credit transactions her 's revenue and customs states that if you supply services or goods new or second hand and receive other    goods or services in payment there are two separate supplies you must account for vat and so must your customer if they 're    vat registered the vat treatment is the same as for part exchanges    you must both account for vat on the amounts you would each have paid    for the goods or services if there had been no barter and they had    been paid for with money searching the website of the federal tax service for the russian word for barter does n't yield any results but that might be because even between google translate and the rest of the internet i do n't speak russian that being said i did manage to find this translated from the first full paragraph of the russian beginning with на the tax on personal income is paid by citizens of the russian    federation with all types of income received by them in the calendar    year either in cash or in kind since bartering would probably qualify as an in kind transaction it would likely be taxable   the south african revenue service includes barter transactions in the supply of goods taxed under the vat   the term supply is defined very broadly and includes all forms of    supply and any derivative of the term irrespective of where the    supply is effected the term includes performance in terms of a sale    rental agreement instalment credit agreement or barter transaction look for section 3.6 supply and taxable supply found on of the current version of the linked document

when you are a certain age you will be able to tap into your retirement accounts or start receiving pension and social security funds in addition you may be faced with required minimum distributions from these accounts   but even before you get to those points you will generally shift the focus of new funds into the retirement account to be more conservative depending on the balances in the various accounts and the size of the pension and social security accounts you may even move invested funds from aggressive to conservative investments the proper proportion of the many different types of investments and revenue streams is open to much debate during retirement you will be pulling money out of retirement accounts either to support your standard of living or to meet the required minimum distributions what to sell will be based on either the tax implications or the required distributions that will still maintain the asset allocation you desire    if your distributions are driven by the law you will be selling enough to meet a specific required $ figure you will either spend that money or move it into a low interest savings account or a non retirement investment account if trying to meet your standard of living expectations you will be selling funds that allow you to keep your desired asset allocation but still have enough to live on again you will be trying to meet a specific $ figure   of course you may decide at anytime in retirement to rebalance based on changes to your lifestyle family obligations or winning the lottery

approximately 25 of all cars sold last year were leased which is the highest on record when you are leasing you do n't own the car instead you are basically renting it for a fixed term and turning it back to the dealership   it is very cost effective because the manufacturers have a keen interest in making lots of cars they are often subsidizing the lease by giving incentives to the dealer they are gambling on the future value of their cars they can lose on that gamble the car business has turned into a financial nightmare for the car companies they have huge development costs as the cars become more like mobile computing platforms loaded with sensors and software that is constantly changing   they ca n't hold a model for 20 years like mercedes was able to do in the past now they have to constantly update their products the only way to survive as a car maker is to pump out volume and the leasing programs which are quietly being underwritten by the manufacturers help them increase the production quantities which helps lower the fixed development costs if only the defense contractors could do this they are stuck spending billions to build 20 planes and so each one has a staggering price tag   in the future the car companies that will survive are those that have terrific credit and low borrowing costs that means japanese and germans will own the car business entirely in the end and countries with higher borrowing costs like america and will not be competitive luckily ford is so frugal due to the lingering spirit of   its founder that they can hold out one thing strongly in favor of leasing is that you have zero maintenance costs typically the repair risk is significant in luxury cars   when you buy a 10 year old bmw and when the goes it costs a fortune having a superb car for 30 months for a few hundred bucks a month is something a lot of people enjoy doing who can blame them you spend an hour or 2 a day in your car and why not live in a nice place

if you 're curious here are my goals behind this silly madness you said it the last two words i mean if you 're auditing your statements why do you need to keep the info after the audit you got the statement for last month you verified that the starbucks charge that appears there is the same as in your receipts why keeping them further done no $ 10 throw them away why do you need to keep your refrigerator owner 's manual what for you do n't know how to operate a refrigerator you do n't know who the manufacturer is to look it up online in case you do need later read it once mark the maintenance details in your calendar like todo change the water filter in 3 months that 's it done throw it away to the paper recycle bin you need the receipt as a proof of purchase for warranty make a warranty folder and put all of them there why in expenses you do n't buy a refrigerator every months that 's it this way you 've eliminated the need to keep monthly expenses folders either throw stuff away after the audit or keep it filed where you really need it you only need a folder for two months at most last and current not for 12 months in each of the previous 4 years

a more recent article on inheritance taxes than the one cited by says that maryland does not charge inheritance tax on inheritances received from parents and other close relatives as well thus there is no inheritance tax due to maryland on your inheritance and of course estate tax both federal and state is imposed on the estate and payable by the estate and thus should have been taken into account by the executor before determining the amount to be divided among the children   if the executor screwed up on this point some of the inheritance may have to be returned to the estate so that the estate can pay the taxes due or be paid directly to the federal government and/or the state of maryland on behalf of the estate some part of the inheritance might be taxable income to you if it came in the form of an inherited ira on which federal and possibly state taxes have to paid on the taxable part of any distribution from the ira including the required minimum distribution that must be made from the ira each year there is also a 50 penalty for not taking at least the rmd each year note that the value of the ira is not taxable income in the year of inheritance just the money taken as a distribution some people liquidate the ira within 5 years as used to be required for non spouse under earlier tax law and thus end up paying a lot more income tax than they would have to pay if they went the rmd route if your uncle took the help of a lawyer in winding up your father 's estate you are probably ok in that all the rules were likely followed but if it was a do it yourself job or you do n't trust your uncle not to screw it up anyway then as john bensin has already told you you   should certainly consult   a tax professional in maryland to make sure you do n't run afoul of tax authorities

in your specific case i would leave them open unless you have a specific reason for wanting to close them particularly unless you feel closing them is necessary for you to not misuse them the impact on the credit score is not why i say this though   much more important are the two competing real factors my suggestion would be to take the cards and put them in your file cabinet or whatever would cause you to not use them   in fact you could even cut them up but not close the accounts i had an account open that i did n't possess a physical card for several years for and did n't use at all and it stayed open though it 's not guaranteed they 'll keep it open for you if you never use it    in an emergency you could then ask them to send you a new copy of the card very easily   but keep them just in case you need them once you have paid off your balances on your balance carrying cards then you should consider closing some of them   keep enough to be able to live for ~4 6 months a similar amount to the ideal rainy day fund in savings basically and then close others particularly if you can do so in a way that keeps your average account age reasonably stable

first make sure you understand the objective of an etf   in some cases they may use leverage to get a multiple of the index 's return that is different than 1   some may be ultra funds that go for double the return or double the inverse of the return and thus will try to apply the appropriate leverage to achieve that return those that use physical replication can still have a small portion be used to try to minimize the tracking error as there is something to be said for what kind of tracking error do you accept as the fund 's returns may differ from the index by some measure yes   for example if you were to have a fund that had a 50 and -50 return in back to back periods what would your final return be   answer which if you need to visualize this take $ 1 that then becomes $ 1.50 by going up 50 and then becomes $ .75 by going down 50 in a compounded fashion   this is where you have to be careful of the risks of leverage as those returns will compound in a possibly negative way

the two factors that will hurt you the most is the age of the credit account and your available credit to debt ratio   removing an older account takes that account out of the equation of calculating your overall credit score which can hurt significantly especially if that is the only or one of just a couple of open credit lines you have available reducing your available credit will make your current debt look bigger than what it was before you closed your account going over a certain percentage for your debt to available credit can make you look less favorable to lenders as stated above closing a credit card does remove it from the credit utilization calculation which can raise your debt credit ratio it does not however affect the average age of credit cards even closed accounts stay on your credit report for ten years and are credited toward average age of cards when the closed credit card falls off your report only then will the average age of credit cards be recalculated and may i suggest getting your free credit report from it 's the only place considered official to receive your free annual credit report as told by the ftc going to other 3rd party sites to pull your credit report can risk your information being traded or sold edit to answer your second point there are numerous factors that banks and creditors will consider depending on the type of card you 're applying for the heavier the personal rewards cash back flyer miles discounts etc the bigger the stipulation some factors to consider are your income to debt ratio income to available credit ratio number of revolving lines of credit debt to available credit ratio available credit to debt ratio and whether or not you have sufficient equity and/or assets to cover both your debt and available credit they want to make sure that if you go crazy and max out all of your lines of credit that you are capable of paying it all back in a sufficient amount of time in other words your volatility as a debt consumer

unfortunately i do not have much experience with european banks however i do know of ways to earn interest on bank accounts cds certificates of deposit are a good way to earn interest its basically a savings account that you can not touch for a fixed rate of time you can set it from an average of 6 months to 12 months you can pull the money out early if there is an emergency as well i would also look into different types of bank accounts if you go with an account other than a free one the interest rate will be higher and as long as you have the minimum amount required you should not be charged hope i was able to help

the risk of any investment is measured by its incremental effect on the volatility of your overall personal wealth including your other investments   the usual example is that adding a volatile stock to your portfolio may actually reduce the risk of your portfolio if it is negatively correlated with the other stuff in your portfolio common measures of risk such as beta assume that you have whole market diversified portfolio in the case of an investment that may or may not be hedged against currency movements we ca n't say whether the hedge adds or removes risk for you without knowing what else is in your portfolio   if you are an eu citizen with nominally savings or otherwise stand to lose buying power if the euro depreciates relative to the dollar than the hedged etf is less risky than the unhedged version   on the other hand if your background risk is such that you benefit from that depreciation then the reverse is true hedging means reducing the risk already present in your portfolio   in this case it does not refer to reducing the individual volatility of the etf   it may or may not do that but individual asset volatility and risk are two very different things

ending up with nothing is an unlikely situation unless you invest 100 in a company stock and the company goes under in order to give you a good answer we need to see what options your employer gives for 401k investments the best advice would be to take a list of all options that your employer allows and talk with a financial advisor here are a few options that you may or may not have as an option from an employer definitions from wikipedia a target date fund also known as a lifecycle dynamic risk or age based fund is a collective investment scheme usually a mutual fund designed to provide a simple investment solution through a portfolio whose asset allocation mix becomes more conservative as the target date usually retirement approaches an index fund or index tracker is a collective investment scheme usually a mutual fund or exchange traded fund that aims to replicate the movements of an index of a specific financial market an exchange traded fund etf is an investment fund traded on stock exchanges much like an etf holds assets such as stocks commodities or bonds and trades close to its net asset value over the course of the trading day most etfs track an index such as a stock index or bond index etfs may be attractive as investments because of their low costs tax efficiency and stock like features the capital stock or stock of an incorporated business constitutes the equity stake of its owners which one can you lose everything in you can lose everything in stocks by the company going under in index funds the entire market that it follows would have to collapse the chances are slim here since the index made up of several companies the s&p 500 is made up of 500 leading companies publicly traded in the u.s.   a pacific europe index such as msci eafe index is made up of companies the chances of losing everything in an etf are also slim the etf that follows the s&p 500 is made up of 500 companies an pacific europe etf such as msci eafe etf is made up of companies target date funds are also slim to lose everything target date funds are made up of several companies like indexes and etfs and also mix in bonds and other investments depending on your age what would i recommend i would recommend the index funds and/or etfs that have the lowest fee that make up the following strategy for your age why not target date funds or stocks target date funds have high fees later in life when you are closer to retirement you may want to add bonds to your portfolio at that time if this is the only option to add bonds then you can change your elections stocks are too risky for you with your current knowledge if your company matches by buying their stock you may want to consider reallocating that stock at certain points to your index funds or etfs

purchases and sales from the same trade date will both settle on the same settlement date they do n't have to pay for their purchases until later either because hft typically make many offsetting trades buying selling buying selling buying selling etc when the purchases and sales settle the amount they pay for their purchases will roughly cancel with the amount they receive for their sales the difference being their profit or loss margin accounts and just having extra cash around can increase their ability to have trades that do not perfectly offset in practice the hft 's broker will take a smaller amount of cash e.g. $ 1 million as a deposit of capital and will then allow the hft to trade a larger amount of stock value long or short e.g. $ 10 million for 10:1 leverage that $ 1 million needs to be enough to cover the net profit loss when the trades settle and the broker will monitor this to ensure that deposit will be enough

student loan is a class of unsecured loan   the characteristics that define a student loan are primarily that it is a loan that is intended to be used by someone who is currently a student   beyond that though there are many variations the different kinds of requirements usually have to do with who is eligible for the loan and with what the loan is allowed to be used to pay   some loans have other limitations such as only being allowed to be directly paid to the institution some student loans are federally guaranteed meaning the federal government will repay the bank if you default   those have a lower interest rate typically and often have more stringent requirements such as only full time students being eligible being need based and limitations on what the loan 's funds can be used for   see for more information many private student loans have quite lax limitations some for example have nearly no limitation as to what they can fund many are allowed to be taken out by part time students and even non degree seeking students in some cases   private loans usually have somewhat higher rates as they 're entirely unsecured to go along with the lower restrictions and higher borrowing limits   you 'd have to see the specific details of any particular loan to know what it 's allowed to pay for so if you choose this route know what you plan to use it to pay for before you go looking

unfortunately not even if the credit card balance is positive i.e. customer has overpaid the credit card account you can not withdraw cash for free as any cash withdrawal is subject to interest even if repaid in full at the end of the month the clarity credit card is one of the best cards for overseas spending as its load free no fees for purchases abroad and it gives near perfect exchange rates if your balance is positive you start at £ 0 then fund that credit card account from your bank account £ 500 you can then spend on your credit card and when your next bill is due at the end of the month they will use that extra £ 500 sitting in your account first and ask for the remainder from you i.e.     scenario 2 it is better in my opinion to set up a direct debit to always clear out the full amount on your credit card that way you have cash in your bank account for emergencies getting £ 500 back from a credit card will take a few days to process as opposed to having the ability to withdraw cash from the 24/7 and once the direct debit is paid automatically at the end of the month there are no fees voila your credit card is almost like a debit card spend on it when you like it gets paid automatically no hassle no worries this approach does take a careful mindset though as you need to know your credit limits and also you need to ensure your bank account has enough to pay off the direct debit at the end of the month otherwise those darn fees will get you and hurt your credit rating for cash spending you will want to either take cash with you check online here for best rates get the money well in advance to avoid fees also in some countries the exchange rate is better there than in the uk google will help you here if you do nt like the idea of carrying large sums of cash with you can use a prepaid card like which is one of the better ones out there the other well known ones are fairfx and travelex cash passport

there are two distinct questions that may be of interest to you both questions are relevant for funds that need to buy or sell large orders that you are talking about the answer depends on your order type and the current market state such as the level 2 order book suppose there are no iceberg or hidden orders and the order book image courtesy of this question currently is   an unlimited at market buy order for 12,000 shares gets filled immediately it gets 1,100 shares at at and 1,200 at after this order the lowest ask price becomes and the highest bid is obviously still because the previous order was a market order a limited buy order for 12,000 shares with a price limit of gets the first two fills just like the market order 1,100 shares at and at however the remainder of the order will establish a new bid price level for 1,200 shares at it is possible to enter an unlimited buy order that the book however such a trade would often be considered a mis trade and either i be cancelled by the broker ii be cancelled or undone by the exchange or iii hit the maximum price move a stock is allowed per day limit up funds and banks often have to buy or sell large quantities just like you have described however they usually do not punch through order book levels as i described before instead they would spread out the order over time and buy a smaller quantity several times throughout the day simple algorithms attempt to get a price close to the time weighted average price or volume weighted average price vwap and would buy a smaller amount every n minutes despite splitting the order into smaller pieces the price usually moves against the trader for many reasons there are many models to estimate the market impact of an order before executing it and many brokers have their own model for example deutsche bank there is considerable research on market impact if you are interested i understand the general principal that when significant buy orders    comes in relative to the sell orders price goes up and when a    significant sell order comes in relative to buy orders it goes down i consider this statement wrong or at least misleading first stocks can jump in price without or with very little volume consider a company that releases a negative earnings surprise over night on the next day the stock may open 20 lower without any orders having matched for any price in between the price moved because the perception of the stocks value changed not because of buy or sell pressure second buy and sell pressure have an effect on the price because of the underlying reason and not necessarily only because of the mechanics of the market assume you were prepared to sell stock but suddenly there 's a lot of buzz and your colleagues are talking about buying it would you still sell it for the same price i would n't i would try to find out how much they are prepared to buy it for in other words buy pressure can be the consequence of successful marketing of the stock and the marketing buzz is what changes the price

note that you 're asking about withholding not about taxing   withholding does n't mean this is exactly the tax you 'll pay it means they 're withholding a certain amount to make sure you pay taxes on it but the tax bill at the end of the year is the same regardless of how you choose to do the withholding   your tax bill may be higher or lower than the withholding amount as far as tax rate that will be the same regardless you 're just moving the money from one place to the other    the only difference would be that your tax is based on total shares under the plan meaning that if you buy 1k shares for example at $ 10 so $ 1,500 discounted income if you go the payroll route you get say $ 375 withheld   if you go the share route you either get $ 375 worth of stock so 38 shares withheld and then you would lose out on selling that stock meaning you do n't get quite as much out of it at the end or you would ask them to actually buy rather more shares to make up for it meaning you 'd have a slightly higher total gain   that would involve a slightly higher tax at the end of it of course option 1   buy and then sell $ 10000 worth share based withholding   assuming 15 profit and $ 10/share at both points then buy sell 1000 shares $ 1500 in profit to take into account 38 shares worth = $ 380 withheld   you put in $ 8500 you get back $ net $ 1120    option 2   buy and then sell $ worth share based withholding   same assumptions   you make about $ 2000 in pre tax profit meaning you owe about $ 500 in tax withholding   put in $ get back $ net $   owe 35 more tax at the end of the year but you have the full $ 1500 to spend on whatever you are doing with it option 3   buy and then sell $ 1000 worth paycheck withholding   you get the full $ = $ 1500 up front but your next paycheck is $ 375 lighter   same taxes as option 1 at the end of the year

assuming that partial payments are held without interest until enough money has accumulated to make at least a full payment and assuming that overpayments are applied toward principal a strategy of making three $   payments per month will shorten your amortization period by less than one month   these calculations assume that the interest rate is 12.5 percent apr compounded monthly with an apy of percent instead of 71 payments of $   plus a final payment of $   you would make the equivalent of 71 payments of $   plus a final payment of $   if you make one $   payment every ten days you will make an average of partial payments per year instead of 36 partial payments per year   this will speed up your loan amortization by about another month and a half over the course of the 72 month loan   one month of shortening is due to the extra principal payments and the other half month is due to interest savings    to a second approximation this strategy is similar to paying $   per month for 69 months plus a final payment of $     in other words this strategy will probably involve about payments of $   each possibly with a small payment

you pay taxes on capital gains when you realize your gains by selling the investment property   also in the us taxes on capital gains are computed at special rates depending on your current income level and so when you realize your gains two years from now you will pay taxes on the gains at the special rate then applicable to your income level for the year of sale remember also that the us congress   can change the tax laws at any time between now and the time you sell your stocks and so the rates you are looking at now may have changed too

creditworthiness is proven over time the longer your track record of making payments on time the more probable you will stick to credit agreements in future or so the reasoning goes conversely someone who has only just started applying for credit could be someone whose finances were previously stable but have now started to get into difficulty obviously this is not necessarily the case but it is one possible inference this inference is strengthened when same person applies for further credit in a short space of time   ultimately what is considered positive is a stable credit record over a reasonable period of time because it indicates you stick to payment schedules and do n't suddenly need credit due to money problems credit card accounts are considered a good indicator of credit status because they imply what kind of borrower you are whereas many credit arrangements present a straightforward case of arrears no arrears e.g. think of a mobile phone account either you pay your bill or you do n't with credit cards there is an element of flexibility in how much you borrow and how much of that you repay if you run up four figure monthly balances but clear them in full each month without fail that is a good sign if your average balance is increasing and you are paying on time but just the minimum amount that is a potential flag in other words credit cards are of particular interest because they paint a more nuanced picture provided you use one responsibly getting and using a credit card may improve your status with credit reference agencies

any one of your three options is viable and has its advantages and disadvantages personally i would go for the used option but i am can do kind of person if you do n't like micro managing a car you may prefer leasing a new car is sort of the middle of the road option leasing will be most expensive and most liability if you have an accident the leasing arrangements are designed to extract money from you heavily even a minor accident can require you to pay for expensive repairs usually much more expensive than if you had your own car fixed so not only will you pay more per month but your accident liability will be a lot higher with your own car you will need to sell it or bring it back to the uk obviously a used car will be the cheapest option a non used car from the local area can also make you blend in and be less like to be targeted by a criminal as an outsider as long as you stay away from dealers and buy the car from a private person of good reputation you have an odds on chance of getting a decent car make sure you check out the person and make sure they are real some dealers called try to pretend to be original owners you can always spot such frauds because the title will be new make sure the same owner has had the car for at least 3 4 years and that it says that on the title also try to buy from somebody who is financially well off they have less reason to try to screw you students people under 30 and working class are bad people to buy from married professionals over age 35 are the right kind of person to buy from

there is really much simpler explanation for the interest rate differences in different countries it is the interest rate arbitrage it is a very well explored economic concept so you can look it up on the internet in case you want to know more 1 interest rates for the same currency in different countries basically as one smart person here pointed out there is only one price of money in free market economy it happens because investors can move their money anywhere in the world to capitalize on the local interest rates advantage for instance if i can take a loan in the usa at 3 4 annual interest and receive 5 6 annual income on my dollar deposit in russia i would take a loan in the us and open a deposit in russia to enjoy a risk free interest rate differential income of 2 5 6 3 4 ~ 2 so would any reasonable person however in real world very few banks in russia or anywhere would pay you an an interest rate higher than it can borrow money at it 'd probably lose money if it 'd do so anyways the difference between the risk free rate and interest rate on the dollar deposit can be attributed to the risk premium of this particular bank the higher expected return the greater risk premium if there is a positive difference in the interest rates on the dollar deposits in different countries it will almost entirely accounted for the risk premium it is generally much riskier to keep money in say russian bank than american that 's why investors want greater return on their dollar deposits in russian banks than in american of course if you 'd want to park your usd in russian bank you 'd also have to consider transaction costs so as you may have already guessed there is no free lunch 2 interest rates in different currencies for different countries if we are talking about the interest rates in different sovereign currencies it is a somewhat similar concept only there is more risk if you keep money in local currency risk premium is much higher probably the biggest component of this risk is inflation that is only attributed to the prices in local currency for that reason current interest rates on deposits in russian rubles are at 10 12 but only 1 3 in the us dollars an economic concept that discusses this phenomenon in great detail is interest rate parity   hope this was helpful p.s. it does n't look quite realistic that you can get an 8 annual income for usd deposit in russia with the interest rates in the u.s. being at 1 2 at present moment a 30-year mortgage annual interest rate in the us is at ~2 3 and an annual interest rates for dollar deposits in one of the safest russian banks = very little risk premium is at 1 3 so arbitrage is impossible

we just got in an argument in another thread and i do n't necessarily want to continue it but was browsing your comments and saw this i can say from personal experience i have several high net worth clients that this is n't true the rich do the opposite of leave their money laying around they invest it to make more money they buy office buildings fund new companies buy up stocks and drive investment in general someone has to do these things office buildings ca n't just be owned by the people someone with a ton of money has to come along and fund them    for example one of my friends knows elon musk founder of pay pal tesla motors solar city and space x he is worth $ 2 billion but was living on other people 's including my friend 's after he sold pay pal because he had just poured all of his cash into starting tesla motors he was a billionaire without a penny to his name well i 'm sure he had a little cash lying around but was essentially asset rich cash broke    that is what most ultra rich people are like they invest their money they do n't just horde it away in a savings account the things people like musk do create jobs and sometimes entire industries or three entire industries in his case i 'm by no means arguing that this is right or wrong but to say rich people just have money lying around is absurd you do n't get rich by saving money in the bank you get rich by spending it   i 'm in my early 20 's but already own multiple apartment buildings i 'm not rich yet and am in the same boat as musk was i have tons of assets but almost no cash i can spend however you bet my efforts are creating jobs i 'm employing people to renovate and people to repair and maintain these buildings i 'm helping stop the bleeding in the real estate market but according to the narrative i 'm evil because my income is six figures

thanks for your reply i think a lot of people are confused when talking about ownership and i think it is a issue    when a company issues stock the first time or anytime what they are doing is selling the right to a percentage of the dividend they are not actually selling parts of the company to you everyone thinks this way though and that has to do with the chicago school economists who perpetuated their ideas of ownership which is what everyone know thinks is the case this way of thinking about corporations and ownership is just wrong not ethically just erroneous    as i stated before of cornell university explains this really well i would encourage anyone to read more about it

i would like to buy hubby a beer and talk some sense into him   do you have 2 years gross income saved as your retirement balance that 's about where he should be at age 30 i wrote about this in an article retirement savings ratio   blowing the 401(k for anything less than an extreme emergency is downright foolish   the decision whether to roll it to an ira or the new account is n't so simple if you roll it to new plan yes you can borrow up to 60 months at a low rate 4 or so taking the cash and then making an ira deposit just means paying the penalty for nothing unless you manage it just right depositing the amount within 60 day etc you do n't mention what he wants to do with it you need to sit down and have a long money talk   keep in mind if you it 's easy to retire early or at 50 just stop saving spend every new dime but it 's something else to turn 50 and realize you will have to work till you die i 've seen both situations i am 48 the mrs 54 our multiple is now 13 the target is 20 to retire the house is not counted as it ca n't be spent the mortgage is counted as it must be paid edit as i read this again i see the op asked about opening an ira in the same year they withdraw the 401(k and pay tax and penalty wow i also see her user reverted to generic which means i think she 's never returned i hope they made the right decision to keep the money in retirement accounts hubby never even said what he wanted the money for

some have suggested you can put the money in the 401k then take a loan to pay off the student loan debt   some things to consider before doing that check your 401k plan first   some plans allow you to continue paying on a loan if you leave the company some do not   if you have to change jobs before you pay back the 401k loan you may only have 90 days to completely pay the loan or the irs will treat this as an early withdrawal which means taxes and penalties   if you do n't have another job lined up this is going to make things much worse since you will have lost your income and may owe even more to the government depending on your state it may be up to 50 of the remaining amount   there are ways to work with some student debt loans to defer or adjust payments   there is no such option with a 401k plan this may change your taxes at the end of the year   most people can deduct student loan interest payments   you can not deduct interest paid to your 401k loan   you are paying the interest to yourself though    it may hurt your long term growth potential   currently loans on 401k loans are in the 4 range   if you are able to make more than 4 inside of your 401k you will be losing out on that growth since that money will only be earning the interest you pay back it may limit flexibility for a few years   when people fall on hard times their 401k is their last resort   some plans have a limit on the number of loans you can have at one time   you may need a loan or a withdrawal in the future   once you take the money out for a loan you ca n't access it again   see the first bullet about working with student loan vendors they typically have ways to work with you under hard circumstances   401k loans do n't amortization schedule   many 401k loans can only be amortized for a max of 5 years if you currently have 10 year loans can you afford to pay the same debt back in 1/2 the time at a lower rate   you will have to do the math when considering debt other than student loans such as credit cards if you fall on hard times you can always negotiate to reduce the amount you owe or the debt can be discharged with tax penalties of course   they ca n't make you take money out   once it is out it is fair game just to clarify the above is n't saying you should n't do it under any circumstances it is a few things you need to evaluate before making that choice   the 401k is supposed to be used to help secure your financial future when you ca n't work   the numbers may work out in the short term but do they still work out in the long term   most credit cards require minimum payments high enough to pay back in 7 10 years so does shortening that to 5 or less make up for the probably early years of compounding interest for your retirement   i think others have addressed some of this so i wo n't do the math i can tell you that i have a 401k loan and when things got iffy at my job for it was a very bad feeling to have that over my head because unlike other debts there is n't much you can do about it

the simple answer would be if you want to take euros from germany to spain as cash and deposit them you 're not breaking any laws there is nothing to declare to customs you 're still in the eu it is not income so there is nothing to tax and your bank should be able to receive it without issue no currency conversion after all it does however come with the risk of loss theft en route so it really depends on how comfortable you are walking around with that much on your person if you do n't want to carry that much around and your banks are imposing unreasonable fees here 's something you could investigate further i have not tested it myself transferwise offers a service that lets people send money to foreign accounts in different currencies for a small fee at mid market rates however they also offer a request money feature which allows eur eur transfers and some other same currency transfers so perhaps you could use this feature to simply request money from yourself the puts in how much they want to receive then they send a generated link to the other party when clicked that link sets up a transaction for the requested amount and sometimes a nominal fee i created a link for a gbp gbp transfer and it wanted 1 pound extra but when i did the same for eur eur it did n't want any extra i assume you would need two transferwise accounts though maybe not and i 'm not sure whether doing this is technically allowed in their terms of service so you should read those to be sure the advantage if this works is that neither bank sees it as a transfer rather the originating bank makes a payment to transferwise and then transferwise makes a deposit to the receiving account so i ca n't imagine either bank would be able to impose their foreign bank transfer fees for the transaction i have used transferwise for currency conversions but not the request money feature maybe other users could chime in if they have used it

after tax contributions to a 401k are after tax    the earnings on that money is taxable but not the contributions this means you 'll have $ 15,000 in the 401k and $ 10,000 is considered after tax and $ 5,000 is considered pre tax the after tax portion can be converted to a roth ira without paying taxes or penalties new in september 2014 the irs has made substantial changes that now enable this to happen    you can request a distribution from your 401k provider where they divide the money into pre tax and after tax funds   in my example you 'd get a check for $ 10,000 that you could send to a roth ira and a check for $ 5,000 you could add to a traditional roll over ira neither of those would be taxable events and you 'd end with a roth ira with $ 10 k and a traditional rollover ira with $ 5 k in it notes

i ca n't find a decent duplicate so here are some general guidelines first of all by stocks the answers generally mean equities which could be either single stocks or mutual funds that consist of stocks unless you have lots of experience that can help you discern good stocks from bad investing in mutual funds reduces the risk considerably if you want to fine tune the plan you can weigh certain categories higher to change your risk return profile e.g. equity funds will have higher returns and risk than fixed income bond funds so if you want to take a little more risk you can put more in equity funds and less in fixed income funds lastly do n't stress too much over the individual investments   the most important thing is that you get as much company match as you can   you can not beat the 100 return that comes from a company match the allocation is mostly insignificant compared to that   plus you can probably change your allocation later easily and cheaply if you do n't like it disclaimer   these are general guidelines for 401(k investing in general and not personal advice

your credit score is really bad and it 's highly unlikely anyone will be willing to give you a mortgage especially if you still have bad debt showing up on your credit report what would help well clearing off any bad debt would be a good place to start ideally you want to get your credit rating up above though that may be optimistic here note though that bad debt falls off your credit report after a while exactly how long depends on your province note that making partial payment or even just acknowledging the debt will reset the timer however i mention this though because you mention some of your debt is from 5 or 6 years ago it may be just about to fall off it would also help if you can show that your credit is so bad because of mistakes from a number of years ago but you 've been making payments and staying on top of all debts for the past few years if that 's the case also it would help if you had a reasonable downpayment 20 minimum but you 'll be a lower credit risk if you are able to put down 50 75 you could also consider having someone with good credit co sign the mortgage note that most people will not be willing to do this as they take on substantial financial risk all that said there are some institutions which specialise in dealing with no credit or bad credit customers you pay more fees and will pay a vastly higher interest rate but this may be a good option for you check out mortgage brokers specialising in high risk clients you can also consider a rent to own but almost all the advice i 've ever seen say to avoid these if you can one late payment and you may lose all the equity you think you 've been building up note that things may be different if you are moving from the u.s. to canada and have no credit history in canada in that case you may have no credit rather than bad credit most banks still wo n't offer you a mortgage in this case but some lenders do target recent immigrants do n't rule out renting for many people regardless of their credit rating renting is a better option the monthly payments may be lower you do n't need a downpayment you do n't have to pay realtor and legal fees and pay again if you need to move a couple of sites provide more information on how your credit rating affects your possibility of getting a mortgage and how to get mortgages with bad credit and along with

so it seems like a lot of people here are n't exactly sure about why this works and its financial implications    so what you are referring to is in finance something called funds transfer pricing or ftp often referred to as just transfer pricing like anything else ftp has its place most companies however do n't use it properly ftp theoretically has one primary purpose although it 's developed a second to properly allocate opportunity costs across divisions   let 's say company a produces widgets they sell these widgets for $ 200 at a total cost of $ 150 and book profits of $ 50 now to produce the widget division 1 makes a computer chip at a cost of $ 50 that it then sells to division 2 for $ 60 division 1 then books a profit of $ 10 division 2 then makes some plastic stuff and the device this is labor intensive so division 2 's costs are $ 100 company a sells the completed device for $ 150 division 2 subsequently books profits of $ 40 and appears much more profitable than division 1 on the surface   the problem arises when division 1 could sell the chip to the open market for $ 125 now it costs them $ 50 to produce and they could make a theoretical profit of $ 75 this is more than the company makes as a whole on the entire device by having division 2 pay effectively fair market price for that chip you realize that division 2 is really operating at a loss the opportunity cost of not selling the chip to market is greater than producing the completed device company a would be better off getting rid of division 2 and solely focusing on division 1 in a good ftp system division 2 would pay the fair market price of $ 125 if done properly management would   hopefully realize it should divest division 2   that 's the fundamental premise behind ftp in actuality things get much more complicated because of economics the company itself branding it operations management labor laws etc that s why most companies screw it up all that other stuff falls under what s called cost allocation accounting it gets very complex and entire masters courses are dedicated to it different methods etc    the other thing you can do with ftp is get crazy tax breaks due to various tax laws the simplified explanation is that divisions pay taxes on profits to the government that division is located in this works on the state level too btw ge does a lot of this and it 's a big part of why they pay almost no taxes again it gets more complicated when you involve audits as there 's some grey area legally    for simplicity assume tax rates are 40 in the us and 10 in india so let 's say ge makes an airplane engine in the us but finishes manufacturing in india these specific engines costs $ 5,000,000 for the us division to make up to a certain point   the us division can then sell the engine at a break even to india so india pays $ 5,000,000 for the engine the us division then books no profit india finishes the manufacturing with additional costs of $ 1,000,000 the india division then sells the engine to the open market for $ therefore the india division books a profit of $ and pays taxes of $ 300,000 now ge as a whole makes a profit of $ less taxes of $ 300,000 = net profit of $   further let 's say the fair market value of the engine as is when the us sells to india is $ that would mean us should book profits of $ 2,000,000 and india should book profits of $ 1,000,000 total taxes by ge are now $ 800,000 us + $ 100,000 india = $ 900,000 however what 's important is that net profit is now $ ge just saved $ 600,000 in taxes by doing the beauty of this is divisions are supposed to charge fair market value for products internationally however it 's really hard for the irs to say what the value of an unfinished product really is heck you could be offering bulk discounts etc   the fact is often us divisions have skilled labor that is difficult to replicate elsewhere they just show us divisions operating at losses to make the company as a whole better the problem again arises when top management do n't fully appreciate or understand the reasoning behind this stuff they end up making cuts to us labor because it 's unprofitable without thinking about the entire story    i know this is very long winded but hope it helps   tldr companies ftp to recognizes profitability and opportunity costs of divisions as well as use it for overseas tax breaks   side note politically speaking people who know how this works are pissed off about it in the u.s. do n't worry though most politicians on both sides do n't have a clue we have high corporate tax rates relative to other countries and irs loopholes allow this kind of thing lobbying $ $ it 's also why economically you ca n't just raise corporate tax rates to increase domestic tax as more companies will just implement this process it 's complicated to do properly also please do n't say 50 years ago tax rates were higher and raising taxes increased receipts the fact is most companies could n't even fathom doing this 50 years ago no less even 20   edit some clarification in wording

the best answer for you is going to depend completely on your financial goals   do you want to be debt free   are you comfortable with the risks of long distance rentals   do you have good resources to take care of any issues where the properties are at    you ca n't directly compare the returns of risky investments versus the risk free return of paying off debt the expected return of the property might be higher that the interest on the loan but when you incorporate risk there 's a decent chance that you 'll make less money on the property than you pay on the loan other things to consider another way to think about it is   if you did not have the debt or the houses would you borrow money at 4 or whatever your student loan is at to buy a rent house in arizona

i have done wal mart 's in store pickup exactly once and do n't plan on doing it again you 'd think the item pickup would be at the customer service desk right next to the front door of the store wrong it 's at its own desk in the very back of the store next to the employee bathrooms the furthest it could possibly be from the front door   i wound up waiting longer for an attendant to on back to the pick up desk dig out my items from the back and ring me up than i would have taken getting the items myself seriously i the needs assistance at the pickup desk three times over the course of fifteen minutes and had to ask two employees having a chit chat break in the department directly outside of the pickup area to page someone before the employee responsible for minding the desk actually showed up turns out one of those employees having the chatting session was the person supposed to be helping us oh and since the desk was right next to the employee bathrooms several employees went back for breaks while we were waiting not one of them asked us if we were being helped or really spared us a glance in the first place   and to top it all off since i was a cart with bags of purchased merchandise and large boxes with electronics from the rear of the store instead of from the normal cash register area of course i was eagerly by a receipt checker on the way out of the store   it was an exercise in extreme frustration never again

it is not a creative career you do n't make anything you serve your purpose in the economy and it is interesting to be surrounded and in the middle of business like this but at the end of the day you sell a service that anyone else can do and your clients the businesses are the actual smart ones they are the ones that make something and make real decisions in finance you just trade or research or sell your investment banking services its pretty bs you leach of what actual creative people are doing unless you are at a buy side shop and high up but then you would be incredibly intelligent and lucky    that all being said i have no regrets choosing finance it is still a great career and any job gets boring after a bit i wish i worked in a different area of finance yes but every area you need to start as someones bitch for a few years and i 'm not sure if i can do that again more math education always helps in finance

what 's the best strategy buy low and sell high now a lot of people try to do this a few are successful but for the most part people who try to time the market end up worse a far more successful strategy is to save over your entire lifetime put the money into a very low cost market fund and just let the average performance take you to retirement put another way if you think that there is an obvious no fail double your money due to a correction strategy you 're wrong otherwise everyone would do it and someone who tells you that there is such a strategy almost surely will be trying to separate you from a good amount of your money   in the end $ 80 k is n't a life altering never have to work again amount of money what i think you ought to do with it is pay off any credit card debts you may have pay a significant chunk of student loan or other personal loan debts you may have make sure you have a decent emergency fund set aside and then put the rest into diversified low cost mutual funds think of it as a nice leg up towards your retirement

there are 2 primary ways to bet against a stock if you think it will decline the first is to short sell shares of that stock the second is to buy put options i would also add that selling naked call options would also be a bet against but i do n't believe that is as common as the other 2 mentioned methods the problem with short selling an ipo is that you first have to borrow the shares you are going to sell since the shares are privately held prior to the ipo that can be problematic even after the ipo you may have to wait a bit before shares become available to borrow   the problem with options either buying puts or seeking naked calls is similar options are traded on a different exchange than the stock and they have their own requirements that a stock must meet to have options traded both of these problems eventually correct themselves however not in time for you to catch the initial fall you seem to be looking for

i think this question is perfectly on topic and probably has been asked and answered many times   however i can not help myself here are some basics however personal finance is not only about math   as a guy who took vector calculus just for fun i have learned that superior math skills do not translate into superior net worth   personal finance is about 50 behavior   take a look at the housing crisis car loans or payday lenders and you will understand that the desire to be accepted by others often trumps the math surrounding a transaction outline your goals   what is it that you want in life   a pile of money or to retire early   what does your business look like   how much cash will you need   do you want to own a ton of rental properties   how does all this happen set intermediate goals then get on a budget   a budget is a plan to spend your money in advance   stick to it   from there you can see how much money you have to implement various goals   are your goals to aggressive    this is really important as people have a tendency to spend more money then they have   often times when people receive a bonus at work they spend that one bonus on two or three times over   a budget will prevent this from happening get an emergency fund   without an emergency fund you be subject to the financial whims of people involved in your own life and that of the broader marketplace   once you have one you are free to invest with impunity and have less stress in a world that deals out plenty   bad things will happen to you financially protect against them the best first investments are simple   invest in yourself   find a way to make a very healthy income with upward mobility   also get out and stay out of debt   these things are not sexy but they pay off in the long run the next best investment is also simple   index funds   these become the bench mark for all other investments   if you do not stand a good chance of beating the s&p 500 index fund why bother   just dump the money in the fund and sleep well at night

my advice to you is not to take any advice from anyone when it comes to investing especially when you do n't know much about what you are investing in mbhunter is correct take your time to learn about what you want to invest in if your goal at the moment is short term do n't invest in stocks unless you really know what you are doing    put your money where you can get the highest interest rate continue saving and do a lot of research on the house you wish to buy even if you are not ready to buy a house yet start looking so that by the time you are ready to buy you know how much the house is really worth before buying our house we spent about 7 months looking and researching and looked at more than 100 houses

check with the manufacturer of the name brand medication   most of them have programs to help people who need their medication but can not afford it   they may be able to send you coupons for discounted or free medication   you can go to a free clinic   if your income is low enough the free clinic will provide medicine until you can get back on insurance    you can do what alot of people who work hard and do not have insurance do and pay for it pocket   you can talk to your doctor and see if there is an alternative to the expensive medicine that your insurance used to pay for it may not be as effective or may have other side affects but many people are forced to go with these alternatives    you situation is unfortunate but also not terribly uncommon   you probably also have recourse against the former employer but if they fraud and faked your insurance there probably is not alot of money to recoup   if it was a person who fraud then you may be able to get a judgement against them that would survive bankruptcy and the business but it will probably be at least 5 years before you can recoup anything possibly much longer and your attorney will probably not take it on contingency

i 'm not sure what you expect in terms of answers but it depends on personal factors it pretty well has to depend on personal factors since otherwise everyone would want to do the same thing either everyone thinks the current price is one to sell at or everyone thinks it 's one to buy at and there would be no trades you would n't be able to do what you want except on the liquidity provided by market makers once that 's hit the price is shifting quickly so your calculation will change quickly too purely in terms of maximising expected value taking into account the time value of money it 's all about the same the market should already know everything you know which means that one time to sell is as good as any other the current price is generally below the expected acquisition price because there 's a chance the deal will fall through and the stock price will plummet that 's not to say there are n't clever sure fire trading strategies around acquisitions but they 're certain to be based on more than just timing when to sell an existing holding of stock if you have information that the market does n't and assuming it is legal to do so then you trade based on that information if you know something the market does n't that 's going to be good for price hold if you know something that will reduce the price sell now and know can be used in a loose sense if you have a strong opinion against the market then you might like to invest based on that nothing beats being paid for being right finally bear in mind that expected return is not the same as utility you have your own investment goals and your own view of risk if you 're more risk averse than the market then you might prefer to sell now rather than wait for the acquisition if you 're more risk prone than the market then you might prefer a 90 chance of $ 1 to that 's fine hold the stock the extreme case of this is that you might have a fixed sum at which you will definitely sell up put everything into the most secure investments you can find and retire to the caribbean if that 's the case then you become totally risk averse the instant your holding crosses that line sell and order cocktails

has a great answer about dividends generally but to answer your question specifically about yield traps here are a few things that i look for as with everything if it looks too good to be true it probably is   a 17 yield is pretty out of this world even for a reit   and i would n't bet on it holding up   compare a company 's yield to that of others in the same industry different industries have different standards for what is considered a high or low yield dividends have to come from somewhere and that somewhere is cash flow   look at the company 's financial statements   do they have sufficient cash flow to pay the dividend   have there been any recent changes in their cash flow situation   how are earnings holding up   debt levels cash on hand sudden moves in stock price   a sudden drop in the stock price will cause the yield to rise   sometimes this indicates a bargain but if the drop is due to a real worry about the company 's financial health see 2 it 's probably an indication that a dividend cut is coming what does their dividend history look like   do they have a consistent track record of paying out good dividends for years and years   companies with a track record of paying dividends consistently and/or increasing their dividend regularly are likely to continue to do so

the answer for this question varies from person to person however most cards give lousy rewards percentage wise take a look at where your money is being spent each month say with a tool like mint.com and seek out a card that rewards you in categories where you already spend a lot of money   many people here have suggested cards with high gas rebates and that 's great if you drive more than anything else however the important thing is to pick what benefits you most

fico is a financial services company whose customers are financial services companies   their products are for the benefit of their customers not consumers the purpose of the credit score system is two fold   first the credit score is intended to make it easy for lending institutions fico 's customers to assess the risk of loans that they make   this is probably based on science although the fico studies and even the fico score formula are proprietary secrets the second purpose of the credit score is to incentivize consumers into borrowing money   and they have done a great job of that   if you think you might need a loan in the future perhaps a mortgage or a car loan you need a credit score   and the only way to get a credit score is to start borrowing money now that you do n't need    yes someone with a good income and a long history of paying utility bills on time would be a great credit risk for a mortgage   however that person will have no credit score and therefore be declared by fico as a bad credit risk   on the other hand someone with a low income who struggles but succeeds to make the minimum payment on their credit card would have a better credit score   the advice offered to the first person is start borrowing money now even though you do n't need it i 'm not anti credit card   i use a credit card responsibly paying it off in full every month   i use it for the convenience   i do n't worry at all about my credit score but i 've been told it is great   however there are some people that can not use a credit card responsibly   the temptation is too great   perhaps they are like problem gamblers i do n't know   but fico and the financial services industry have created a system that makes a credit card a necessity in many ways   these are the people that get hurt in the current system

yes factor into your fund the cost of health insurance   you basically have three options when facing a loss of income for 3 6 months pre aca the cobra one was the default option many planned for because there was no need to change doctors of course many people were shocked how expensive it was compared to just looking at the employees share of the monthly premium for planning you can do some research into the cost of one of the aca approved plans in your state keeping in mind that the lack of income might qualify you for a subsidy as to the coverage level that would depend on your situation and the perceived gap i have known many people who did n't have to pick cobra until after the new job started so they knew exactly what they needed to cover and what their bills were during the gap

check your calculation of i was able to duplicate their calculations using excel make you sure have accounted for all the terms it can be easy to be one off they are making a guess at the interest rate which will be wrong then they are adjusting it to see how wrong it is then making another adjustment they will repeat until they see no movement in the guesses

yes   this article describes opting out it is true i think that most banks will offer this as a courtesy by default but i believe that they must offer an option to opt out i checked my bank 's webpage and they explicitly describe how to opt out by calling a number or visiting a bank branch but it required digging carefully to find that information that being said are you sure that you 'd really want to opt out   the bank can still charge a fee for non sufficient funds nsf and whoever was expecting the payment may also charge you late fees and service fees   it 's much better just to make sure that you do n't overdraw through careful planning

you can buy out of the money put options that could minimize your losses or even make you money   in the event of a huge crash put options are good in that you do nt have to worry about not getting filled or not knowing what price you might get filled with a stop loss order however put options cost money and their value decays over time it 's just like buying insurance you always have to pay up for it

having just gone through selling a car i can tell you that carmax will most likely not be the best solution i recently sold my 09 vibe which had a kbb and edmonds value private party sale of around $ 6k trade in value was around $ i took it to the local carmax for a quote and they came back with $ 3,500   refinancing is tricky banks have a set limit on how old a car they will finance many wo n't even offer financing if the vehicle has over 100k miles we looked at refinancing our other car and even getting the apr down over a point we would only have saved $ or so banks typically offer much higher interest rates for used non dealership cars and refinancing than they do for new cars or even used cars purchased from a dealership assuming you have 2 3 years left on your loan i do n't think that refinancing would save you enough to be worth considering carmax sells cars in 1 of 2 ways they are also up front with you about the process they do not reference kbb or edmonds or any other valuation tool other than their own internal system they either take the car it up a bit then resell it on their lot or they sell it at auction if they determine your car will be sold at auction then they will offer you a rock bottom price the determining factors that come into play include age of the car mileage and of course overall condition if you mini is still in good shape and does n't have a lot of miles then they may try to resell it on their lot for which they could offer you closer to personal sale price than trade in how many 2007 's are for sale in your area how much are they selling for i did sell them a truck back in 2005 and received $ 200 more than kbb valued it for but it was in great shape only a couple of years old relatively low mileage and it was in high demand god bless the south and their love for trucks i ended up selling my to another local car dealership they offered me $ after negotiating leaving the dealership then negotiating more over the phone it took me a day and a half and really very little effort i have several friends that have gone through the same thing with selling cars and all have had similar luck going to other dealerships where prices can be negotiated rather than carmax   carmax has no incentive to settle or forgive your loan if you really want to pay it off save up what you believe the difference will be then shop your car around the local dealerships and get prices for your mini remember that dealers have to turn a profit so be reasonable with your negotiation if you can find comparable vehicles in your area listed for $ then knock $ 1,500 off that price and tell the dealerships that 's what you want

you 're confused because the source you cite leaves out one number that is n't relevant to the argument they 're making total costs the number you 're expecting $ 9 x 365 or $ is the total cost of buying the jewelry which when subtracted from the $ sales volume gives us the net profit of $ 365   the investment is the amount of money original put into a system our company in this case the merchant bought his first piece of jewelry for $ 9 sold it for $ 10 took one dollar in profit and used the other 9 to reinvest by buying a new piece of jewelry we can extend the analogy further after 9 days of selling the merchant will $ 18 allowing him to now buy 2 pieces of jewelry each morning and sell them for $ 20 every day his costs will be $ 18 and he 'll turn a $ 2 profit all with the original investment of $ 9

i 'm just trying to visualize the costs of trading say i set up an account to trade something forex stock even bitcoin and i was going to let a random generator determine when i should buy or sell it if i do this i would assume i have an equal probability to make a profit or a loss your question is what a would call an ill posed problem   it makes it a challenge to answer   the short answer is no   we will have to consider three broad cases for types of assets and two time intervals let us start with a very short time interval   the bid ask spread covers the anticipated cost to the market maker of holding an asset bought in the market equal to the opportunity costs over the half life of the holding period   a consequence of this is that you are nearly guaranteed to lose money if your time interval between trades is less than the half life of the actual portfolio of the market maker   to use a dice analogy imagine having to pay a fee per roll before you can gamble   you can win but it will be biased toward losing now let us go to the extreme opposite time period which is that you will buy now and sell one minute before you die   for stocks you would have received the dividends plus any stocks you sold from mergers   conversely you would have had to pay the dividends on your short sales and received a gain on every short stock that went bankrupt   because you have to pay interest on short sales and dividends passed you will lose money on a net basis to the market maker   maybe you are seeing a pattern here   the phrase market maker will come up a lot now let us look at currencies   in the long run if the current fiat money policy regime holds you will lose a lot of money   deflation is not a big deal under a commodity money regime but it is a problem under fiat money so central banks avoid it   so your long currency holdings will depreciate   your short would appreciate except you have to pay interest on them at a rate greater than the rate of inflation to the market maker finally for commodities no one will allow perpetual holding of short positions in commodities because people want them delivered   because insider knowledge is presumed under the commodities trading laws a random investor would be at a giant disadvantage similar to what a chess player who played randomly would face against a grand master chess player   there is a very strong information asymmetry in commodity contracts   there are people who actually do know how much cotton there is in the world how much is planted in the ground and what the demand will be and that knowledge is not shared with the world at large   you would be fleeced can i also assume that probabilistically speaking a trader can not do    worst than random say if i had to guess the roll of a dice my    chance of being correct ca n't be less than a physicist a con man a and a statistician would tell you that dice rolls and coin are not random   while we teach fair coins and fair dice in introductory college classes to simplify many complex ideas they also do not exist   if you want to see a funny version of the dice roll game watch the 1962 japanese movie   it is an action movie but it begins with a dice game    consider adopting a bayesian perspective on probability as it would be a healthier perspective based on how you are thinking about this problem   a frequency approach always assumes the null model is true which is what you are doing   had you tried this will real money your model would have been falsified but you still would n't know the true model yes you can do much worse than of the time   even if you are trying to be fair you have not accounted for the variance extending that logic then for an inexperienced trader is it right to    say then that it 's equally difficult to purposely make a loss then it    is to purposely make a profit because if i can purposely make a loss    i would purposely just do the opposite of what i 'm doing to make a    profit so in the dice example if i can somehow lower my chances of    winning below it means i would simply need to bet on the    other 5 numbers to give myself a better than 83 chance of winning if the game were fair but for things like forex the rules of the game are purposefully changed by the market maker to maximize long run profitability   under us law forex is not regulated by anything other than common law   as a result the market maker can state any price including prices far from the market with the intent to make a system used by actors losing systems such as to trigger margin calls   the prices quoted by forex dealers in the us move loosely with the global rates but vary enough that only the dealer should make money systematically   a fixed strategy would promote loss you are assuming that only you know the odds and they would let you profit from your percentage chance of winning so then is the costs of trading from a purely probabilistic point of    view simply the transaction costs no matter what my chances can not    be worse than random and if my trading system has an edge that is    greater than the percentage of the transaction that is transaction    cost then i am probabilistically likely to make a profit no the cost of trading is the opportunity cost of the money   the transaction costs are explicit costs but you have ignored the implicit costs of foregone interest and foregone happiness using the money for other things you will want to be careful here in understanding probability because the distribution of returns for all of these assets lack a first moment and so there can not be a mean return   a modal return would be an intellectually more consistent perspective implying you should use an all or nothing cost function to evaluate your methodology

i thought i 'd see if the credit card companies had anything to say about this while trying to get merchants to sign up i went to clicked run your business in the top nav then accept visa payments this page has a more benefits of accepting visa link with an which i ca n't easily link directly to which includes these lines while the average cash transaction is $ 17 credit card purchases average $ 70 while debit card purchases average $ visa payment panel study to time period visa mars data march 2015 may 2015   that obviously does n't tell the entire story i suspect people are more likely to pull out cash when they 're just buying a stick of gum and more more likely to pull out a card when they 're buying large electronics but certainly there is some evidence from the credit card companies themselves that people spend more when using cards which is one of the aspects they use to convince merchants to accept cards i think the best evidence that people spend more is that more and more merchants accept cards accepting cards comes with some significant costs though it 's important to keep in mind that accepting cash can come with some significant costs as well i suspect that merchants would n't do so unless the increased sales that they get for accepting cards makes up for the fees that they need to pay and the equipment they need to buy to accept them not to mention the risks of chargebacks and the like

my interpretation of that sentence is that you ca n't do the buying selling of shares outright sans margin because of the massive quantity of shares he 's talking about   so you have to use margin to buy the stocks however because in order to make significant money with this sort of strategy you probably need to be working dozens of stocks at the same time you need to be familiar with portfolio margin   since your broker does not calculate margin calls based on individual stocks but rather on the value of your whole portfolio you should have experience handling margin not just on individual stock movements but also on overall portfolio movements for example if 10 by value of the stocks you 're targeting tend to have a correlation of with the price of oil you should probably target another 10 by value in stocks that tend to have a correlation of + 0.8 with the price of oil   and so on and so forth   that way your portfolio can weather big or even small changes in market conditions that would cause a margin call on a novice investor 's portfolio

bit hesitant to put this in an answer as i do n't know if specific investment advice is appropriate but this has grown way too long for a comment the typical answer given for people who do n't have the time experience knowledge or inclination to pick specific stocks to hold should instead invest in etfs exchange traded index funds what these basically do is attempt to simulate a particular market or stock exchange an s&p 500 index fund will generally attempt to hold shares in the stocks that make up that index they only have to follow an index not try to beat it so are called passively managed they have very low expense ratios far below 1 and are considered a good choice for investors who want to hold stock without significant effort or expense and who 's main goal is time in the market it 's a contentious topic but on average an index and therefore an index fund will go even with or outperform most actively managed funds with a sufficiently long investment horizon which you have these may be ideal for you trading in etfs is also typically cheap because they are traded like stock there are plenty of low fee online brokers and virtually all will allow trading in etfs my broker even has a list of several hundred popular etfs that can be traded for free   the golden rule in investing is that you should never buy into something you do n't understand do n't buy individual stock with little information it 's often little more than gambling the same goes for trading platforms like do n't use them unless you know their business model and what they stand to gain from your custom as mentioned i can trade certain funds for free with my broker but i know why they can offer that and how they 're still making money

when economies are strong it is particularly to have a single currency as it makes trade and tourism simpler and helps reduce costs the problem comes when individual member economies get into trouble because the eurozone is a loose grouping of nations there is no direct equivalent of the us federal government to coordinate a response there is instead an odd mixture of national and central government that makes it harder to get a unified approach to the economy ok it 's maybe not so different to the us in reality   this lack of flexibility means that some of the key levers of international finance are compromised for example a weak economy ca n't float its currency to improve exports similarly individual country 's interest rates ca n't be adjusted to balance spending i suspect the main reason though is political and based on concepts of sovereignty and national pride the uk does the majority of its trade with the eurozone so the pros would possibly outweigh the cons but the uk as a whole and some of our papers in particular have always regarded europe with suspicion most only speak english and find france and germany a strange and obtuse place the almost common language makes it easier to relate to the us and canada than our near neighbours it seems the perception amongst the political establishment is that any attempt to join the euro is political suicide while that is the case it is unlikely to happen purely from a personal perspective i 'd welcome the euro except it means a lot of the products i routinely buy would become a lot more expensive if price is for an example compare the price of the ipod touch in the uk £ to the french pay £ at the current exchange rate which is close to 25 more ouch see also my question about canada adopting the us dollar

how low you can reduce your costs does depend on your calling pattern   how many minutes per month you call locally call long distance call internationally and how many minutes you receive calls for   if all these figures are low you can be better off with a pay per minute service if any of the outbound figures are high then you could consider a flat rate unlimited service   so that 's the first step determine your needs do n't pay for what you do n't need for example i barely use a landline voip phone any more   but it is still useful for incoming calls and for 911 service   so i use a prepaid pay per minute voip company that has a flat rate < $ for the incoming number an add on fee for the 911 service 80c mo and per minute costs for outgoing calls 1c min or less to us canada western europe   i use my own box under $ 50 to buy   there is a bit of setup and learning needed but the end result means my landline bill is usually under $ no other taxes or fees companies in this byod bring your own device space in the us canada include in order and many others   a good discussion forum to learn more about them is the voip forum at although it can be a bit technical   there is also a reviews section at that site if your usage is higher you make lots of calls to a variety of numbers most of these companies and others have flat rate bundles probably similar to what you have now   comparing them depends on your usage pattern so again that 's the first thing to consider then you know what to shop for   if you need features like or be sure to look at whether you need an expensive bundle with it in or whether you 're better off paying for that if your outbound calls are to a limited number of numbers such as relatives far away or internationally consider getting a similar voip system for those relatives   most voip companies have free on network calls between their customers regardless of the country they are in   so your most common and most lengthy calls could be free the boxes 's analog telephone have an advantage here if you install them in yours and relatives houses   as well as allowing you to use any of the bring your own device voip companies like those listed above they have their own network allowing free calls between their boxes and also to from their ios and android apps   there are other 's from other companies cisco have well known models and other ways to make free calls between them so is n't the only option   i mentioned above i pay for the incoming number   not every supplier has incoming numbers available in every area you need to check this   some can port in transfer in your existing number if you are attached to it but not all can so again check you can also get incoming numbers in other areas or countries that ring on your home line without forwarding costs   this means you can have a number near a cluster of relatives who can call you with a local call   does n't directly save you money each number has a monthly fee but could save you having to call them back

you 're asking if lottery ticket can ever produce a positive expected value ev the short answer is no there 's an interesting article that goes into the details and is heavy on the math and graphs the key point even if you think you have a positive expected value due to the size of the jackpot being larger than the number of possible numbers as more tickets are purchased and the jackpot grows larger the odds of someone else picking the winner goes up and your ev goes down the article concludes it paints a picture for anyone    still holding out hope that a lottery ticket can ever be an    economically rational investment as the jackpot grows in value the    number of people who try to win it grows super linearly this human    behavior has a mathematical consequence even though the jackpot    itself can theoretically grow without bound there is a point at which    the ticket buying grows to such a fever pitch that the    expected value of the jackpot actually starts going down again

it can be helpful but also knowing what has been tried before is vital what works and what does not work many ideas are not so new for example typically in it management loves the idea of but what it often means is that they want to start before they understand the scope of the problem let alone the requirements   it tends to be the big projects that end up being screwed up smaller stuff is easier but it takes a lot of skills to manage the production of large and complex systems or pieces of engineering   sure change is important but so is the knowledge of what works and what does not work every so often something comes along and sets it on its head so some of that old knowledge can be discounted but not often

weird from the bad old days when you had to do arithmetic by hand i would guess   stocks used to trade in so bonds trading in even smaller increments makes sense   also and i am unsure if this is still true u.s. bonds trade on a 360 day year or used to anyway for the same reason 360 divides well into months and quarters for easier math whereas 365 is considerably harder   most of the world now trades in and years so i am unsure why the u.s. does n't   institutional inertia i would guess

a lot of loans are taken out on a fixed rate basis so the rate is part of the contract and is therefore covered by contract law if the loan is taken out on a variable basis then in principle the rate can rise within the terms of the contract   if a particular lender tries to raise its rates out of line with the market then its customers will seek alternative cheaper loans and pay off their expensive loan if they can if rates rise sharply in general due to unusual economic circumstances then those with variable rate loans can find themselves in severe trouble   for example the base rate in the uk and therefore variable mortgage rates closely tied to it spiked sharply in the late 80s which caused severe stress to a lot of borrowers and undoubtedly pushed some into financial difficulties

out of your seven recommendations one is up 14 one up 6 four are either even or down slightly and one is down a whopping 40 this reminds me of a recommendation earlier in the year provided by the motley fool to buy when it was around the $ 40 mark i had a quick look at it and thought gee there is no way i am buying those shares now they are just below $ 15 see the chart below   you have just learnt a valuable lesson by testing these recommendations without your real money never trust investment recommendations from analysts or anyone else get yourself educated so you understand what analysts are talking about and you can make a decision for yourself better still learn about technical analysis so you can decide for yourself whether it is the right time to buy or sell

in addition to the higher risk as pointed out by you also need to consider that there are regulations against naked shorting so you generally need to either own the security or have someone that is willing to loan the security to you in order to sell short   if you own a stock you are shorting the irs could view the transaction as a sell followed by a buy taking place in a less than 30 day period and you could be subject to wash sale rules   this added complexity most often the finding of someone to loan you the security you are shorting is another reason such trades are considered more advanced you should also be aware that there are currently a number of proposals to re the uptick rule or some circuit breaker variant designed to prevent short sellers from driving down the price of a stock and conducting bear raids etc the first requires that a stock trade at the same or higher price as prior trades before you can submit a short   in the latter shorting would be prohibited after a stock price had fallen a given percentage in a given amount of time   in either case should such a rule be then you could face limitations attempting to execute a short which you would not need to worry about doing simple buys or sells    as to vehicles that would do this kind of thing if you are convinced we are in a bear market and willing to take the risk there are a number of etf 's classified as inverse exchange traded funds etf 's for a variety of markets that via various means seek to deliver a return similar to that of shorting the market in question   one such example for a common broad market is ticker sh the short s&p500 etf which seeks to deliver a return that is the inverse of the s&p500 and as would be predicted based on the roughly + 15 performance of the s&p500 over the last 12 months sh is down roughly -15 over the same period   the wikipedia article on inverse etf 's lists a number of other such funds covering various markets    i think it should be noted that using such a vehicle is a pretty aggressive bet to take in reaction to the belief that a bear market is imminent   a more conservative approach would be to simply take money out of the market and place it in something like cd 's or treasury instruments   in that case you preserve your capital regardless of what happens in the market using an inverse etf otoh means that if the market went bull instead of bear you would lose money instead of merely holding your position

right one thing i ’ve learned is that there is no such thing as a mild recession until long after it ’s over the downturn in 2001 02 was the worst one since the great depression at the time according to many reports the same thing was said about the one in the early 90s people who were around for the recessions in the early 80s and before that can probably say the same thing    there will be another recession probably soon and it will probably be worse than people expect until another economic cycle comes and goes then it wo n’t be so bad anymore i do think 2008 will persist for awhile as this event much like 1929 did several generations ago

tv is just distribution be it a lucrative one   the networks for the most part do n't produce shows   they set up deals with production companies and if they like the idea give the go ahead to make 1/2 dozen or so episodes   if ratings are there then they 'll order another season   this system works because the networks will hope for a 10 success rate or something like that   so one in ten shows is a reasonable major success   will that process end if networks end   no that 's silly   production values may suffer but how much does it cost to make a seinfeld excluding the incredible salaries for actors and writers   not a whole lot   comedy central is famous for giving a shot at a show on tv in exchange for low reimbursement   the top talent will always flow towards the best salaries but the future may show the top talent risking their own reimbursement in exchange for profit sharing and risk taking   louis ck did so with his recent stand up act he did very well and has inspired   one of the studios or production companies called his bypassing the tradition route of middlemen and promoters who take the lions share of the profits   so the establishment sees the writing on the wall and resorts to upstarts as   they will resort to laws to try to stop consumers getting what they want but and other will keep the pressure on     my wife will come home turn on the tv and zone out   but nobody else in my social circle does this   it may be a male female thing or a generational thing i do n't know   however tv has always been innovative is not the way i see it   in fact it really only blocks progress   from cable monopolies to trying to stop the networks are an oligopoly trying to keep competitors out

do you work in this field or something you sound like a very passionate apologist    gt;why should n't traders be able to decide as a group what the companies are worth   because often they purposefully distort value so they can either a buy low and profit or b sell high and profit why are you so anti government i 'd rather have people i elected and who are accountable to me determining things instead of private and highly selfish interests who represent only themselves    gt do you really think that intraday or even prices are really representative of what the market thinks a company is valued at   if not why bother with the in the first place what is the point of wild price fluctuations even throughout a single day if they as you admit do not represent value the whole concept of short term profiting off of these pointless and often engineered market movements is silly and adds nothing to society whatsoever the original point of the stock market further that money needs to come from somewhere and that typically is long term investors who want a pension at some point and do n't feel like trading at timeframes because they do something useful instead its disgusting   to the effect of long term buy and holders changing their mind about a company the effect of any hft people on the valuation of a stock is practically nothing like i said there 's just about no evidence of speculators causing significant mispricing over any significant period   so you 're saying just because the aggregate effect is no one should worry about it that is the absolute thing i have ever heard if i steel a car every other week who cares right millions of cars are made every year the effect of me stealing 20 or 30 wo nt change car markets in any noticeable way    further speculation in commodities mainly food has indeed caused enormous mispricing and human suffering in the developing world

there 's a few things going on here if we fixed rates and terms over time we 'd expect a pretty tight chart of home prices to income almost add a layer of growth above that in boom times due to the wealth effect when stocks are way up we have extra money to blow on bigger houses and the opposite when markets are down next the effect of rates with long term rates dropping from 14 in 1985 to 5 in 2003 the amount that can be bought for the same monthly payment rises dramatically as rates fall easy to lose site of that and the fact that the average size house has increased about 1.5 per year over the last 40 years surely that ca n't continue   when you normalize all these factors houses cost fewer hours worked almost at the peak of the market than 25 years ago mike 's logical example of out is very clever i like it in the short term we 'll see periods that are booms and busts but actual prices will straddle the line representing the borrowing power of a week 's pay

the rich pay more in taxes it would be hard to cut taxes in a way that did nt help the rich i 'm more concerned with what it does for the middle and lower classes i do n't care that much if it helps the rich   edit okay so let 's say you give the top third of the population by income a 1 income tax cut the middle third got a 5 cut and the bottom third got a 10 cut in dollar value the rich are still getting a larger cut simply by virtue of how much they pay in taxes   someone made a point about property tax speaking very generally poor people rent and rich people own so a property tax inherently benefits the wealthy because they own more property certainly any kind of corporate or capital gains cut would benefit the wealthy since they own the corporations and are more heavily invested even a sales tax cut would benefit the wealthy more than the non wealthy simply because they spend more money   but what frustrates me is how hung up people get on the fact that something is good for the wealthy such as with the headline of ops article as if we should actively try to avoid helping anyone rich as i stated above i do n't care that it helps the rich as long as it 's helping the rest of us too and if the rich are getting a bigger benefit than i am by virtue of being rich i 'm not bothered because i can do math

when you initiate a chargeback the merchant has the right to dispute the chargeback   if they can provide proof that the purchase actually took place the chargeback will fail we do n't know all the details of your situation of course but it appears from what you have said that the tax chain probably has documents that you signed agreeing to the charges   they prepared your return even if they did a poor job and so from their perspective they have decided that they deserve to be paid   whether or not they did a good job is a matter of opinion of course their position might be that they did it correctly and the second business did it poorly    the chargeback is a powerful tool but it is not a magic button that makes a charge disappear   if the merchant can show that a sale did indeed take place and show that the proper amount was charged the chargeback will fail   for a service it is n't enough usually to simply state that you were unsatisfied if you received the service at the agreed upon price the charge is valid a chargeback is sort of a nuclear option when it comes to getting a refund   there are negative ramifications and expenses every time a merchant gets a chargeback even if they ultimately win and so often they will be willing to work something out to avoid a chargeback   you should go to the merchant first if you can and ask for a refund before considering the chargeback option   if you file a chargeback without even giving them the opportunity to work it out with you the merchant will usually want to fight back

you are thinking about it this way the longer i wait to the more knowledge and information i 'll have thus the more confidence i can have that i 'll be able to sell at a profit minimizing risk if i exercise early and still have to wait there may never be a chance i can sell at a profit and i 'll have lost the money i paid to exercise and any tax i had to pay when i exercised all of that is true but if you exercise early the fair market value of the stock will probably be lower so you may pay less income tax when you exercise this depends on your tax situation currently iso exercises affect your amt if the company goes through a phase where the value is unusually high you 'll be able to sell and still get the tax benefits because you exercised earlier you avoid the nightmare scenario where you leave the company voluntarily or not and ca n't afford to exercise your options because of the tax implications in many realistic cases exercising earlier means less risk imagine if you 're working at a company that is privately held and you expect to be there for another year or so you are very optimistic about the company but not sure when it will ipo or get acquired and that may be several years off the fair market value of the stock is low now but may be much higher in a year in this case it makes a lot of sense to exercise now the cost is low because the fair market value is low so it wo n't result in a huge tax bill and then when you leave in a year you wo n't have to choose between forfeiting your options or borrowing money to pay the much higher taxes due to exercise them then

changing my answer based on clarification in comments it appears that some of the securities you mentioned including are traded on what is colloquially known as the grey market grey sheets and also known as the gray market is another category of otc stocks that is completely separate from pink sheets and the   from investopedia the grey market is an over the counter market where dealers may execute orders for preferred customers as well as provide support for a new issue before it is actually issued this activity allows underwriters and the issuer to determine demand and price the securities accordingly before the ipo   some additional information on this type of stocks source unlike other financial markets no recent bid or ask quotes are available because no market makers share data or quote such stocks there is no quoting system available to record and settle trades all grey sheet trading is moderated by a broker and done between individuals at a price they agree on the only documentation that can be publicly found regarding the trades is when the last trade took place no sec registration and little sec regulation regulation of grey sheet stocks takes place mainly on a state level unlike pink sheets these stocks have no sec registration to possess a stock symbol or to possess shares or trade shares of that stock such penny stocks similar to pink sheets are not required to file sec securities and exchange commission financial and business reports these stocks may not be solicited or advertised to the public unless a certain number of shares are qualified to be traded publicly under 504 of regulation d. extremely illiquid gray sheet trading is infrequent and for good reason difficult to trade not advertised difficult to follow the price the least regulation possible hard to find any information on the stock very small market cap little history and most such stocks do not yet offer public shares the lack of information bids history financial reports alone causes most investors to be very skeptical of gray sheets and avoid them altogether   gray sheets are commonly associated with initial public offering ipo stocks or start up companies or spin off companies even though not all are ipo 's start ups or spin offs grey sheets is also home to delisted stocks from other markets some stocks on this financial market were once traded on the nasdaq or the pink sheets but ran into serious misfortune usually financial and thus failed to meet the minimum requirements of the registered sec filings and/or stock exchange regulations for a financial market such stocks were delisted or removed and may begin trading on the grey sheets   so to answer your question i think the cause of the wild swings is that    great question btw

from my recollection of warren buffett 's book warren buffett and the art of arbitrage the following factors determine the difference between the market price of a stock and the future expected price of an acquisition or merger time assuming the deal will close the market price should approach the offer price as the closing date approaches the fact that there is a 14 spread partially reflects the time value of money probability things could happen between now and closing date which could derail the deal the higher the spread the more likely the market thinks the deal will not occur for example lo shareholders could reject the offer saying it is too low or anti trust regulators could say the deal is anti competitive part of this 14 spread indicates the probability of the deal completing
