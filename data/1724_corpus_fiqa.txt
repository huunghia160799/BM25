the united states taxes nonresident aliens on two types of income first a nonresident alien who is engaged in a trade or business in the united states is taxed on income that is effectively connected with that trade or business second certain types of u.s source payments are subject to income tax withholding the determination of when a nonresident alien is engaged in a u.s. trade or business is highly fact specific and complex however keeping assets in a u.s. bank account should not be treated as a u.s. trade or business a nonresident alien 's interest income is generally subject to u.s. federal income tax withholding at a rate of 30 percent under section of the tax code interest on bank deposits however benefit from an exception under section so long as that interest is not effectively connected with a u.s. trade or business even though no tax needs to be withheld on interest on a bank deposit the bank should still report that interest each year to the irs on form the irs can then send that information to the tax authority in brazil please keep in mind that state and local tax rules are all different and whether interest on the bank deposits is subject to state or local tax will depend on which state the bank is in also the united states does tax nonresident aliens on wages paid from a u.s. company if those wages are treated as u.s source income generally wages are u.s source income if the employee provides services while physically present in the united states there are a few exceptions to this rule but they depend on the amount of wages and other factors that are specific to the employee 's situation   this is an area where you should really consult with a u.s. tax advisor before the employment starts maybe your company will pay for it

ignoring the complexities of a and regulated market a futures contract is simply a contract that requires party a to buy a given amount of a commodity from party b at a specified price the future can be over something tangible like pork or oil in which case there is a physical transfer of stuff or it can be over something intangible like shares the purpose of the contract is to allow the seller to lock in a price so that they are not subject to price fluctuations between the date the contract is entered and the date it is complete this risk is transferred to the seller who will therefore generally pay a discounted rate from the spot price on the original day in many cases the buyer actually wants the stuff futures contracts between farmers and manufacturers being one example the farmer who is growing say wool will enter a contract to supply 3000 kg at $ 10 per kg of a given quality etc there are generally price adjustments detailed for varying quality with a textile manufacturer to be delivered in 6 months the spot price today may be $ 11 the farmer gives up $ 1 now to shift the risk of price fluctuations to the manufacturer when the strike date rolls around the farmer delivers the 3000 kg and takes the money if he has failed to grow at least 3000 kg then he must buy it from someone or trigger whatever the penalty clauses in the contract are for futures over shares and other securities the principle is exactly the same say the contract is for 1000 shares of xyz stock party a agrees to sell these for $ 10 each on a given day to party b. when that day rolls around party a transfers the shares and gets the money party a may have owned the shares all along may have bought them before the settlement day or if push comes to shove must buy them on the day of settlement notwithstanding when they bought them if they paid less than $ 10 they make a profit if they pay more they make a loss   generally speaking you ca n't settle a futures contract with another futures contract you have to deliver up what you promised be it wool or shares

you ca n't calculate how many houses it will take to do so you would have to know how much you can charge in rent compared to how much is costs to run that particular location if the desirability of that location changes so does the ability to rent the place and so does the amount you can charge it is possible to create a business in real estate that would allow you to generate retirement income but you would be focusing all your income in your retirement years on one segment of the entire investment universe the diversification would have to come from spreading the money through different types of real estate condo apartments houses commercial warehouse light industrial you would even have to decide whether you want them all in one micro market or spread throughout a larger market or an even wider area diversification   as your empire grew and you approached retirement age you would have to decide if you wanted to liquidate your investments to minimize risk the long leases that provides stability of income would make it hard to sell quickly if the market in one area started to weaken

much more than that   last i looked at this i saw the dji have fat tails i.e. non gaussian to the order of hundreds of days   the effect becomes less pronounced the larger the interval and the curves show that it becomes more gaussian   if you plot the return distributions for 1-day etc on a plot you end up with curves that look like figure of figure 1.3 edit sorry i got the figure wrong     the gaussian curve on a plot comes out as a i.e. the black curve   non gaussian fat tails fan out like the green red and blue plots   the out occurs even when dealing with returns over a couple of hundred days but the effect becomes less pronounced suggesting a convergence to gaussian

this is based on my experience with chase and may not be applicable to other banks as you mentioned chase as one of the banks you do business with hopefully this will be helpful to you the money does come out of your account immediately if the check is n't cashed in a certain amount of time the check expires and you get the money credited back to your account once you have made a bill payment online you can check on the status of your check by looking at your payment activity finding the payment in question and following the proof of payment link    there is will provide you with information on your payment which you can submit to your payee to prove when you submitted the payment and which they can use to verify with the bank that you really did send the payment as you claimed   once the check is cashed this page will also contain images of the front and back of the cashed check so you can prove that the recipient really did cash it   you can see from this info that the check is being funded from a different account number than your own which is good for security purposes since per 2008 giving someone else your bank routing number and account number as found on your personal checks basically provides them with all they need to fraudulently of course clean out your account

after reading op mark 's question and the various answers carefully and also looking over some old pay stubs of mine i am beginning to wonder if he is mis reading his pay stub or slip of paper attached to the reimbursement check for the he purchases   pay stubs whether paper documents attached to checks or things received in one 's company mailbox or available for downloading from a company web site while the money is deposited electronically into the employee 's checking account vary from company to company but a reasonably well designed stub would likely have categories such as taxable gross income for the pay period this is the amount from which payroll taxes federal and state income tax social security and medicare tax are deducted as well as other post tax deductions such as money going to purchase of us savings bonds contributions to united way via payroll   deduction contribution to roth 401k etc employer paid group life   insurance premiums are taxable income too for any portion of the policy   that exceeds $ 50k. in some cases these appear as a lump sum on the last pay stub for the year nontaxable gross income for the pay period this would be sum total of the amounts contributed to 401k plans employee 's share of group health care insurance premiums for employee   and/or employee 's family money deposited into fsa accounts etc net pay this is the amount of the attached check or money sent via ach to the employee 's bank account year to date amounts these just tell the employee what has been earned paid withheld to date in the various categories now op mark said my company does not tax the reimbursement but they do add it to my running gross earnings total for the year so the question is whether the amount of the reimbursement is included in the year to date amount of taxable income if ytd taxable income does not include the reimbursement amount   then the the op 's question and the answers and comments are moot unless the company has really messed up pat pending payroll software that does weird things the amount   on the w2 form will be whatever is shown as ytd taxable income   on the last pay stub of the year and as noted it is what will appear on the w2 form that really matters in summary it is good that op mark is taking the time to investigate the matter of the reimbursements appearing in total gross income but if the amounts are not appearing in the ytd taxable income his payroll office may just him that they have good software and that what the ytd taxable income says on the last pay stub is what will be appearing on his w2 form   i am fairly confident that this is what will be the resolution of the matter because if the amount of the reimbursement was included in taxable income during that pay period and no tax was withheld then the employer has a problem with   social security and medicare tax and nonpayment of this tax plus the employer 's share to the us treasury in timely fashion the irs takes an extremely view of such shenanigans and most employers are unlikely to take the risk

i can answer scenario 3 if you are purchasing a property with buy to let intentions can you use the    rental income exclusively to fund the mortgage repayments yes this is exactly how buy to let mortgage applications are evaluated lenders generally expect you to fund the mortgage payments with rent they look for the anticipated monthly rent income to cover a minimum of 125 of the monthly mortgage payment this is to make sure you can allow for vacant periods maintenance compliance with rules and regulations and still be in profit i.e. generate a positive yield on your investment however buy to let btl mortgage lenders also generally expect you to own your own home to begin with it 's up to them but rare is the lender who will provide a buy to let mortgage to a non owner this is because of point 2 above the lender does n't want you to end up living in the property because then you 'll need to repay the loan capital since you 'll always need somewhere to live this makes the economics of btl they look at your application as a business proposal quite different to a residential mortgage application which is what your question seems to be addressing bottom line you 're right about scenario 3 but it sounds like you 're trying to afford a home first whereas btl is best viewed as an investment for someone who already has their main residence under ownership mortgaged or otherwise as for scenarios 1 and 2 i ca n't offer first hand answers but i think m. and steve have covered it

once you turn 18 you should open an account in your own name and transfer the assets there currently your mom is the one responsible as far as the irs cares with respect to taxes as it is her name on the account the taxes due will be based on your mom 's tax rate as a good child you can reimburse your mom for the taxes that she has to on your behalf also legally that money currently belongs to her any legal judgement against your mom can claim that money and it is not available for using as an asset by you on credit applications and such a better solution would have been for your mom to open a custodial account in your name this way the money is still yours you just do n't have control of it until you turn 18 while probably not an issue here the transferring of money between you and your mom and then back is considered a gift by the irs if the account was very well funded then you could run into having to deal with the annual gift limit and lifetime gift exclusion based on the clarification that the question is in reference to india while i do n't know the particulars of the law in india my advice of transferring the assets when you turn 18 still remains the main difference that i would see been india and the us would be the gift tax exclusions unless someone else knows otherwise i would still expect the law in india to see the current account as being the property of the mother

i recommend you take a look at this lecture really the whole series is enlightening from swenson he identifies 3 sources of returns diversification timing and selection he appears to discard timing and selection as impossible a student kinda calls him out on this diversification reduces risk not increase returns it turns out they did time the market by shorting .com 's before the bubble and real estate just before the downturn in 1990 yale started a absolute return unit and allocated like 15 percent to it mostly by selling us equities that specializes in these sorts of hedging moves as for why you might employ managers for specific areas consider that the expense ratio wall street charges you or me still represent a very nice salary when applied to the billions in yale 's portfolio so they hire internally to reduce expenses and i 'm sure they 're kept busy they also need people to sell off assets to maintain ratios and figuring out which ones to sell might take specialized knowledge finally in some areas you functionally can not invest without management for example yale has a substantial allocation in private equity and by definition that does n't trade on the open market the other thing you should consider is that for all its diversification yale lost 25 percent of their portfolio in 2009 for a technique that 's supposed to reduce volatility they seem to have a large range of returns over the past five years

first do n't owe much money on a car that 's out of warranty   if you have an engine blow up and repairs will cost the lion 's share of the car 's value the entire car loan immediately comes due because the collateral is now worthless   this puts you in a very miserable situation because you must pay off the car suddenly while also securing other transportation   second watch for possible early payment penalties   they are cheaper than paying interest but run the numbers   their purpose is to repay the lender the amount of money they already paid out to the dealer in sales commission or kickback for referring the loan   the positive effects you want for your credit report only require an open loan owing more money does n't help it hurts   however interest is proportional to principal owed so a $ 10,000 car loan is 10 times the interest cost of a $ 1000 car loan   that means paying most of it off early can fulfill your purpose as the car is nearer payoff you can reduce costs further assuming you handle the hit by increasing the deductible on collision and comprehensive fire and theft auto insurance   it 's not just you paying more co pay it also means the insurance company does n't have to deal with smaller claims at all e.g. with a $ 1000 files a claim on an $ 800 repair   if the amount you owe is small compared to its value and within $ 1000 2000 of paid off the lender may be ok with you dropping collision and comprehensive coverage altogether assuming you are   all of this adds up to paying most of it off but not all may be the way to go you could also talk to your lender about paying say 3/4 of it off and refinancing the rest as a 12-month deal

please realize that your issuer can close the account for any number of reasons   inactivity is one as having a credit line open costs them money and if you never charge anything the company does n't get any transaction fees from vendors nor does the company get to charge you any interest an occasional charge is likely to keep your card from being closed automatically but it is not a guarantee another reason they may close the account is that you have other bad marks show up on your credit score or their criteria for offering you the card change so you no longer match their target demographic i have a credit card issued by my credit union that i have not used for a couple of years they will not close the card account because my other accounts are still very profitable for them if i were not an otherwise profitable customer i would n't be surprised if they closed my credit card account if you are serious about keeping the account open you should probably have more than a trivial amount of usage

there are a number of ways trading stocks is easier than commodities but the main and most important reason is that over long periods stocks in general will tend to outperform inflation as you are investing money in enterprises that generally try to become more productive over time   whereas commodities in the long term tend to rise only at the pace of inflation this is kind of the definition of inflation actually   so even uninformed investors that pick stocks at random will generally do better than someone doing the same in commodities even before the higher commodities trading fees are taken into account also your orange example may be harder than you think   once the news that a drought is an issue the price of oranges will almost immediately change well before the oranges come to market   so unless you can predict the drought before anyone else can you wo n't be able to make money this way

at its simplest level it 's an application of basic statistics probability suppose you have n independent and identically distributed assets with the return on asset i which has mean m and variance same for all assets you can easily weaken these assumptions but i make them to simplify the   square brackets show a numerical example with if you invest in one of these assets you expect to get a return of m 8 with standard deviation s 2 so you expect with probability 95 approx to get a return between and   between 4 and 12 now suppose you split your money equally among the n assets   your return is now r = your expected return is   = = m = m    8 the variance of your return is   = var        = = n =     so the standard deviation is = = s = now with 95 probability we get a return between and between and   this interval is smaller than when we invested in the single asset so in effect with this portfolio we are achieving the same return m 8 but with lower variance risk instead of 2   this is the result of diversification      you can assume the assets are not independent and most book of this topic do indeed do that in that case the calculation is modified because the variance of the portfolio now depends on the correlation between returns as does the reduction in variance caused by the diversification   if assets are negatively correlated the result of the diversification will be more reduction in risk and vice versa    you can also assume the assets are not identically distributed and the above analysis does not change too much    you might look for some references on capm capital asset pricing model or portfolio theory but broadly these are based on what i have described above finding the portfolio with minimum variance for a given return by investing proportionally in treasury bonds and risky assets

brokerages offer you the convenience of buying and selling financial products they are usually not exchanges themselves but they can be typically there is an exchange and the broker sends orders to that exchange the main benefit that brokers offer is a simpler commission structure not all brokers have their own liquidity but brokers can have their own allotment of shares of a stock for example that they will sell you when you make an order so that you get what you want faster regarding accounts at the exchanges to track actual ownership and transfer of assets it is not safe to assume that s how that works there are a lot of shortcomings in how the actual exchange works since the settlement time is 1 3 business days depending on the product so upwards of 5 to 6 actual days in a fast market the asset can change hands many many times making the accounting completely incorrect for extended time periods better to not worry about that part but if you 'd like to read more about how that is regulated look up failure to deliver regulations on short selling to get a better understanding of market it is a very antiquated system

in the equity world if a stock trades at 110 and is going to pay a dividend of 10 in a few days an option expiring after the ex date would take the dividend into account and would trade as if the stock were trading at 100 negative interest rates may also lead to a similar effect in the commodity world the cost of carry needs to be taken into account

we have a local bank that changed to a bill pay service   the money is held as processing when the check is supposed to be cut and shows as cleared on the date the check is supposed to be received   because our business checking is with the same bank we discovered recently that the although the check shows cleared from our account the recipient has not received the paper check yet and may not for 2 3 days   we discovered this because the payroll checks we write this way to ourselves never arrive on the due date but clear the business account   it appears to be a new way for banks to ride the float and draw interest on the money   it happens with every check processed through the bill pay system and not with electronic transfers

in any technical field practitioners have difficulty explaining general abstract concepts to outsiders they 're accustomed to using a particular set of concepts and ideas that make communication fast and easy between their colleagues but make communication difficult with outsiders who do n't know that language it 's usually easy to come up with a mediocre analogy that communicates the gist of the idea but finding analogies that capture the complete essence of the concept is extremely hard and maybe impossible   have you studied mathematics try explaining the concept of a continuous function in all its without talking about and deltas or open sets and you can talk about drawing a line and not picking up your pencil but that 's not quite what a continuous function is likewise if you 've studied law try explaining what a security interest is in its full without talking about liens or pledges you can come up with specific examples sure but it 'll be tough to find one that captures the whole concept i 'm sure you can come up with examples from whatever field it is you specialise in   added to this is the problem that the skill set needed to be a good across disciplines is n't really valued in most corporations including banks    edit i accidentally a word

the title question suggests an answer balance   there are countless stories of who saved their money but led miserable lives   keep in mind you are looking at debt while still earning an income lower than you 'll see after you get your phd do n't add more debt while working towards the phd but do n't think that this is the time to aggressively pay it off either   i 'd look at it this way when you get a full time job money itself will be cheaper it will cost you fewer hours to earn the same number of euros when i was in college the us minimum wage was just over $ but i had an engineering degree and back then a starting salary of over $ 20/hr while still in school my time was precious and the $ 10,000 i borrowed for spending money was 3300 hours that i did n't need to work but it was paid back with just 500 work hours   your question also goes to the future a home purchase there are 2 approaches first pay off the student loan then save for the down payment for many anti debt people this is ideal but if your goal is to be in the house sooner save now for the down payment and only pay the minimum on the loan once you are in the house you can decide to pay the student loan faster but 1.5 i 'd just pay the mortgage faster   i do n't know the cost of housing where you will choose to live but in general i 'd suggest finding the house that you can afford on a 15 year mortgage but take out a 30 this will give you flexibility in your budget life happens and it 's tough to plan for every possible outcome i 'd prefer to have room in the budget for the first years in the house and for potential marriage and the kids that may follow it 's far easier to pay extra on loans than to get lower payments when you realize the budget is too tight   happy to update edit to address any comments you may have

well primarily because that 's fraud and fraud prevents a debtor from receiving a discharge in bankruptcy court   fraud would be pretty easy to prove if you did n't have an income change and you have several lines of credit opened on and around the same day with almost no payments made toward them   additionally thanks to the reforms of the bankruptcy code if your income exceeds the median income of your state you 'll be forced in to a chapter 13 and committed to a repayment plan that allocates all of your disposable income to your creditors now if whoever posted that will attempt to simply not pay then negotiate repayment plans with their creditors the process will last far longer than 7 years   it takes a long time to be in default for enough time that a consumer creditor will negotiate the debt and this is assuming the creditor does n't sue you and get a judgement which could apply liens to any property you may own   the will likely cause you to pursue bankruptcy anyway only now you 're at least a few years beyond the point at which you ruined your credit

if you did n't receive the money in 2012 or have constructive receipt you really ca n't claim the income if the company is going to give you a 1099 for the work they are n't going to give you one until next year and if you claim it this year you will have a hard time explaining the income difference on the other hand if this is n't miscellaneous income but rather self employment income and expenses you should be able to claim the expenses in 2012 and if you have a loss that would carry over to 2013 note it is possible to use an accrual basis if you are running a business which would allow you to do this but it is more complex than the cash accounting individual tax payers use

i started a company that 's in the process of trying to become an sec approved funding portal as defined by this act   that being said i obviously think it was a good thing overall it 's going to be much easier for companies to raise money however i think it 's also going to be much more difficult find good investments there 's a chance that it might fuel a bubble similar to the dotcom bubble in the late early 00 's that 's if it takes off i have some doubts that it will really change the landscape a whole lot even though it 's now legal you still do n't see startups hedge funds etc soliciting investments at least i do n't   some of the relaxing of sox requirements is interesting but i do n't think that really does anything but just defer the inevitable there are quite a few private companies that are already sox compliant simply because if they go public or get purchased by a public company that can be a big advantage   the increasing of shareholders of record from 500 to 2,000 is irrelevant really one shareholder of record can sell portions of their interest to as many people as they want see goldman sachs and facebook   making equity investments in startups available to regular joe 's is a good thing overall it allows the possibility that someone making $ 50k per year to invest in a company that could in the long run boost them up a tax bracket or two the flipside of that is that i still believe most of the us to be financially illiterate there 's a possibility of abuse the sec is currently writing rules to try and stem that but there will still be people who do it hopefully it 's not too bad   lifting the ban on general solicitation is in general a good thing for startups i think this might be advantageous but wo n't be used very much part of the reason startups choose the investors they do if they 're smart is for what value that person or people bring to the table besides cash if i 'm a startup and i need some money i 'm giving up a portion of my baby to someone i want to make sure that person is smart and on the same page with me i 'm not going to settle for just anyone it 's important to remember that even if that person has one share they still get a vote and a say in how i run my company   tl;dr overall i think it 's going to be good it 's not going to be quite as radical as most people think there will be some abuses of the new laws and regs but that comes with the territory

several people have mentioned the obvious inflation   but let 's assume we are talking about real inflation adjusted prices one argument is that populations keep rising while the land does not change   so the price of homes in desirable places gets pushed up and people move to second best locations pushing those prices up etc   similar argument holds for raw materials steel granite fine wood etc another argument is that the economy has a long term upward trajectory that 's the assumption   so each generation as a whole has more disposable real income than the previous   as disposable income increases people tend to put more and more money into their homes pushing prices up   true for all goods of course but it may be more true for real estate than for other types of goods

with my experience because i hate generalizations of an entire country   i 'm indian born and raised but came to the us to do my undergrad uni and now work out of the us i had a lot of the same qualms about working with my indian peers but i 've found that it also depends on the support structure that companies offer high turnover is definitely an issue but that seems to be because companies focus more on hiring and less on retention offering signing bonuses but then little to no continued progress limited growth opportunities rigid hierarchy terrible working hours   i have someone who reports to me in india now and it 's an experiment on how to better engage them and it 's worked better turns out you can expect more when you also treat them like an american employee while expecting american results there are definitely still cultural in work ethic etc but they can be overcome if you get people to stick around long enough   of course this is anecdotal but that 's my two cents

a suitable mix of index funds is a great option if you do n't want to spend a lot of time and effort micromanaging your money if you find amusement in pushing numbers around you may be able to do better notice may if you have multiple millions you can hire someone of that sort to push the numbers around for you they may do better for you notice may and remember that part of your additional gains have to go to pay them which means they have to do better just to be worth having on staff in the first place if you have more than that there are some options available which smaller investors really ca n't get involved in as one example if you have enough money that you can lose $ 100 k without especially noticing you can get involved in venture capital and the like which require a large commitment and are higher risk but can yield higher returns anyone who 's dismissing index funds as only for beginners is being foolish but recommending them to beginners in particular is a good thing since they let you get into the market with fairly predictable risk benefits without needing a massive investment in education and time

whether it 's wise or not depends on what you think and what you should consider are the risks both ways what are the risks for let 's say that the company produces great value and its current price and initial price are well below what it 's worth   by investing some of your money in the company you can take advantage of this value and capitalize off of it if the market recognizes this value too or when the market does if it 's a successful company it will be a matter of when other reasons to be for it are that the tech industry is considered a solid industry and a lot of money is flowing into it   therefore if this assumption is correct you may assume that your job is safe even if your investment does n't pay off meaning you do n't lose income but your investment may not be a great move against let 's say that you dump a lot of money into your company and invest in the stock   you 're being paid by the company you 're taking some of that money and investing it in the company meaning that depending on how much you make outside the company you are increasing your risk of loss if something negative happens to the company ie it fails other reasons to be against it are just the opposite as above due to the nsa some analysts like mish zerohedge and others think that the world will cut back on doing it business with the united states thus the tech industry will take a major hit over the next decade   in addition to that jesse colombo on twitter is predicting that there 's another tech bubble and it will make a mess when it pops to be fair to colombo he was one of analysts who predicted the housing bubble and his predictions on trading are often right finally there is a risk of lost money and there is also a risk of lost opportunity   looking at your past investments which generally hurt more   that might give you a clue what to do

md tech 's answer is correct let me only point out that there are easier ways to invest in the djia index without having to buy individual stocks you can buy a mutual fund or etf that will track the index and your return will be almost identical to the performance of the underlying index it 's almost identical because the fund will take a small management fee you will have to pay annual taxes on capital gains if you hold the investment in a taxable account and because the fund has to actually invest in the underlying stocks there will be small differences due to rounding and timing of the fund 's trades you also ask assuming that i calculated those numbers correctly is this gain    approximately better equal to or worse than an average investment    for that while people argue about the numbers index funds tend to do better than average depends on what you call average of course they do better than most actively managed funds too and since they have low management fees index funds are often considered to be an important part of a long term investment portfolio because they require very little activity on your part other than buying and holding

gt;well first off the roads are more than just hobbies they really do go places a lot of the roads in my area would be unprofitable and people live down those roads what happens when a company decides that road is too expensive to maintain but decides to keep ownership the people have to move   yes if people want to live out somewhere that is inefficient other people who do not choose to live there should n't have to subsidize them i say this having grown up 17 miles from the nearest town in a completely rural environment   gt;it does n't have to but it 's unrealistic to expect that they wo n't take a profit from it but do you really think that if a company has a monopoly they 're going to charge you the bare minimum they can if you have no choice but to pay tolls or for driving passes for certain cities and you can only get them from a single company what motivation does that company have to keep them affordable and readily available they 're going to do like any company would and find that point of maximum profitability between cost of permit and number of permits   is this not a similar situation we currently have with electricity trash and various other pieces of our infrastructure people are not being because there is some level of regulation which is necessary for a functional society i 'm not necessarily advocating a completely free market as monopolies are dangerous i just think the government 's role is to big   gt;then there 's the whole reality that you will still pay for roads you do n't use if one company owns multiple roads they 're going to charge you enough money to expand roads to fix up other dilapidated roads etc more profitable roads will be used to offset less profitable roads etc basically if there 's a new neighborhood and they build a road to it if you 've been paying that company they 're using your money to build that road   not really i 'm paying to use a certain stretch of road right now what the company chooses to do with that money is their issue

like @littleadv i do n't consider a mortgage on a primary residence to be a low risk investment   it is an asset but one that can be rather illiquid depending on the nature of the real estate market in your area   there are enough additional costs associated with home ownership down payment insurance repairs relative to more traditional investments to argue against a primary residence being an investment your question did n't indicate when and where you bought your home the type of home single family townhouse or condo the nature of your mortgage fixed rate or adjustable rate or your interest rate but since you 're in your i 'm guessing you bought after the crash   if that 's the case your odds of making a profit if when you sell your home are higher than they would be if you bought in the time frame   this is no guarantee of course   given the amount of housing stock still available housing prices could still fall further   while it is possible to lose money in all sorts of investments the illiquid nature of real estate makes it a lot more difficult to limit your losses by selling if preserving principal is your objective money market funds and treasury inflation protected securities are better choices than your home   the diversification your financial advisor is suggesting is a way to manage risk   not all investments perform the same way in a given economic climate   when stocks increase in value bonds tend to decrease and vice versa   too much money in a single investment means you could be wiped out in a downturn

i primarily intend to add on to 's answer which is good it has been shown that momentum is a very real tangible factor in stock returns stocks that have done well tend to keep doing well stocks that are doing poorly tend to keep doing poorly for a long term value investor of course fundamental valuation should be your first thing to look at but as long as you 're comfortable with the company 's price as compared to its value you should absolutely hang onto it if it 's been going up the old saying on wall street is cut your losses and let your winners ride as said there may be some tangible emotional benefit to marking your win while you 're ahead and not risking that it tanks but i 'd say the odds are in your favor if an undervalued company starts rising in stock price maybe that means the market is starting to recognize it for the deal it is hang onto it and enjoy the fruits of your research

the economics in this are pretty let 's just say weird off   us looks richer because of borrowing money therefore it 's currency appreciates in relation to other countries i do n't see the logic in this one    the outsourcing jobs overseas phenomenon is a long term one firms do n't do it with recessions recessions might force the hand of some firms to outsource but i do n't see businesses suddenly bringing those jobs back en mass when a boom occurs it also ignores the fact that when firms outsource they can provide goods at a cheaper rate domestically thereby bringing down some costs the decrease in costs might even make it cheaper for businesses to operate thereby allowing enough savings to hire more people who knows the whole effect is somewhat ambiguous to simply select the worst possible scenario and explain only that is pretty obvious bias   when uncle sam can no longer pay it 's bills the video says it like it 's a certainty somehow he knows for a fact that the us will default soon yet the investment banks with teams of analysts do n't

economically it does n't make much difference but i like to control the account because i can adjust the amount i put aide each month based on the new tax rates that come out each spring this allow me finer control i also know that the bills have been paid i had one lender years ago that failed to pay the property tax bill i had to end the money in to the county and then months fighting the lender to get the money back now i avoid escrow accounts   the money being collected by the mortgage servicing company for property taxes and property insurance goes into a separate account the company insists on handling the funds to make sure that these bills are paid on time thus protecting their investment the failure to pay the taxes leaves the property subject to forfeiture via tax lien   the failure to pay property insurance leaves the house unprotected if there is a fire or other incident you can avoid the use of an escrow   account if you have enough equity in the account some lenders ask for you to provide proof of payment each year if you are going to pay it yourself   at the end of each year the servicing company will provide you with an accounting for interest on the loan and the amount of money spent on taxes and insurance also expect that they will make adjustments to the monthly withholding based on estimated increases for taxes and insurance   depending on your financial situation the interest taxes may be included on schedule a. if you have a rental property the interest taxes and insurance are considered expenses that you can write off the biggest issue with escrow accounts is that the company can have a buffer built in to protect them from unexpected increases many people view the calculation of the buffer a confusing and feel that they are overpaying   if you want to avoid the escrow account you should make sure that each month you put the money into a separate account so that when the property tax bill is due you can pay it on time when savings accounts earned significant interest it was possible to make a little money in the deal but that has n't been true for the last few years

removal of net neutrality is a vote for double billing consumers   many consumers already overpay for their internet service physical and wireless and most people do n't realize that websites also pay for internet access that second fee is built into the site 's business model e.g. ad supported subscription etc   sites could more effectively fight for net neutrality with a financial campaign like this   subscription services could highlight the hidden cost of website internet access as a line item on their invoices   for example   netflix   $ 5.50 verizon access fee   $ 3.50 total price $ 8.00   or   netflix   $ 5.75 at&amp;t access fee   $ 4.25 total price $ 10.00   of course removing net neutrality means that netflix would need to jack up it 's prices for customers depending on who their isp is to meet whatever crazy quality of service fees the isps want to tack on   and that seriously messes with netflix 's business however by using invoice line items consumers and their politicians would quickly realize that isps are double dipping maybe netflix could simply threaten this reality   the more interesting problem is ad supported businesses like google and facebook any removal of net neutrality will lead to higher fees paid by advertisers and most likely further to consumers with yet more fucking ads that try to pay for this insanity advertisers themselves are disgruntled with digital advertising and it would be interesting if they too realized that isps were ultimately screwing them with quality of service fees can you imagine some advertisers will pay more for that quality of service to force yet more ads on you   but the really scary part is n't net neutrality it 's the data rape that isps engage in to get those sweet sweet ad dollars back in march that debate came and went with a house internet privacy repeal index.html probably because google and facebook also need to data rape people to support their business models

can you easily stomach the risk of higher volatility that could come with smaller stocks how certain are you that the funds would n't have any asset bloat that could cause them to become large cap funds for holding to their winners if having your 401(k balance get chopped in half over a year does n't give you any pause or hesitation then you have greater risk tolerance than a lot of people but this is one of those things where living through it could be interesting while i would n't be against the advice i would consider caution on whether or not the next 40 years will be exactly like the averages of the past or not in response to the comments you did n't state the funds so i how i do know you meant index funds specifically look at fidelity low priced stock for a fund that has bloated up in a sense could this happen with small cap funds possibly but this is something to note if you are just starting to invest now it is easy to say i 'll stay the course and then when things get you may not be as strong as you thought this is just a warning as i 'm not sure you get my meaning here imagine that some women may think when having a child i do n't need any drugs and then the pain comes and an is demanded because of the different between the hypothetical and the real version while you may think i 'll just turn the cheek if you punch me if i actually just did it out of the blue how sure are you of not at me for doing it really stop and think about this for a moment rather than give an answer that may or may not what you 'd really do when the matter hits the oscillator could n't you just look at what stocks did the best in the last 10 years and just buy those companies think carefully about what strategy are you using and why or else you could get tossed around as more than a few things were supposed to be the sure thing that turned out to be incorrect like the dream team of long term capital management the banks that were too big to fail the japanese taking over in the late 1980s etc there are more than a few times where things started looking one way and ended up quite differently though i wonder if you are aware of this performance chasing that some will do

i held shares in bind a small biotechnology company on the nasdaq that was liquidated on the chapter 11 auction block in 2016 there were sufficient proceeds to pay the debts and return some cash to shareholders with payments in 2016 and 2017 some payments have yet to occur the whole process is counter intuitive and full of both for tax preparation planning and receiving payments landmine 0 some shareholders will sell in a panic as soon as the chapter 11 is announced   this would have been a huge mistake in the case of bind because the eventual liquidation payments were worth 3 or so times as much as the share price after chapter 11   the amount of the liquidation payments was n't immediately because the company 's intellectual property had to be auctioned landmine 1 the large brokerages vanguard fidelity tda and others the distributions to shareholders on form 1099 distributed to both shareholders and the irs the bankruptcy trustee considered this to be their responsibility according to the tax code and to the irs website the liquidation is taxed like a sale of stock rather than a dividend on the shareholder level a complete liquidation can be thought of as a sale of all outstanding corporate stock held by the shareholders in exchange for all of the assets in that corporation like any sale of stock the shareholder receives capital gain treatment on the difference between the amount received by the shareholder in the distribution and the cost or other basis of the stock the distributions as dividends makes them wrongly ineligible to be wiped out by the enormous capital loss on the stock   vanguard 's error appeared on my own 1099 and the others were mentioned in an investor discussion on   however l the bankruptcy trustee stated on twitter that while the payments are not dividends the 1099s were the brokers responsibility landmine 2 many shareholders will wrongly attempt to claim the capital loss for tax year 2016 or they may have failed to understand the law in time for proper tax planning for tax year 2016 it does not matter that the company 's shares were cancelled in 2016   according to the irs website when a shareholder receives a series of distributions in liquidation gain is recognized once all of the shareholder 's stock basis is recovered a loss however will not be recognized until the final distribution is received in particular shareholders who receive the 2017 payment will not be able to take a capital loss for tax year 2016 because the liquidation was n't complete   late discovery of this timing issue no doubt resulted in an end of year of 2016 overall capital gains for many causing a failure to preemptively realize available capital losses elsewhere i 'm not going to carefully consider the following issues which may or may not have some effect on the timing of the capital loss landmine 3 surprisingly it appears that some shareholders who sold their shares in 2016 still may not claim the capital loss for tax year 2016 because they will receive a liquidation distribution in 2017 taken at face value the irs website 's statement a loss however will not be recognized until the final distribution is received appears to apply to shareholders of record of august 30 2016 who receive the payouts even if they sold the shares after the record date   however to know for sure it might be worth carefully parsing the relevant tax code and treasury regs landmine 4 some shareholders are completely cut out of the bankruptcy distribution the bankruptcy plan only provides distributions for shareholders of record aug 30 2016   those who bought shares of afterwards are out of luck landmine 5 according to the discussion on many shareholders have yet to receive or even learn of the existence of a form more secure link showing brokers served here required to accept 2017 payments   to add to confusion there is apparently ongoing legal over whether the trustee is able to require this form worse shareholders report difficulty getting brokers required cooperation in submitting this form landmine 6 hopefully there are no more boom disclaimer i am not a tax professional consult the tax code treasury regulations irs publications when preparing your taxes   they are more trustworthy than accountants or at least more trustworthy than good ones

i 'm not convinced that cost of living is related to ensuring greater appreciation of assets over time especially over a 30 year window the importance of regional differences in cost of living to anyone 's decision making should be weighted by the percentage of their income spent on indexed items   that is for people who spend 35 or even 50 of their salary on indexed items regional variances in cost of living are far more important than for people who spend 10 of their salaries on these items   essentially as income goes up the significance of cost of living goes down see for a pretty picture of the relevance of cost of living across income groups for food gas which are often not included in indexes due to volatility   so if you are wondering whether cost of living is overstated perhaps it 's because you are in an income group that does n't need to worry about it as much   whether it 's overstated or not will depend on how much one makes and spends

much of the interest on a loan comes in the first years of a mortgage so the sooner you can pay that off the better   but let 's see what the numbers say if you have a loan at 4 principal of $ 100,000 a term of 30 years then this gives monthly payments of $ using the excel pmt function if you sell the house after precisely 5 years worth of payments then you have made $ in payments you still owe $ suppose you sell the house for $ 100,000   that means you will be in the hole for $ 100,000 $ $ = now suppose you pay an extra $ 50 per month over the five years   the same calculation becomes $ 100,000 $ $ = so in this scenario which is a little simplistic you are $ better off the question you have to ask is whether you could have done better investing the $ 3,000 in extra payments somewhere else the cagr in doing this is 1.7 so you might be better off putting the money away running the same numbers for a 6 mortgage the cagr you have is about 2.7 edit i 've added a google docs spreadsheet read only that you can download and play with   feel free to correct anything you find edit 2   ok so i 've had a look at what joetaxpayer is saying in the comments below and now i agree   the cagr should be 4 where i want wrong was to assume that the $ 50 per month payments over the five years are worth $ 50 5 12 = $ 3000    this neglects the time value of money having small amounts of money periodically rather than all of it in a lump sum including this makes the effective value of the monthly $ 50 payments $ written as = in excel or google docs i 've added a tab to the original spreadsheet to show the different calculations   note that it still does n't quite come to 4 but i guess it 's a minor error in the sheet nb i know i 'm leaving out mortgage interest tax relief costs for selling etc etc

it very much depends on whether you want to drive around in an expensive car or whether you want an expensive car parked on your driveway and whether you want to buy a new car or a used one and whether you know a reliable garage that does n't rip you off or not   for example if my wife who drives maybe 5,000 miles a year wanted a 5 series bmw we could buy a five year old one with 120,000 miles for about £ 120 per month purchase price if it lasts 6 years 11 year old and 150,000 miles should be no problem for that kind of car so that 's quite affordable for me driving 25,000 miles a year the numbers are quite different   fact is if you drive around in my wider neighbourhood you will sometimes see very expensive cars parked in front of very rundown houses some people find it more important to drive around in an expensive car than to live in a nice place that 's priorities many people can afford expensive cars if they their priorities and i 'm not saying it 's a good thing   ps if you want to be seen in an expensive car for example you take your wife out you can always rent a car for a day or two

varying the amount to reflect income during the quarter is entirely legitimate consider someone like a salesman whose income is partly driven by commissions and who therefore ca n't predict the total the payments are quarterly precisely so you can base them on actual results having said that   i suspect that as long as you show good intent they wo n't quibble if your estimate is off by a few percent and they 'll never complain if you overpay so it may not be worth the effort to change the payment amount for that last quarter unless the income is very different

there are lots of sub parts to your question let 's them one at a time should i worry about an ira at this age absolutely or at least some form of retirement account when you are young is the best time to start putting money into a retirement account because you have so much time for it to grow compounding interest is a magical thing even if you can only afford to put a very small amount in the account do it   you will have to put a heck of a lot less money into the account over your working career if you start now is there a certain amount   you need for the ira deduction no essentially with a traditional ira you can just subtract the amount you deposited up to the contribution limit from your income when calculating your taxes   what kind of ira should i get i suggest a roth ira but be warned that with that kind you get the tax breaks when you retire not now if you think taxes will be higher in 40 years or so then the roth is a clear winner   traditional ira tax deduction this year for contribution investment    plus gains are taxed as income when    you take the money out at retirement roth ira investment amount is taxed in the year you put it in no    taxes on investment amount or gains    when you take it out at retirement given the long horizon that you will be investing the money is likely going to at least double so the total amount you are taxed on over your lifetime would probably be less with the roth even if tax rates remain the same is the 401 k a better option if they offer a match most do then it is a no brainer the employer 401 k always comes out on top because they are basically paying you extra to put money into savings   if there is no match i suggest a roth because company 401 k plans usually have hidden fees that are much higher than you are going to pay for setting up your own ira or roth ira with a broker

a breakdown of stock buy backs has this bottom line on it are share buybacks good or bad as is so often the case in finance the question may not have a definitive answer if a stock is undervalued and a buyback truly represents the best possible investment for a company the buyback and its effects can be viewed as a positive sign for shareholders watch out however if a company is merely using buybacks to prop up ratios provide short term relief to an ailing stock price or to get out from under excessive dilution read more what is the reason that a company like aapl is buying back its own    shares   offsetting dilution would be my main thought here as many employees may exercise options putting more stock out there that the company buys back stock to balance things does it have too much cash and it does n't know what to do with it   no as it could do dividends if it wanted to give it back to investors so it is returning the cash back to investors not quite while some investors may get cash from apple i 'd suspect most shareholders are n't likely to see cash unless they are selling their shares so i would n't say yes to this without qualification at the same time the treasury shares apple has can be used to give options to employees or be used in acquisitions for a couple of other purposes

as mhoran_psprep and others have already said it sounds like the sale is concluded and your son has no obligation to return the car or pay a dime more the only case in which your son should consider returning the car is if it works in his favor for example if he is able to secure a similar bargain on a different car and the current dealer buys the current car back from your son at a loss if the dealer wants to buy the car back your son should first get them to agree to cover any fees already incurred by your son after that he should negotiate that the dealer split the remaining difference with him suppose the dealership gave a $ 3000 discount and your son paid $ 1000 in title transfer registration and any other fees such as a cashier 's check or tax if applicable the remaining difference is $ 2000 your son should get half that   in this scenario the dealer only loses half as much money and your son gains $ 1000 for his trouble

for 3x it 's about 114 and for 4x 144 which naturally is twice 72   these are close back of napkin results with smart phone apps offering scientific calculators you should get comfortable just taking the root of a number for a more precise answer   update in response to brick 's comment the rule of 72 says that to double your money it answers both questions how much time do i need given a rate and how much return do i need given a time   logic tells me that if 72 is the number to double 144 is the but i 'm a math guy and my logic might not be logical to op so   let 's take the 20th root of 4    this is the key to use 4 hit key 20 equals the result is or and this is the precise rate you 'd need to quadruple your money in 20 years now 20 = which rounds to 144 rule of 144 to quadruple your money   this now answers op 's question how to derive a rule of x for a return other than doubling   one more example i want 10x my money of course i need the initial guess to enter one calculation people like 8 in general it 's a bit below the 10 long term s&p return and a good round number the rule of 72 says 9 years to double so 18 years is 4x and 36 years is for my initial calculation i 'll use 40 years the root of 10 i get again the precise rate that gives 10 fold over 40 years and multiplying this by 40 i get a rule of 237 which i 'm tempted to round to 240   at 6 yrs   1.06 ^ = 9.99 at 6 yrs   1.06 ^ = you can see that you lose some accuracy for the sake of a number that 's easier to remember and manipulate 72 to double is pretty darn accurate so i 'll stick with rule of 237 to get 10x my money    to close the purpose of these rules is to create the tool that lets you perform some otherwise tough calculations away from any electronic device of course i know how to use logs and in real life i 'm paid to explain them to students who are typically glad when that chapter is over i 've shown above how the rule of x can be formulated with a power root key which for most people is simpler ironically log calculations as offered force a continuous compounding which may not be desired at all it would give a result of 230 for my 10x return example and the following using the first equation he offered at 6 yrs   1.06 ^ = which is further away from the desired 10x than my 237 or rounded 240

my opinion is that in general it is probably not a good idea to borrow at a cost in order to make your rrsp contribution   banks of course have an interest in loaning you money   do n't expect their literature to be objective on the matter   they are selling you a product and the advice is biased   what better way to double dip than to get guaranteed interest payments from you as well as ongoing fees for probably also getting your loan money invested in their high fee mutual funds a year 's rrsp contribution room allowance is n't use it or lose it unlike 401k contribution allowances in the u.s that is unused rrsp contribution room accumulates and you can take advantage of it in later years if we could n't carry our rrsp contribution room over i might feel different about the general case for rrsp loans yet there are two specific cases i can think of where it may make sense to borrow and pay back a possible case if your tax rate is currently in a high bracket e.g. 46 and you anticipate being in a lower income and bracket next year e.g. 35 then it would make sense to take advantage of the higher tax savings in the current tax year   if you waited until the following year to take the deduction you 'd lose out on 11 of the deducted amount    for a typical person whose income is level or increasing from year to year this is n't likely to be applicable but it could help somebody who is going on leave or otherwise has irregular income a foolish case if you knew somehow that you could realize a return on your invested rrsp money exceeding the pre tax earnings required to pay the interest on the rrsp loan   however i would suggest this is foolish bet to make   the interest you pay is guaranteed but the return you are expected to get is probably not or if it is it is probably a return lower than what your bank wants to charge on the loan if for some reason it does make sense for you take the money and invest it somewhere better than the high fee mutual funds the bank is also pushing

the key is that you need to use your debit card to earn the higher interest rate the bank can offer a higher interest rate on accounts connected with a debit card because they earn additional income through debit card fees charged towards account holders among other things they offer the higher interest rate specifically to encourage people to use their debit cards by offering a joint checking savings account that requires you to use your debit card the bank is assuming that you 'll keep more money in your account than you would in a standard checking only account your higher balance translates into more money the bank can loan out or invest which usually leads to higher profit for them businesses pay fees to the bank to accept debit cards these fees represent another source of profit for the bank the more you use your debit card the more the bank earns in fees so the bank encourages you to use your debit card more frequently through incentives like a higher interest rate or waiving fees on your account if you use your card enough plus since it 's likely that an individual who maintains a fairly high balance in an account linked to a debit card is going to spend more simply because they can spend more banks will sometimes waive fees on the consumer side for balances over a certain amount

in the us it is perfectly legal to execute what you 've described however since you seem to be bullish on the stock why sell how do you know the price will continue downwards aside from the philosophical reasoning there can be significant downside to selling shares when you 're expecting to repurchase them in the near future i.e. you will lose your cost basis date which determines whether or not your trade is short term less than 1 year or long term this cost basis term will begin once you repurchase the shares if you are trying to tax harvest and match against some short term gains tax loss harvesting prior to long term treatment may be suitable otherwise your reasoning and reconsider the sale at all since you are bullish remember if you could pick where stock prices are headed in the short term with any degree of certainty you are literally one of a kind on this planet   in addition do remember that in a tax deferred account e.g. ira the term of your trade is typically meaningless but your philosophical reasoning for selling should still be examined

there 's absolutely nothing wrong with unskilled labor   but walmart is such a large part of the us economy that an increase in their wage base would definitely have an impact on inflation so that any broad based increase they gave would likely have a marginal impact on quality of life   it would also make their items more expensive two times over one because it would cause inflation that other employers have been raising wages to keep pace with and the more direct route of increased costs     whatever you pay unskilled labor the market will simply raise prices to a level where unskilled labor still have a tough time affording a comfortable lifestyle   look at australia as an example of what happens when you raise the minimum wage too high

i would expect that your position will be liquidated when the option expires but not before there 's probably still some time value so it does n't make sense for the buyer to exercise the option early and take your stock instead they could sell the option to someone else and collect the remaining time value occasionally there 's a weird situation for whatever reason where an option has near zero or negative time value and then you might get an early exercise but in general if there 's time value someone would want to sell rather than exercise if the option has n't expired maybe the stock will even fall again and you 'll keep it if the option just expired maybe the exercise just has n't been processed yet it may take overnight or so

no it wo n't affect your score until your statement is posted paying your bill before your statement is posted is actually a good way to keep your credit utilization low if you 're worried about high credit utilization negatively affecting your credit score consider paying your bill several times a month to ensure that when your final monthly statement is posted your utilization is still low when my credit limit was very low while i was in college i did this almost every month and i 've seen other sites recommend this practice as well from creditkarma.com the easiest way to lower credit utilization is to make credit card payments more than once a month so that your balance never gets too high and consider making payments to creditors more than once each month otherwise if you put a major expense like a new appliance on a credit card even if you plan to pay it off your fico score may take a hit the reason is that credit scores are calculated as a snapshot in time so if that happens to be right after you charged a new $ 700 washing machine your utilization ratio will look high remember though that it 's best to have some balance on your card when your statement is posted assuming you pay it off in full each month because as the chart shows 0 utilization is about as bad as utilization > 31 40   also remember that credit utilization affects your credit score in real time so if you have high utilization one month but a lower utilization the next month the hit to your score will disappear once a statement with low utilization is posted

i started with lending club about a year ago   i love it   it has been insightful   off topic but i am in a loan to a guy who make 120 k a year and is regularly late and has a pretty high interest rate   crazy you gain some economies of scale by going with a bigger note   i have $ 100 notes that i get hit for 2 or 3 cents for a fee where $ 25 notes are always a penny   however i do n't think that should be your deciding factor i scale my note purchases based on how much i like the status of the borrower   for example i did $ 100 which is currently my max for a guy with a reasonable loan amount 16 k a stable work history 15 + years a great credit history and a great interest rate   if one of those things were a bit out of whack   i might go $ 50 two $ 25    i prefer 36 month notes really 5 years to get out of debt   it is unlikely to happen imho keep in mind that if you invest $ 100 in a loan then you get one $ 100 note   you ca n't break them up into 4 $ 25 notes   for that reason if you are likely to want to sell the note prematurely keep it at $ 25   the market is greater    i 've had a lot of success using the trading account buying further discounted notes for people who want out of lending club or get spooked by a couple of late payments and a change in billing date    another advantage of using the trading account is you start earning interest day 1   i 've had new notes take a couple of weeks to go through    to summarize there are some other things but that is the main stuff i look at

my answer is similar to ben miller 's but let me make some slightly different points there is one excellent reason to get a consolidation loan you can often get a lower interest rate if you are presently paying 19 on a credit card and you can roll that into a personal loan at you 'll be saving over 5 which can add up i would definitely not consolidate a loan at into a loan at then you 're just adding 1 to your interest rate what 's the benefit in this another good reasons for a consolidation loan is psychological a consolidation loan with fixed payments forces you to pay that amount every month you say you have trouble with credit cards it 's very easy to say to yourself oh just this month i 'm going to pay just the minimum so i can use my cash for this other very important thing that i need to buy and then next month you find something else that you just absolutely have to buy and again the next month and the next and your determination to seriously pay down your debt keeps getting pushed off if you have a fixed monthly payment you ca n't you 're committed also if you have many credit cards juggling payments on all of them can get complex and confusing it 's easy to lose track of how much you owe and to budget for payments at worst when there are many bills to pay you may forget one personally i now have 3 bank cards an airline card and 2 store cards and managing them is getting out of hand i have good reasons for having so many cards the airline card and the store cards give me special discounts but it 's confusing to keep track of as to adding $ 3,000 to the consolidation loan very very bad idea you are basically saying i have to start seriously paying down my debt tomorrow today i need a some extra cash so i 'm going to borrow just a little bit more but i 'm going to get started paying it off next month this is a trap and the sort of trap that leads people into spiraling debt start paying off debt now not at some vague time in the future that never seems to come

it sort of sounds like you want to contradictory things 1 to fix your credit so you will be able to get loans and 2 to have more money available to spend now it sounds like the latter is probably not possible   not without getting into a worse situation than you are currently in based on what you have written the next step is payday loans and the like which is basically financial suicide fixing your credit is simple   it 's just not fun   cut your spending   cut it way way way down   you will certainly have to change your lifestyle i 'd suggest taking a second job make the minimum payment on everything then put all your extra money toward the most pressing things i would focus on the former   as you pay down your debt your utilization will go down and this will raise your score automatically   when you pay off your highest interest rate debt do n't change your spending   instead put everything you were putting to that to the next highest debt you have   continue until your highest interest rate loan is at or below the mortgage rate when you get to this point you will notice that your credit score is vastly better and you are no longer spending all your money on interest   you will probably be in a position to buy a home   and you will have the satisfaction of knowing you did it yourself rather than having a bankruptcy judge force you to change your lifestyle a note on the items in collections make sure they are all legit   if any are wrong it is pretty straightforward to contest them with the credit bureaus and get them taken off   things in collections will drop your score severely

the uk does n't tax gifts or wealth so you do n't have to pay any tax on your existing savings or the money your parents transfer you if your parents lived in the uk then you might be potentially liable to inheritance tax on the money if they died less than seven years after giving it to you but if they live in japan this wo n't be relevant in theory you might have to pay tax on any interest received in the bank account while you live in the uk however this is likely to be very small and if you do n't have any other income then it 's highly unlikely this would apply as you can get up to £ 16,000 of interest without paying tax

i work in the fsa hsa industry and just wanted to point out that if your wife has a medical fsa you can not contribute to an hsa whether or not you are covered by her medical insurance plan the only exception to this per the rules is if your wife 's employers plan limits the medical fsa benefit to the employee your wife which i can say from experience is extremely rare it 's possible but i 've never personally seen an employer with this in their plan document so better check first to be sure the fsa is restricted to your wife only you have to understand the fsa to know why this is true unless restricted your wife can use her medical fsa for herself her spouse and any tax dependents meaning whether or not she uses the fsa for your eligible expenses you still have 1st dollar coverage from the fsa making you in eligible to open and contribute to an hsa until the end of the plan year and possibly grace period if her employer has one in place and she does not spend her funds by the end of the plan year hope this helps if your still not sure talk to a tax professional which i am not but do advise employers and participants on both hsas and fsas

indeed so goes the theory that redistribution would lead to inflation or run away inflation but is n't that exactly what the fed is trying to do it could also or alternatively indicate that assets are way overvalued which would also be a bad situation which is it
# 591007
the reason is governments print extra money to cause inflation hopefully reasonable so that people do n't just sit comfortably but do something to make money work thus inflation is an artificial measure which leads to money value gradually decreasing and causing people invest money in one way or another to beat inflation or maybe even gain some more money printing money is super cheap unlike producing any kind of commodity and that makes money different from commodities commodities have their inherent value but money has only nominal value it 's an artificial government controlled product

my advice would be to invest that 50k in 25 batches across 4 different money markets batch 1 lend using a peer to peer account 12.5k the interest rates offered by banks are n't that appealing to investors anymore at least in the uk peer to peer lending brokers such as zopa provide 5 to 6   annual returns if you 're willing to hold on to your investment for a couple of years despite your pre these investments are relatively safe although not guaranteed i must stress this zopa state on their website that they have n't lost any money provided from their investors since the company 's inception 10 years ago and have a safeguard trust that will be used to pay out investors if a large number of borrowers defaulted i 'm not sure if this service is available in australia but aim for an interest rate of 5 6 with a trusted peer to peer lender that has a strong track record batch 2 the stock market 12.5k an obvious choice this is by far the most exciting way to grow your money the next question arising from this will likely be how do i pick stocks this 12.5k needs to be further divided into 5 or so different stocks my strategy for picking stock at the current time will be to have 20 of your holdings in blue chip companies with a strong track record of performance and ideally a dividend that is paid bi quarterly another type of stock that you should invest in should be companies that are relatively newly listed on the stock market but have monopolistic qualities that is that they are the biggest best and only provider of their new and unique service examples of this would be tesla and just eat moreover i 'd advise another type of stock you should purchase be a sin stock to hedge against bad economic times if they arise a sin stock is one associated with sin i.e. cigarette manufacturers alcohol suppliers providers of gambling products these often perform good while the economy is doing well but even better when the economy experiences a 2007 2008 and type of meltdown finally another category i 'd advise would be large cap energy provider companies such as exxon mobil bp duke energy primarily because these are currently cheaper than they were a few months ago and the demand for energy is likely to grow with the population which is definitely growing rapidly batch 3 funds 12.5k having some of your money in funds is really a no brainer a managed fund is traditionally a collection of stocks that have been selected within a particular market at this time i 'd advise at least 20 of the 12.5k in emerging market funds as the prices are ridiculously low having fallen about 60 unless china brazil india just self destruct or get they will slowly grow again within the next 5 years i imagine quite high returns can be had in this type of funds the rest of your funds should be high dividend payers but i 'll let you do your own research batch 4 property 12.5k the property market is too good to not get into but let 's be honest you 're not going to be able to buy a flat house apartment for 12.5k the idea therefore would be to find a crowd funding platform that allows you to own a part of a property alongside other owners the uk has platforms such as property partner that are great for this and i 'm sure australia also has some such platforms invest in the capital city in areas as close to the city 's center as possible as that 's unlikely to change barring some kind of economic collapse or an strike i think the above methods of investing provide the following 1 diversified portfolio of investments 2 hedging against difficult economic times should they occur and the only way you 'll lose out with diversification such as this is if the whole economic system collapses or all out nuclear war although i think your investments will be the least of your worries in a nuclear war anyway this is the method of investing i 've chosen for myself and you can see my reasoning above feel free to ask me if you have any questions

what you 're looking for are either fx forwards or fx futures    these products are traded differently but they are basically the same thing agreements to deliver currency at a defined exchange rate at a future time    almost every large venue or bank will transact forwards when the counterparty you or your broker has sufficient trust and credit for the settlement risk but the typical duration is less than a year though some will do a single digit multi year forward on a custom basis   then again all forwards are considered custom contracts   you 'll also need to know that forwards are done on currency pairs so you 'll need to pick the currency to pair your nok against   most likely you 'll want eur nok simply for the larger liquidity of that pair over other possible pairs a quote on a forward will usually just be known by the standard currency pair ticker with a settlement date different from spot   e.g. eur nok 12 m for the 12 month settlement futures on the other hand are exchange traded and more standardized   the vast majority through the cme chicago mercantile exchange   your broker will need access to one of these exchanges and you simply need to qualify for futures trading process depends on your broker   futures generally have highest liquidity for the next expiration quarterly expiration on well known standard dates but i believe they 're defined for more years out than forwards    at one fx desk i 've knowledge of they had 6 years worth of quarterly expirations in their system at any one time   futures are generally known by a ticker composed of a globex or cme code for the currency with another code representing the expiration   for example is nok for norwegian h for march and 6 for the nearest future date 's year that ends in 6 i.e. 2016    note that you 'll be legally liable to deliver the contracted size of if you hold through expiration   so the common trade is to hold the future and net out just before expiration when the price more accurately reflects the current spot market

it is a dangerous policy not to have a balance across the terms of assets short term reserves should remain in short term investments because they are most likely needed in the short term   the amount can be shaved according to the probability of their respective needs but long term asset variance usually exceed the probability of needing to use reserves for example replacing one month bonds paying essentially nothing with stocks that should be expected to return 9 will expose oneself to a possible sudden 50 loss   if cash is indeed so abundant that reserves can be doubled this policy can be expected to be stable however cash is normally scarce   it is a risky policy to place reserves that have a 20 chance of being 100 liquidated into investments that have a 20 chance of declining by approximately 50 just for a chance of an extra 9 annual return financial stability should always be of primary concern with rate of return secondary only after stability has been reasonably assured

gt but the buying power of that money can be significantly reduced to the point where it 's fundamentally useless i.e. inter war germany and many countries in south and central america   that 's true but how does that come about the effect on buying power stems from the level of spending in the present period too little leaves you anywhere from outright deflation and contraction to weaker growth falling short of capacity too much reaches capacity and keeps spending bidding up prices and driving down purchasing power   it has nothing to do with debt gdp or interest payments   gt germany managed to skate by by creating a new in a confidence trick and it worked because germany is a solid iron clad manufacturing powerhouse of a lot of stuff    there are two important differences between inter war germany and the us first is that inter war germany lost a this real shock is kind of important when you 're talking about buying power of money one side of it is the amount of money in circulation but the other side of it is how much real output there is to buy and german real output capacity collapsed after the war their most productive regions were occupied territory and they were no longer a powerhouse manufacturing a lot of stuff driving down the value of their currency   so lesson number one from germany real output collapse harms your currency   the second problem is that losing a war left germany saddled with war denominated in foreign currency when you 're on the hook for something you do n't print you 're in a situation where you can run out of money and that 's exactly what happened to them they tried printing more of their own currency to buy the foreign stuff with but that quickly drove down the value of german currency   so lesson number two from germany is you do n't want to be on the hook for a currency you do n't issue   put the two together and you have a real supply shock + foreign denominated debt the buying power of german currency it was n't debt gdp but the real basis for their economy collapsing out from under them pushed along by a need for foreign currency   gt;my question is at what point do we engage washington 's unlimited money printing presses until we reach that point   in answer to your question the printing presses are what funds the real economy the worry in terms of avoiding that point is in making sure we keep that real economy productive and fully funded ironically taking our eye off the ball to focus on budget balance at the expense of real output pushes the economy in the direction you 're afraid of going see also the euro zone today

will the proportion of my payments towards interest eventually go down   yes today would be a good day to do a web search for amortization schedule you will quickly learn how to compute precisely how much of each payment goes to interest and how much goes to principal given different payment choices would it be wiser to spend more each month on loan payments that depends on your goals and resources which we know nothing about if you have extra money you could spend it on debt reduction or you could spend it on an investment that pays more money in growth or dividends than the interest you 'd save or you could decide that the longer you have that loan sure the more interest you 'll pay but inflation will make future money less valuable basically by taking out a loan you have chosen to gamble that the thing you bought with the loaned money will be worth the cost of the interest payments in the future adjusted for inflation the bank on the other hand is gambling that you 're good for the debt and that they can make a reasonable profit off it if you have more money to gamble with which bet is the wisest one is really up to you would it be smarter to try to pay off one loan before the other if you want to pay off a loan early then always choose the loan with the higher interest rate should i start making bi weekly payments instead of monthly that 's roughly equivalent to paying off the principal by one additional payment a year there are two reasons to do so   the first is that the total interest will be lower and the loan will be paid off faster you can work out exactly how much with your new found skill at amortization computation    the second is the simple convenience of knowing that your budget for each pay period is the same   that convenience is worth something is it worth the amount extra you 'll be paying every year again this is for you to decide work out how much extra you 're paying per year and how much you 're saving in the long run and compare that against the benefit

it 's not a ponzi scheme and it does create value i think you are confusing creating value and producing something the stock market does create value but not in the same way as toyota creates value by making a car the stock market does not produce anything the main way money enters the stock market is through investors investing and taking money out    the only other cash flow is in through dividends and out when businesses go public     the stock market goes up only when more people invest in it although the stock market keeps tabs on businesses the profits of businesses do not actually flow into the stock market earnings are the in flow that you are missing here business profits do flow back into the stock market through earnings and dividends think about a private company if it has $ 100,000 in profits for the year then the company keeps $ 100,000 but if that same company is publicly traded with   100,000 shares outstanding then all else being equal each of those shares went up by $ 1 when you buy stock it is claimed that you own a small portion of the company this statement has no backing as you can not exchange your stock for the company 's assets you ca n't go to an apple store and try to pay with a stock certificate but that does n't mean the certificate does n't have value using your agriculture example you would n't be able to pay with a basket of tomatoes either you would n't even be able to pay with a lump of gold we used to do that it was called the barter system   companies also do buy shares back from the market using company cash although they usually do it through clearing houses that are capable of moving blocks of 1,000 shares at a time

from the times a reader on g.m. ’s bankruptcy q. i own g.m. preferred shares should i be looking to sell them or    hold on i bought them at $ 25 a share when they were issued in late    2001 manhattan a. when a company files for bankruptcy its various stock and    bondholders essentially get in line the first investors to be repaid    are secured debt holders then senior bond investors followed by    subordinated debt holders preferred shareholders are next and    lastly holders of common stock in a bankruptcy preferred shares are usually worthless much like    shares of common stock but in the case of g.m. there may be some    good or at least somewhat better news most of g.m. ’s preferred    shares are actually senior notes or quarterly interest bonds which    means you will be treated as a bondholder according to cohen    president of envision capital management so you will be able to    exchange your for g.m. stock bondholders will receive 10    percent of the new company ’s stock it ’s not the best deal but it    beats the empty bag true preferred shareholders would have been left    holding of course this is just one example and you were hoping to get some larger picture the article stated in a bankruptcy preferred shares are usually worthless much like shares of common stock which at least is a bit closer to that if you accept usually as a statistic

i am in nyc so my views on costs are certainly skewed but you 're also comparing apples and oranges here you are comparing a bowl of stew or a personal pizza bowl of pasta to a burger meal that 's a bit disingenuous   i am not arguing that five guys is the best value out there i 'm just saying the costs are justifiable in comparison to other burger options their product is at a much higher standard than traditional fast food joints

what would you consider good worthwhile and why it would give you satisfaction to benefit society i 've done various things that can be considered good worthwhile but the more i 'm around people the less i want to contribute anything to their well being and the more i want to out at them unfortunately getting substantial money generally requires interacting with people and showing up   i would enjoy such things as profiting off target gift cards if i knew about the promotion or if the idea occurred to me because it 's profit for relatively little effort the money that i 've worked hard for does n't mean that much to me because the cost was too high

i ’m sure you would n’t say that conflicts of interest are ok this is obviously one is your argument just that we do n’t have proof bezos explicitly ordered this article or we do n’t have proof that there is pressure direct or indirect on authors to write pro amazon stories pressure is new or old to be clear we will never ever have evidence that such things are occurring getting evidence for some of things is basically not possible so i do n’t think we should sit here and say well we do n’t have proof instead we should say this is an obvious conflict of interest and that should be seriously considered when evaluating the content of this article soft power is hard to prove

in the other question the op had posted a screenshot circa 2010 from transunion with suggestions on how to improve the op 's credit score   one of these suggestions was to obtain retail revolving accounts   by this they are referring to credit accounts from a particular retail store   stores have been offering credit accounts for many years and today this usually takes the form of a store credit card   the credit card does not have the visa or mastercard logo on it and is only valid at that particular store   for example target has their own credit card that only works at target stores   the revolving part simply means that it is an open account that you can continue to make new charges and pay off as opposed to a fixed retail financing loan such as you might get at a high end furniture store where you obtain a loan for a single piece of furniture and when it is paid off the account is closed the formula for credit scores are proprietary secrets   however i have n't read anything that indicates that a store credit card helps your credit score more than a standard credit card   i suspect that transunion was offering this tip in an attempt to give the consumer more ideas of how to add credit cards to their account that the consumer might not have thought of   but it is possible that buried deep in the credit score formula there is something in there that gives you a higher score if you have a store credit card as an aside the op in the other question had a credit score of and was trying to make it higher   in my opinion this is pointless   remember that the financial services industry has an incentive to sell you as much debt as possible and so all of their advice will point to you getting more credit accounts and getting more in debt

for stocks i would not see these as profiting at the expense of another individual   when you purchase trade stocks you are exchanging items of equal market value at the time of the trade both parties are getting a fair exchange when the transaction happens if you buy a house the seller has not profited at your expense you have exchanged goods at market prices if your house plummets in value and you lose $ 100k it is not the sellers fault that you made the decision to purchase the price was fair when you exchanged the goods future prices are speculative so both parties must perform due diligence to make sure the exchange aligns with their interests   obviously this is barring any sort of dishonesty or insider information on the part of either buyer or seller

you 're a partnership you should ask the money to be paid to the partnership you 'll have to fill partnership income tax return form 1065 and each of you will get a k-1 schedule with your own personal portion of the income for example you 're adam ben and you work together on a project and are being paid you get a check for $ 300 issued to adam ben and dba abc partnership you do n't have to have a dba it just makes it easier to show you as a single entity you then deposit the check to an account you set up for your partnership and from that account you transfer $ 100 to each of you year end you file form 1065 showing $ 300 income and attach k-1 for each of the partners showing $ 100 income that $ 100 income will flow to your individual tax returns the overhead here is setting up a partnership account potentially making a dba and filing the extra tax return that 's the proper way to do it especially if it is something you 're going to do regularly for a one time thing one of you can get paid report it as income on his her schedule c and issue 1099 to the rest of you for your parts and deduct the amount as his her expense here the overhead is schedule c for each of you instead of schedule e if handling it as a partnership extra 1099 forms instead of 1065 and and a risk of one partner defrauding the others depends on how much you trust each other with proper documentation each of these is equally legal and tax wise the costs are the same i.e. either way you pay the same taxes with partnership the overhead is a bit more expensive extra cost but in the long term it will make your life easier if you do this kind of thing regularly you may want to consider setting up your partnership as a llc llp depending on what your state allows but that would require state paperwork and potentially more fees

like kind of exchanges have a list of requirements the irs has not issued formal guidance in the matter i recommend to be aggressive and claim the exchange while justifying it with a good analogy to prove good faith and persuade the irs official reading it the risk of losing in tax court would be to high worst case the irs will attempt to reject the exchange at which point you could still pony up to get rid of the problem interest being the only real risk for example past tax court rulings have stated that collectable gold coins are not like kind to gold bars and unlike silver coins but investment grade gold coins are like kind to gold bars so you could use a justification like this i hold bitcoin to be like kind to litecoin because they use the same fundamental technology with just a tweak in the math as if exchanging different grades of gold bars which has been approved by tax court ruling note that it does n't matter whether any of this actually makes sense it just has be reasonable enough for you to believe and look like it is not worth pursuing to an overworked irs official at it i have n't tried this yet so up to now this is a guess but it 's a good enough guess in my estimation that i will be using it on some rather significant amounts next year

i 'm assuming you are buying bond mutual funds or bond etfs here not the actual bonds directly there are a significant variety of different types of bond funds reflecting the sort of bonds they invest in for example you can invest in risky non commercial grade bonds also known as junk bonds or you can invest in short term bonds which are much safer but return much less there 's no such thing as the average bond so let 's go for somewhere in the middle let 's go for 3 return after fees now it 's fairly simple math you want $ 3,000 a month or $ 36,000 a year to generate that sort of return you 'd need to invest $ if we are more optimistic we could go for a 4 return after fees that reduces your investment to $ 900,000 note that it would almost certainly not make sense to invest all that money in bonds instead you 'd want to invest in a mix of stocks and bonds this could likely reduce your risk while increasing your expected return

a insured high interest savings bank account is both safe and liquid i.e. you can withdraw your money at any time   at present time you could earn interest of per year if you shop around if you are willing to truly lock in for 2 years minimum rates go up slightly but perhaps not enough to warrant loss of liquidity look at gic rates to get an idea any other investments such as mutual funds stocks index funds etfs etc are generally not consistent with your stated risk objective and time frame better returns are generally only possible if you accept the risk of loss of capital or lock in for longer time periods

the literal answer to your question what determines the price of an etf is the market it is whatever price a buyer is willing to pay and a seller is willing to accept but if the market price of an etf share significantly from its nav the per share market value of the securities in its portfolio then an authorized participant can make an arbitrage profit by a transaction creation or redemption that pushes the market price toward nav thus as long as the markets are operating and the aps do n't vanish in a puff of smoke we can expect price will track nav that reduces your question to why does nav = market value of the holdings underlying a bond etf share decrease when the market interest rate rises   let 's consider an example i 'll use us treasuries because they have very active markets are treated as risk free although that can be debated and excluding special cases like tips and strips are almost perfectly fungible and i use round numbers for convenience let 's assume the current market interest rate is 2 and 10-year treasury fund opens for business with $ 100 m invested via aps in 10-year t notes with 2 coupon at par and 1 m shares issued that are worth $ 100 each now assume the interest rate goes up to 3 this is an example not a prediction no one wants to pay par for a 2 bond when they can get 3 elsewhere so its value goes down to about 0.9 of par not exactly due to the way the arithmetic works but close enough and shares similarly slide to $ 90 at this price an investor gets slightly over 2 basis plus approximately 1 amortized capital gain slightly less due to time value per year so it 's competitive with a 3 coupon at par   as you say new bonds are available that pay 3 but our fund does n't hold them we hold old bonds with a face value of $ 100 m but a market value of only $ 90 m if we sell those bonds now and buy 3 bonds to try to replace them we only get $ 90 m par value of 3 bonds so now our fund is paying a competitive 3 but nav is still only $ 90   at the other extreme say we hold the 2 bonds to maturity paying out only 2 interest but letting our nav increase as the remaining term duration and thus discount of the bonds decreases assuming the market interest rate does n't change again which for 10 years is probably unrealistic ignoring 2009 2016 at the end of 10 years the 2 bonds are redeemed at par and our nav is back to $ 100 but from the investor 's point of view they 've forgone $ 10 in interest they could have received from an alternative investment over those 10 years which is effectively an additional investment so the original share price of $ 90 was correct

start with the tax delta for example you 'd hope to deposit at 25 bracket but take withdrawals while at a marginal 15 in this case you 're 10 to the good with the 401(k and need to look at the fee eating away at this over time pay an extra and after 10 years you 're losing money that 's too simple however along the way you need to consider that the capital gain rate is lower than ordinary income it 's easier to take those gains as you wish to time them where the 401(k offers no flexibly for this even with low fees this account is going to turn long term gains to ordinary income note in 2013 a couple with up to $ in taxable income has a 0 long term cap gain rate so if they wish they can sell and buy back a fund claim the gain and raise their cost basis a tiny effort for the avoidance of tax on the gains each year first paragraph do n't forget there are the standard deduction exemption and 10 bracket while you are in the range to save enough to create he income to fill the low end at withdrawal there 's more value than just the 10 i discussed earlier   last there 's a phenomenon i call the phantom tax rate zone when one 's retirement withdrawals trigger the taxation of social security   it further complicates the math and analysis you seek

regarding some major holes in the atlantic article   one mining became the norm underground rather than advance retreat mining it massively advanced the productive output of the industry and required far less workforce this was the central cause of the drop to the coal industry workforce before the 1990s thereafter a of prices competition attacks on the working class unions of new energy sources etc and other factors were the mixture which reduced the workforce    two strip mining and type coal lower workforce necessary in the western coal region also played a role rather than the demands of underground mining mostly but also type coal concentrated in the east higher workforce necessary key to remember that this move from eastern to western coal production while reducing the workforce was a major drive by the coal bosses in the 90s through the 2000s a major aspect was that this was a campaign by the owners bosses seeking to side step the and unions labor costs health dental the eastern mines were union but out west the union movement in the coal industry unfortunately never had broad modern success moments of greatness occurred in the western organizing battles some great nation some good locals in colorado too a few ut battles one in particular which was lead by miners who were originally from mexico but no where near like east of the mississippi    anyone who worked or even lived near the industry lived in or western coal could have told the young atlantic author or the stanford institute fellow just about all of this driving around rural west virginia pa or kentucky you can occasionally see the old advance retreat joy miner machinery the old timers often times are glad to share heaps of the proud labor history of the region and this industry much easier to make a buck via the atlantic by reading a couple academic reports check department of energy and bls statistical websites

traders sometimes look at the depth of the book number of outstanding limit orders to try and gauge the sentiment of the market or otherwise use this information to formulate their strategy   if there was a large outstanding buy order at $ there 's a decent chance this could increase the price by influencing other traders however a limit order at $ 2 is like an amazon.com price of $ 200,000 for a book   it 's so far away from realistic that it is ignored   people would think it is an error submitting this type of order is perfectly legal   if the stock is extremely thinly traded it might even be encouraged because if someone wanted to sell a bunch and did a really bad job of it the price could conceivably fall that far and the limit order would be adding liquidity   i guess   your example is pretty extreme it is not uncommon for there to be limit orders on the book that are not very close to the trading price   they just sit around   the majority of trades are done by algorithmic traders and institutional traders and they do n't tend to do this but a retail investor may choose to submit an order like that just hoping against hope also buy orders are not likely to push prices down no matter what their price is   a sell order yes even if it is n't executed

rebalancing has been studied empirically quite a bit but not particularly carefully and actually turns out to be very hard to study well   the main problem is that you do n't know until afterward if your target weights were optimal so a bad rebalancing program might give better performance if it closer to optimal weights even if it did n't do an efficient job of keeping near the target weights in your particular case either method might be preferred depending on a number of things you can see why there is n't a generally correct answer to your question and the results of empirical studies might very wildly depending on the mix of assets and risk tolerance   still if your portfolio is not too complicated you can estimate the costs of the two methods without too much trouble and figure out if it is worthwhile to you edit in response to comment below your example gets at what makes rebalancing so hard empirically but also generally pretty easy in practice   if you were to target 75 equity 25 bonds and look at returns only for 30 years the best rebalancing method would be to never rebalance and just let 75 equity go to near 100 as equity has better long term returns   this happens when you look only at returns as the final number and do n't take into account the change in risk in your portfolio in practice most people that are still adding or subtracting in retirement to a retirement portfolio are adding removing a significant amount compared to the total amount in their portfolio   in the case you it is cheaper massively cheaper in the presence of load fees just to use new capital to trade toward your target keeping your risk profile   new money should be large enough to keep you near enough your target   if you just estimate the trading costs fees in both cases i think you 'll see just how large the difference is between the two methods this will dwarf any small differences in return over the long run even if you ca n't trade back all the way to your target

first determine the workload he will expect   will you have to quit your other work either for time or for competition   how much of your current business will be into his business if any   make sure to understand what he wants from you   if you make an agreement set it in writing and set some clear expectations about what will happen to your business e.g. it continues and is not part of your association with the client   because he was a client for your current business it can blur the lines second if you join him make sure there is a business entity   by working together for profit you will have already formed a partnership for tax purposes   best to get an entity both for the legal protection and also for the clarity of law and accounting   llcs are simplest for small ventures c corps are useful if you have lots of early losses and owners that ca n't use them personally or if you want to be properly formed for easy consumption by a strategic   most vcs and super angels prefer everybody be a straight c.   again remember to define as necessary what you are contributing to be an owner and what you are retaining your original business which for simplicity may already be in an entity   as part of this process make sure he defines the cap table and any outstanding loans   june and cousin steve might think their gifts to him were loans or equity purchases best to clear this issue up early before there 's any more money in it third with regard to price that is an intensely variable question   it matters what the cap table looks like how early you are how much work he 's already done how much work remains to be done and how much it will pay off   also if you do it expect to be diluted by other employees angels vcs other investors and so on   luckily more investors usually indicates a growing pie so the dilution may not be at all painful   but it should still be on your horizon   you also need to consider your faith in your prospective partner 's ability to run the business and to be a trustworthy partner so you do n't get and to market the business and the product to customers and investors if you do n't like the prospects then opt for cash   if you like the business but want to hedge ask for compensation plus equity   there are other tricks you could use to get out early like forced redemption but they probably would n't help either because it 'd sour your relationship or the first vc or knowledgeable angel to come along will want you to that sort of right it probably comes down to a basic question of your need for cash his willingness to let you pursue outside work hopefully high and your appraisal of the business prospects

the 3 and 9 figures are based on the cost of borrowing money and all the other ownership costs associated with real estate   from the same article because it 's usually still much cheaper to rent than to own the same    size and quality house in the same school district in rich    neighborhoods annual rents are typically only 3 of purchase price    while mortgage rates are 4 with fees so it costs more to borrow the    money as it does to borrow the house renters win and owners lose    worse total owner costs including taxes maintenance and insurance    come to about 8 of purchase price which is more than twice the cost    of renting and wipes out any income tax benefit imagine you are renting a house if the cost of your annual rent is lower than x then renting is obviously the best idea from a monetary calculation if rent is greater than y being a landlord makes more sense in the middle it is debatable and the non monetary reasons need to be considered

historical volatility of a stock is going to be based on past performance basically its current trend   that can be useful but really is no indication of how it will perform in the future   especially with a big swing in the market now if you 're talking about implied volatility iv of an options contract that 's a little different   iv is derived from an option ’s price and shows what the market implies about the stock ’s volatility in the future thus it is based on the actions of active traders and market makers   so it gives you a bit more insight into what 's going on but at times has less to do with fundamentals i guess a good way to think of iv based on options contracts is as an educated opinion of the market as a whole with regards to how much that stock could likely move over a period of time options expiration also note that iv represents the potential for a stock to move but it does not forecast direction i do n't know of any studies off the top of my head but i 'm sure there have been plenty

i dislike this argument that government pressure to make bad loans is the origin of subprime loans    in fact the term subprime is because those type of loans ca n't be underwritten by the government   usually the concept of government forcing bad loans is government forcing banks to give minorities and low income people loans for their first houses    the government requires w-2 income and a base credit score to procure these loans   at the peak of the bubble the majority of home sales were for investment purposes not homeownership purposes    those who declared the housing market was wildly unstable and who were proven right were talking about the problem of mortgage brokers being incentivized to lie about a person not being qualified for prime government loans in order to make more money by putting them in lucrative subprime loans or simply advising them they were better off in subprime and could get cash out up front   also liar no doc loans were booming and speculators and house flippers were getting multiple properties in order to flip them for profit   once upon a time these speculators would make sure they could rent out the house for the carrying costs if they needed to   0 down 0 interest meant a whole different ballgame     ah but maybe these speculators would n't have anyone to sell to if low income people could n't get prime loans from the gov   all evidence points to them selling to other speculators until there was no fool left to hold the bag   see miami las vegas etc   edit   i forget that the argument has from fannie to the end of to the cra and now to changes made to the cra where the argument finally gains a bit of traction gt law professor michael s. a treasury department official under president stated that approximately 50 of subprime loans were made by independent mortgage companies that were not regulated by the cra and another 25 to 30 came from only partially cra regulated bank subsidiaries and affiliates noted that institutions fully regulated by cra made perhaps one in four sub prime loans and that the worst and most widespread abuses occurred in the institutions with the least federal oversight   further the discussion into whether the idea and enthusiasm of the rest started as a seed from the regulated banks how much removing risk by wall street with non government backed home loans through credit instruments had its origination in the cra and how much of the failure of ratings agencies to properly rate those credit instruments has to do with the us government and the cra and not regular wall street   so originally i stated no relationship but yes once you get into the complexity of it all i 'm sure we could find a way to say a global mania in speculation in real estate is due to the american government getting poor people into their first home and generally has nothing to do with the human condition of wanting something for nothing and getting excited when the government allows you to sell blue sky returns to foolish speculators

it would be good to know which country you are in you are basically on the right track with your last point usually when you buy your first property you need to come up with a deposit and then borrow the remainder to have enough to purchase the property in most cases and most places the standard percentage of loan to deposit is 80 to 20 this is expressed as the loan to value ratio lvr which in this case would be 80 this being the amount of the loan to the value of the property some banks and lenders will lend you more than the 80 but this can usually come with extra costs in australia the banks charge an extra percentage when you borrow called loan mortgage insurance if you borrow over 80 and the gets more expensive the higher lvr you borrow also this practice of lending more than 80 lvr has been tightened up since the gfc so if you are borrowing 80 of the value of the property you will need to come up with the remainder 20 deposit plus the additional closing costs taxes in australia we have to pay stamp duty solicitor or fees loan application fees building and pest inspection costs etc if you then want to buy a second property you will need to come up with the same deposit and other closing costs again most people can not afford to do this any time soon especially since the a good majority of the money they used to save before is now going to pay the mortgage and upkeep of your first property especially if you used to say live with your parents and now live in the property and not rent it out so what a lot of people do who want to buy more properties is wait until the lvr of the property has dropped to say below 60 this is achieved by the value of the property going up in value and the mortgage principle being reduced by your mortgage payments once you have enough as you say collateral or equity in the first property then you can refinance your mortgage and use this equity in your existing property and the value of the new property you want to buy to basically borrow 100 of the value of the new property plus closing costs as long as the lvr of the total borrowings versus the value of both properties remains at or below 80 this should be achievable you can do this in two ways firstly you could refinance your first mortgage and borrow up to 80 lvr again and use this additional funds as your deposit and closing costs for the second property for which you would then get a second mortgage the second way is to refinance one mortgage over the two properties the first method is preferred as your mortgages and properties are separated so if something does go wrong you do n't have to sell everything up all at once this process can be quite slow at the start as you might have to wait a few years to build up equity in one property especially if you live in it but as you accumulate more and more properties it becomes easier and quicker to do as your equity will increase quicker with tenants paying a good portion of your costs if not all if you are positively geared of course you do want to be careful if property prices fall as this may drastically reduce your equity and increase your total lvr or the lvr on individual properties and have a safety net for example i try to keep my lvr to 60 or below currently they are below 50

the barrier to entry is extremely high in the isp world you either have to piggyback on an existing isp and their lines or you lay your own obviously google is going with the latter which is a huge undertaking that not only involves the work to actually lay the fiber but also get regulatory approval and the funds to do so they have the resources to do this but only when the cities cooperate and work with them then there 's the work involved with setting up all of the networking infrastructure to actually route customer traffic set up agreements etc basically there are two kinds of entities that can do all this existing isps who obviously want to maintain the status quo and companies with lots of influence and money and technical resources you wo n't find a startup doing what google is doing at least not without some big players backing them

i appreciate your taking the time to shoot some holes in this oft repeated statistic   however i do disagree on some points   gt nor is there anything wrong with the person then ending that business and moving on to another different name different field business or taking a job with some company   there may not be anything shameful about doing that but that scenario is indeed a business failure   people do not shutter a profitable successful business and then go to work for someone else   i believe a key contributor to the confusion is talking about the self employed and business owners in the same breath   someone who 's self employed basically owns a job   his income will always be directly proportional to the amount of time spent working and the company does not exist apart from himself     a business owner on the other hand has processes equipment staff ip in place that generates income whether or not she gets out of bed in the morning   these are different people with different goals and can not be lumped into the same demographic block

in some cases it might be rational to pay low interest debt first because the consequences of defaulting on that debt are worse    consider this simplified example   suppose you have two debts a low interest mortgage secured by your house and a high interest unsecured credit card debt both of which are within a few years of being paid off   there is a chance that sometime between now and then something will happen to disrupt your income e.g. medical problems and it wo n't be possible to make the payments on either loan    defaulting on the credit card loan will result in a lower credit score and calls from collection agencies   defaulting on the mortgage will result in the foreclosure or forced sale of your house at best forcing you to move and at worst leaving you homeless at a time when you are also facing other e.g. medical problems   so you might rationally judge that losing your house is much worse than bad credit   therefore you might rationally conclude that it would be better to direct extra income toward paying down the mortgage to increase the chances that if and when an income disruption might occur the mortgage would already be paid off   in other words you shorten the window of time where income disruption results in foreclosure you might decide that this increased security is worth the extra interest you will pay compared to the strategy where you pay the high interest loan first this is a fairly special situation but you asked why might it be a good idea to do this and i am just giving an example where it could rationally be considered a good idea    of course in a real life version of this example there might be other options available such as refinancing the mortgage   if you like you could imagine a more extreme example where the lower interest debt is owed to the who will come and break your if you miss a payment

i concur with the other answers about not mixing family and money the one whose loans are paid off second will be taking the credit risk of the other not paying being able to pay there may also be tax implications that said if you do still want to do this i think there 's a fairly straightforward way to account for the payments with your scenario your brother should make you a personal loan at some interest rate 5 and 10 that loan would be tracked independently of the actual student loans any money that your brother transfers to you to pay off your loans add to that personal loan and later on once your loans are paid off you start repaying the loan to him and he uses the proceeds for his own loans the interest rate will determine how the benefit of paying off the 10 loans is shared if the rate is set at 10 then your brother will get all the benefit if 5 you will get all the benefit and 7.5 would roughly share it out this means that you can still manage your own student loans separately your brother can choose how little or much to commit to the snowball rather than his own loans of course he should first make the minimum payments on his own loans anything he does loan you benefits you both if we ignore the credit and tax issues he gets more than the 5 interest on his own loans and you pay less than the 10 interest on your loans you 'll need to track the payments each way on this personal loan and apply interest to it every so often i 'd suggest monthly beware that the monthly equivalent of 5 annual interest is not because of compounding

never thought about the difference in goals between manufacturers and local businesses   ultimately they have the same goals sale of product services   but they have a hugely different emphasis   john deere wants you to buy john deere brand products and they really do n't care where you buy it   walmart target generally do n't really give a crap what brand you buy so long as you buy it from walmart target   so john deere 's advertising is all about convincing you to only be interested in buying a john deere from where ever   and the retailer aka local business whether a chain or independent advertising is all about getting you to come back to their store to buy well whatever which can be specific or anything and everything they sell   those things can coincide when there is some exclusive relationship so the local john deere dealer is interested in promoting the john deere brand but really only to the extent that you buy a john deere from them and not from some other dealer store   and likewise the local buick dealer wants you to buy a buick but chiefly so that you will buy one from them and/or so that you will come to them to buy parts service which most dealers actually tend to make more money on than they do from the sale of the car itself     your knowledge about the facebook ad model might be able to help me with a personal project i 'm doing    i do n't know that it i would call it knowledge about the facebook ad model it 's more general knowledge about how the advertising marketing world and speculation with back of the napkin style calculations regarding about how far away from reality facebook 's supposed super specific targeting actually is     gt;if you care to take a whack at it read on what interested me before the ipo was the debate about the value of fb 's ad model   this is was kind of my whole point though i 'm coming from a different tack than you my view is that regardless of how effective ineffective fb 's ads prove to be   1 there is only so much commerce in the world granted it can grow but it does so on an incremental basis in real money terms   2 only a certain percentage of it is going to be spent on advertising   3 a lot of that probably 50 or more is local advertising marketing done not by the big players but by smaller more local operations   4 there is no way that facebook will capture anywhere near even 50 of even the big player advertising marketing money competing against all other types of media yeah not gon na happen and they are n't even trying to get any of the local money   5 as a result of the above there is no way for facebook to achieve the revenues much less the profit margins to support anything anywhere near the valuation it at   6 ergo the price of the stock will continue to drop especially as insiders amp previous investors cash in by selling additional stock into the float until it reaches a price that can be supported by a reasonable p e say in the 10 to 20 range that is based on actual achievable revenues which i do n't see any way for the final value of fb to be anything over $ 10 a share more likely the will end up in the $ 4 to $ 5 range and possibly even lower especially if they continue to things as they have recently ultimately especially if they dilute the shares as they seem likely to it will probably end up as a $ 1 to $ 2 stock   as to your questions i think we 're barking up different trees your approach sounds interesting but i would n't have any idea where you could get hard data on any of that at best you i think whatever data you can lay hands on is going to be a lot of highly dubious and speculative bs in no small part because i do n't think anyone really has any harder data maybe gm does and that is why they dropped their use of the stuff

options reflect expectations about the underlying asset and options are commonly priced using the black scholes model   and are probability functions s is the spot current price of the asset k is the strike price r is the risk free rate and t t represents time to maturity   without getting into the mathematics it to say that higher volatility or expectation of volatility increases the perceived riskiness of the asset so call options are priced lower   and put options are priced higher think about it intuitively if the stock is more likely to go downwards then there 's an increased chance that the call option expires worthless so call options must be priced lower to accommodate the relative change in expected value of the option   puts are priced similarly but they move inversely with respect to call option prices due to put call parity so if call option prices are falling then put option prices are rising note however that call prices falling does not cause put prices to rise the inverse relationship exists because of changes in the underlying factors and how pricing works so the option action signifies that the market believes the stock is headed lower in the given time frame that does not mean it will go lower and option traders assume risk whenever they take a particular position bottom line got ta do your own homework best of luck

sales taxes are charged at the point of purchase while a vat is assessed during the production process of the item in the end the amount paid by the consumer is the same but with the vat the tax was collected from the manufacturer instead of the consumer one of the big arguments for vat is that it prevents lost revenue due to things like smuggling if sales tax increases past 10 smuggling spikes so the vat is a good mechanism if you 're looking to implement large taxes on goods it also keeps the tax burden away from and other tiers of the production process that do n't change the intrinsic value of the item

setting up an entity that is partially foreign owned is not that difficult it takes an additional 1 1.5 months in total and in this particular case you guys would be formed as a joint venture it will cost a bit more about 3 5000 if you 're serious about owning a part of a business in china you should carefully examine what he means by more complicated from my point of view i have set up my own in china and examined the possibilities of a and even considered using a friend to set up the company under their personal name as a domestic company which is what your supervisor is doing any difference between the three are not really a big deal anymore and comes down to the competency of the agencies you are using and the business partner themselves    it cost me 11,000 for a including the agency and government registration fees only chinese speaking   you should also consider the other shareholders who may be part of this venture as well if there are other shareholders and you are not providing further tangible contribution you will end up replaced and unless of course you trust them too because they are actually paying money to be part of the business and you are not they will not part with equity for you   i 'm not a lawyer but think you should not rely on any promises other than what it says on a company registration paper good luck

i did n't mean to imply that bankruptcy is a magical process i was using that to clarify my use of conservative vs. aggressive to be fair i guess it can vary depending on your perspective if you 're taking the perspective of the debt laden company then yes on the side of a higher value could be defined as aggressive if you 're taking the perspective of someone looking to acquire business i would say on the side of a higher value is conservative    if the debt is trading at say $ 0.20 on the dollar then yes i can agree that the market value of the debt is likely more representative of the book value i guess i was n't thinking of that type of extreme example a more common scenario i 'd encounter would be a the debt trading at maybe $ 0.95 on the dollar and b taking the perspective of someone looking to invest in the equity which is why i 'd say that it 's more conservative to use the higher value which is the book value   so i 'm persuaded that using market value of the debt can make sense in some cases but i would still argue that the book value might make more sense in other cases

zero ten grand somewhere in the middle it depends your stated salary in u.s. dollars would be high five figures you certainly should not be starving but with decent contributions toward savings and retirement money can indeed be tight month to month at that salary level especially since even in you 're probably paying more per square foot for your home than in most u.s. markets edit actually apartments in according to range from £ 750 850 which is us$ and for that many bedrooms you 'd be hard pressed to find that kind of deal in a good neighborhood of the dfw metro and good luck getting anywhere close to downtown new york la miami chicago etc for that price what job do you do and how are you expected to dress for it depending on where you shop and what you buy a quality dress shirt and dress will cost between us$ each assuming real costs are similar for the same brands between us and uk that 's £ per shirt and pair of pants for quality brands i maintain about a weeks wardrobe at this level of dress my job allows me to wear much cheaper and most days and i have about 2 weeks wardrobe of those and i typically have to replace due to wear or on average 2 of these outfits a year i 'm hard on clothes and my is expanding adding in 3 business casual outfits each year plus casual outfits shoes socks and call it maybe $ in wardrobe that does n't generally get out as a monthly allowance the monthly amount would barely buy a single dress shirt or pair of but if you 're socking away a savings account and buying new clothes to replace old as you can afford them it 's a good average i generally splurge in months when the utilities companies give me a break and when i get extra paychecks means two months have 3 checks effectively giving me a free check that neither pays the mortgage nor the other major bills now that 's just to maintain my own wardrobe at a level of dress that wo n't get me fired my wife currently stays home but when she worked she me and her work clothes were basic black to outright replace all the clothes i wear regularly with brand new stuff off the rack would easily cost a grand and that 's for the average u.s. software dev who does n't go out and meet other business types on a daily basis if i needed to show up for work in a suit and tie daily i 'd need a two week rotation of them plus dress shirts and even at the low end of about $ 350 £ 225 per suit $ 400 £ 275 with dress shirt and tie for something you wo n't be embarrassed to wear we 're talking $ 4000 £ 2600 to replace and $ 800 £ 520 per year to update 2 a year not counting what i wear underneath or on the weekends and if i wore suits i 'd probably have to update the styles more often than that so just go ahead and double it and i turn over my wardrobe once every 5 years none of this includes laundering costs which increase sharply when you 're taking suits to the cleaners weekly versus just throwing a bunch of cotton in the washing machine what hobbies or other entertainment interests do you and your wife have a movie ticket in the u.s. varies between $ depending on the size of the screen and vs 3d my wife and i currently average less than one theater visit a month but if you took in a each weekend with your wife with a decent $ 50 dinner out that 's between $ £ 165 270 monthly in entertainment expenses not counting babysitting for the little one the going rate in the us is between $ 10 and $ 20 an hour for at home child sitting depending on who you hire and for how long how often worst case without babysitting that 's less than 5 of your gross income but possibly more than 10 of your take home depending on uk effective income tax rates your marginal rate is 40 according to the hmrc unless you find a way to deduct about £ 30k of your income that 's just the traditional american date night which is just one possible interest playing organized sports is more or less expensive depending on the sport soccer sorry football just needs a well kept field two goals and and a ball golf while not really needing much more when you say it that way can cost thousands of dollars or pounds a month to play with the best equipment at the best courses hockey requires head to toe padding sticks and ice time american football typically is n't an amateur sport for adults and has virtually no audience in europe but in the right places in the u.s. beginning in just a couple years you 'd be your son out head to toe not dissimilar to hockey minus sticks and at a similar cost and would keep that up at least halfway through high school i 've played them all at varying amateur levels and with the possible exception of soccer they all get expensive when you really get interested in them how much do you eat and of what my family of three 's monthly grocery budget is about $ 300-$400 £ depending on what we buy and how we buy it americans have big often more than one there 's three in my house of varying sizes we buy in bulk as needed every week to two weeks we or freeze a lot of what we buy and we eat and drink a lot of high corn syrup based crap that 's excise taxed into non existence in most other countries i do n't have real world experience living and grocery shopping in europe but i do know that most shopping is done more often in smaller quantities and for more real food you might expect to spend £ 325 $ 500 or more monthly in fits and starts every few days but as i said you 'd probably know better than me what you 're buying and what it 's costing to educate myself i went to which has what i assume are typical uk food prices mostly from tesco and it 's a real eye opener in the u.s. alcohol is much more expensive for equal volume than almost any other drink except designer coffee and energy drinks and we the heck out of everything anyway so a low budget food approach in the u.s. generally means beer and wine in favor of milk fruit juices sodas and kool aid or just plain ol' tap water a quick search on shows that wine prices average a little cheaper accounting for the exchange rate as in the states that varies widely even in the u.s. as local and state taxes for beer wine and spirits all differ beer is similarly slightly cheaper across the board especially for brands local to the british and even the coors lite crap we 're apparently shipping over to you is more expensive here than there but in contrast milk by the gallon seems to be virtually unheard of in the uk and your half are just a few pence cheaper than our going rate for a gallon unless you buy organic in the us which carries about a 100 markup juices are also about double the price depending on what you 're buying a of innocent oj roughly equivalent in presentation to the u.s. brand simply orange is £ 3 while simply orange is about the same price in usd for 2 and u.s brand drinks are similarly at a premium £ over $ 3 for a bottle of coca cola with the general preference for room temperature alcohol in europe giving a big advantage to the longer shelf lives of beer and wine i 'm going to guess you guys drink more alcohol and water with dinner than americans beef is cheaper in the u.s. depending on where you are and what you 're buying prices for store brand ground beef you guys call it of the grade we 'd use for hamburgers and is about £ 6 per kilo in the uk which works out to about $ when we 're paying closer to $ in most cities i actually ca n't remember the last time i bought fresh chicken on the bone but the average price i 'm seeing in the uk is £ $ which sounds pretty steep anyway it sounds like shopping for american tastes in the uk would cost on average between 25 30 more than here in the us so applying that to my own family 's food budget you could easily justify spending £ a month on

you have a couple of options auto investing in an open end mutual fund   some companies may waive a minimum if you sign up for an automatic investing e.g. t. rowe price will waive its minimum if you agree to invest $ 100/month   there may be some lower ones out there as well some brokers like sharebuilder have programs where someone could auto invest getting fractional shares with each purchase   however something to consider is what percentage is it costing you to buy each time as it may be quite a bit of friction if you are paying $ 4 a purchase and only buying $ 40 this is 10 of your investment being eaten up in costs that i 'd highly advise taking the first option

first of all bear in mind that there 's no such thing as a risk free investment if you keep your money in the bank you 'll struggle to get a return that keeps up with inflation the same is true for other safe investments like government bonds gold and silver are essentially completely speculative investments over the years their price tends to vary quite wildly so unless you really understand how those markets work you should steer well clear they 're certainly not low risk repeatedly buying a property to sell in a couple of years time is almost certainly a bad idea you 'll end up paying substantial transaction fees each time that would wipe out a lot of the possible profit and of course there 's always the risk that prices would go down not up buying a property to keep and preferably live in might be a decent option once you have a good deposit saved up it 's very hard to say where prices will go in future on the one hand london prices are very high by historical standards but on the other hand supply is likely to remain severely constrained for years to come i tend to think of a house as something that i need one of for the rest of my life and so in one sense not owning a house to live in is a gamble that house prices and rents wo n't go up substantially if you own a house you 're insulated from changes in rent etc and even if prices crash at least you still have somewhere to live however that argument only works really well if you expect to keep living in the same area under most circumstances house prices might crash in your area but not elsewhere

the default scenario that we 're talking about in the summer of 2011 is a discretionary situation where the government refuses to borrow money over a certain level and thus becomes insolvent that 's an important distinction because the us has the best credit in the world and still carries enormous borrowing power so much so that the massive increases in borrowing over the last decade of war and have not affected the nation 's ability to borrow additional money from a personal finance point of view my guess is that after the drop dead date disclosed by the treasury you 'd have a period of chaos and increasing liquidity issues after government runs out of gimmicks like borrowing from various internal accounts and selling assets to government authorities   i do n't think the markets believe that the democrats and republicans are really willing to destroy the country if they are the market does n't like surprises

nobody can give you a definitive answer   to those who suggest it 's expensive at these prices i 'd point to this showing the price of gold versus the global money supply over the past decade or so   it 's not conclusive but it 's evidence that gold tracks the money supply relatively well   there might be a bit of risk premium baked in that it would shed in a stable economy but that premium is unknowable   it 's also imo probably worth the protection it provides   in an inflationary scenario euro devaluation gold will hold its buying power very well   it also fares well in a deflationary environment just not quite as well as holding physical currency   note that in such an environment bank defaults are a big danger that 50k might only be safe under your mattress rather than in a fractionally reserved bank account   if you 're buying gold certificates are n't exactly a bad option although there still exists the counterparty risk of the agent storing your gold as well as political risk of the nation where it 's being held   buying physical bullion these risks but then you face the problem of protecting it   safe deposit boxes a home safe or burying it in your backyard are all possible options   the merits of each i 'll leave as an to the reader   foreign currency might be a little bit better than the euro but as we 've seen in the past year or so the swiss franc has been devalued to match the euro in the proverbial race to the bottom   it 's probably not much better than another fiat currency   i do n't know anything about norway   edit depending on your time horizon my personal opinion would be to put no less than 5 10 of your savings in a hard store of value e.g. gold silver platinum   depending on your risk appetite you could probably stand to put a lot more into it especially given the eurozone turmoil   of course as with anything else your mileage may vary past performance does not guarantee future results this is not investment advice seek professional medical help if you experience an lasting longer than four hours

so if i understand the investment program here you have $ 100 of tax withheld from your salary at the end of jan feb mar until december   this withholding is in excess of the expected tax for the year you use the appropriate h&r block product to file your taxes and h&r block gets your refund of $ 1200 on march 1st   h&r block adds 10 and give you e cards for $ on the face of it this represents a return of per year compounded monthly however there are a few wrinkles that might make the scheme less inviting you 'll get a receipt for miscellaneous income from h&r block and pay tax on the earnings the quoted return is only realized if you can use the e cards immediately   if they sit around for a while then they are n't earning any interest   if you sell them for cash at a discount if you even can   then this reduces the return   if you do n't cash them at all they 're a total loss this offer was announced on jan 15 2015   so you ca n't go back and put it in place for 2014   and if you set it up for withholding in 2015 is there any guarantee that it the same offer will be in place when filing in 2016

i would question whether your stated goal of strictly controlling your expenses is really the problem you should be tackling   in my opinion unless you 're under financial hardship where you can barely make ends meet you 're much better off using a budget as a high level descriptive tool rather than a low level tool this is what i would do in your situation after the first few months you can start to think about high level changes that you can make to your spending habits to get the most bang for your buck   i would n't worry about the little expenses unless they 're really adding up to a sizable chunk of your total expenses   instead i would look at things like eating out too often buying too many movies too many impulse buys over $ 100 etc identifying patterns like that will help you make lifestyle changes that will allow you to spend less money without having to micromanage every single expense   i have tried the micromanaged approach in the past and it simply does n't work for me   there 's too much overhead and eventually i start to feel that it 's just not worth it   think about it is it really worth the extra time and energy required to worry about where every dollar goes all month long just to save an additional hundred bucks over what you can do with this passive approach    i think that by focusing on the big picture you can get within a couple percentage points of the same amount of savings as if you had micro managed your expenses but with much less work and mental strain let 's put some numbers on this and see what the hourly returns are with each approach always being optimistic about the micromanaged approach and conservative on the passive approach    let 's assume you earn $   let 's also assume that if you micromanage all of your expenses you could manage to save $ beyond what you do now   and let 's say that with the passive approach you can get within 20 percentage points instead of the 2 i stated earlier for a savings of $   now what will your hourly returns look like   the following are based on how i would personally use both systems so your numbers may vary a bit micromanaged budgeting savings = $ 5000 per year = $ per month   time spent = 15 30 minutes per day = 7.5 15 hours per month   hourly return = $ $   passive budgeting savings = $ 4000 per year = $ per month   time spent = 1 2 hours per month hourly return = $ $ so clearly the passive approach gives a substantially higher hourly return even though it gives a lower absolute return   maybe more importantly though if passive budgeting opens up an extra 10 hours a month you could potentially put those hours into your job and make an extra 10 hours $ = $ 250 a month or $ 3000 per year assuming no extra pay for overtime   so that means that the passive budgeting approach would actually allow you to save $ 4000 + $ 3000 .75 = $ per year compared to the $ 5000 you would save by micromanaging if you 're in a situation where you ca n't put those hours into more work and you really need that extra $ per month to help make ends meet then by all means micromanage your expenses and try to save as much as possible   but if either of the previous conditions are not true for you you 're much better off in my opinion using a passive budget

your goal of wanting to eliminate your debts early is great generally you can save more money by paying off loans with higher interest rates first however it sounds like you are excited about the idea of eliminating one of your car loans in two months   there is nothing wrong with that it is good to be excited about eliminating debt   i like your plan pay off the $ loan first then apply the $ monthly payment to the $ loan   you 'll have that loan paid off almost 3 years early   perhaps you 'll find some additional money to apply to it and get rid of it even earlier after you 've eliminated both car loans save up that $ 1000/month for your next car   that will allow you to pay cash for it which will allow you to negotiate the best price and save interest   0 loans are not free money other answers will tell you to wait as long as possible to pay off your 0 loan but i think there can be good reasons to eliminate smaller loans first regardless of interest

your argument is biased vastly in favor of the banks   does n't the simultaneous growth of the residential and commercial real estate pricing bubbles undermines the case made by yourself that fannie and freddie were at the root of the problem   why does your explanation also leave out predatory lending or that during 2006 22 of homes purchased 1.65 million units were for investment purposes with an additional 14 1.07 million units purchased as vacation homes during 2005 these figures were 28 and 12 respectively in other words a record level of nearly 40 of homes purchased were not intended as primary residences    or that housing prices nearly doubled between 2000 and 2006 a vastly different trend from the historical appreciation at roughly the rate of inflation   or that the proportion of subprime arm loans made to people with credit scores high enough to qualify for conventional mortgages with better terms increased from 41 in 2000 to 61 by 2006    from wikipedia so why did lending standards decline in a award winning program npr argued that a giant pool of money represented by $ 70 trillion in worldwide fixed income investments sought higher yields than those offered by u.s. treasury bonds early in the decade further this pool of money had roughly doubled in size from 2000 to 2007 yet the supply of relatively safe income generating investments had not grown as fast investment banks on wall street answered this demand with financial innovation such as the mortgage backed security mbs and collateralized debt obligation cdo which were assigned safe ratings by the credit rating agencies in effect wall street connected this pool of money to the mortgage market in the u.s. with enormous fees accruing to those throughout the mortgage supply chain from the mortgage broker selling the loans to small banks that funded the brokers to the giant investment banks behind them by approximately 2003 the supply of mortgages originated at traditional lending standards had been exhausted however continued strong demand for mbs and cdo began to drive down lending standards as long as mortgages could still be sold along the supply chain eventually this speculative bubble proved unsustainable

it 's very simple the whole purpose of a credit card for the credit card company is that you borrow money and then pay them interest for the rest of your life the way you describe yourself you are the perfect victim so the obvious thing for you to do is to not touch credit cards with a pole   if you decide to use a credit card then what you should really really do is to pay back the maximum amount possible all the time best is to pay off the credit card in full if at all possible   consider this if you owe them money the interest rate is so high that with the minimum payment your debt will be growing all the time spend $ 1,000 pay $ 10 a month and next year you owe $ 1,100 without having used the credit card at all if you pay $ 32 a month as you mentioned your $ 1,000 purchase is actually a multi year loan if you need a multi year loan for a $ 1,000 purchase an ordinary loan from your bank will be much much cheaper

one year is short term short enough that trying to predict returns is a crap shoot frankly if you will need the money in one year i would n't touch anything riskier than a money market account $ 5000 also is n't enough to give you much flexibility in achieving a balanced portfolio since the minimal initial purchase for mutual funds is often around $ 2500 i 'm not sure whether etfs would give you any more flexibility so on grounds of both size and time horizon i have to recommend against this plan the risk of losing money with insufficient time for gains to balance that risk is simply too high others may feel differently of course but that 's the best advice i can offer

the most important thing to look at is the fdic insurance savings accounts are covered money markets not necessarily online savings accounts provide rates of ~1 look at american express ally capitol one ing direct e*trade etc the pledge basically brings everbank into the same list as they all have similar rates being top 5 of competitive accounts is not that hard because there are thousands of banks around you know is not the highest rate available american express currently give 1 on their savings account re moving the money a lot depends on the amounts but when the rates were higher i moved around a lot now it just does n't worth the trouble although i would move for 0.25

i 'm surprised there 's so little sympathy for the model here her image was used in a sexual context without her awareness or consent what bk did was probably legal but definitely immoral if a male model sold the rights to a picture of his face would it be ok to make billboards saying this is the face of an    as for the reaction to her using the word rape yes it was probably unnecessary and on her part however she quite reasonably feels violated in a sexual way and was drawing attention to that i do n't think that a poor word choice should distract us from the fact that she has a very reasonable gripe with how her picture was used

i was wondering what relations are between brokerage companies and exchanges are brokers representing investors to trade on exchanges yes but a broker may also buy and sell stocks for his own account this is called broker firm for individual investors what are some cons and pros of trading on the exchanges directly versus indirectly via brokers does n't the former save the investors any costs expenses paid to the brokers yes but to trade directly on an exchange you need to register with them that costs money and only a limited number of people can register i believe note that some or all exchanges have their websites where i think trading can be done electronically such as nasdaq and bats can almost all stocks be found and traded on almost every exchange in other words is it possible that a popular stock can only be found and traded on one exchange but not found on the other exchange if needed to be more specific i am particularly interested in the u.s. case and for example apple 's stock yes it is very much possible with smaller companies big companies are usually on multiple exchanges what are your advices for choosing exchange and choosing brokerage companies what exchanges and brokerage companies do you recommend for brokerage companies a beginner can go with discount broker for sophisticated investors can opt for full service brokers usually your bank will have a brokerage firm for exchanges it depends if you are in us you should send to the us exchanges if you wish to send to other exchanges in other countries you should check with the broker about that

using a simple investment calculator to get a sense of scale here to have 70k total including the 500 a month invested after ten years you just need returns of 2   to earn 70k on top of the money invested you would need returns over 20   to do that in five years you would need over 50 annual return that is quite a big difference   annualized returns of 20 would require high risk and a very large amount of time invested skill and luck   2 returns can be nearly guaranteed without much effort i would encourage you to think about your money more if you get very unlucky with investments and do n't make any money will you not go on the vacations even if your income allows   that does n't make a lot of sense   as always spend all your money with the current and future in mind   investment return euros are no different from any other euros at that point the advice is the same for all investors try to get as much return as possible for the risk you are comfortable with   you seem to have a high tolerance for risk   generally for investors with a high risk tolerance a broadly diversified portfolio of stocks with maybe a small amount of bonds other investments will give the most return over the long term for the risk taken after that generally the next most useful way to boost your returns is to try to avoid taxes which is why we talk about 401(k)s so much around here   each european country has different tax law but please ask questions here about your own country as well as you mention could use more ex us questions

there are two reasons leases are generally a worse deal than buying first inherent in the lease is the concept of trading in the car at the end of the lease term as we all know cars depreciate the most in the first year or two by repeatedly leasing cars on short time frames you own the vehicles during those most expensive years of course there 's nothing stopping you from doing the same thing when buying be it via cash or loan but leasing builds in a schedule and encourages you to stick to it second it is easier for the dealer salesperson to hide things from the consumer in a lease contract most salespeople will try to get a car purchaser to focus on the monthly payment or they 'll four box the purchaser but even then there 's only 4 numbers and most consumers have a rough idea what they are and what they mean but in a lease the numbers in question are renamed and price becomes capitalized cost interest rate becomes money factor and is divided by 2400 making it look really small and not easily without a calculator or pencil and paper down payment becomes a capitalized cost reduction there 's a new concept residual value neither of those reasons change when interest rate is lower

yes this unions are what ruined the german economy and put them at the bottom of the list of world manufacturers they are bleeding so many jobs to china   and south east asia experts are predicting they wo n't have any manufacturing sector jobs left within the year this is going to exacerbate germany 's already sky high unemployment rate and god knows how they are going to pay off their enormous national debt   on another point i just do n't understand how we allow police and fire unions as they do n't make those jobs any safer and just end up costing the tax payers more money if it were n't for them we could pay our police and fire fighters minimum wages that would equate to about a hundred dollars in tax savings for each and every property owner in a municipality   furthermore the rights of the workers are best represented by their employers and not an expensive corrupt union you can clearly see the efficiency with which large employers like flour takes care of their non union employees sure the non union people have a much higher medical debt load less home ownership and more frequent bankruptcies due to unpaid medical debt but that is not without its advantages

i have a car loan paid in full and even paid off early and 2 personal loans paid in full from my credit union that do n't seem to reflect in a positive way and all 3 were in good standing but you also   my credit card utilization is 95 i have a total of 4 store credit cards a car loan 2 personal loans so assuming no overlap you 've paid off three of your ten loans 30   and you still have 95 utilization    what would you do if you were laid off for six months   regardless of payment history you would most likely stop making payments on your loans   this is why your credit score is bad   you are in fact a credit risk   not due to payment history   if your payment history was bad you 'd likely rank worse   but simple fiscal reality is that you are an adverse event away from serious fiscal problems    for that matter the very point that you are considering bankruptcy says that they are right to give you a poor score   bankruptcy has adverse effects on you but for your creditors it means that many of them will never get paid or get paid less than what they loaned    the hard advice that we can give is to reduce your expenses   stop going to restaurants   prepare breakfast and from scratch and bag your lunch   do n't put new expenses on your credit cards unless you can pay them this month   cut up your store cards and do n't shop for anything but necessities   whatever furniture appliances clothes shoes etc you have now should be enough for the next year or so    cut your expenses   have premium channels on your cable or the extra fast internet   drop back to the minimum instead   turn the heat down and the a c temperature up so it cools less   turn off the lights if you are n't using them   if you move move to a cheaper apartment   nothing to do   get a second job   that will not only keep you from being bored it will help with your financial issues    bankruptcy will not itself fix the problems you describe   you are living beyond your means   bankruptcy might make you stop living beyond your means   but it wo n't fix the problem that you make less money than you want to spend   only you can do that   better to stop the spending now rather than waiting until bankruptcy makes your credit even worse and forces you to cut spending    if you have extra money at the end of the month pick the worst loan and pay as much of it as you can   by worst i mean the one with the worst terms going forward   highest interest rate etc   if two loans have the same rate pay the smaller one first   once you pay off that loan it will increase the amount of money you have left to pay off your other loans   this is called the debt snowball snowball effect    after you finish paying off your debt save up six months worth of expenses or income   these will be your emergency savings    once you have your emergency fund write out a budget and stick to it   you can buy anything you want so long as it fits in your budget   avoid borrowing unless absolutely necessary   instead save your money for bigger purchases   with savings you not only avoid paying interest you may actually get paid interest   even if it 's a low rate paid to you is better than paying someone else    one of the largest effects of bankruptcy is that it forces you to act like this   they offer you even less credit at worse terms   you wo n't be able to shop on credit anymore   no new car loan   no mortgage   no nice clothes on credit   so why declare bankruptcy   take charge of your spending now rather than waiting until you ca n't do anything else

because it appears you have in the neighborhood of 30 years on your mortgage for the first house if you can sell it you will likely be better off in the end   while renting has the potential for greater income it is a business   and like any business there are risks expenses and work required to make it successful   there will be times where you can not find a renter immediately and will be responsible for making both payments maintaining both houses the for an owner is higher for a rental property than a domicile and paying the applicable taxes    you need to look at your best and worst case numbers   if your best case numbers leave you in the hole 300/month then that is not the sort of business you want to run   your investment should build your savings and retirement funds not deplete them   further you are more likely to fall between your best and worst case   so you need to be able to thrive at that level   if something in the middle is going to take you into bankruptcy then sell the property   if you are not willing to put the time into your business that it will need my rental home took about 10 30 hours a month despite renters being responsible for basic upkeep and maintenance    finally your plan b   a home with 800k value will have higher costs and expenses and maintenance   if the 800k home is the home you and your family needs then by all means go for it   but if it can do just as well in the 450k home then go there   pay the home off early by making the payments you would be making for the 800k home   in this way you pay less in total cost of the home and set your self up for the greatest chance of success   once that home is paid off the break even point for renting goes way down as well   so the rental option could be in the future   i would just it now if possible

investopedia has a section in their article about currency trading that states the fx market does not have commissions unlike exchange based markets fx is a principals only market fx firms are dealers not brokers this is a critical distinction that all investors must understand unlike brokers dealers assume market risk by serving as a counterparty to the investor 's trade they do not charge commission instead they make their money through the bid ask spread principals only means that the only parties to a transaction are agents who actively bear risk by taking one side of the transaction   there are forex brokers who charge what 's called a commission based on the spread investopedia has another article about the commission structure in the forex market that states there are three forms of commission used by brokers in forex some firms offer a fixed spread others offer a variable spread and still others charge a commission based on a percentage of the spread   so yes there are forex brokers who charge a commission but this paragraph is saying mostly the same thing as the first paragraph the brokers make their money through the bid ask spread how they do so varies and sometimes they call this charge a commission sometimes they do n't all of the information above differs from the stock markets however in which   the broker takes the order to an exchange and attempts to execute it as per the customer 's instructions for providing this service the broker is paid a commission when the customer buys and sells the tradable instrument the broker is n't taking a side in the trade so he 's not making money on the spread he 's performing the service of taking the order to an exchange an attempting to execute it and for that he charges a commission

there is economic value added to the marketplace by having many investors trading stocks the stock market itself can be thought of as a tool which provides additional liquidity to the marketplace liquidity is the ease with which you can convert your assets into cash for example how quickly could you sell your car if you needed money to pay a medical bill without a stock market funds would be very illiquid an investor would likely need to post advertisements to have other people consider buying his her shares until the match between a buyer and seller is found the person with the shares ca n't use the cash they need on the other side of the transaction are people who have an appetite for risk this means that for various reasons they are willing to take on more risk than you if it pays off on average they are young and have many years of salary earnings in front of them or they are rich can afford to lose money sometimes if it pays off on average consider this like a transaction between your insurance broker you do n't want to pay for a new car if you get in an accident and you 're willing to pay total annual premiums that on average will cost more than that same car over time you do n't want the risk but the insurance company does that 's how they make money so by participating in any marketplace you are providing value in the form of liquidity and by allowing the market to allocate risk to those willing to take it on

the preparation for starting up of the company has lasted already more than 2 years let 's say the company starts officially in january next year so in january 2014 8 million usd is invested to purchase the equipments and the company will start selling their right away imagine the company will be selling the same amount of products each year at the same price for 5 years after 5 years it will sell the equipments for 6 million usd and cease to exist the depreciation of   equipments is divided into those 5 years so each year the depreciation of equipments is usd in despite of this the company will make usd per year as a profit before tax   so the equipments are bought in 2014 first month of the existence of the company and sold in december 2018 last month of the existence of the company this is the npv that i calculated is it correct

tricky question   many car leasing companies like to quote payments by the week or twice a month to make the car sound cheaper to carry   if the lease or loan is calculated such that interest accrues monthly not in advance then any payments made prior to the date on which the interest is calculated will reduce the balance and therefore the interest however many loans and leases are calculated at the beginning for the whole life of the agreement   in that case splitting each payment in half does n't do anything to reduce the interest built in to the payments because the interest is calculated in advance

i see several interesting statement in your question   a. my only income is from my employer b. i also receive employer stock espp rsu however employer withholds taxes for these stock transactions through my broker i see them broken down on my w2   c. i have been subject to alternative minimum tax a implies a simple tax return b and c tell the opposite story in fact if b is not done correctly the amount withheld due to payroll may be perfect but the under withholding could be due to the espp 's rsus and   the amt can throw everything else out the window   if a person has a very simple tax situation income does n't change a lot from paycheck to paycheck they take the standard deduction the number of exemptions equals the number of people in the family then the withholding is very close to perfect   the role of the exemptions on the w-4 is to compensate for situations that go above the standard deduction the role of extra withholding is when the situation requires more withholding due to situations that will bring in extra income or if the amt is involved

if the call is in the money and you believe the reason for the price jump was an overreaction with a on the horizon or you anticipate downward movement for other reasons i will roll sometimes for a strike closer to at the money as long as the trade results in a net credit    you already have the statistical edge trading covered calls over everyone who purchased stock at the same point in time   this is because covered calls reduce your cost basis and increase your probability of profit for people reading this who are not interested in the math behind probability of for covered calls you should be aware of why pop is higher for covered calls cc   with ccs you win when the stock price stays the same you win when it goes down slightly you win when the stock goes up   you have two more ways to win than someone who just buys stock therefore a higher probability of making a buck another option if your stock is going to be called at a loss or the strike you want to roll to results in a net debit or   your cash funds are short of owning 100x shares and you are familiar with the stock try writing a naked put for the price you want to buy at   at if the naked put is exercised your basis is reduced by the premium of the put you sold and you can write a covered call against the stock you now own   if it expires worthless you keep the premium   this is also another way to increase your pop

you are making an assumption that the house will appreciate in the short term which there is no way you can know   you will probably take a bath financially selling a house after one year into a mortgage even if you sell it for what you paid for it if there is any chance you might relocate back it is definitely worth keeping it otherwise i 'd say cut your losses the only upside might be if you could rent it out keeping in mind that you generally need to rent for about double your mortgage payment to get positive cash flow letting it sit empty while you wait for it to appreciate is undoubtedly going to cost you big time

yes you should worry and take care not to violate the law or provide any appearance of    every bank in the usa is required under the bank secrecy act to report cash transactions over $ 10,000 the same day to the irs and here 's the fun secret part without notification to the depositor    but splitting the deposits up into smaller amounts is also a crime called structuring    on occasion there is a news story where a retail business that naturally must deposit cash from customers will be falsely accused of structuring e.g.   feds seize grocery store 's entire bank account institute for justice grocer under the legal doctrine of civil asset forfeiture your money can be accused of a crime seized and tried separately from its owner   the actual cases indicate the money as defendant i.e. us v $ in this somewhat bizarre system of justice the owner need not be charged with a crime and is not in immediate peril of going to prison about the only upside in this but might be temporary because the authorities have n't charged the owner yet   when only the money is charged with a crime there is no requirement for the government to supply a public for the owners who can not afford a lawyer can not afford a lawyer because the government took all their money

people are willing to pay higher premiums for options when stocks go down obviously the time value and intrinsic value and interests rates of the option does n't change because of this so the remainder is priced into the implied volatility part of the formula   basically anything that suggests the stock price will get volatile sharp moves in either direction will increase the implied volatility of the option for instance around earnings reports the iv in both calls and puts in the nearest expiration dates are very high when stocks go down sharply the volatility is high because some people are buying puts for protection and others are buying calls because they think there will be a rebound move in the other direction people the sleep at night investors not the derivatives traders   tend to be calm when stocks are going up and fearful when they are going down the psychology is important to understand and observe and profit from not to quantitatively prove the first paragraph should be your qualitative answer

the service processors are providing is absorbing the risk   the flow goes roughly and i say roughly because it 's a complicated process   1 you swipe insert your card at bob 's house of and get charged $ 10 for a bucket of ramen or something 2 the device you swipe your card in a terminal the card number amount and some other transaction details and contacts a payment gateway    3 the gateway the of data and is responsible for determining the issuing financial institution chase us bank etc 4 the gateway contacts the above and asks can card 555 charge $ 10 5 the gateway also sends this answer to the processor    5 the processor immediately that yes no back to the merchant 's terminal 6 the processor having a transaction id and a yes no sends the response to the merchant 's systems so your receipt can be printed or order processed and so on    7 meanwhile the processor has a transaction id and is busy figuring out things like interchange fees   the amount depends on a whole host of things and almost everyone involved in the process wants their cut the bank the gateway the processor and it all depends on the type of card customer rewards and so on    8 at the end of the day week whatever the processor collects money from the issuing financial institution and is responsible for giving the right amount less fees to the merchant     the processor here also the risk and costs for things like chargebacks as almost everyone in that chain gateway issuing bank want their pound of flesh for a chargeback and often the processor does n't pass that full cost on to the merchant and instead does some risk analysis to determine if they think this merchant is going to be okay to do business with     that 's what you 're paying for

you did something that you should n't have done you bought a dividend   most mutual fund companies have educational materials on their sites that recommend against making new investments in mutual funds in the last two months of the year because most mutual funds distribute their earnings dividends capital gains etc to their shareholders in december and the share price of the funds goes down in the amount of the per share distribution these distributions can be taken   in cash or can be re invested in the fund you most likely chose the latter   option it is often the default choice if you ignored all this because you are a newbie for those who choose to reinvest the number of shares in the mutual fund increases but since the price of the shares has decreased the net amount remains the same you own more shares at a lower price than the day before when the price was higher but the total value of your account is the same ignoring normal market fluctuations in the price of the actual stocks held by the fund regardless of whether you take the distributions as cash or re invest in the fund that money is taxable income to you unless the fund is owned inside a 401k or ira or other tax deferred investment program   you bought 56 shares at a price of $ per share net cost $ 1000 the fund distributed its earnings shortly thereafter and gave you additional shares the new share price is $ so the total value of your investment is $ but the amount that you have invested in the account is the original $ 1000 plus the amount of the distribution which is roughly $ x = $ 216   your total investment of $ is now worth $ only and so you have actually lost money besides you owe income tax on that $ 216 dividend that you received   do you see why the mutual fund companies recommend against making new investments late in the year   if you had waited till after the mutual fund had made its distribution you could have bought $ = shares and would n't have owed tax on that distribution that you just bought by making the investment just before the distribution was made see also my answer to this recent question about investing in mutual funds

simply put for a mortgage interest is charged only on the balance as well think of it this way on a $ 100 k 6 loan on day one 1/2 is $ 500 and the payment is just under $ 600 so barely $ 100 goes to principal but the last payment of $ 600 is nearly all principal   by the way you are welcome to make extra principal payments along with the payment due each month an extra $ in this example paid each and every month will drop the term to just 15 years think about that 40 higher payment all attacking the principal and you cut the term by 1/2 the time

i do n't understand the op 's desire i 'd love to have a few hundred dollars coming in each month until i really get the hang of things   when growing your wealth so that it will be large enough in retirement to throw off enough profits to live on you must not touch the profits generated along the way   you must reinvest them to earn even more profits   the profits you earn need not show up as cash   most investments also grow in re sale value this growth is called capital gains and is just as more important than cash flows like interest income or dividends     when evaluating investing choices you think of your returns as a percent of your total savings at any time   so expecting $ 100/month equals $ would require a $ 12,000 investment to earn 10%/yr from the sounds of it the op 's principal is not near that amount and an average 10 should not be expected by an investment with reasonable risk i would conclude that there is no free lunch   you need to continually save and add to your principal   you must invest to expect a reasonable return less than 10 and you must reinvest all profits whether cash or capital gains or else start a business which can not be compared to passive investing

here 's an excerpt from the charles schwab website which i think will help evaluate your position the simple answer to your question is no the value of a gift of stock    for gift tax liability is not the donor 's cost basis but rather the    fair market value of the stock at the time the gift is given so let 's    say you purchased 100 shares of xyz stock at $ 50 a share your cost    basis is $ 5,000 now the stock is $ 80 a share and you give it as a    gift the value of your gift for gift tax purposes is $ 8,000 in 2015 you can give up to $ 14,000 to an unlimited number of    individuals each year without paying a gift tax or even reporting the    gifts if you give over that amount to any individual however you    must report the gift on your tax return but you do n't have to pay    taxes until you give away more than the current lifetime limit of    $ the amount above and beyond $ 14,000 per person per    year so in the example above there would be no gift tax liability    however if the stock happened to be $ 150 a share the value of the    gift would be $ 15,000 you 'd then have to report it and $ 1,000 would    be applied toward your $ lifetime exclusion you will need to pay a gift tax on the current value of the stock i 'm not familiar with the tax laws in india but if your brother was in the us he would n't pay taxes on that gift until he sells the stock the recipient does n’t have to worry about gift taxes it 's when the    recipient decides to sell the stock that the issue of valuation comes    up for income taxes and this is where things can get a bit more    complicated in general when valuing a gift of stock for capital gains tax    liability it 's the donor 's cost basis and holding period that rules    as an example let 's say you receive a gift of stock from your    grandfather he bought it for $ 10 a share and it 's worth $ 15 a share    on the day you receive it if you then sell the stock whether for a    gain or a loss your cost basis will be the same as your    grandfather ’s $ 10 per share sell it at $ 25 and you 'll pay tax at    the short- or long term rate depending on how long he owned the    stock on a gain of $ 15 a share sell it at $ 8 and your capital loss    will be $ 2 a share ultimately with a gift this large that also crosses international borders you really should hire a professional who is experienced with these types of transactions their fees commission will be completely offset by the savings in risk and paperwork

conceptually the entries are    yes and since you 're the sole owner your basis will equal to the equity balance on the balance sheet keep in mind the book and tax basis will probably be different so you may want to keep a separate calculation to track the tax basis there is no journal additional journal entry for this if you 're using bookkeeping software be sure to research its book closing closing entries feature as it is handled differently depending on the software for example quickbooks does n't explicitly close its books but re computes the balance sheet dynamically depending on the selected date range

long convexity is achieved by owning long dated low delta options when a significant move occurs in the underlying the volatility curve will move higher instead of a linear relationship between your long position and it 's return you receive a multiple of the linear return for example share price $ 50 long 1 equals 100 shares contract of a 2 year 100 call assume this is a 5 delta option if the stock price rises to $ 70 the delta of the option will rise because it is now closer to the strike lets assume it is now a 20 delta option then   expected return on a $ 20 price move higher 100 however what happens is the entire volatility surface rises and causes the 20 delta option to be 30 delta option then the return on a $ 20 price move higher 100 this $ 200 extra gain is due to convexity and explains why option traders are willing to pay above the theoretical price for these options
