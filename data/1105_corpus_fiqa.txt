this question drives at what value a shareholder actually provides to a corporation and by extent to the economy if you subscribe for new shares like in an initial public offering it is very straightforward to say i have provided capital to the corporation which it is using to advance its business if you buy shares that already exist like in a typical share purchase on a public exchange your money does n't go to the company instead it goes to someone who paid someone who paid someone who paid someone etc who originally contributed money to the corporation   in theory the value of a share price does not directly impact the operation of the company itself apart from what noted employee stock options are affected by share price impacting morale etc this is because in theory the true value of a company and thus the value of a share is the present value of all future cashflows dividends + final liquidation this means that in a technical sense a company 's share price should result from the company 's value the company 's true value does not result from the share price but what you are doing as a shareholder is impacting the liquidity available to other potential investors also as mentioned by in reference to the desirability for future financing the more people who invest their money in the stock market the more liquid those stocks become this is the true value you add to the economy by investing in stocks you add liquidity to the market decreasing the risk of capital investment generally the fewer people there are who are willing to invest in a particular company the harder it is for an investor to buy or sell shares at will if it is difficult to sell shares in a company the risk of holding shares in that company is higher because you ca n't cash out as easily this increased risk then does change the value of the shares because even though the corporation 's internal value is the same the projected cashflows of the shares themselves now has a question mark around the ability to sell when desired whether this actually has an impact on anything depends on how many people join you in your declaration of ethical investing like many other forms of social activism success relies on joint effort this goes beyond the direct and indirect impacts mentioned above if ethical investing becomes more pronounced it may begin to the   target companies fewer people wanting to work for blacklist corporations fewer people buying their products etc

yes it does matter you are right that lower demand for a stock will drive its price down lower stock prices can hurt the company take a look at 's answer to this question a declining share price will make it hard to secure credit attract further investors build partnerships etc also employees are often holding options or in a stock purchase plan so a declining share price can severely dampen morale in an extreme case if share prices plummet too far the company can be pressured to reverse split the shares and eventually take the company private this recently happened to playboy if you do not want to support a company for whatever reason then it is wise to avoid their stock

the cra 's website has pretty good information on this type of thing the search function is not great however so i recommend going to google and typing if you search   it brings you here   if you want to transfer funds from one tfsa to another or from one issuer to another there will be no tax consequences if your issuer completes a direct transfer on your behalf for more information contact your issuer it seems that this is not something you are able to perform yourself unfortunately it seems you may need to go back to your issuer with this information and ask again that they perform the transfer on your behalf note that failure to comply with this request on their end likely has stiff penalties behind it so it may help you to get the individual 's name and wave that stick around to make something happen you may also have better luck by first opening an account with your new desired institution and asking that they assist in requesting the transfer from your old institution they have incentive to help you here as it 's the only way they get to serve you so you 'll have valuable help on your side

its best to seek a lawyer but it is unlikely you can force him to pay   you probably know couples that are in some part of the divorce process that have trouble obtaining court ordered payments   in your case you have less of a legal standing exception if you have children together   as far as the house goes the two of you entered into some sort of business arrangement and it will be difficult to force him to pay    one thing that works for you is that he has excellent credit   if he is interested in keeping a high credit rating he will ensure that no payments are late on the home   your question suggests that the two of you are not getting along very well right now and that needs to stop   the best financial decision you can make right now is to get along with him    it seems that the two of you have not officially broken up   if you do decide to ways do so as as possible   you will have to work to get the home in your name only and him off the deed   this benefits both of you as you will have sole control of the house and this ill advised business decision can end   he will have the home off his credit and will not be responsible if you miss a payment and can also buy a home or whatever of his own good luck and do your best to work this out   seeking peace will cost you a lot less money in the long run   fighting in court cost a lot of money   giving in to semi reasonable demands are far cheaper then fighting here is an example   lets say he normally contributes $ 500 to the mortgage and he decides to move out   i would ask him to contribute $ 200 until you can get his name off the loan say 6 months at the most   after that you will put the house up for sale if you can not obtain a mortgage in your own name and will split any profits

first off great job on your finances so far you are off on the right foot and have some sense of planning for the future   also it is a great question    first i agree with @littleadv take advantage of your employer match do not drop your 401(k contributions below that also good job on putting your contributions into the roth account second i would ask are you out of debt   if not put all your extra income towards paying off debt and then you can work your plan third time to do some math   what will your business look like   how much capital would you need to get started   are there things you can do now on a part time basis to start this business or prepare you to start the business come up with a figure find some mutual funds that have a low beta and back out how much money you need to save per month so you have around that total   then you have a figure e.g. assume you need $ 20,000 and you find a fund that has done 8 over the past 20 years   then you would need to save about $ to be ready to go in 10 years or $ to go in about 5 years   it 's a time value of money calculation the house is really a long way off but you could do the same kind of calculation   i feel that you think your income and possibly locale will change dramatically over the next few years   it might not be bad to double what you are saving for the business and designate one half for the house

yes if you can split your income up over multiple years it will be to your advantage over earning it all in one year   the reasons are as you mentioned you get to apply multiple deductions credits exemptions to the same income rather than just 1 standard deduction you get to deduct 2 standard deductions you can double the max saved in an ira you benefit more from any non refundable credits etc this is partly due to the fact that when you are filing your taxes in year 1 you ca n't include anything from year 2 since it has n't happened yet it does n't make sense for the government to take into account actions that may or may not happen when calculating your tax bill there are factors where other year profit loss can affect your tax liability however as far as i know these are limited to businesses look into loss carry forwarded back if you want to know more regarding the 30 simple rate i think you are confusing something that is simple to say with something that is simple to implement   are we going to go change the rules on people who expected their mortgage deduction to continue there are few ways i can think of that are more sure to cause home prices to plummet than to eliminate the mortgage interest deduction what about removing student loan interest under a 30 simple rate what tools would the government use to encourage trade in specific areas will state income tax deduction also be removed this is going to punish those in a state with a high income tax more than those in states without income tax those are all just common deductions that affect a lot of people you could easily say no to all of them and just piss off a bunch of people but what about selling stock though i paid $ 100 for the stock and i sold it for $ 120 do i need to pay $ 36 tax on that because it is a simple 30 tax rate or are we allowing the cost of goods sold deduction it 's called something else i believe when talking about stocks but it 's the same idea what about if i travel for work to tutor individuals can i deduct my mileage expenses do i need to pay 30 income tax on my earnings and principal from a roth ira a lot of people have contributed to a roth with the understanding that withdrawals will be tax free changing those rules are punishing people for using vehicles intentionally created by the government are we going to go around and dismantle all non profits that entirely on tax deductible donations do i need to pay taxes on the employer 's cost of my health insurance what about 401k 's and ira 's being true to a simple 30 tax will eliminate all benefits from every job as you would need to pay taxes on the value of the benefits i should mention that this is n't exactly too crazy there was a relatively recent irs publication about businesses needing to withhold taxes from their employees for the cost of company supplied food but i do n't know if it was ultimately accepted at the end of the day the concept of simplifying the tax law is n't without merit but realize that the complexities of tax law are there due to the complexities of life the vast majority of tax laws were written for a reason other than to benefit special interests and for that reason they can not easily be ignored

not really   they did n't account for the fact that the income would first be spread out over 8 billion people   i do n't know if anyone in keynes time was thinking about dozens of industries closed in america and moved directly to china   had you suggested that to them i think they would have thought it ridiculous but that is in fact what happened   also theories on trade suggest that it makes everyone better off   so if you ask any economist at any given point if more free trade is better they will probably say yes   that was all fine until about the 1980s when computer networks made it possible to supply chains   suddenly vast cad cam systems sprung up and suddenly you could pay a worker a $ 1 a day to do what someone in the us was getting $ 45 an hour to do   the economics of it for corporations were absolutely and they lobbied hard to make sure noting got in the way note that free trade passed under both parties   in order to mask the fact that this was happening a giant credit bubble was created in the developed world using the newfound savings of the developing world   living standards were temporarily maintained in developed countries by borrowing money from the people they had sent their jobs to   the effects of this are all pretty clear   most developed nations are now burdened under a mountain of debt   central banks are having a difficult time maintaining enough liquidity to support the illusion of buying power in developed nations that is no longer present without enormous artificial support   many americans alive today can not even remember a time when america 's current account deficit was not deeply in the red   so far the only thing propping up developed nations is the use and threat of use of vastly superior military force   that has n't really changed but every day the developing nations a little bit more on the resources of the world for consumption rather than just production   as that happens the out of the developed world start to feel more and more pressured as they come to realize they really do n't have much of value to trade   america 's biggest exports are food and services   food is surely important but one farmer can farm like 100,000 acres   and services just means we can export the time of a wall street douchebag at a high rate of pay

every bank and credit union in the us has a deposit agreement and disclosures document bank of america is no different our general policy is to make funds from your cash and check deposits    available to you no later   than the first business day after the day    of your deposit however in some cases we place a hold   on funds that    you deposit by check a hold results in a delay in the availability of    these funds that sounds great but for determining the availability of your deposits every day is a    business day except saturdays    and federal holidays    if    you make a deposit on a business day that we are open at one of our    financial centers before    p.m. local time or at one of our atms    before p.m. local time in the state where we   maintain your    account we consider that day to be the day of your deposit however    if you make   a deposit after such times or on a day when we are not    open or that is not a business day we   consider that the deposit was    made on the next business day we are open some locations have     different cutoff times so if you deposit a check on friday afternoon the funds are generally available on tuesday but not always in some cases we will not make all of the funds that you deposit by    check available to you by the   first business day after the day of    your deposit depending on the type of check that you deposit   funds    may not be available until the second business day after the day of    your deposit the first   $ 200 of your deposits however may be    available no later than the first business day after the day   of your    deposit   if we are not going to make all of the funds from your    deposit available by the first business   day after the day of your    deposit we generally notify you at the time you make your deposit we    also tell you when the funds will be available ok what happens when the funds are available in many cases we make funds from your deposited checks available to    you sooner than we   are able to collect the checks this means that    from time to time a deposited check may be   returned unpaid after we    made the funds available to you please keep in mind that even though     we make funds from a deposited check available to you and you withdraw    the funds you are   still responsible for problems with the deposit    if a check you deposited is returned to us unpaid   for any reason you    will have to repay us and we may charge your account for the amount of    the   check even if doing so your account fidelity has a similar document each check deposited is promptly credited to your account   however    the money may not be available until up to six business   days later    and we may decline to honor any debit that is applied   against the    money before the deposited check has cleared if a deposited check does not clear the deposit will be removed   from    your account and you are responsible for returning any   interest you    received on it i would think that the longer holding period for fidelity is due to the fact that they want to wait long enough to make sure that the number of times they have to undo investments due to the funds not clearing is nearly zero

there is economic value added to the marketplace by having many investors trading stocks the stock market itself can be thought of as a tool which provides additional liquidity to the marketplace liquidity is the ease with which you can convert your assets into cash for example how quickly could you sell your car if you needed money to pay a medical bill without a stock market funds would be very illiquid an investor would likely need to post advertisements to have other people consider buying his her shares until the match between a buyer and seller is found the person with the shares ca n't use the cash they need on the other side of the transaction are people who have an appetite for risk this means that for various reasons they are willing to take on more risk than you if it pays off on average they are young and have many years of salary earnings in front of them or they are rich can afford to lose money sometimes if it pays off on average consider this like a transaction between your insurance broker you do n't want to pay for a new car if you get in an accident and you 're willing to pay total annual premiums that on average will cost more than that same car over time you do n't want the risk but the insurance company does that 's how they make money so by participating in any marketplace you are providing value in the form of liquidity and by allowing the market to allocate risk to those willing to take it on

really the question you need to ask yourself is how much risk you want to take in order to save a little on interest for 5 years rates are pretty close to a historic low and if you have good credit you should shop around a bit to get a good ideal of what a 15 or 30 year fixed loan would go for for people that are sure they will be selling a property in a few years a balloon or arm might not be a bad thing   otoh if their plans change or if you plan to stay in the property for longer e.g. 10 15 years then they have the potential to turn into a huge trap and could have the effect of forcing you to sell your house    the most likely people to fall into such a trap are those who are trying to buy more house than they can really afford and max out what they can pay using a lower rate and then later can not afford the payments if anything happens that makes the rate go up   over the last three years we 've seen a large number of foreclosures and short sales taking place are because of people who fell into just this kind of trap   i strongly advise you learn from their mistakes and do not follow in their   you need to consider what could happen in 5 years time    or if the economy takes off and/or the fed is not careful with interest rates and money supply we could see high inflation and high interest rates to go along with it    the odds of rates being any lower in 5 years time is probably pretty low   the odds of it being higher depends on who 's crystal ball you look at   i think most people would say that rates are likely to increase and the disagreement is over just how much and how soon   if you are forced to refinance in 5 years time and the rates are higher will you be able to make the payments or will you potentially be forced out of the house perhaps into something much smaller   what happens if the rates at that time are 9 and even an arm is only 6 could you make the payments or would you be forced to sell    potentially you could end up paying out more in interest than if you had just gotten a simple fixed loan myself i 'd not take the risk   for much of the last 40 years people would have sold off their children or body parts to get rates like we have today on a standard fixed loan   i 'd go for a standard fixed loan between 15 and 30 years duration   if you want to pay extra principle to get it paid off earlier in order to feel more secure or just get out from under the debt then do so personally i would n't bother not at today 's rates

50 dollars euros is a very small amount to invest the first time i ever bought stock i picked a winner it went up by about 40 in the first few months i sold it and lost money how i only bought 10 shares at $ 7.50 each the profit was less than the two commissions for buying and selling about $ 17 a piece if you are thinking of buying individual stocks you simply need to save up more money before it will be practical if you are not trying to beat the market which is probably not something an amateur like you or i should attempt then you should consider low cost index funds i have money in mutual funds some of which have as low as a $ 100 minimum investment i have moved entirely away from picking stocks it was a good experience and i could afford to lose the money but as a long term strategy it just was not working for me note this is coming from an american if this somehow does not apply in europe

aiui this is not terribly abnormal there are sometimes to as pending charges or holds and actual charges an authorisation reserves money but does n't actually take it normally what happens when you pay by card is that the merchant gets an authorisation immediately then some time later the authorisation is converted into an actual charge when the merchant takes the money sometimes merchants are slow in taking the actual charge either deliberately some merchants wo n't charge your card until they actually supply the goods to reduce the chance of having to process a refund or because of administrative somewhere when this happens the authorisation can time out before the actual charge is taken so you get the pattern you see first the authorisation appears then it times out and and finally the actual charge shows up

edit new ideas based on the full story i would n't worry about the price history   while it is certainly true that some buyers might try to leverage that information against you the bottom line is the price is the price   both the buyer and the seller have to agree    if the initial listing was too high then lower the price   if that is n't low enough then readjust down   i see no harm in moving the price down over time repeatedly   in fact i thin that is a good tactic to getting the most for the house   if you happen to have the luxury of time then keep lowering that price until it sells   do n't fret how that behavior appears you can lower the price as often as you like until it sells   i am not a real estate agent and i am a terrible negotiator but i would lower the price every quarter until it sells   you ca n't go down to fast a buyer might wait you out and you ca n't wait to long as you stated   also if you house is priced inline with the neighborhood you can at least get offers and negotiate buy asking for such a premium 25 folks might not even make an offer you simply need to decide what is more important the selling price or the time frame in getting it sold if you house does n't sell because the market does n't support your price then consider keeping it as a rental   you can do it yourself or if you are not interested in that large amount of work then hire a rental management company to do it for a fee renting a home is hard work and requires attention to detail a good amount of your time and much labor   if you just need to wait a couple of years before selling renting it can be a good option to cover your costs while you wait for the market to reach you you should get advice on how to handle the money how to rent it how to deal with renters and the the laws are in your jurisdiction rent it out to a trusted friend or family member for a steal of a deal   they save money and you get the luxury of time waiting for the sale with a real estate lawyer you hire get a contract for a lease option or owner finance deal on the house   sometimes you can expand the market of people looking to buy your house   if you have a willing purchaser will bad credit you can be doing them a favor and solving your own issue   it costs money and you will make less on the sale but it could be better than nothing take heed there is a reason some people can not get a traditional loan on their own   before you extend your good name or credit think about it   it is another hassle for sure this wo n't help if you have to pay off a mortgage but you could donate it   this is another tricky deal that you really need to speak with a lawyer who specialize in charitable giving   there are tax benefits but i would make any kind of a deal where tax deductions are the only benefit this is common enough these days   if you are unable to pay for the mortgage it benefits you and the bank to get into a short sale arrangement   they bank gets probably more money than if they have to foreclose and they save money on legal fees and you can get rid of the obligation you will do a deed in lieu or the short sale depending on how the market it and what the house can be sold for   you and the bank will have to work it out this will ruin for a credit for a while and you will not likely qualify to get a new mortgage for at least a few years you can stop paying your mortgage tell the bank and they will foreclose   this is going to ruin your credit for a long time as well as disqualify you from mortgages in the near future   do n't do this   if you are planning a foreclosure take the time to contact your bank and arrange a short sale or a deed in lieu   there is n't really any excuse to go into foreclosure if you are having problems   talk to the bank and work out a deal

the first thing you need to do is look at your terms and conditions of your credit card or ask your bank how they will apply the payments   as dilip notes in his answer in the us they will likely apply the minimum payment to the lower rate balance and then must apply the rest above the minimum to the higher rate balance   in other countries this will vary by law and custom   do not assume it will pay off the higher balance or proportionally without asking let 's take the following example you owe $ 6000   $ 5000 is at 13.5 normal purchase rate and $ 1000 is at 22 cash advance rate   if your bank applies payments to both balances proportionally then a payment of $ 600 will reduce your purchase balance by $ 500 and your cash advance balance by $ 100 the average apr then is simply sum of the product of the apr times balance   so here 5000 + = 15   this is called a weighted average if the bank applies the payment differently such as to the lower rate first or some specified part to the lower rate and the rest to the higher rate then this will be misleading if you enter it into a calculator because your average apr will rise over time as you pay off the purchase balance but do n't pay off the cash advance balance or may decrease if the opposite happens the weighted average is probably reasonably close in the circumstance that you describe even if you have rules applying the balance differently so long as they do n't 100 pay down the lower rate so it may be the simplest option for you in terms of rough calculations where it 's not critical to be correct just close one approach using the online calculators that might be better is to treat these like two separate loans cards   many calculators exist for multiple balances   then you can allocate funds differently to the two cards   this would allow you to see how long you will need until you 've paid off the higher balance for example although it probably wo n't perfectly match things unless you find a site that has this specific option available you probably will have to either live with a small error in your calculations or do the math by hand

the benefit of paying into a pension is that the payment is effectively made from pre tax money either you pay from your own pocket and then you get income tax relief on the payment i.e. your gross salary is reduced by the gross pension contribution and income tax is recalculated with the excess either refunded to you or put in your pension the details are a bit more complicated depending on your marginal tax rate but the end result is the same or your company pays and then you are never charged tax on the payment in the first place from the company 's point of view the two are roughly the same either it pays you who then pays into your pension or it pays straight into your pension either way the money going out from the company is treated as a cost that is offset against the company 's revenue reducing the amount of corporation tax the company has to pay there are some national insurance advantages to paying directly into the pension neither you nor the company gets relief on ni if the payment goes via you but no ni is paid in the first place if it goes direct from the company edit your question is actually worded to suggest that you want to lend your company money from your own pocket and then have that loan directly discharged by the company paying into your pension that 's no different to you just paying into your pension directly and would n't have any better tax implications for the rest of my answer i assume that the idea is actually to lend your company money that it uses to make an immediate contribution to your pension as part of your pay from that company and then the company will repay the loan later by returning the money to you personally your pension and you are two separate entities legally however in your case what you 're proposing is that the company should effectively make a loss paying into your pension it 's going to end up with more costs than revenue so there wo n't be any immediate tax saving because there was n't revenue to pay corporation tax on in the first place you also wo n't save tax because the loan will be made from previously taxed income or whatever   however there will be a tax loss that can be carried forward and offset against future profits so if you expect the company to make money in future to repay the loan you might end up saving some corporation tax you can also sometimes carry a tax loss back one year so if your company had profits last year you could get some corporation tax back immediately the repayment of the loan itself wo n't be subject to income tax as it 's not income so unless you can carry the loss back you wo n't get any immediate tax relief by doing this but it might give you a way to carry forward your annual allowance to future years i.e. use it now and get the tax advantage later however the annual allowance can already be carried forward by up to three years so this is only worthwhile if you expect that future revenue to repay the loan to arrive more than three years later also this is only worthwhile if you 'll continue to max out the annual allowance for paying into your pension in future years otherwise you might as well just make the pension payment using that same revenue in future years however even if this beneficial tax wise i 'm not sure if it 's actually allowed this might be viewed as an artificial transaction to avoid tax and that could lead to hmrc the future tax relief you might need to ask hmrc or an accountant about that if you do make the loan make sure it 's clearly documented so you can show in future why the repayment should n't be treated as income

there 's really no right or wrong answer here because you 'll be fine either way if you 've investing amounts in the low 5 figures you 're likely just getting started and if your asset allocation is not optimal it 's not that big a deal because you have a long time horizon to adjust it and the expense ratio differences here wo n't add up to that much a third option is vanguard etfs which have the expense ratio of admiral shares but have lower minimums i.e. the cost of a single share typically on the order of $ 100 however they are a bit more advanced than mutual funds in that they trade on the market and require you to place orders rather than just specifying the amount you want to buy a downside here is you might end up with a small amount of cash that you ca n't invest since you can initially only buy whole numbers of etfs shares so what i 'd recommend is buying roughly the correct number of etfs shares you want except for your largest allocation then use the rest of your cash on admiral shares of that if possible for example let 's say you have $ 15k to invest and you want to be 2/3 u.s. stock 1/6 international stock and 1/6 u.s. bond i would buy as many shares of international stock etf and u.s. bond etf as you can get for $ 2500 each then whatever is left over put into vtsax u.s. stock admiral shares mutual fund

most of the time you can manage it sure   it is managed all the time even in the hypothetical crisis it is still being managed   gt;but without the lender of last bank bank runs would happen and failures would be common like in 19th century   one of the principal reasons for a lender of last resort however the system functions perfectly well without a lender of last resort unless there is also a of the interbank market   gt;the only way to fractional reserve banking   it is not the only way it is the best way in many respects we could also change the terms and conditions of deposits such that all deposits require notice or have fixed term etc etc this is without even considering what can be achieved with derivative instruments   abuse its power   it can also not abuse its power see the of west germany or the central banks of australia or new zealand even the federal reserve banks are actually not terrible in the global scale of central banks   credit expansion causing economic bubbles   economic bubbles occur independently of the presence of a central bank see the tulip

you do n't understand government financing at all   earn revenue aka taxes   they also spend money   the different between the money they spend and they money they earn is the deficit   if you run a deficit for a long period of time you incur a very large national debt   now you can finance aka pay for a deficit by borrowing money   this means you can sell bonds and instead of pay off the debt each year you just pay the interest   if your spending balloons out of control your the likely hood of you paying your debt decreases   if you are very unlikely to payback your debt people wo n't buy any more of your bonds and you no longer have the income from borrowing to pay off your interest from other debt you owe or what ever other obligations you own think mortgage payments or teachers salaries etc   here 's were europe and usa differ european nations ca n't just print money   they can issue more debt but they ca n't just create more euros   if you can print money you can pay off your debt with money you literally created out of thin air at the expense of your people this is called inflation   but this is a form of cheating eventually people wo n't trust you and wo n't buy your debt either   so where do the banks come in   if the government is sound and the banks are not the government can backstop the banks   this is what the us and uk did   greece spain ireland all had to back stop their banks also   however greece spain and and italy and portugal also have    1   a lot of debt   2   structurally high deficits   3   extremely high borrowing costs high interest rates because people do n't trust them because   4   weak underlying economies   the fourth point gets you in real trouble   if you have high entitlements lots of out of work who the hell is paying taxes and what are they going to   you have no revenue   remember a govt works just like a household   it is easy for a good household to support one member but it is difficult for a member to support an irresponsible household

i 'm not sure where people keep getting this idea but i see it come up a lot anyway you pay capital gains taxes when you sell an investment that has appreciated it makes no difference when if you reinvest the money or what you invest it in if you are afraid of the tax burden you can minimize it by 1 selling a stock that you have held longer than a year to get the lower long term rate 2 sell a stock that has n't appreciated that much and therefore does n't have a lot of gains to tax 3 sell a stock that 's below purchase price i.e. at a loss to offset any short term gains

i 'll add a little to the already great advice here it certainly sounds like you are in need of consolidation here having 11 different cards for your attention sounds like a nightmare to manage i also concur that it is a bad idea to cash out your retirement accounts to deal with this i know it 's frustrating to have the debt hanging over your head i have student loans i 'm personally working on but getting a loan to consolidate that level of noise sounds like a much smarter move that can help greatly if you have high interest cards most likely the case here since you mentioned that you are not interested in selling the house have you considered a home equity loan to consolidate this best of luck to you

first two to address good points people made in comments as noted before you move your $ 30k to something that might lose money make sure you have enough cash to serve as an emergency fund in case you lose your income especially remember that big stock market crashes often go hand in hand with widespread layoffs also you mentioned that you 're maxed out in a 401k as joetaxpayer hinted this could very well already be invested in stocks and if it is n't probably a big part of it should be regarding your $ 30k you do n't need to pay anybody in general fees and expenses can form a big drag on your investments and it 's good to avoid them as much as possible in particular especially with only $ 30k it 's unlikely that advisers can save you more than they cost also all financial advisers have a cost the free ones usually push you into investing in expensive funds that make them money at your expense in that regard keep in mind that unlike a lawyer or a doctor a financial adviser is not required by law to give advice that 's in your best interest when investing there is a pretty short list of important considerations that you should keep in mind if anyone has any other points they think are similarly important feel free to suggest an edit practically speaking i 'd suggest investing in index funds these are mutual funds that invest very broadly in a passive way that does n't spend a lot of effort and money trying to pick individual high performing stocks or anything like that index funds provide a lot of diversification and tend to have low expense ratios other actively managed funds tend to be more expensive and often do n't outperform index funds anyway if you 're saving for retirement there are even target date funds that are themselves composed of a small number of index funds often domestic and international stocks and bonds and will increase the proportion invested in bonds safer as they get closer to a target retirement date see for example the vanguard target retirement 2045 fund a fund like that one might be all you need if you are saving for retirement finally you can invest online without paying any advisers not all companies are created equal however do your research i personally highly recommend vanguard since they have a wide variety of no load index funds and tend to have very low expense ratios no load means you do n't have to pay a fee to buy and sell part of why they are inexpensive is that unlike most financial companies they are actually a cooperative owned by those who invest in their funds so they do n't need to try and milk a profit out of you do n't let that suggest that they 're some small potatoes hippie firm though they 're actually one of the largest i hope i helped keep posting if you have more questions

i absolutely agree with the other answers   no contest you should keep getting the match   but just for completeness i 'll give a contrarian opinion that is generally not very popular but does have some merit    if you can focus on just one main financial goal at a time and throw every extra dollar you have at that one focus i.e. getting out of debt in your case you will make better progress than if you 're trying to do too many things at once   also there something incredibly freeing about being out of debt that has other beneficial impacts on your life so if you can bring a lot of focus to the credit card debt and get it paid off quickly it may be worth deferring the 401(k investing long enough to do that even though it does n't make as much mathematical sense   this is essentially what dave ramsey teaches btw

everyone always rants on how big of a problem this is   just a quick note i do n't care how much they get paid but it 's important to understand why   it is n't because they set their own salaries or that they are all super greedy   their pay is meant to solve an agency problem the ceo does n't own the company the public does because of that the ceo has little incentive to act in the best interests of the owners rather than his own interest   so their pay is structured in a way that solves this problem they are paid based on how well their company does and how much shareholder value they create this aligns their interests with the shareholders   is this the best solution probably not   is there a better one probably   do i know it no   but mindlessly complaining about the result does n't solve the issue the issue is we need a good solution for the agency problem in an economic system that is built on public ownership and private management

the primary advantage of hfts is their speed to act upon opportunities that exist for only fractions of a second the reason why they are able to do this is because they invest heavily in hardware custom software and custom algorithms   most of the fleeting advantage as they all manage to top each other 's hardware seemingly every other day is from the hardware investment   to see the extremes that hfts will go to invest in hardware one might view this it is highly likely that the trader with the market making algorithm could have been ignorant of the hide not slide order and missed out on many more opportunities while still being successful   who is very much against this order type was not so lucky if it was truly an investment bank then it was unlikely that they were actually front running which is very illegal and easily possible with much more low tech means since companies like citadel handle most orders now and they have not been successful in investment banking the reality of hft is slowly coming to light that while hft can provide extremely consistent returns with enormous sharpe ratios the capital investment is equally enormous and the amount of capital that can be employed is also as enormously limited   after all the richest people on the planet are not hft owners also when it comes to time periods longer than their results become very human

i am suggesting that on a macro level a wage increase of 2 would offset a 1 increase in unemployment    more spending power equals more demand and more demand creates jobs while hard in the short term bob 's job will come back but with a higher wage     if your goal is that no one lose their job capitalism is not the economic system for you

like i said to the others do a remind me i am not trying to hate on you or your views but facebook is not the future not even close they survive because the vision of facebook is heavily flawed   also gopro being worth half what is with in 5 years only shows your lack of research into the company and to what i said i also said that the money i made was essentially a drop in the bucket of what i wanted to invest but i held back heavily because of the type of companies they are and what the stocks show the fact i made what i did on what little i put in is well awesome no i am not a billionaire but i am rather good at picking short and middle to long term well and have done well with it my only fault is i do n't trust my own judgement enough i am sorry you think snap chat is a bad long term investment because in 5 years it will be over 100 a share i do n't expect you to take or trust the advice from a random person online but you talk like you actually know which you do n't and that is ok i just gave my opinion which i have zero doubt will pan out but that is the beauty of it

the big risk for a bank in country x is that they would be unfamiliar with all the lending rules and regulations in country y. what forms and disclosures are required and all the national and local steps that would be required a mistake could leave them exposed or in violation of some obscure law plus they would n't have the resources in country y to verify the existence and the actual ownership of the property the fear would be that it was a scam this would likely cause them to have to charge a higher interest rate and higher fees not to mention that the currency ratio will change over the decades    the risks would be large

when you have multiple assets available and a risk free asset cash or borrowing you will always end up them if you have a reasonable objective function   however you seem to have constrained yourself to 100 investment   combine that with the fact that you are considering only two assets and you can easily have a solution where only one asset is desired in the portfolio   the fact that you describe the us fund as dominating the fund indicates that this may be the case for you   ordinarily diversification benefits the overall portfolio even if one asset dominates another but it may not in your special case notice that these funds are both already highly diversified so all you are getting is cross border diversification by getting more than one   that may be why you are getting the solution you are   i 've seen a lot of suggested allocations that have weights similar to what you are using finding an optimal portfolio given a vector of expected returns and a covariance matrix is very easy with some reliable results   fancy models get pretty much the same kinds of answers as simple ones   however getting a good covariance matrix is hard and getting a good expected return vector is all but impossible   unfortunately portfolio results are very sensitive to these inputs   for that reason most of us use portfolio theory to guide our intuition but seldom do the math for our own portfolio   in any model you use your weak link is the expected return and covariance   more sophisticated models do n't usually help produce a more reasonable result for that reason your original strategy 80 20 sounds pretty good to me   not sure why you are not diversifying outside of equities but i suppose you have your reasons

you 're focusing on the wrong thing here you should be paying off debt not borrowing   thus your credit score is of almost no relevance   there is no lasting effect from credit utilization one cycle after you have everything paid off it 's going to have the same credit score no matter what order you pay them off in i would look at which of the first three has the highest interest rate and pay it off first   you can pay any of them off in one month so whichever you pick you get one card down to $ 0 and restore it 's grace period   after that sort them by interest rate

as mhoran said the risks of buying a bankrupt company are huge and even successful bankruptcy do n't involve keeping the same stock for instance the gm bankruptcy was resolved by the company more or less selling all its valuable assets brands factories inventory to a new version of itself using that money to pay off what liabilities it could and then dissolving the new company then issued new stock and you had to buy the new stock to see it rise the old stock became worthless aa could have gone the same way delta could have bought it out of bankruptcy and consumed it outright with any remaining shareholders being paid off at market value that 's probably the best the market was hoping for instead the deal is a much more equal merger brings a very large airport network and aircraft fleet to the table and delta brings its cash an also considerable fleet and network and a management team that 's kept that airline solvent the stockholders therefore expect to be paid off at a much higher per share price either in a new combined stock in delta stock or in cash

this is only partly true   the main problem is that the average person is not a fully informed healthcare consumer    for example if you go to your local doctor with lower back pain one doctor might prescribe a whole bunch of expensive tests another might tell you to go to a and yet another might tell you to take some cheap pain killers and come back in six weeks time if nothing has changed most people will have no way of knowing which is the best course of action then in a country like the us which is very all the doctors will recommend the most comprehensive and expensive care package so that they do n't get sued    ultimately economists do not work in healthcare and are not qualified to recommend the best financial model for healthcare delivery   to quote who knew that healthcare was so complicated certainly not the economists

can they change the weights yes will they it depends are etf 's fixed from their inception to their de listing it 's actually not possible for weights to be fixed since different assets have different returns so the weights are constantly changing as long as the market is moving usually after a certain period or a substantial market move fund managers would rebalance and bring the weights back to a certain target the target weights what your question is really about are n't necessarily the same as the initial weights but often times they are it depends on the objective of the etf which is stated in prospectus in your example if the manager drops the weight of the most volatile one the returns of the etf and the 5 stocks could be substantially different in the next period this is not desirable when the etfs objective is to track performance of those 5 stocks   most if not all etfs are passively managed the managers do n't get paid for active management so they do n't have incentive to adjust the weights if their funds are tracking the benchmarks just fine

an option is a financial instrument instrument that gives you the right but not the obligation to do some transaction in the future at a given price an employee stock option is a kind of call option it gives you the right but not the obligation to buy the stock at a certain price the exercise price usually set as the price of the stock when the option was granted the idea is that you would exercise the option buy the stock at the given price as provided by the option if the value of the stock is higher than the exercise price and not if it is lower the option is gifted to you but that does not mean you get any stock if and when you choose to exercise the option you would buy the stock with your own money at what time you can exercise the option and how many shares you can exercise at a given time will be specified in the agreement usually you can only exercise a particular share after it has vested according to some vesting schedule and you lose the ability to exercise after you no longer work for the company plus perhaps a grace period or after the option expires

you can apply for a position with any company you like whether or not you are a shareholder however owning shares in a company even lots of shares in a company does not entitle you to having them even look at your resume for any job let alone the ceo position you generally can not buy your way into a job   the hiring team if they are doing their job correctly will only hire you if you are qualified for the job not based on what your investments are stockholders get a vote at the shareholders meeting and a portion of the profits dividend and that 's about it   they usually do n't even get a discount on products let alone a job of course if you own a significant percentage of the stock you can influence the selections to the board of directors   with enough friends on the board you could theoretically get yourself in the ceo position that way

in cases like this you should be aware that tax treaties may exist and that countries are generally willing to enter into them their purpose is to help prevent double taxation tax treaties often times give you a better tax rate than even being a resident of the countries in question for instance the italy to us tax rate is lower than simply doing business in many united states   this should guide your google search here is something i found for germany spain it appears that the dividend tax rate under that treaty is 5 to my understanding the income tax rates are often multiples higher i read that spain 's income tax rate is 18   so what i would do is see if there is the possibility of deferring taxes in the lower tax and then doing a large one time dividend when but germany is n't really known for its low taxes being a federal republic the taxes are levied by both the states and the federal government look to see if your business structure can avoid being taxed as the entity level ie your business earnings are always distributed to the owners which are not germany citizens or residents as dividends so this way you avoid germany 's 15 federal corporate tax and you avoid spain 's 18 income tax and instead get spanish dividends at 5 tax anyway contact a tax attorney to help interpret the use of the regulations but this is the frame of mind you should be thinking in because it looks like spain is willing to do a tax credit if you pay taxes in germany several options here to lower your tax footprint

from rich dad poor dad 3 major things with rental real estate in addition to mortgage interest you also deduct property taxes and must claim depreciation cost of house 27.5 years business expenses for example buy a yacht and put it in a charter fleet deduct interest on the loan depreciation of the asset property taxes upkeep of the boat your business earns profit from the boat which if i recall correctly is taxed at a lower rate you get to go sailing for free then there was the concept of the businesses if you own a restaurant create another business to own the property and the equipment used in the company then lease the equipment and rent the land to the restaurant now admittedly i thought this was like the daylight savings plan of tax avoidance i mean now are n't you essentially having two companies paying half the taxes i am sure there are well paid cpas that make the math happen perhaps using insurance plans perhaps each business funds a whole life insurance account and contributes vast amounts into that then you take a loan from your insurance account loans of course are not income so not taxed the third way is to create your own bank banks are required to have reserves of 9 meaning if i have $ 100 dollars the allows me to loan $ i then charge you 20 interest or $ now how much can i loan   well you can see how profitable that is sure you pay taxes but when you print your own money who cares most of this is just from books and government publications but that was my general understanding of it feel free to correct the finer points

you 're talking about espp for espp it makes sense to utilize the most the company allows i.e. in your case 15 of the paycheck if you can afford deferring that much i assume you can when the stocks are purchased i would sell them immediately not hold this way you have ~10 premium as your income pretty much guaranteed unless the stock falls significantly on the very same day and almost no exposure this sums up to be a nice 1.5 yearly guaranteed bonus on top of any other compensation as to keeping the stocks this depends on how much you believe in your company and expect the stocks to appreciate being employed and dependent on the company with your salary i 'd avoid investing in your company as you 're invested in it deeply as it is

it 's interesting that you use so many different risk measures here 's what i 'd like to know more in detail   1 about the use of i 've heard from a friend may be unreliable that some investment managers like does n't use var for assessing risk and maintaining capital adequacy requirements rather some firms only rely on tracking error beta standard deviation etc why do you think is this so is n't var supposed to be a widely accepted risk measure   2 the whole expected shortfall vs. var debate i 've read some papers comparing expected shortfall and mainly they criticize var for not being able to consider the 1 probability left where losses can probably skyrocket to infinity if i need to choose between the two which do you think is better and why

i 'd recommend getting online quotes from several insurance companies   during the process of getting a quote you will be asked for the year make model of your car   you can put in one of   the cars you were thinking about buying and get a quote   then start over and try with a different type of car   this should show you how the insurance will compare between different cars    i 've done this in the past when i was trying to make a decision on a car purchase   it takes a while but seemed worth it to me

just an fyi this can be a risky move unless you have been in the industry for a while or are extremely well averse in investment management research keep it pretty short in a lot of ways you might want to think about tailoring it more like a sell side report also make sure you understand the style of investing the pm company you are applying to likes    the reason i say this is because every buy side shop is different some do 1 2 page write ups with models and walk through 's others will expect 60 page decks i.e. the longer the deck the more you have that can go wrong if one tiny thing is wrong or you have a typo anywhere it hurts you more than it helps that you wrote something long i once had the wrong rating on one issuance of a bond ladder i was pitching it 's all the pm 's focused on   the more important aspect is that you understand the shop you are applying to and then tailoring the pitch to them for example do n't do a growth tech company with an forward p e if you 're applying to a fundamental value shop it shows you did n't do research on the firm you 're applying to and that you wo n't fit the culture this is part of why i was saying that this can be a risky move if the firm is large enough to have an hr department they likely have a lot of different investment styles in house   finally try to keep it to a small mid cap company analysts pms follow stocks all day long and will most likely have an opinion on 99 of large caps no matter the sector   in summary i 'd recommend a 1 2 page sell side style write up with a backup model printed excel file kiss keep it simple stupid have a summary couple years worth of historical 's 2 years forward and a few main bullet points of why you like them in your case this pitch should be something to the interest so that you can nail a real pitch in the interview if you get an interview know everything about everything in the industry as well as that specific company for example lets say you do a smartphone secular theme investment do you know what outstanding aapl android cases there are and more importantly how would each ruling likely affect the marketplace this is because i can guarantee if you 're pitching to another tech guy he knows and has an educated opinion on it also in many cases having a great model can mean more than a long write up it shows that you 're good with numbers and can think about future earnings which are all that matter   last point imo you 'd be better off trying to get your foot in the door through networking than hr hr does n't really do much on the buy side with recruiting and wo n't really understand what to look for in a good pitch they 're hr after all not an analyst try to meet someone over coffee and then have a pitch ready to bring out discuss the buy side is selective enough that usually when positions open up it 's either because they are creating one for you or they already have an idea of who is going to fill it this mean hr has little to no say in helping you get in you 'll have a lot more success this way than to a bunch of hr emails

it sounds like the kinds of planners you 're talking to might be a poor fit because they are essentially selling investments for a commission some thoughts on finding a financial planner the good kind of financial planner is going to be able to do a comprehensive plan look at your whole life goals and non investment issues such as insurance you should expect to get a document with a monte carlo simulation showing your odds of success if you stick to the plan for investments you should expect to see a recommended asset allocation and an emphasis on low cost no commission commission is load funds see some of the other questions from past posts for example what exactly can a financial advisor do for me and is it worth the money a good place to start for a planner might be there 's also a franchise of planners providing hourly advice called the planning network i helped my mom hire someone from them and she was very happy though i do think your results would depend mostly on the individual rather than the franchise anyway see they do require planners to be fee only and working on their cfp credential you should really look for the certified financial planner cfp credential there are a lot of credentials out there but many of them mean very little and others might be hard to get but not mean the right thing some other meaningful ones include chartered financial analyst cfa which would be a solid investment expert though not necessarily someone knowledgeable in financial planning generally and irs enrolled agent which means someone who knows a lot about taxes a cpa accountant would also be pretty meaningful a law degree and estate law know how is very relevant to many planning situations too some not very meaningful certifications include certified mutual fund specialist which is n't bogus but it 's much easier to get than cfp or cfa registered investment adviser ria which mostly means the person is supposed to understand securities fraud laws but does n't mean they know a lot about financial planning there are some pretty bogus certifications out there many have retirement or senior in the name a good question for any planner is are you a fiduciary which means are they legally required to act in your interests and not their own most sales oriented advisors are not fiduciaries they would n't charge you a big sales commission if they were and they are not on your side legally speaking it 's a good idea to check with your state regulators or the sec to confirm that your advisor is registered and ask if they have had any complaints small advisors usually register with the state and larger ones with the federal sec if they are registered they may still be a salesperson who is n't acting in your interests but at least they are following the law you can also see if they 've been in trouble in the past when looking for a planner one firm i found had a professional looking web site and did n't seem sketchy at all but the state said they were not properly registered and not in compliance other ideas a good book is it 's very and you 'd feel more confident talking to someone maybe with more background information for companies to work with stick to the ones that are very consumer friendly and sell no load funds vanguard is probably the one you 'll hear about most but t. rowe price fidelity usaa are some other good names fidelity is a bit of a mixture with some cheap consumer friendly investments and other products that are less so avoid companies that are all about charging commission pretty much anyone selling an annuity is probably bad news annuities have some valid uses but mostly they are a bad deal not knowing your specific situation in any detail it 's very likely that 60k is not nearly enough and that making the right investment choices will make only a small difference you could invest poorly and maybe end up with 50 k when you retire or invest well and maybe end up with 80 90k but your goal is probably more like a million dollars or more and most of that will come from future savings this is what a planner can help you figure out in detail it 's virtually certain that any planner who is for real and not a ripoff salesperson will talk a lot about how much you need to save and so forth not just about choosing investments do n't be afraid to pay for a planner it 's well worth it to pay someone a thousand dollars for a really thorough fiduciary plan with your interests foremost the free planners who get a commission are going to get a whole lot more than a thousand dollars out of you even though you wo n't write a check directly be sure to convert those mutual fund expense ratios and sales commissions into actual dollar amounts to summarize find someone you 're paying not someone getting a commission look for that cfp credential showing they passed a demanding exam maybe read a quick and easy book like the one i mentioned just so you know what the advisor is talking about and do n't rush into anything and btw i think you ought to be fine with a solid plan you and your husband have time remaining to work with good luck

there is no central government signature database   at least not in the us and at least not yet for debit and credit card transactions the merchant may check the signature on your against the signature on back of the card   this is intended to verify that you did n't steal the card so if you want to change the signature on the back of the card all you need to do is get a new card and re sign it   your card has an expiration date   when that happens you will get a new card to re sign   if your card expires soon you can just wait if you are impatient you can call your bank and ask for a new card   if they give you a lot of grief about issuing a new card it is an unusual request you can tell them you lost your card and need a new one   in that case they will typically disable the old card and issue a new one with a new account number note that if you want to change how you sign your name there are some other places you should also update also keep in mind that people 's signatures naturally drift over time   this fact is generally understood and accepted by people who check signatures

who the fuck cares about exhausting sorry dude that is not the criteria   you examples are and non responsive to my points but one more time to humor you nope your janitor who did not study to get a degree so he can not get your ex 's job while your ex can get the janitor job if she wanted to so nope one is going to get paid better   brain surgery will put your gf at upper middle lower upper class   btw saying but to argue cleaning kids and shit off the bathroom floor takes less skill and should be paid less yeah no is not a valid argument it is your opinion and by this point in the conversation it is no longer necessary to repeat yourself in you can repeat it till you are blue in the face and it will still remain your unsubstantiated opinion not only is the fact that cleaning requires less skill one of the reasons why janitors get paid less but to boot the fact that it requires less skill means that more people can do the job and basic supply demand inevitable leads to lower price which in this case is lower salary   the fact is that there will always be a lower class it being the part below the middle class and it takes skills to pull oneself out or luck to be born rich which i do agree is unfortunate if you have no skills or chose to work a job that does not require skill you will be in the lower class    so now besides a basic english class you seem to need a basic logic class i 'd suggest looking that stuff up online or if you need the more structured environment your local community college

to me it looks pretty good 10 per year is a pretty good return lagging behind the indexes is normal it is hard to beat the indexes over a long period of time the longer the period the lesser the chances to succeed however half a year is a relatively short period of time and you should check your investments a little bit deeper i 'm assuming you 're not invested in one thing so you should check per investment how it is performing if you have funds check each fund against the relevant index for that fund if you have stocks check against the relevant industry indexes etc also check the fees you pay to each fund and the plan they come out of your pocket lowering the return

if you are not open to changing the amount of money you are willing to spend your options are limited why change your amounts and proportions your situation changed you got married divorced purchased a new car the company added free disability coverage if the amount spent per year ca n't change then you are asking how to review if your proportions are correct the first thing is to look at what must you spend it on if you have a mortgage or car loan the bank will tell you the minimum amount if you own a car the state will tell you the minimum amount for auto coverage if there is any money left look at life and disability these can wreck the life of your dependents   when you have meet those needs then increase auto and home to cover additional liability

agreed   also i think something missing here is the perception that companies are profiting enough to warrant these salary increases   the current competitive landscape in america is tough   aside from a premier selection of companies most are getting by and do not have the means to raise wages in the ways suggested   these companies could raise their prices and that 's been happening and will probably continue but it 's mostly going to affect the same people that it 's serving to increase wages for   the real issue as i see it is that there is n't enough capital in circulation   americans are n't spending and massive capital reserves sit with the 1 that are gun shy on investing understandably so

say a stock is listed in nasdaq and the same company has a stock listed in tsx does the nasdaq price affect the tsx price as trading not directly basically an exchange is a market and the price is defined only by supply and demand in that market however any substantial price differential for a commodity traded in multiple market creates an arbitrage opportunity and there are many traders whose job it is exactly to find and use such opportunities their activity in turn has the effect of reducing the price to the point where transaction costs make them unprofitable with high frequency traders around the time for a price differential to disappear is nowadays measured in milliseconds if a trader buys from one exchange will it affect the price of the other only through the mechanism mentioned above   are there any benefits to being listed in two exchanges it increases the liquidity of a stock

as said by others buying shares of a company will not support it directly but let 's think about two example companies company a which has 90 stocks owned by supporters and company b which has only 1 of stocks owned by supporters both companies release bad news for example profits have decreased in company b most investors might want to sell their stock quickly and the price will plummet in company a the supporters continue believing in the company and will not want to sell it the price will drop less usually but it can drop even more if the sellers of company a are very desperate to get rid of the stock so why is it important for the company to have a high stock price in the short term it 's not important one example is that the company can release more stocks and receive more financing by doing that other reasons are listed here

a practical issue is that insider trading transfers wealth from most investors to the few insiders if this were permitted non insiders would rarely make any money and they 'd stop investing that would then defeat the purpose of the capital markets which is to attract capital a moral issue is that managers and operators of a company should act in shareholders interests insider trading directly takes money from other shareholders and transfers it to the insider it 's a nasty conflict of interest and would allow any ceo of a public company to make ton of money quickly regardless of their job performance in short shareholders and management should succeed or suffer together so their interests are as aligned as possible and managers have the proper incentives

i 'm going to go with ridiculous notion   the vast majority of businesses are legitimate run by honest people trying to earn a living for themselves and their employees   these days almost all of them accept credit cards   crooked businesses are a very small minority when a bad business over charges you you dispute the charge and you get your money back   but that 's not all that happens   the bad merchant pays penalties for this and if it happens more than a couple of times the merchant loses their merchant account with their bank which means that they lose their ability to accept credit card payments anymore   a crooked business is not able to rob people via credit card for very long at all a would certainly not be able to include every legitimate business   and a blacklist would never be able to be kept up to date as bad businesses come and go continuously as soon as a business was added to the blacklist they would lose their merchant account and would no longer need to be on the list what you are describing is very rare   my brother once had a bad experience with a tech support company where they were repeatedly charging him for a service they never performed   but a credit card chargeback took care of it   if that company made a habit of that i 'm sure that they got in trouble with their bank instead the most common credit card fraud happens when crooks use your credit card at perfectly legitimate businesses   but your blacklist would n't help you with that at all

buffett is a value investor his goal is to buy good companies when the market is overly worried and prices them below intrinsic value when the market is highly priced it is much more difficult for him to find things that he thinks are at an attractive price when people are very worried and the market has crashed stocks are then priced below their intrinsic value and he can use the cash he keeps in the company to make attractive purchases remember that buffett is not concerned with the ups and downs of the price of berkshire hathaway stock he is concerned with the economic value of the assets that the company owns so if all stock prices crash and he can buy things that are at bargain prices he is happy no matter what berkshire stock price does in the short run one consequence of value investing is that because you are buying assets at bargain prices the total value of your assets drops less in a bear market than the highly priced stuff that drives the major indexes

financial aid formulas determine expected family contribution   for example my alma mater now has a list price of over $ 65k year   the average student today actually pays $ 42k year after grants   students with rich parents pay more than that   students with poor parents pay less than that   lets say list prices for my kids colleges average $ 110k year while they are in school   if we only make $ 200k then based on our income alone efc would start in the low $ per year   if we have $ 1 m saved in taxable accounts 529s rental properties etc then we also have to pay of the value of those every year for the eight years my kids will be attending an extra $ year every year for 8 years   if that $ 1 m is in assets that do n't count such as retirement accounts and equity in primary residence then it does n't increase the price my kids are billed   that 's a pretty big incentive to put everything i can in home equity roth ira spousal roth ira traditional 401k after tax 401k and hsa   if i could afford to save more i 'd switch from traditional to roth 401k and pre pay retirement taxes at a higher marginal rate rather than have the savings on the side subjected to the college wealth income taxes which are effectively a much higher difference between the 25 now and 15 later federal tax brackets   profile and consensus formulas have slightly different percentages and count some home equity if you have an expensive house but the general idea is the same

lower risk of having to fight to get their money back obviously that 's what credit rating is supposed to predict paying your bills on time and paying off the balance in full every month are different questions they want to know that you will make the minimum payments at least and that you will eventually pay back the loan compare that with subprime and/or loan sharks where the assumption is that being late or defaulting is more common and interest rates are truly obscene in order to make a profit despite that

i guess most banks will not have an issue with that arrangement the bank take collateral in the house for the amount your girlfriend needs to borrow from her part of the house most likely the bank will accept the house value as what you pay for it assuming you pay fair market value otherwise they will contact a valuation company to put a value of your new house if they feel that her share of the house 50 can cover her loan they will definitely agree with the deal you being a foreigner will probably have little to say in the matter as long as you do not need to borrow money for your share of the house

at its heart i think the best spirit of donation is helping others less fortunate than yourself but as long as the us remains solvent the chief benefit of paying down the national debt is like paying off a credit card lowering the future interest payments the u.s. taxpayer has to make since the wealthy pay a disproportionately large portion of taxes per capita your hard earned money would be disproportionately benefitting the wealthy so i 'd recommend you do one or both of the following instead target your donations to a charity whose average beneficiary is less fortunate than yourself take political action with an aim towards balancing the federal budget since the us national debt is principally financed in the form of 30 year treasuries the u.s. will be completely out of debt if it can maintain a balanced budget for 30 years see below

i 'm curious so i 'm going to calculate it for my area i 'm in an average priced metro and a 2 bedroom apartment out here is going to cost you at least $ 1400 700 each with a and that 's if you go minutes from downtown it does n't really drop off any more than that the further you go out you 'll also still need renters insurance and to cover half the utilities lets tack on another $ 75 here conservatively at that far out you need a car and the insurance gas and maintenance costs that go with it assuming you go with something cheap say $ 5k with a payment around $ 120 a month + $ 60 a month for insurance another $ 60 for gas and accruing $ 30 a month for maintenance you 're going to need a cell phone and if you 're on a plan alone it 's not cheap with the big 4 providers so you 'll go with someone smaller for $ 50 a month even though the service is mediocre you 'll need to eat so being cheap and buying store brands and sale items you get your groceries down to $ 120 a month so that should cover the bottom level of 's pyramid which is far from glamorous that puts your living costs at $ a month being that it is a major metro minimum wage within the city is $ assuming you have a job that 's 40 hours a week that puts you at $ a month before taxes are withheld since you make so little taxes would only be around $ a month that leaves $ 49 for saving spending emergencies i live in a state that has very good support for the aca as well so the $ 300 credit roughly covers the cost of the monthly premium the deductible is obviously still impossible to pay but you do n't get hit with the penalty at year end and the hospital still gets mostly paid and you might just be able to avoid bankruptcy if the hospital is willing to negotiate the payment plan with you   so what are the conclusions here it 's possible to skate by for a short while assuming you can live without any social life stay healthy and have no emergencies   you also need the self discipline of a monk and to live in an area that supports a minimum wage relative to living costs and the aca

several people have mentioned the obvious inflation   but let 's assume we are talking about real inflation adjusted prices one argument is that populations keep rising while the land does not change   so the price of homes in desirable places gets pushed up and people move to second best locations pushing those prices up etc   similar argument holds for raw materials steel granite fine wood etc another argument is that the economy has a long term upward trajectory that 's the assumption   so each generation as a whole has more disposable real income than the previous   as disposable income increases people tend to put more and more money into their homes pushing prices up   true for all goods of course but it may be more true for real estate than for other types of goods

it is true that all else being equal you will pay a lower amount of total interest by paying down your highest interest rate debts first   however all else is not always equal   i 'm going to try to come up with some reasons why it might be better in some circumstances to pay your debts in a different order   and i 'll try to use as much math as possible   let 's say that your goal is to eliminate all of your debt as fast as possible   the faster you do this the lower the total interest that you will pay   now let 's consider the different methods that you could take to get there you could pay the highest interest first you could pay the lowest interest first or you could pay something in the middle first   no matter which path you choose the quicker you pay everything off the lower total interest you will pay   in addition to that the quicker you pay everything off the difference in total interest paid between the most optimal method and the least optimal method will be less   to put this in mathematical notation = 0 given that anything we can do to speed up the time it takes to get to debt free is to our advantage when paying large amounts of debt as fast as possible sacrifice is needed   and this means that psychology comes into play   i do n't know about you but for me the system makes everything easier   after all is what gets us to write answers here on se one way to do this is to eliminate individual debts as quickly as possible   for example let 's say that i 've got 10 debts   5 of them are for $ 1k each   3 of them are for $ 5k each 1 is a $ 20k car loan and 1 is a $ 100k mortgage   each one has a monthly payment let 's say that i 've got $ 3k sitting in the bank that i want to use to my debt reduction   i could pay all $ 3k toward one of my larger loans or i could immediately pay off 3 of my 10 loans   ignore interest for the moment and let 's say that we are going to pay off the smallest loans first   when i eliminate these three loans three of my monthly payments are also gone   now let 's say that with the money i was paying toward these eliminated debts and some other money i was able to scrape together $ 500 a month that i want to use toward debt reduction   in four months i 've eliminated the last two $ 1k debts and i 'm down to 5 debts instead of 10   achievement unlocked instead of this strategy i could have paid toward my largest interest rate   let 's say that was one of the $ 5k loans   i paid the $ 3k toward the bank to it and because i still had all the monthly payments after that i was only able to scrape together $ 400 a month extra toward debt reduction   in four months i still have 10 debts now let 's say that after these four months i have a bad month and some unexpected expenses come up   if i 've eliminated 5 of my debts my monthly payments are less and i 'll have an easier month then i would have had if i still had 10 monthly payments to deal with each time i eliminate a debt the amount extra i have each month to tackle the remaining debts gets bigger   and if your goal is eliminating debt quickly these early wins can really help motivate you on   it really feels like you are getting somewhere when your monthly bills go down   it also helps you with the debt free mindset   you start to see a future where you are n't sending payments to the banks each month   this method of paying your smaller debts first has been popularized in recent years by dave ramsey and he calls it the debt snowball method there might be other reasons why you would pick one debt over another to pay first   for example let 's say that one of your loans is with a bank that has terrible customer service   they do n't send you bills on time they process your payment late their website stinks they are a constant source of stress and you are getting sick of them   that would be a great reason to pay that debt first and never set foot in that bank again in conclusion if you have a constant amount of extra cash each month that you are going to use to reduce your debt and this will never change then yes you will save money over the long run by paying the highest interest debt first   however if you are trying to eliminate your debt as fast as possible and you are sacrificing in your budget sending every extra penny you can scrape together toward debt reduction the snowball method of knocking out the small debts first can help motivate you to continue to sacrifice toward your goal and can also ease the cash flow situation in difficult months when you find yourself with less extra to send in

the simplest way to handle this is for you to rent the apartment and sublet to the girlfriend and friend   i 'd split the utilities evenly one third from each   the reason for this is that each of you contribute evenly to generating the utility bills   it 's not like your income makes the water cost more for you    utilities are driven by usage   dividing them other than equally is likely to lead to more problems than it solves   also it seems unlikely that a different apartment would use significantly different water electricity or internet   those are driven by the appliances rather than the size or location of the apartment   only pay more for the utilities if you want something that they do n't   for example maybe you want hbo etc   it would be reasonable for you to pay the entire premium if that 's a luxury that they simply would n't buy    i 'd also divide the groceries evenly if you share and share alike   if you eat separate meals you can buy separate groceries    if the rent ca n't be split evenly but you could afford it alone then you can just sign up for it   if you break up with the girlfriend and/or the friend moves out you 're still fine   you have your fancy apartment and can afford it    the bigger problem comes if you ca n't afford the apartment without both the girlfriend and friend contributing   if so you should probably avoid this situation   it 's fragile   any person leaving would put you in a financially untenable position   you can look for a new tenant to replace your friend but you ca n't exactly rely on getting a new move in girlfriend on demand    neither the girlfriend nor the friend can afford to be on the main lease   in case of emergency or tragedy they could n't replace you as a tenant   that 's why they should sublet   then their obligation is to you not to the landlord    how much apartment would the girlfriend and friend get if you were n't involved   what rents would they pay   that 's probably how much rent they should pay for this apartment   you want a better apartment or a better location   that 's on you    you should only do this if you want to do it   if you want to share apartments with the girlfriend and friend then do so   work out something equitable   if you plan on moving in together to reduce your costs then you do n't sound like you are compatible   obviously there are reasons to move in with the girlfriend aside from costs   why ca n't the friend get his or her own place   the added rent probably wo n't do more than pay for the added room you could get a one bedroom without the friend    that points to an alternative way of calculating the friend 's contribution   the difference between a two bedroom and a one bedroom apartment   that 's the additional cost of the bigger apartment   if the friend ca n't afford that then this might not be a good idea    make sure that you can afford the apartment if one or both of the friend and girlfriend move out   you can eventually replace the friend as the tenant but do n't rely on doing the same with the girlfriend   share utilities evenly   possibly groceries too   the friend should pay at least the added cost of the additional bedroom   do n't expect either to pay more in the new apartment than they would pay without you   you should be the only one on the main lease sublet to them

i think also by insurance from other the risk gets spread around and these guys actually know what they are doing i 've heard insurers sometimes do n't using really rough thumb rules like buy 2 cats and end up with suboptimal reinsurance policies but they always make sure they are covered the have a better idea of what the risk is and can outsmart the insurers when they sell the reinsurance policies    expanding on the 2 cat thing insurers need to keep enough reserves + reinsurance to cover everything the gist is if they buy 2 catastrophe insurance then the will cover losses over 2 of the portfolio so the insurers only need to cover the first 2 of their portfolio it might be a bit more complicated than this of course   they might be better keeping higher reserves than 2 self insuring more buying less re insurance or they might be better keeping less than 2 reserves and self insuring less buying more re insurance it depends on the price they negotiate with the re insurer whatever the case they have to make sure that they can cover any disaster and the government will regulate this or end up getting pressured to fund bail outs as insurers go bankrupt and home owners are left with nothing

with the second example if you continue to read on you will see that although directors must try and maximise shareholders wealth that precedence does n't change however the interpretation of the actions and whether they maximise shareholders wealth does for example giving money to charity with regards to the v. ford case would probably have been blocked on the grounds that it decreases shareholder wealth but later cases such as a. p. smith manufacturing co. v. say that donations can increase shareholders wealth in the long run so it gives a broader coverage of the actions deemed to increase shareholder wealth   the second is related to short term vs long term wealth but part of the reason for it was due to the inability of paramount to prove that the value increase for shareholders in the long run from selling to viacom rather than would be larger than the difference between the two offers which was 1.3 billion then there is also the issue of shareholders rights and the ability to block shareholders from selling to whomever they want so as i said it 's related but the issue is n't solely and simply about short term vs long term wealth   both examples are kind of weak as in the first well the issue does n't really exist in the present day as previous case law has the definition of actions which increase shareholder wealth and in the second short term vs long term value is related but mostly tagging along with a larger issue your original statement was in matters of cost vs. quality i 'd expect publicly traded companies to prioritize short term shareholder profit or be sued by said shareholders   are there any examples where shareholders have sued simply because they wanted better short term performance over long term performance

like most other investment decisions it depends specifically in this case it depends upon your view of the fx foreign exchange market over the next few years and how sensitive you are to losses as you correctly note a hedge has a cost so it from your overall return but given that you need to repatriate the investment eventually to us dollars you need to be aware of the fluctuations of the dollar versus other currencies if you believe that over your time horizon the us dollar will be worth the same as now or less then you should not buy the hedge   if the dollar is the same the choice is was obvious   if you believe the us dollar will be weaker in the future that means that when you repatriate back to us dollars you will purchase more dollars with your foreign currency if on the other hand you believe the us dollar will get stronger then you should certainly lock in some kind of hedge   that way when your foreign currency would have effectively bought fewer us you will have made money on the hedge to make up the difference if you choose not to hedge now you can likely hedge that exposure at any time in the future separate from the initial investment purchase buy buying selling the appropriate fx instrument good luck

i would say that there is no real difference   asset management companies that is part of large banking groups usually seat in separate entities and operate independently from the rest of the bank assuming proper procedures and regulators usually check that are in place they will not share information with the rest of the bank and their assets are clearly segregated from the rest of the bank they have the same fiduciary duties as an independent am and are probably using the broker dealer services of other banks as well as their parent reputation is a key issue for banks and conflict of interests are usually managed properly independence also comes and goes the corporate history of is a good example was once an independent asset manager in 2003 it merged with lehman brothers thus loosing its independence when lehman went bankrupt in 2008 nb did not join its parent company in bankruptcy and did not lose the assets of its clients the company continued to operate until it was acquired by the management finally it is mostly a question of marketing and positioning

maybe not but i think the point was making is that you chart a pretty tight relation to price hikes by barrel and price increases at the pump over time    price drops by barrel are n't usually followed by a drop at the pump though as it takes a while for competition to drive that down    so while it 's good news that oil prices are dropping per barrel for non gasoline uses it 's fair to be totally cynical about the prospect of a cheaper prices at the pump when you hear news like this   watching that per barrel rate drop and knowing this means a nice cushy profit trough for exxon always comes with a slight taste of

keep in mind this is an opinion piece the foreign sovereign act would have argentina from virtually all of these suits lets sovereigns opt out of its protections which argentina did argentina waived immunity from suit in new york state or federal court and its immunity from the attachment of its assets within the us to satisfy a judgement    in this particular case it also agreed this issuance of debt would rank with its other debt obligations and without any preference among themselves emphasis added 1994 bondholder agreement this is the clause the court used when deciding whether argentina could pay some bondholders and not others it is fairly that bondholders are all on equal footing it also added that these debt obligations would rank at least equally with argentina 's other unsecured debt    this was not a coincidence by issuing in new york and subjecting itself to new york us law argentina was able to obtain a much more favorable borrowing rate argentina was the of the debt agreement where it promised to treat all borrowers the same and it was the party who waived its inherent under us law it benefited greatly from the substantially lower borrowing costs it enjoyed by doing so    because argentina waived its sovereign the court looked to the language in the contract it states the debt will all be treated the same and will be subject to ny us law it is hard to say it is unfair for a new york court to enforce a contract argentina wrote and then subjected itself to new york jurisdiction law    note three us government agencies sided with argentina justice state treasury claiming should at least partially apply regardless of waiver they made mostly policy arguments about how sovereigns should enjoy at least partial immunity argentina 's debt contract was very liberal with its waiver of sovereign immunity so it is not surprising the court looked to the actual contract when deciding what rights bondholders have

depends on the insurance company itself as well as the costs of treatments imagine an ideal scenario where costs of treatments stayed the same and that all insurance plans were segregated and pulled from the same pool of funds to pay for treatments then employer subsidized health insurance plans would be unaffected by the drama in the aca plans those are the factors to consider from my understanding but i would n't be surprised if the burdens of accepting people that would previously never have been serviced by these companies has greatly distorted the market as a whole

in many cases the expenses are not pulled out on a specific day so this would n't work on the other hand some funds do charge an annual or quarterly fee if your investment in the fund is larger than the minimum but lower than a small balance value many funds will reduce or eliminate this fee if you signup for electronic forms or other electronic services some will also eliminate the fee if the total investment in all your funds is above a certain level for retirement funds what you suggest could be made more complex because of annual limits though if you were below the limits you could decide to add the extra funds to cover those expenses as the end of the year approached

what you need will depend on a number of factors that are n't clear from the question this coverage is simply called vacant home insurance but not all companies are willing to offer this coverage unfortunately in new york insurers can also legally drop your standard homeowners coverage if they become aware that your property has become vacant for 30 days or more the insurer 's concerns typically a standard homeowners policy will have an exclusion clause for vacant homes the insurance company 's concern is that without someone in the home they will be at risk for break ins and if you 've ever seen flip men on spike you 'll know this is a serious concern great show by the way they will use a risk model to calculate an estimated risk for the property this is why a seasonal vacation home in a populated area is often less of a concern than a family home in an urban area if they estimate the risk to be low some insurance companies will allow to you buy back that exclusion so that vacant properties are covered in your case they have probably decided that either your options first you need to find a company that is comfortable with taking on the extra risk of a vacant home this will vary quite a bit by location but the main ones are farmer 's they use the foremost brand name in new york and castle rock there are lots of insurance agencies that also advertise these products but most of them are middlemen and use one of these two companies to actually write the coverage additionally since this is a specialty policy make sure you understand all of the details of the policy and how they vary from a regular policy including how to reduce your premium costs these are general tips from the murray group 's website an independent broker in ny on how to lower the additional cost of vacant coverage this may sound expensive but these steps will all reduce the risk of something really bad happening when you 're not there additionally do you know anyone you completely trust relative unemployed friend that might want to live in your old house rent free for a while this could work out for you if they are willing to keep the place 100 clean around the clock so that you can show the house at any time if you have additional specific questions you should be able to find an independent insurance broker in your area that would be willing to advise you on your specific situation for a flat fee best of luck with getting the home covered and sold quickly

as for refinancing many institutions charge up front fees when doing any type of vehicle loan typically this is in the neighborhood of 1 the value of the loan with a floor of $ 100 although this may vary by lender however for the loan the be secured by the vehicle the principle value must be less than the collateral value in your case this means there is a collateral shortfall of $ 4,000 when working with a traditional bank you would have two options pay the difference up front reducing the principle value of the loan or obtaining a separate loan for the difference this separate loan would often have a higher interest rate unless you have some other form of collateral to secure it with i doubt carmax would do a separate loan all that being said if you plan on selling the vehicle within the next months do n't bother refinancing it wo n't be worth the hassle

gt the 20 million people added to healthcare is a number they boast and brag about when they do nt realize from a study i m having a hard time so take it with a grain of salt roughly 65 of those people could afford health insurance prior to the aca just chose not to buy and because of the mandate were forced to    yes that is one of the reasons i supported the aca the problem of rising health care costs as one of the sources i linked to showed is the free rider problem too many people walk into the emergency room uninsured or they get emergent care that they are not covered for and the hospitals jack up the prices greatly in the hopes of getting a larger portion reimbursed by medicare now who pays for that medicare reimbursement you and i of course the taxpayers do and we pay a heavily artificially inflated version of that price this is the most jacked up form of universal health care but that is what the gop if fighting to    gt i also know that for me health insurance prior to the aca was significantly lower roughly 50 cheaper and that does nt even begin to touch the hikes a lot of people i know saw    i have no doubt this is true and another reason that i support the aca not because it equates to higher prices for you but because for the first time it made younger adults actually responsible for their medical bills when the aca was enacted we had a guy in our company who was about 23 years old he saw his insurance costs go up by 50 we covered is insurance increases because we supported him however what we found when we went back and compared the insurance that he had with the insurance that he has is that the first policy did n't cover anything but the most extreme circumstances it was a junk policy that left the taxpayer liable for a lot of stuff response x rays medicine etc there was nothing in there for preventative care which as the study i linked showed greatly impacted health for the worse    gt they have some of the lowest income tax rates in the world   again switzerland has lower tax rates than the us but they do n't even crack the top 20 when it comes to countries with low countries with the lowest tax rates in the edges out the regions other oil rich state to come in second place but still loses out to one other most of the countries in that list are relatively poor countries to the average citizen with weak infrastructure many of those countries are in which the ruling family controls the number one source of income oil so there is no taxes they just skim their money right off the top these are not countries that we would want to live retire in    switzerland succeeds with low taxes because they have a very efficient universal health care system and they have almost no military to fund    gt while i do not own my own company or have anything to do with r&amp;d i can for a fact disprove your theory   again speaking in this denotes that you can disprove every situation possible to show that government is worse than commercial as i said if you thought that before you entered my industry you quickly see the flip side of that coin    your example is a perfect example of that so you work in construction an industry in which commercial is notorious for a contract whether to government or to private and then running into unexpected that cause the job to go over schedule over budget these companies succeed because there are a very small number of providers that can accomplish certain jobs so they tend to stick around just like the big banks even though they are n't the best    its not like the government just sits around and takes it i know of at least one federal contractor who went to federal archive id for fraudulently winning contracts in my part of the country    gt the private sector will always have a need to innovate and that need will always be filled with or without the government the only difference is the private sector wo nt keep throwing money at an unsustainable rate like the government does because if they do nt see results its not worth funding   and this is why the government can succeed in areas that commercial can not this is why government got the first people on the moon not commercial this is why we have already sent missions to mars whereas musk is going to make those trips more efficient it is because government has tremendous resources that they can throw at a problem even the richest man in the world will run out of money before he can solve the big problems as i told a poster earlier spent over $ 1 t working on the problem in iraq afghanistan this was the number one killer of our troops there were many inventions that came out of this there is no company in this world that had the resources to tackle this problem solely what the government does a great job in is the troops and assembling resources to tackle a major task that would be by the individual    gt i d also like to add you are near the same

when an ipo happens the buyers pay some price let 's say $ 20 per share and the seller the company receives a different price $   who paid the commission well the commission caused a spread between buyer and seller   it does n't matter who technically pays the commission because it costs both parties   in an ipo the company technically pays the commission but they use buyers money to do it and the buyer must pay more than he she would if there was no commission the same thing happens when you buy a home   technically the seller pays both realtors commissions but it came from money the buyer gave the seller and the commissions pushed up the price so did n't the buyer pay the commission   they both did the second paragraph suggests that if the investment bankers act as a simple broker buying public securities instead of newly issued shares for their clients then the commissions will be much lower   obviously   i wonder if this is really the right interpretation though as no broker charges 4 to a large client for this service   i would need more context to be sure that 's what 's meant the is that ipos generate a lot of money for the investment bankers who act as intermediaries   if you are participating in the transaction that money is in some way coming out of your pocket even if it does n't show up as a brokerage fee on your statement

if flying business of first class allows your employee to be more productive first class or business class is worth it small compared to the person losing a day ’s work due to fatigue the ticket is worth what an extra $ 1000 a day ’s work for an executive is worth easily double that and if you are flying multiple times a week on a regular basis the extra comfort is well worth the cost

compound interest is your friend for such a low amount of cash just pop it into savings accounts or deposits when you reach about € buy one very defensive stock that pays high dividends with deposits you do n't risk anything with one stock you can lose 100 of the investment that 's why it 's important to buy defensive stock food pharma every time you hit € after buy another stock until you have about 10 different stock in different sectors in different countries then buy more stock of the ones you have in portfolio you 're own strategy is pretty good also

ca n't tell you where to go for a good policy but i can tell you that most brokers make a hefty commission out of your payments for at least a year before you even start funding the tax sheltered investment account that you 're trying to buy under the umbrella of life insurance you 'll have to do a lot of homework to hunt down a reputable discount broker or a direct policy purchase from the insurance company life insurance requires need the description is vague enough that you can probably still get the account despite being a single male with no apparent heirs to benefit but it raises the question of why you are buying the insurance whole life policies require you to maintain a certain ratio of investment to premium payment and you will likely never be able access all of the money in the account for your own personal usage compare several policies from several brokers and companies read all the critical sources you can about the pitfalls and dangers of commissions fees and taxes eating the benefits of your account verify that the insurance company you buy the policy from is financially stable after the market crash you are paying a commission to pool your money into their investment fund and if your insurer goes under you 'll have to get a portion of your money possibly only the principle back from the state insurance commissioner some companies sold pretty generous policies during the bubble and have cut their offerings way down without fixing their marketing literature and rosy promises   finally let us know what you find it never hurts to see hard numbers and to run multiple eyes over the legalese in these contracts

hiring a cpa comes into play if you 're doing something that requires judgement or planning such as valuation of internal shares in a partnership valuation of assets in an asset swap or distribution of the proceeds of a liquidation that said i would strongly suggest hiring someone who is also a tax attorney over a plain old cpa in the event you do need representation to clarify positions or assertions you 're probably going to need to hire one anyway qualified representation is much cheaper to hire up front than after the fact if all you need is help filing compliance paperwork returns software should be more than adequate

i find those government checks arguments to be more appealing in theory than in reality    ultimately it comes down to deciding who gets what and who gets to be the    capitalism is far from perfect but it decides who gets what through the individual decentralized choices of everyone again it 's not perfect by any means but it is and everyone makes decisions for themselves not for other people    government action decides who gets what through a highly indirect process of electing politicians and decisions are made by a small group of people who are under practically speaking   very little oversight or control a few people make decisions for everyone else    government action is despite all our desire and efforts to avoid this necessarily subject to the same disparities in influence control as the market it may come in different forms and the consequences may manifest differently often less readily apparent but there is no avoiding the a few people have a lot more control than everyone else problem    governments are more prone to corruption because they trade the intangible currency of power in addition to money    no matter how you go about doing so it 's always easier to counteract a private actor than a government given roughly equivalent levels of influence obviously     i understand the desire for intervention but i think we have a scary tendency to place far too much weight on good intentions and far too little weight on consequences    it 's so easy to think things through in your head i do often and come up with a plan that could obviously work exactly as intended for everyone 's benefit in doing so we forget that people are n't to be guided through life for someone else 's vision or pursuit of utopia or anything else they have lives desires interests plans of their own and theirs are just as valid as yours or mine    the reality is that you and i are probably far more similar than either of us would guess but there are still huge differences what we value what we want to do next year whether we want that promotion or want to get laid off so we can finally start our dream business whether we want money for family vacations or medical bills so many differences that i could n't ever fairly and accurately represent your interests without you actually telling me what they are    that 's just the 2 of us there are 300 million people in the us we ca n't comprehend even really knowing a thousand well enough to genuinely speak on their behalf    in theory big plans make everything better in practice they run into the reality that humans truly are n't and controlling 300 million people and predicting their responses actions is way more difficult than it seems big plans often end up with real people people who are just as deserving of opportunities and rights as everyone else getting really hurt because some guy he does n't know and who does n't know him had an idea and the power to enforce it on everyone    i 'm not saying that all government interference is bad of course and i 'm not saying it should n't happen     government interventions that are straightforward wealth transfers are probably less harmful to people like a tax on the rich to give hefty tax refunds to the poor is more direct and less prone to causing unintentional harm then things like wage manipulations

based on what you asked and your various comments on other answers this is the first time that you will be making an offer to buy a house and it seems that the seller is not using a real estate agent to sell the house that is it is what is called a fsbo for sale by owner property and you can learn a lot of about the seller 's perspective by visiting on the other hand you are a ftb first time buyer and i strongly recommend that you find out about the purchase process by googling for first time home buyer and reading some of the articles there but most important i urge you do not make a written offer to purchase the property until you understand a lot more than you currently do and a lot more than all the answers here are telling you about making an offer to buy this property   even when you feel absolutely confident that you understand everything hire a real estate lawyer or a real estate agent to write the actual offer itself the agent might well use a standard purchase offer form that his company uses or the state mandates and just fill in the yes you will need to pay a fee to these people but it is very important for your own protection and so do n't just wing it when making an offer to purchase as to how much you should offer it depends on how much you can afford to pay i will ignore the possibility that you are rich enough that you can pay cash for the purchase and assume that you will like most people be needing to get a mortgage loan to buy the house most banks prefer not to lend more than 80 of the appraised value of the house with the balance of the purchase price coming from your personal funds they will in some cases loan more than 80 but will usually charge higher interest rate on the loan require you to pay mortgage insurance etc now the appraised value is not determined until the bank sends its own appraiser to look at the property and this does not happen until your bid has been accepted by the seller what if your bid say $ 500 k is much larger than the appraised value $ 400 k on which the bank is willing to lend you only $ 320 k well you can still proceed with the deal if you have $ 180 k available to make the pay the rest or you can let the deal fall apart if you have made a properly written offer that contains the usual contingency clause that you will be applying for a mortgage of $ 400 k at rate not to exceed x% and that if you ca n't get a mortgage commitment within y days the deal is off absent such a clause you will lose the earnest money that you put into escrow for failure to follow through with the contract to purchase for $ 500k.   making an offer in the same ballpark as the market value lessens the chances of having the deal fall through note also that even if the appraised value is $ 500 k the bank might refuse to lend you $ 400 k if your loan application and credit report suggest that you will have difficulty making the payments on a $ 400 k mortgage   it is a good idea to get a pre approval from a lender saying that based on the financial information that you have provided you will likely be approved for a mortgage of $ z that is the bank thinks that you can afford the payments on a mortgage of as much as $ z that way you have some feel for how much house you can afford and that should affect what kinds of property you should be bidding on

i 'll add a bit to paul 's excellent write up foreign earned income exclusion form notice the earned there it does n't exclude capital gains interest dividends and basically everything that is not salary you pay us taxes on it from the first cent foreign tax credit foreign tax credit form 1116 does n't reduce your us tax dollar for dollar even though it may appear that it does from the generic explanations by using this form you may end up accumulating unused credit while still paying double taxes at the same time happened to me thank congress for the logical and reasonable us tax laws new fatca form 8938 as opposed to fbar that goes to the fincen in the treasury this one goes to the irs it contains very similar info but the threshold requirements are different you may have to file fbar but not these or you may have to file both being an american citizen some european banks will refuse to provide services to you again thank congress for fatca it requires foreign banks to enforce us tax regulations on us citizens and banks that wo n't will get penalized in the us many banks refuse to provide services to americans because of that because what irs requires is illegal in most countries some countries like uk and some other eu countries have signed treaties with the us to resolve this but many have n't currency conversion as i commented to paul you convert the amounts when you receive them which may have your fixed eur salary be converted to different dollar amounts every time you need to make sure you do it right pensions savings investments if you 're doing these in non us instruments prepare to be penalized us taxes foreign investments much more aggressively than domestic if you 're investing in indexes mutual funds or you 're a principle in a corporation or you create a pension account you 'll get hit by additional reporting requirements and tax tax treaties the us has tax treaties with many eu countries and equalization treaties with some the tax treaties affect the standard tax treatment by the us and some of the generic info you got here may not apply because of a tax treaty and some other rules may apply equalization treaties work similarly with regards to the social security bottom line and i know paul disagrees with me on this talk with a us licensed adviser in the country you 're going to it is very important for your tax adviser to know the relevant treaty and not read it the first time when you call him and to understand each and every financial instrument in your country missing piece of paper in your tax return can cost you thousands of dollars in penalties not exaggerating not filing form 3520 triggers a $ 10000 penalty even if there 's no tax and additional taxes

assuming the amount of your car payment and student loan are n't crazy you should be fine i would suggest starting with a baseline budget listing your monthly income and expenses be sure to include miscellaneous expenses like car maintenance insurance food clothes etc the common things that sometimes get overlooked in a budget after all of your necessary expenses fluff like entertainment does n't count if your employer has a 401k with a match i would contribute to that up to the match amount   next i would save an emergency fund to cover unforseen events such as car repairs etc $ 1000 is not an uncommon amount to see people suggest for this next i would knock out your car loan then student loan as fast as possible this will free up some cash flow which gives you more freedom to do what you want at this point you save more so you do n't have to finance the next car or have a down payment for a home or whatever   building your savings to be 3 6 months of income is a good idea this covers things like being laid off or other larger unexpected events after you get to that point how you handle your budget is pretty open

they 're not going to look very hard at the asset value except for actual cash in the bank which does n't bear much relationship to the real value of the company more likely they will look at the last three years earnings and choose a target p e ratio based on that the owner 's share depends entirely on how much of the business they choose to sell if the business is worth $ 60 m and they want to raise $ 20 m for themselves then that means selling 33 of the company if they want to raise $ 20 m for the business as well then that means selling half the company and retaining ownership of the other half which is now worth $ 80 m because of the cash infusion but many stock exchanges will have minimum requirements for the percentage of the shares that are trading freely so they will have to sell at least that much

i 'll take a stab at this question and offer a disclosure i recently got in ring 5.1 asx rio and   while i wo n't add to my positions at current prices i may add other positions or more to them if they fall further   this is called catching a falling and it 's a high risk move cons let 's scare everyone away pros the ecb did n't engage in as much qe as the market hoped and look at how it reacted especially commodities   consider that the ecb 's actions were tighter than expected and the fed plans to raise rates or claims so   commodities should be falling off a cliff on that news while most american western attention is on the latest news or entertainment china has been seizing commodities around the globe like crazy and the media have failed to mention that even with its market failing china is still seizing commodities   if china was truly panicked about its market it would stop investing in other countries and commodities and just bail out its own country   yet it 's not doing that   the whole china crisis is completely oversold in the west china is saying one thing oh no but doing another using its money to snap up cheap commodities capitalism works because hard times strengthen good companies   you know how many bailouts has received compared to goldman sachs   you know who owns more real wealth   oil does n't get bailed out banks do and banks ca n't innovate to save their lives while oil   hard times strengthen good companies   this means that this harsh bust in commodities will separate the winners from the losers and history shows the winners do very well in the long run related to the above point how many bailouts from tax payers do you think mining companies will get   zero   at least you 're investing in companies that do n't steal your money through government confiscation if you 're like me you can probably find at least 9 people out of 10 who think investing in miners is a very bad idea   what do they think is a good idea   duh snapchat and twitter   then there 's the old saying be greedy when everyone 's fearful and fearful when everyone 's greedy finally miners own hard assets   benjamin graham used to point this out with the dead company strategy like finding a used cigarette with one more smoke   you 're getting assets cheap while other investors are overpaying for stocks hoping that the fed qe   think strategy here seize cheap assets begin limiting the supply of these assets if you 're the saver and not borrowing then watch as the price begins to rise for them because of low supply   remember investors are part owners in companies take more control to limit the supply   using graham 's analogy stock pile those one puff cigarettes for a day when there 's a low supply of cigarettes many miners are in trouble now because they 've borrowed too much and must sell at a low profit or in some cases must lose   when you own assets debt free you can cut the supply   this will also help the federal reserve who 's been desperately trying to figure out how to raise inflation   the new patriotic thing to do is stimulate the economy by sending inflation up and limiting the supply here is key

several actually maintenance costs as landlord you are liable for maintaining the basic systems of the dwelling structure electrical plumbing hvac on top of that you typically also have to maintain anything that comes with the space so if you 're including appliances like a w d or fridge if they crap out you could spend a months rent or more replacing them you are also required to keep the property up to city codes as far as unless you specifically assign those responsibilities to your tenant and in some states you are not allowed to do so and in many cases renters expect to come out of their rent one way or the other failure to do these things can put you in danger of giving your tenant a free out on the lease contract and even expose you to civil and criminal penalties if you 're running a real slum escrow payments the combination of property tax and homeowner 's insurance usually doubles the monthly housing payment over principal and interest and that 's if you got a mortgage for 20 down also because this is not your primary residence it 's ineligible for homestead act exemptions where available states like texas are considering extending homestead exemptions to landlords with the expectation it will trickle down to renters however mortgage interest and state taxes do count as rental expenses and can be deducted on schedule c as ordinary business expenses offsetting revenues income tax the money you make in rent on this property is taxable as self employment income tax you 're effectively running a sole proprietorship real estate management company so not only does any profit you are allowed to deduct maintenance and administrative costs from the rent revenues get added to whatever you make in salary at your day job you 're also liable for the full employee and employer portions of medicare medicaid ss taxes you are however also allowed to depreciate the property over its expected life and deduct depreciation the life of a house is pretty long and if you depreciate more than the house 's actual loss of value you take a huge hit if when you sell because any amount of the sale price above the depreciated price of the house is a capital gain though it can work to your advantage by depreciating the maximum allowable to reduce ordinary income then paying lower capital gains rates on the sale   legal costs the rental agreement typically has to be drafted by a lawyer in order to avoid things that can cause the entire contract to be thrown out though there are boilerplate contracts available from state landlords associations this will cost you a few hundred dollars up front and to update it every few years it is deductible as an ordinary expense advertising putting up a for rent sign out front is typically just the tip of the iceberg online and print ads an ad agency these things cost money it 's deductible as an ordinary expense add this all up and you may end up losing money in the first year you rent the property when legal advertising initial maintenance purchases to get the place tenant ready etc are first spent deduct it properly and it 'll save you some taxes but you better have the nest egg to cover these things on top of everything your lender will expect you to bring to closing assuming you do n't have $ 100k+ lying around to buy the house in cash

most markets around the world have been for the last 6 to 10 months the definition of a downtrend is lower lows and lower highs and until you get a higher low and confirmation with a higher high the downtrend will continue if you look at the weekly charts of most indexes you can determine the longer term trend if you are more concerned with the medium term trend then you could look at the daily charts so if your objective is to try and buy individual stocks and try to make some medium to short term profits from them i would start by first looking at the daily charts of the index your stock belongs to only buy when the intermediate trend of the market is moving up higher highs and higher lows   you can do some brief analysis on the stocks your interested in buying and two things i would add to the short list in your question would be to check if earnings are increasing year after year the second thing to look at would be to check if the earnings yield is greater than the dividend yield that way you know that dividends are being paid out from current earnings and not from previous earning or from borrowings you could then check the daily charts of these individual stocks and make sure they are uptrending also buy uptrending stocks in an uptrending market before you buy anything write up a trading plan and develop your trading rules for example if price breaks through the resistance line of a previous high you will buy at the open of the next day have your money management and risk management rules in place and stick to your plan you can also do some backtesting or paper trading to check the validity of your strategy a good book to read on money and risk management is trade your way to financial freedom by van tharp your aim should not be to get a winner on every trade but to let your winners run and keep your losses small

the $ 3 k includes property tax right it looks like the mortgage alone will be about $ or so if your cal state tax is enough to put you into itemized deductions your mortgage and property tax are a write off and the $ 3k will actually be closer to the $ 2 k you are considering for rent   the wild card as i see it is that your budget is so tight that any unforeseen expenses will be charged as a long time homeowner i know these expenses sometime appear to be high and regular despite their random nature the money earmarked for credit card payments will go a long way to cover the tight budget you seem to have this and your decreasing support makes this look tight but not impossible the condition of the house would make or break the deal in my opinion

this answer is better served as a comment but i do n't have enough rep   it is not guaranteed that they do not accrue interest while you are a full time student some student loans can capitalize the interest before pursuing leveraged investing be sure that your student loan is not capitalizing capitalized interest capitalized interest is a second reason your loan may end up costing    more than the amount you originally borrowed interest starts to accrue grow from the day your loan is disbursed    sent to you or your school at certain points in time when your    separation or grace period ends or at the end of forbearance or    deferment your unpaid interest may capitalize that means it is added    to your loan ’s current principal from that point your interest will    now be calculated on this new amount that ’s capitalized interest capitalized interest if you accrue interest while you are in school as with direct    unsubsidized unsubsidized direct and plus loans and    private loans you will have capitalized interest if it is unpaid    unpaid accrued interest is added to the principal amount of your loan    after you leave school and finish any applicable grace period simply put there will be interest to be paid on both the principal of    the loan and on the interest that has already accumulated to minimize the effects of the capitalized interest on the amount you    will pay overall you can pay the interest during college instead of    waiting until after graduation that way you start with the original    principal balance minus any fees when you begin repayment

for a company the size of amazon a 1 increase in prices is substantial   many of their products are in competitive price sensitive markets   there are some products that people would notice a 1 difference from competitors   so the actual increase would have to be concentrated on a smaller subset of products that are not as price sensitive   however that would still mean reduced sales   in short i do n't think amazon is foregoing a 50 bump in profits if they could get it   also a 5 sga cut is absolutely enormous for a lean organization   in any one year that would mean an effective ~10 cut once you factor in inflation

statistics are often tough to grasp specifically we need to understand the exact context and implication of the data and how it 's presented an example i look at real estate sales data for a given town and find that for    the last 10 years the average sale price has dropped every    year for these 10 what can i conclude   now to your data you do n't mention age   when we look at this chart combined with the next   the picture while still bleak is at least more clear nearly half of pre retirees have no retirement savings if that lower half is running close to zero the average for the upper half is nearly twice the reported $   even now there are important bits going people who have had no access to retirement accounts either through lack of company availability or self who just ignored them may very well have saved outside of retirement accounts you can see these graphs are tracking only 401(k ira and keogh accounts   last social security for the $ 30 k earner will replace nearly half their working income at retirement almost 65 if they work till 70 i do n't advocate counting on ss for the entirety of one 's retirement income but the way ss benefits are structured replacement benefits are far higher as a percent for lower wage workers as the system intended   to conclude median alone is too small a data point to be useful in my opinion this kind of information presented in these charts is far more preferable to get a fuller picture

the short answer is you 'd be much better off paying up front in this case   the present value of $ 2,500 plus 12 $ 500 monthly payments is $ at a 12 discount rate which is much higher then the $ 6,000 you could pay now the long answer is how you get that present value   how can i use time value of money to find the present value of money if i choose to go with option a first of all i 'd question your discount rate   a 12 discount rate means that you can safely reinvest the money that you 're not spending today at a 12 annual 1 monthly rate which seems very high   normally for short term spending decisions you 'd use a risk free rate which would be closer to however to discount at 1 monthly you 'd just divide each monthly payment by 1 plus the discount rate raised to the power of the number of periods until each payment so the total is which is $ you could also use the npv function in excel it seems like to get an accurate answer the calculation of the interest rate should take into account compounding period as well correct and in the example above the compounding is assumed to be monthly since that 's the of the cash flows you could calculate it with a different compounding period but it gets much more complicated and probably would n't make a significant difference the discount rate does take compounding into effect meaning if you saved the $ the pv of $ minus the $ 2,500 initial payment you 'd earn 1 interest on $ the first month $ plus that interest the second month etc

renters insurance should also have some level of liability coverage i.e. if you caused a flooding because you went on and broke the pipe or a fire because you smoked in the bed there should be some level of coverage for that however most of the damage the tenant can do is probably not accidental if you broke the pipe you probably did something wrong if you caused fire by smoking in bed you obviously did something wrong while seemingly accidental you 're deeply at fault insurance companies are not in business for rewarding risky behavior accidents where the tenant has nothing to do with what happened earthquakes fires because of say wiring flooding because it too much or bird flying into a window and it are covered by the homeowner 's insurance in any case talk to your insurance agent about your specific policy and concerns

you are kind of thinking of this correctly but you will and should pay for insurance at some point   what i mean by that is that although the insurance company is making a profit that removing the risk for certain incidents from your life you are still receiving a lot of value    things that inflict large losses in your life tend to be good insurance buys   health liability long term care long term disability and property insurance typically fall into this category    in your case assuming you are young and healthy it would be a poor choice to drop the major medical health insurance   there is a small chance you will get very sick in the next 10 years or so and require the use of this insurance   a much smaller chance than what is represented by the premium   but if you do get very sick and do n't have insurance it will probably wipe you out financially   the devastation could last the rest of your life    you are paying to mitigate that possibility   and as you said it 's pretty low cost    while you seem to be really good at numbers it is hard to quantify the risk avoidance   but it must be considered in your analysis also along those lines is car insurance   while you may not be willing to pay for full coverage it 's a great idea to max out your personal liability if you have sufficient assets

there is no way you can directly defer that capital gains tax if you sell a property that is not your principal residence it will be taxed in the year in which it was sold it does n't matter what you do with the proceeds that tax will get paid now if you had adequate rrsp contribution room you could certainly put some money there and would get a deduction on your tax return that would offset this capital gains tax for example if you sold a property for $ 300 k that was originally purchased for $ 200 k then you would incur capital gains tax of $ 50 k assuming you were not claiming cca deductions if you took $ 50 k of your proceeds and put it in an rrsp it would offset the tax you pay now and essentially defer the tax on that $ 50 k of income until you withdraw hopefully at a lower marginal tax rate a spousal rrsp would work the same except it would be taxed at your spouse 's marginal tax rate when withdrawn either way you need to have sufficient contribution room in the rrsp for this to work check your notice of assessment to see how much room you have available

as someone who has a very similar debt amount and environment new grad nice new paying job want a car etc i 'd like to share something with you life has unexpected costs luckily i did n't buy that new car the first few months out of college like i had planned to i 'm glad that i did n't because as a fledgling adult despite having lived on my own while in college while working part to full time there are some things you just do n't realize until it either happens or it happens to someone else here are some of those things i could go on but i wo n't $ 95 k is good money and i would definitely recommend spending it a bit to enjoy yourself but i would honestly tell you that taking your monthly expenses adding a few hundred on top of that and then multiplying   that sum by 3 would be a smart savings amount before picking up a car loan maybe that 's an excessive savings but i 've seen way too many people burn out over their cost of living and their failure to adjust appropriately when shit hits the fan so instead of having to deal with the stab at your pride when having to lower the cost quality of living that you 'll probably grow accustomed to at a $ 95 k salary just prepare for the worst   oh and did i mention a new job is not a secure job consider yourself to likely be the first asset dropped from the company if even the tiniest thing goes wrong i know way too many people who were fresh hires at intel boeing and a few other big tech companies that pay around what you make and despite being bad asses in college they were dropped like a bad habit when their employers hit rough patches to those even more experienced than me please feel free to add to the list i 'd personally love to know them myself

firstly a stock split is easy for example each unit of stock is converted into 10 units   so if you owned 1 of the company before the stock split you will still own 1 after the stock split but have 10 times the number of shares    the company does not pay out any money when doing this and there is no effect on tax for the company or the share holder now onto stock dividend when a company make a profit the company gives some of the profit to the share holders as a dividend this is normally paid in cash   an investor may then wish to buy more shares in the company using the money from the dividend       however buying shares used to have a large cost in broker charges etc therefore some companies allowed share holders to choose to have the dividend paid as shares    the company buys enough of their own shares to cover the payout only having one set of broker charges and then sends the correct number of shares to each share holder that has opted for a stock dividend   along with any cash that was not enough to buy a complete share this made since when you had paper shares and admin costs where high for stock brokers    it does not make sense these days a stock dividend is taxed as if you had been paid the dividend in cash and then brought the stock yourself

this very topic was the subject of a question on workplace se tl dr   from tax publication 521 moving expenses table regarding how to report if your form w-2 shows your entire reimbursement reported    as    wages in box 1          and you have moving expenses     then file form showing all allowable   expenses but do not    show any    reimbursements there are tax implications covered in tax publication 521 moving expenses and employers tax guide to fringe benefits related to moving expenses from the employers view moving expense reimbursements this exclusion applies to any amount you directly or indirectly give to an employee including services furnished in kind as payment for or reimbursement of moving expenses you must make the reimbursement under rules similar to those described in chapter 11 of publication 535 for reimbursement of expenses for travel meals and entertainment under accountable plans the exclusion applies only to reimbursement of moving expenses that the employee could deduct if he or she had paid or incurred them without reimbursement however it does not apply if the employee actually deducted the expenses in a previous year    deductible moving expenses    deductible moving expenses include only the reasonable expenses of moving household goods and personal effects from the former home to the new home and traveling including lodging from the former home to the new home deductible moving expenses do not include any expenses for meals and must meet both the distance test and the time test the distance test is met if the new job location is at least 50 miles farther from the employee 's old home than the old job location was the time test is met if the employee works at least 39 weeks during the first 12 months after arriving in the general area of the new job location for more information on deductible moving expenses see publication 521 moving expenses employee    for this exclusion treat the following individuals as employees a current employee a leased employee who has provided services to you on a substantially full time basis for at least a year if the services are performed under your primary direction or control exception for s corporation shareholders    do not treat a 2 shareholder of an s corporation as an employee of the corporation for this purpose a 2 shareholder is someone who directly or indirectly owns at any time during the year more than 2 of the corporation 's stock or stock with more than 2 of the voting power treat a 2 shareholder as you would a partner in a partnership for fringe benefit purposes but do not treat the benefit as a reduction in distributions to the 2 shareholder exclusion from wages    generally you can exclude qualifying moving expense reimbursement you provide to an employee from the employee 's wages if you paid the reimbursement directly to the employee report the amount in box 12 of form w-2 with the code p. do not report payments to a third party for the employee 's moving expenses or the value of moving services you provided in kind   from the employees view the not be included as income the expenses must be from an accountable plan accountable plans to be an accountable plan your employer 's reimbursement arrangement must require you to meet all three of the following rules your expenses must have a business connection that is you must have paid or incurred deductible expenses while performing services as an employee of your employer two examples of this are the reasonable expenses of moving your possessions from your former home to your new home and traveling from your former home to your new home you must adequately account to your employer for these expenses within a reasonable period of time you must return any excess reimbursement or allowance within a reasonable period of time also what is interesting is the table regarding how to report if your form w-2 shows your entire reimbursement reported    as    wages in box 1          and you have moving expenses     then file form showing all allowable   expenses but do not    show any    reimbursements

the first thing is to look at the monthly cost of the loan the one from the company is interest free while it is unlikely that a bank will have a zero percent loan you will also have to look at what the seller will offer   the next thing to look at is the term of the loan when comparing two loans with the same interest rate the shorter term loan will cost more per month many times when an auto dealer offers a zero percent loan they also   have a very short term 12 24 months many people ca n't afford the monthly payments with that short a term   you said you could afford to save the other $ 2000 in about six months that means you could set aside $ a month to do it in six months if the loan from the employer has a term longer than 6 months you should be able to afford the loan keep in mind that the employer will probably be taking the money right out of your paychecks   you do have to look at the conditions attached to the loan what does accepting the loan do to your employment situation if you leave early do they want you to pay it back in 30 days or will they take the rest from the final paycheck or do you have longer   you do have to look at the term of the loan and see if you can pay it off early if they require a 12 month term can you end it earlier or change the monthly payment to end it early the reason why you care about the term is that if the term is 24 months then after a year you still owe them $ 1000 which if you have to pay back immediately if you quit it may make it hard for you to leave the company a minor note they probably are not reporting it to the credit reporting agencies therefore it wo nt help your credit score this is probably not a big issue since you are considering going without a loan

yes if you gift him with a large amount you may be liable for gift tax i believe the current limit is still $ 17k per person per person per year so between you and your spouse you could give him up to $ per year without triggering gift tax if you want to give a larger sum the standard workaround is an intra family loan for that phrase to learn more about it but basically you loan the money and then gift the payments on the loan this gives him the money up front spreading the gift over subsequent years it requires that you declare the interest that he is supposedly paying you as income there is a lower limit on the interest rate for these loans but it 's a fraction of a percent so this generally is n't a significant cost if you are able to structure the loan as a mortgage he may be able to deduct the interest from his taxes that usually requires a few hundred dollars if paperwork to set up i 've done it it works and one of the advantages is that it puts the exact terms of the on paper where everyone can agree to them which could be useful should there be arguments later on   when doing business with friends and relatives keeping it on a clear business contract basis is the best way to avoid destroying the friendship

if the ira is costing you $ 100 a year you should almost certainly transfer it to a cheaper provider regardless of whether you 're going to withdraw anything   you can transfer the ira to another provider that does n't charge you the fees   or you can convert it to roth and combine it with your existing roth   either way you will keep all the money and save $ 100 per year in the future if you want to take money out of your retirement accounts you should take it out of your roth ira because you can withdraw contributions i.e. up to the amount you contributed from the roth without tax or penalty whether you should withdraw anything from your retirement accounts is a different question   if you 're already maxing out your roth ira and you have sufficient retirement savings you could just instead plow that $ 5500 into your student loans   if you can afford it of course it 'd be better to just pay the $ 7500 from your income and still contribute to the retirement accounts   there 's no reason to withdraw from retirement accounts to pay loans when you could just divert current income for that purpose instead

one of the things that you have to be aware of is a little gotcha in the credit utilization rate they or at least the credit company i worked for used the high balance in figuring the credit utilization not the ending balance for example say you had a single card with a $ 2000 credit limit and used it to charge everything during the month say that the high balance was $ 1900 and you paid it down to zero at the end of the month the company would calculate your credit utilization at 95 this is not good and not really fair but that was the way it was done increasing the credit limit helps but you can also usually make interim payments say as a paycheck comes in during the month if you have an online account

first what is waste   is waste defined purely as financial waste   if we were to choose this definition running electricity to houses is ridiculously wasteful   same with running water   it ’d be easier to setup hubs for every resource and ship them to the hubs   people can either pay more for personal delivery or can come to the hub to get their resources   that would be financially efficient

in a domestic setting letters of credit are often used to build public works needed to support a development   so if you 're a few 3 story buildings to build a 50 story tower the municipality will build appropriate water sewer gas road infrastructure and draw from the developer 's letter of credit to fund it the catch to the developer is that these things usually are n't once the city town etc starts work the developer can not cut off the funding even if the   project is cancelled a letter of credit definitely is n't a consumer financing vehicle the closest equivalent is a line of credit tied to an asset like a home

the answer to the question can i exercise the option right away depends on the exercise style of the particular option contract you are talking about if it 's an american style exercise you can exercise at any moment until the expiration date if it 's an european style exercise you can only exercise at the expiration date according to the cme group website on the on gold futures it 's an american style exercise always make sure to double check this especially in the options on futures world there are quite a few that are european style so if you wanted to the answer is yes you can exercise those contracts before expiration but a very important question you should ask is should you option prices are composed of 2 parts intrinsic value and extrinsic value intrinsic value is defined as by how much the option is in the money that is for calls it 's how much the strike is below the current underlying price and for puts it 's how much the strike is above the current underlying price extrinsic value is whatever amount you have to add to the intrinsic value to get the actual price the option is trading at the market note that there 's no negative intrinsic value it 's either a positive number or 0 when the intrinsic value is 0 all the value of the option is extrinsic value the reason why options have extrinsic value is because they give the buyer a right and the seller an obligation ie the seller is assuming risk traders are only willing to assume obligations risks and give others a right if they get paid for that the amount they get paid for that is the extrinsic value in the scenario you described underlying price is call strike is whatever amount you have paid for that option is extrinsic value because the strike of the call is above the underlying price so intrinsic = 0 intrinsic + extrinsic = value of the option by definition now in your scenario gold prices went up to now your call option is in the money that is the strike of your call option is below the gold price that necessarily means that your call option has intrinsic value you can easily calculate how much it has exactly $ 5 intrinsic value price strike but that contract still has some risk associated to it for the seller so it necessarily still have some extrinsic value as well so the option that you bought for let 's say $ 2.30 could now be worth something like $ $ 5 + a hypothetical $ 1.90 in extrinsic value in your question you mentioned exercising the option and then making a profit there well if you do that you exercise your options get some gold futures immediately paying $ for them your strike and then you can sell them in the market for $ so you make $ 5 there multiplied by the contract multiplier but your profit is not $ 5 here 's why remember that you had to buy that option you paid some money for that in this hypothetical example you payed $ 2.30 to buy the option so you actually made only $ 5 $ 2.30 = $ profit on the other hand you could just have sold the option you 'd then make money by selling something that you bought for $ 2.30 that 's now worth $ this will give you a higher profit in this case if those numbers were real you 'd make $ $ 2.30 = $ profit more than $ profit here 's the interesting part did you notice exactly how much more profit you 'd have by selling the option back to the market instead of exercising it and selling the gold contracts exactly $ 1.90 do you remember this number that 's the extrinsic value and it 's not a coincidence by exercising an option you immediately give up all the extrinsic value it has you are going to convert all the extrinsic value into $ 0 so that 's why it 's not optimal to exercise the contract also many brokers usually charge you much more commissions and fees to exercise an option than to buy sell options so there 's that as well always remember when you exercise an option contract you immediately give up all the extrinsic value it has so it 's never optimal to do an early exercise of option contracts and individual retail investors institutional investors doing hft might be able to spot price discrepancies and make money doing arbitrage but retail investors do n't have the low commissions and the technology required to make money out of that might also be interesting to think about the other side of this have you noticed how in the example above the option started with $ 2.30 of extrinsic value and then it had less $ 1.90 only that 's really how options work as the market changes extrinsic value changes and as time goes by extrinsic value usually decreases other factors might increase it like more fear in the market usually bring the option prices up but the passage of time alone will decrease it so options that you buy will naturally decrease some value over time the closer you are to expiration the faster it 's going to lose value which kind of makes intuitive sense for instance compare an option with 90 days to expiration to another with 10 one day later the first option still has 89 almost the same as 90 but the other has 9 it relatively much closer to the expiration than the day before so it will decay faster option buyers can protect their investment from time decay by buying longer dated options which decay slower edit just thought about adding one final thought here probabilities the strategy that you describe in your question is basically going long an otm call this is an extremely bullish position with low probability of making money basically for you to make money you need two things you need to be right on direction and you need to be right on time in this example you need the underlying to go up by a considerable amount and you need this to happen quickly before the passage of time will remove too much of the extrinsic value of your call and obviously before the call expires benefit of the strategy is in the highly unlikely event of an extreme unanticipated move of the underlying to the upside you can make a lot of money so it 's a low probability limited risk unlimited profit extremely bullish strategy
# 73256
i would expect that your position will be liquidated when the option expires but not before there 's probably still some time value so it does n't make sense for the buyer to exercise the option early and take your stock instead they could sell the option to someone else and collect the remaining time value occasionally there 's a weird situation for whatever reason where an option has near zero or negative time value and then you might get an early exercise but in general if there 's time value someone would want to sell rather than exercise if the option has n't expired maybe the stock will even fall again and you 'll keep it if the option just expired maybe the exercise just has n't been processed yet it may take overnight or so

the following is from wikipedia term life insurance with very minor editing because term life insurance is a pure    death benefit its primary use is to    provide coverage of financial    responsibilities for the insured    such responsibilities may include but    are not limited to consumer debt    dependent care college education for    dependents funeral costs and    mortgages term life insurance is    generally chosen in favor of permanent    life insurance because it is usually    much less expensive depending on the    length of the term many financial    advisors or other experts commonly    recommend term life insurance as a    means to cover potential expenses    until such time that there are    sufficient funds available from    savings to protect those whom the    insurance coverage was intended to    protect for example an individual    might choose to obtain a policy whose    term expires near his or her    retirement age based on the premise    that by the time the individual    retires he or she would have amassed    sufficient funds in retirement savings    to provide financial security for    their dependents this suggests the questions why do you have this policy also how many term life policies do you need or how much insurance do you need clearly you will be better off investing the premiums in the market   your beneficiaries may be better off either way depends when you die and to a lesser extent on market performance if you are not able to retire now but expect to be able to later you should strongly consider having sufficient insurance to provide income replacement for your spouse   this is a fairly common why

before the prevalence of electronic trading trading stocks was very costly dropping from in the late 1970s to less than a nickel per share today   exchange fees for liquidity takers are per share currently when orders were negotiated exclusively by humans stocks used to be quoted in fractions rather than decimal such as $ 50 1/2 instead of something more precise like $ that necessary ease of negotiation for humans to rapidly trade extended to trade size as well   traders preferred to handle orders in round lots 100 shares for ease of calculation of the total cost of the trade so 100 shares at $ 50 1/2 would have a total cost of $   the time for a human to calculate an odd lot of 72 shares at $ would take much longer so would cost more per share and these costs were passed on to the client these issues have been negated by electronic trading and simply no longer exist except for obsolete brokerages   there are cost advantages for extremely large trades well above 100 shares per trade brokerage fees today run the they can be as insignificant as what interactive brokers charges to as high as a full service broker that could charge hundreds of usd for a few thousand usd trade   with full service brokerages the charges are frequently and quoted at the time a trade is requested   with discount brokerages there is usually a fee per trade and a fee per share or contract   interactive brokers will charge a fee per share or option only and will even refund parts of the liquidity rebates exchanges provide as close as possible to having a seat on an exchange   even if a trader does not meet interactive brokers minimum trading requirement the monthly fee is so low that it is possible that a buy and hold investor could benefit from the de minimis trade fees it should be noted that liquidity providing hidden orders are typically not but are at least discounted the core costs of all trades are the exchange fees which are per share or contract   over the long run costs charged by brokers will be in excess of charges by exchanges and interactive brokers fee schedule shows that it can be reduced to a simple markup over exchange fees    exchanges sometimes have a fee schedule with lower charges for larger trades but these are out of reach of the average individual

firstly what are you trading that you could lose more than you put in if you are simply trading stocks you will not lose more than you put in unless you are trading on margin a limit order is basically that a limit on the maximum price you want your buy order bought at or the minimum price you want your sell order sold at if you ca n't be to the screen all day when you place a limit order and the market moves the opposite way you may miss out on your order being executed even if you can be in front of the screen all day you then have to decide if you want to chase the market of miss out on your purchase or sale for example if a stock is trading at $ 10.10 and you put a limit buy order to buy 1000 shares at or below $ 10.00 and the price keeps moving up to $ then $ and then $ 10.50 until it closes the day at $ you then have the choice during the day to miss out on buying the shares or to increase your limit order in order to buy at a higher price sometime if the stock is not very liquid i.e. it does not trade very often and has low volume the price may hit $ 10.00 and you may only have part of your order executed say 500 out of your 1000 shares were bought this may mean that you may have to increase the price of your remaining order or be happy with only buying 500 shares instead of 1000 the same can happen when you are selling but in reverse obviously with market order however you are placing a buy order to buy at the next bid price in the depth or a sell order to sell at the next offer price in the depth see the market depth table below   note that this price depth table is taken before market open so it seems that the stock is somewhat illiquid with a large gap between the first and second prices in the buyers bid prices when the market opened this gap is closed as is a major australian bank and is quite liquid the table is for demonstration purposes only if we pretend that the market was currently open and saw the current market depth for as above you could decide to place a limit sell order to sell 1000 shares at say $ you would sell 100 shares straight away but your remaining 900 sell order will remain at the top of the sellers list if other buyers come in at $ you may get your whole sale completed however if no other buyers place orders above $ and other sellers come into the market with sell orders below $ your remaining order may never be executed if instead you placed a market sell order you would immediately sell 100 shares at $ and the remaining 900 shares at $ so you would be $ 99 or just over 0.3 worse off than if you were able to sell the full 1000 shares at $ the question is how low would you have had to lower your limit order price if the price for kept on falling and you had to sell that day there are risks with whichever type of order you use you need to determine what the purpose of your order is is it to get in or out of the market as soon as possible with the possibility of giving a little bit back to the market or is it to get the price you want no matter how long it takes you that is you are willing to miss out on buying the shares can miss out on a good buy if the price keeps rising for weeks or months or even years or you are willing to miss out on selling them right now and can wait for the price to come back up to the price you were willing to sell at where you may miss out on selling the shares at a good price and they keep on falling and you give back all your profits and more just before the onset of the gfc i sold some shares which i had bought a few years earlier at $ through a market order for $ it had traded just above $ 6 a few days earlier but if instead of a market order i had placed a limit order to sell at $ 6.00 or more i would have missed out on the sale the price never went back up   to $ 6 or above and the following week it started dropping very quickly it is now trading at about $ 1.30 and has never gone back above $ 2.00 5.5 years later so to me placing a limit order in this case was very risky

sign up with credit karma   it will give you two scores for free and will show you credit cards you have a good chance in being approved for   plus it will evaluate your score showing you the 6 items that effect your score and give you steps to improve them or tell you how long you have to wait until they roll off plus i would look at a credit union and see if they have any fresh start programs   you should be well on your way    the thing that is probably hurting your credit is your utilization   if you can just use 10 of your available credit

possible ways they could make money or think they could i would go back through your transaction history and see if it 's disappeared   even with an assumed rubbish interface finding a reversal of the transaction should be easy as you know the amount   i would n't spend it for a very long time if it is still there just in case my last bullet applies given what they knew about you phone number and account details i 'd be wary enough to keep an eye on all my accounts possibly wary enough to consider credit monitoring in case they try to open other accounts with your details   although of course plenty of people have legitimate reasons to have this information if you 've written a cheque the account details will be on it and you might well be in the phone book or otherwise searchable

is this for the us or does it apply here in the uk in a general sense   obviously i think we are using different terms but this is just a general run down of the different business types really right   i 'm wondering if the use of a name thing matters here in the uk or not i 'm happy to trade under my actual name but would prefer a name for the business that is separate to my own name

when you ask people to differentiate between a condominium and an apartment they usually base their answers on the structure itself a condominium is more often than not a high rise building filled with dozens of living spaces while an apartment is usually two to three stories high with only a handful of units

the nyse 20 year plus treasury bond index is a multiple security fixed income index that aims to track the total returns of the long term 20 year and greater maturity range of the u.s. treasury bond market the index constituent bonds are weighted by their relative amounts outstanding one can not directly invest in an index index bond maturities 24 to 27 years   to 29 years      index duration years an oversimplification of how bonds value changes as rates change is they are inversely related based on the duration of the bond   think of duration as the time weighted average of all the coupons and the final payment in this case a drop in rates of about 1 will cause a rise in value of about long term rates took a drop in the last year

this is based on evidence over the past 35 years which coincides with the largest technology revolution in human history those automated jobs were going away even if minimum wage was cut our business community is of technology solutions that enrich them in the short term and to hell with the law no term    to keep telling the public this then prevents people demanding a livable wage in fear of no job at all it keeps working class people complacent with the abuses in their work environment such as legal breaks not paying overtime that is due last minute schedule changes unpaid 24 on call status and less than 8 hours between shifts fear is the most powerful mute button in the world    long term profits will begin to slide slowly as we are seeing in retail right now it will be blamed on internet shopping millennials are or student loan payments this does n't explain deceased shopping by other age groups but not suppose to notice    as more and more people are left in poverty or near poverty by lack of wage increases the number of customers fall when it hits the middle class and they stop shopping so much our economy will be in a persistent recession layoffs to reduce expenses leads to fewer customers for products leads to decreased profits leads to layoffs   automation will of course reduce the expenses in the short term but will also eliminate the market all the white collar workers that think they are immune will be shocked when it hits their industry but it only makes sense in myopic business circles to eliminate higher wages workers too    sometimes technology is the problem not the solution i expect to be banned for saying so

a junk bond is broadly a bond with a non negligible risk of default   bond ought to be defined elsewhere but broadly it 's a financial instrument you buy from a company or government where they promise to pay you back the principal and some interest over time on a particular schedule the name junk is a bit exaggerated many of them are issued by respectable and reasonably stable businesses junk bonds were required to do large leveraged buyouts   this means the company issued fairly risky fairly high yield debt to buy out equity holders   they have to pay a high rate on the debt because the company 's now fairly highly geared ie has a lot of debt relative to its value and it may have to pay out a large fraction of its earnings as interest what is a junk bond and how does it differ from a regular bond   it 's only a matter of degree and nomenclature   a bond that has a credit rating below a particular level eg s&p is called junk or more politely non investment grade or speculative   it 's possible for an existing bond to be reclassified from one side to another or for a single issuer to have different series some of which are more risky than others   the higher the perceived risk the more interest the bond must pay offer in order to attract lenders why is there higher risk chance of default well why would a company be considered at higher risk of failing to repay its debt   basically it comes down to doubt about the company 's future earnings being sufficient to repay its debt which could be for example

i love working for a cu   our in articles like this    he will post them and tell us this is why we do what we do   we would rather be financial physicians    our job is heal financial worries and get people on the right path   i have seen our lenders convince folks to not take a loan best that is truly in their best interest   i have seen our investment group tell folks that their investment goals and personal goal do n't line up and honestly they should wait we also do crazy stuff like identifying folks who live in the flood zones and offer them 90 day loan deferment with no fees   that and a care loan for repairs   it 's an insanely low interest loan 2   to help folks get their repairs done     we also lowered our credit requirements for that to where just about every who needs it qualifies     it 's also hard to get fired   if you do n't hit your sales goal it 's ok   you will not lose your job   yes we are encouraged to meet our goals with incentives but we pretty much get paid something no matter what you do     pretty much the only way to get fired is to pull a wells fargo   if you do something like that your ass is not only fired the will personally come down and will kick you out the door   hell i would n't be surprised if if he then tied you to his car and dragged you down the street     and you know what it 's working   we are repeatedly breaking every record we set for ourselves   record loans record deposits record account openings   and you better believe that is heavily audit internally and externally    we actually hire auditors to make sure this crap does n't even start     tldr wells fargo is the devil    credit unions rule

i 'm not familiar with us tax law in particular but the general principle around the world tends to be that interest free or low interest loans are taxed as gifts of the difference between a commercial interest charge and the actual interest charged you could also forgive $ 13,000 waived interest of the loan each year also remember that there 's a lifetime exemption covering inheritance as well of $ 1,000,000 which can be used for any amounts over the $ 13,000

i was a victim of this   i 'm not sure who got my routing and account number off my check but someone subscribed to using my bank account information   luckily it was only for about $ 30 and the bank refunded my money   however it was a mess in that i had to open a new checking account and keep the other one open until all checks cleared   the bank was extremely helpful and monitored the account to make sure only the checks i told them about were processed   i then had to close the old account this is why i believe checks are much less secure than credit cards or debit cards   a paper check can lay on someone 's desk for anyone to pick up or write the information down off of it   i avoid checks if at all possible   for things like craig 's list i would try to use paypal or some other intermediate processing service

the rate of spending growth is relevant the reason tax cuts are expected to pay for themselves is that they are expected to increase economic growth such that the absolute dollar amount of revenue is the same though it makes up a smaller relative proportion of the total economic value created over a period    this would be sufficient to pay for itself if spending growth were flat but if it 's growing particularly if it 's growing sharply just maintaining the same absolute revenue level wo n't be enough to pay the government 's bills   basically whether or not tax cuts pay for themselves depends on where we are on the laffer curve and on the level of spending growth hence my previous comment

disadvantage is that tenant could sue you for something and in an unfavorable judgement they would have access to your house as property to possess you could lose the house even if you make an llc to hold the house they 'll either sue you or the llc and either way you could lose the house this might be why the landlord is moving to florida where their house can not be possessed in a judgement because of the state 's strong homestead exemption

because it 's not cheaper it 's virtually free to run a private chain no transaction fees no competition for mining it does n't require even a of a fraction of the maintenance resources and you maintain total operational control over it bitcoin could crash it 's encryption could be broken 100 's of things could change which would totally your internal infrastructure lastly if you want you can destroy the chain say if you are sharing private documents with another legal firm you can destroy the chain when the case is done the documents wo nt be floating in a public chain for perpetuity   the mega chain is a very stupid idea because it forces everything to be hosted by everyone which very quickly loses feasibility instead you will likely see an increase in very specific use case chains
