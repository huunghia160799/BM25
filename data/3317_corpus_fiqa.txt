it 's not so much a credit card but a financial institution 's online platform that either provides this functionality or not the following canadian financial institutions show an itemized list of pre authorized transactions not an exhaustive list   the following institutions show a total value of pre authorized transactions most other institutions show the available credit e.g. chase financial used by amazon rewards which give an indication of how much you have to spend by subtracting the current balance and the available balance from the total credit limit you can get an indication of the total amount of pre authorized transactions example $ 1000 $ 500 $ 400 = $ 100 is the amount of pre authorized transactions from td 's demo it appears that they do n't include pre authorized transactions in the available credit you can verify for yourself by logging in to online banking after you make a purchase and comparing the available credit to credit limit current balance if it is equal then they do n't include if it is different most likely for the value of the transaction then they do

this is a brilliant move on amazon 's part in my opinion they have the economy of scale to increase margins in addition it increases their urban brick amp mortar footprint they were already planning to enter the grocery landscape via amazon fresh and this gives them an immediate and scalable footprint with the opportunity to transform the way consumers buy groceries it will be interesting to see if the likes of walmart kroger sprouts and other traditional large format grocers are able to adapt and continue to compete also excited to see how amazon will decide to improve upon the existing whole foods format this is a huge disruption in the grocery landscape and the ripple effects will be significant

there are many reasons for buying stock for dividends   you are right in the sense that in theory a stock 's price will go down in value by the amount of the dividend as the amount of dividend was adding to the value of the company but now has been paid out to shareholder so now the company is worth less by the value of the dividend however in real life this may or may not happen sometimes the price will drop by less than the value of the dividend sometimes the price will drop by more than the dividend and other times the price will go up even though the stock has gone ex dividend we can say that if the price has dropped by exactly the amount of the dividend then there has been no change in the stockholders value if the price has dropped by more than the value of the dividend then there has been a drop to the stockholder 's value and if the price has gone up or dropped by less than the value of the dividend then there has been a increase to the stockholder 's value benefits of buying stocks with good dividends what you should n't do however is buy stocks solely due to the dividend be aware that if a company starts reducing its dividends it could be an early warning sign that the company may be heading into financial troubles that is why holding a stock that is dropping in price purely for its dividend can be a very dangerous practice

if you have significant assets such as a large deposit then diversification of risks such as currency risk is good practice there are many good options but keeping 100 of it in is definitely not a good idea nor is keeping 100 of it in a single foreign currency   of course it would be much more beneficial to have done it yesterday and moments of extreme volatility generally are a bad time to make large uninformed trades but if the deposit is sufficiently large say equal to annual expenses then it would make sense to split it among different currencies and also different types of assets as well deposit stocks precious metals bonds the rate of rouble may go up and down but you also have to keep in mind that future events such as fluctuating oil price may risk a much deeper crisis than now and you can look to experiences of the 1998 crisis as an example of what may happen if the situation continues to deteriorate

keep in mind there are too many variables to address in a single post i could and might write a full book on the topic one simple way to comprehend your perceived observation in the 25 bracket you have $ 1000 of income and two choices net out $ 750 and deposit to roth or deposit the full $ 1000 to the traditional ira or 401(k sufficient time passes for the investment to grow 10 fold for what it 's worth 8 at 30 years will do that   the roth is now worth $ 7500 tax free the traditional 401(k is worth $ 10000 but subject to tax at 25 we 're at the same $ 7500   for those looking to invest more than a gross $ 18,000 the roth flavor is an effective $ 24,000 as post tax this is $ 18,000 i wrote a bit more on this in the titled the density of your ira this is really a top issue as it takes quite a bit of income for the $ 23,000 combined ira and 401(k limits to be a problem   in my writing the larger case to be made is for taking advantage of the tax rate difference between the time of deposit and withdrawal a look at the 2016 tax rates is in order   let 's stick with 25 while working now at retirement but before social security as that 's another story the couple has $ in standard deduction and exemption and both the 10 and 15 brackets to enjoy   ignoring any other deductions potential credits etc let 's look at a gross $ 80,000 withdrawal    the numbers happen to work out to an average 10 with the couple being in a marginal 15 bracket a full 25 or $ 20,000 tax would be the break even to the same bracket in out analysis so this produces a $ 12,000 benefit   this issue is often treated as if there were 2 points in time the deposit and the withdrawal for most people that may be the case keep in mind current law allows a conversion to roth any time in between this gives an opportunity to make a deposit while in the 25 bracket and convert in any year the marginal rate drops back to 15 for whatever reason   last i ca n't ignore the social security problem simply put when half of your social security benefits plus other income exceed $ 25,000 $ if married filing joint your benefits start to become taxable until 85 of your benefits are fully taxed this issue is worthy of multiple posts by itself it 's not a deal killer just another point to consider a very high income earner might be beyond these levels already in which case the point is moot a low income earner not impacted at all it 's those who are in the range to navigate this that would benefit to take advantage of the scenario i presented above and spend down pre tax accounts while planning to use the roths when social security starts this should make it clear it 's not all or none those retiring with $ 2 m in 100 pretax or $ 1.5 m 100 in roth have both missed the chance to have the optimal mix

would make sense that the higher liquidation cost and transaction costs are driving the share price down    higher and transaction means higher investors would require higher return driving down the share price the other possibilities i can think of off the top of my head based on looking at the firm for five minutes   1 in transaction costs did you include tax disclaimer math below done on the back of the envelope in between meetings   so nav says they are at liquidating that entire portfolio means about 22 capital gains tax rate which means after tax value is about $ add in any fees you 'd incur from trying to sell this stuff and it 's not unreasonable to assume you 'll only get about $ 55 m once all is said and done which is pretty close to the actual market cap    if you have accounted for the above consider   2 bulk of their investments seem to be in private assets which implies that they have some discretion in how they mark the value of those investments and there is the chance that the market does n't have confidence in these guys what 's their performance been like in recent years especially with a private asset portfolio i 'd be weary    if i was to invest in them i 'd want a higher return for the opaque portfolio

ramsey promotes growth mutual funds and says he can screen out examples of good funds with a solid history of 10 returns in a couple of minutes on morningstar   the 12 in the video is fairly unrealistic but 10 or 8 are realistic especially when you buy into the market every month at all levels rather than chasing winners buying high at 10 you will still get $ 3 million in 40 years and at 8 you 'll get $ 1.5 million you need to make sure you include reinvestment of dividends as well as mere price appreciation in these calculations of returns on investment so yes you could probably drive really nice cars this way without breaking the bank like any financial endeavor this requires hard work patience and discipline the actual work in this case would be fairly minimal in comparison to the patience and discipline if you get really lucky you might end up with millions of dollars 40 years from now if a health disaster job loss children 's college etc strikes then you it might save you from financial ruin both are better than the rat race i agree his predictions are too rosy but this ad is an emotional sales pitch designed to change goals and behavior compare it to the psychology and unrealistic claims in some of the auto commercials you see on tv

it seems that you 're complicating things quite a bit   why would you not create a business entity open one or more bank accounts for it and then have the money wired into those accounts   if you plan on being a company then set up the appropriate structure for it in the u.s. you can form an s corporation or an llc and choose pass through taxation so that all you pay is income tax on what you receive from the business as personal income   the business itself would not have tax liability in such a case co mingling your personal banking with that of your business could create real tax headaches for you if you are n't careful so it 's not worth the trouble or risk

i answered a similar question before essentially you should n't trust a site you find on the internet merely because it looks professional and real   before signing up with any new service provider you found online you should verify the authenticity of both the organization itself and their web site address even if the name displayed by a web site represents a legitimate brokerage firm any site you happen to come across on the internet could be an elaborate of a real company intended to capture your personal details or worse first to check if a brokerage firm is in fact registered to trade securities in the united states you can consult finra 's online service   this might be the first of many checks you should undertake after you convince yourself that finra is legitimate   a meta problem then if you want to know if the web site address is authentic one way is to contact that broker offline using the contact information found from a trusted source such as the finra details   unfortunately those details do not currently appear to contain the broker 's web site url   else that could be useful another thing to look at is the site 's login or sign up page for a valid ssl certificate that is both issued to the correct legal name of the brokerage firm as well as has been signed by a well known certificate authority e.g. for a financial services firm of any kind you should look for and expect to see an extended validation certificate   any other kind of certificate might only assert that the certificate was issued to the domain name owner and not necessarily to an organization with the registered legal name   yes anybody can register a domain with a similar name and then acquire a basic ssl certificate for that domain fwiw scottrade and sharebuilder are both legitimate brokers i was aware already of each but i also just checked in the finra tool and the urls currently linked to by the question are legitimate web site addresses for each   also you can see their ev certificates in action on secured pages here and here as to whether your investments with those brokers would be safe in the event of the broker failing e.g. goes bankrupt you 'll want to know that they are members of the securities investor protection corporation wikipedia   of course this kind of protection does n't protect you if your investments simply go down in value but do your own due diligence always

insurance is n't a product designed to protect against financial loss the product is designed to allow people to pay a small fee the premium for peace of mind this allows the insured to feel as if their purchase was worthy they see the potential of loss as a concern and the premiums small enough to allow them to not worry about having a loss insurance companies will then seek out risks where the perceived losses far out weight the actual losses risk assessment so you answer is that your friends are paying for peace of mind

no credit card company would ever give a card with either no credit limit or that was not in credit for prepaid cards because they would earn no money from it the company 's income is entirely derived from fees that they charge you for balances and interest on those balances so a 0 limit card would be worthless to them getting a prepaid card and letting the balance hit 0 might be a way around this but the fees that you will be charged and will become a debt in your name when the billing system tries to take the first paid month 's cost from the card and fails will be exorbitant they may go so far as the actual cost but the one thing that they will certainly do is lower your credit rating so this is not a good idea

the first thing i would try is to take out a loan from a local credit union if you do n't know of any that you 're eligible for start looking at the national credit union administration 's credit union locator you should be able to get a good rate since your credit is so good if for whatever reason you ca n't get the credit union loan i would open another credit card try hard to get the loan though because using a credit card will most likely be significantly more expensive if you ca n't cover your cash only expenses with cash you already have make sure that you can get cash from the card for example one of my cards regularly sends me checks that i could write to myself to get cash but be careful with this strategy usually the interest is much higher than normal purchases either way until you 've paid off this emergency debt and built up an emergency fund of 3 6 months of expenses cut your expenses as much as possible this experian article has some good tips

as joetaxpayer has commented the markets are littered with the of those who buy into the idea that markets submit readily to formal analysis    financial markets are amongst the most complex systems we know of   to borrow a concept from mathematics that of a chaotic system one might say that financial markets are a chaotic system comprised of a structure of chaotic for example the unpredictable behaviour of a single big market participant can have dramatic effects on overall market behaviour in my experience becoming a successful investor requires a considerable amount of time and commitment and has a steep learning curve   your actions in abandoning your graduate studies hint that you are perhaps lacking in commitment most people believe that they are special and that investing will be easy money   if you are currently entertaining such thoughts then you would be well advised to forget them immediately and prepare to show some humility tl dr it is currently considered that behavioural psychology is a valuable tool in understanding investors behaviour as well as overall market trends   also in the area of psychology confirmation bias is another aspect of trading that it is important to keep in mind   quantitative analysis is a mathematical tool that is currently used by hedge funds and the big investment banks however these methods require considerable resources and given the   performance of hedge funds in the last few years it does not appear to be worth the investment if you are serious in wanting to make the necessary commitments then here are a few ideas on where to start there are certain technical details that you will need to understand in order to quantify the risks you are taking beyond simple buying and holding financial instruments   for example how option strategies can be used limit your risk how margin requirements may force your hand in volatile markets how different markets impact on one another e.g. the relationship between bond markets and equity markets and a host of other issues   also to repeat it is important to understand how your own psychology can impact on your investment decisions

gt that said the non profit also was likely to enroll about 1,000 students at nominal tuition levels whereas the for profit is likely to enroll tens of thousands with dozens of staff doing nothing but making sure their students get the largest possible student loans   i get what you are saying the non profit is n't causing as much long term damages as these for profit johnny come has anyone taken the numbers and really crunched them   i feel like the problem is the perverse incentives created by the student loan system there is n't anything inherently wrong with for profit colleges but there are issues under the current system because of the way we extend credit to students anytime credit is available the big corrupt banks are not far behind   i say get rid of the loan programs and see how these for profit schools adjust i think they would probably be able to adjust more quickly and possibly even get better than the non profit schools due to their lack of legacy contracts and traditions

you can you can take out a conventional mortgage and keep the cash   a mortgage is nothing but a secured loan against your home you can open a heloc and treat it as a negative equity bank account note that both a mortgage and a heloc tend to have significant up front or administrative costs attached to them   it costs the loaning institution some money to ensure they are in a safe position and they will want to pass it on to you they do n't want you taking out such a loan and not using it on the other hand the interest rates on such a loan are often much lower than interest rates on other loans if you have a reliable source of significant income getting a completely unsecured line of credit may be possible with a rate only a few percentage points higher than a heloc without having to pay a cent in fees   the bank does n't have to appraise your home or ensure ownership before such a loan just assess income which is easy especially if you have a regular paycheck auto deposited into an account at the same branch toss in some signatures from your employer and good to go if that is feasible you could end up with a lower rate   withdraw from the line of credit pay off your other loans then work to repay the line of credit if an unsecured line of credit has a rate 1 3 higher than a secured one and you are borrowing 5000 $ against it and pay it off over 2 years the total interest you would save from a secured line is about note that in some jurisdictions your home is protected against loss from bankruptcy unless you have used it as collateral for a loan or it is easier to claim the home if you are insolvent if you have used it as collateral   determining what the consequences of securing your loan against the house could itself be expensive

you 'd have to look at the terms of the loan to be sure but if the interest compounds weekly then you 'd have to calculate the effect of 3 compounding periods then compute for weekly payments the balance after 3 weeks would be using excel 's pmt function for that principal balance i get a weekly payment of $    if the interest does n't compound the principal balance will be about $ and the weekly payment would be $ note however that the terms of the loan could be completely customized so you 'd need to be sure that the payment and the amortization schedule make sense to you before you agree to the loan   since the interest is very high i suspect this is a no credit needed car loan which are notorious for unfavorable to the borrower terms

i admit in the long term there are a good number of to work out but in the end i want to see some system where people in general can seize the means to their own well being without stepping on one another   the management you talked about is another reason why i prefer worker co ops to be the optimum form of issuing business because its not just a few people in charge it 's a whole social group acting in     when you discuss the mom and pop store having no suppliers it would be good to promote some way of each money supply to have a share of each industry within it   there are always some people in every trade looking for their next job   they just have to find a supply where there trade is in demand   the process is self feeding   next off or course the mechanism of the system would work in a way that firm 's ca n't just pay themselves with their own debt they have to issue it to their creditors first and even then it 's practically impossible to accept your own debt as payment   you would have to take some from a competitor at best     what i 've been trying to do is find some system where no one institution or no one alliance holds the keys to the definition of value   if you have five to eight dictators fighting at once as opposed to one financial dictator who can oversee all like the fed scenario you just described it 's more possible for people who are freer relatively to survive freely between the borders of these of influence as they can play each dictator off the other   at least from your dialogue i can see you 're one of those who gets what i 'm trying to aim for     here 's another idea i 've explored with it that 's similar but may make the environment slightly different so let me know what you think   what i call the revolving tax window where the government accepts different both in quantity and specific of notes in intervals of every business quarter so that the demand for specific notes changes four times a year   from january until the end of march they could accept taxes in notes from firms a f h and t and for april into june it could be just b and s and so on   the options for note issuing could be set on a list of firms registered with the sec or whoever    the combination for the quarter could be picked at random by a algorithm so no firm could make a plan to be a market dictator and a sense of is maintained in the economy     obviously the more firms are properly registered on this list the more combinations of monetary combinations you have and the more power is distributed from too much control by anybody     what you can do is choose whether or not you want there to be less or more notes in the next quarter because just like fiscal policy and conventional monetary policy the extremes have trade offs but different ones to few currencies the economy may be stimulated but you get market dictators via monetary oligopoly even if temporary   too many you avoid market dictators who will be more focused on getting a real return by investing in competing ventures based on what will actually return investment but the economy may not be as stimulated   what do you think of this structural alternative   one of the sources i 've been building my economic policy on has been debt the first 5,000 years by david if anyone 's familiar

while the vanguard paper is good it does n't do a very good job of explaining precisely why each level of stocks or bonds was optimal if you 'd like to read a transparent and quantitative explanation of when and why a a glide path is optimal i 'd suggest the following paper   full disclosure i 'm the author   the answer is that the optimal risk level for any given holding period depends upon a combination of   using these two factors you construct a risk averse decision model which chooses the risk level with the best expected average outcome where it looks only at the median and lower percentile outcomes this produces an average which is specifically robust to downside risk the result will look something like this    the exact results will depend on the expected risk and return of the portfolio and the degree of risk aversion specified   the result is specifically valid for the case where you liquidate all of the portfolio at a specific point in time for retirement the glide path needs to be extended to take into account the fact that the portfolio will be liquidated gradually over time and dynamically take into account the longevity risk of the individual   i ca n't say precisely why vanguard 's path is how it is

well there are many papers on power spot price prediction for example it depends on what level of methodology you would like to use linear regression is one of the basic steps then you can continue with more advanced options i 'm a phd student studying modelling the energy price electricity gas oil as stochastic process regarding to your questions 1 mildly speaking it 's really hard due to its random nature   2 well i would ask what kind of measure of success you mean what level of predicted interval one could find successful enough 3 would you like me to send you some of the math based papers on 4 as i know the method is to fully capture all main characteristics of the price if it 's daily power price then these are mean reversion effect high volatility spike seasonality weekly monthly yearly   would you tell me what kind of method you 're using maybe we can discuss some shared ideas anna

the value of a stock ultimately is related to the valuation of a corporation   as part of the valuation you can estimate the cash flows discounted to present time of the expected cash flows from owning a share   this stock value is the so called fundamental value of a stock   what you are really asking is how is the stock 's market price and the fundamental value related   and by asking this you have implicitly assumed they are not the same    the reason that the fundamental value and market price can diverge is that simply most shareholders will not continue holding the stock for the lifespan of a company indeed some companies have been around for centuries   this means that without dividends or buybacks or liquidations or mergers acquisitions a typical shareholder can not reasonably expect to recoup their share of the company 's equity in this case the chief price driver is the aggregate expectation of buyers and sellers in the marketplace not fundamental evaluation of the company 's balance sheet    now obviously some expectations are based on fundamentals and expert opinions can differ but even when all the experts agree roughly on the numbers it may be that the market price is quite a ways away from their estimates   an interesting example is given in this survey of behavioral finance   it concerns palm a wholly owned subsidiary of   when palm went public its shares went for such a high price they were significantly higher than 's shares   this mispricing persisted for several weeks note that this facet of pricing is often given short in standard explanations of the stock market   it seems despite decades of academic research and nobel prizes being handed out to behavioral economists the knowledge has been slow to trickle down to laymen although any person will realize something is with the standard explanations    for example before 2012 the last time apple paid out dividends was 1995   are we really to believe that people were pumping up apple 's stock price from 1995 to 2012 because they were waiting for dividends or hoping for a merger or liquidation   it does n't seem plausible to me especially since after apple announced dividends that year apple stock ended up taking a deep dive despite wall street analysts stating the company was doing better than ever   that the stock price reflects expectations of the future cash flows from the stock is a thinly disguised form of the efficient market hypothesis emh and there 's a lot of evidence contrary to the emh see references in the previously linked survey   if you believe what happened in apple 's case was just a rational re evaluation of apple stock then i think you must be a hard core emh advocate basically and this is at length in the survey above fundamentals and market pricing can become   this is because there are in the marketplace making it difficult for people to take advantage of the mispricing   in some cases this can go on for extended periods of time possibly even years   part of the friction is caused by strong beliefs by market participants which can often shift pressure to supply or demand   two   popular on wall street are it does n't matter if you 're right   you have to be right at the right time   and it does n't matter if you 're right if the market disagrees with you   they suggest that you can make the right decision with where to put your money but being right is n't what drives prices   the market does what it does and it 's subject to the whims of its participants

the best thing for you to do will be to start using the cash flow report instead of the income and expense report go to reports > income and expense > cash flow once the report is open open the edit window and open the accounts tab   there choose your various cash accounts checking saving etc   in the general tab choose the reporting period   and then save the report settings so you do n't need to go hunting for your cash accounts each time gnucash will display for you all the inflows and outflows of money which appears to be what you really want though gnucash does n't present the cash flow in a way that matches united states accounting rules with sections for operating investing and financial cash flows separated it is certainly fine for your personal use if you want the total payment to show up as one line on the cash flow report you will need to book the accrual of interest and the payment to the mortgage bank as two separate entries normal entry for mortgage payments which shows up as a line for mortgage and a line for interest on your cash flow pair of entries to make full mortgage payment show up as one line on cash flow entry 1   interest accrual entry 2   full mortgage payment tested in gnucash

if you intend to flip this property you might consider either a construction loan or private money a construction loan allows you to borrow from a bank against the value of the finished house a little at a time as each stage of the construction repairs are completed the bank releases more funds to you interest accrues during the construction but no payments need to be made until the construction repairs are complete   private money works in a similar manner but the full amount can be released to you at once so you can get the repairs done more quickly the interest rate will be higher if you are flipping then this higher interest rate is simply a cost of doing business since it 's a private loan you ca structure the deal any way you want perhaps accruing interest until the property is sold and then paying it back as a single balloon payment on sale of the property to find private money contact a mortgage broker and tell them what you have in mind   if you 're intending to keep the property for yourself private money is still an option once the repairs are complete have the bank reassess the property value and refinance based on the new amount pay back the private loan with equity pulled from the house and all the shiny new repairs

people seem to think that yelp serves businesses or the public   it does n't   it serves yelpers   yelpers want reviews from other yelpers and that 's it   if you do n't review things frequently on yelp they do n't care about your opinion   sorry   nothing personal but this website is only interested in reviews from people who use the site frequently   you might be the most person in the world and you might post a great review of a business but this is n't your blog   you 're not entitled to have the world see your review here   they only want the opinion of regular yelpers   if you want to be a part of the yelp community keep making reviews and they 'll un filter your reviews   there are people who say that businesses that pay yelp get more reviews but it 's not true   the article even states that she was paying $ 350/month before these reviews got filtered out   the article also says a court case against yelp was thrown out because there was no evidence showing bias   people who claim this are just butt hurt and want to justify their bias by claiming that yelp is greedy and unscrupulous   the fact of the matter is this yelp has a powerful community   business owners see yelp as possibly affecting their business   they want to have control over that but they ca n't   in fact yelp goes out of their way to prevent that   many business owners simply are n't mentally capable of grasping how some things work and when things do n't go their way they get angry and make accusations   this particular woman who is currently taking 3 hours of social media classes per week wtf thinks there maybe needs to be some rules on the net that are n’t there now   no offense lady but you probably should n't be writing internet laws until you 're done with your internet for dummies classes   you might think that this is not a good model for a review website   if so do n't use it   it 's not a government institution and you 're not obligated to use it   go find another review site   better yet if you think yelp is so horrible go make your own review website that allows anyone to review things   i 'm sure it will be great and everyone will love it   whatever you choose stop trying to ruin yelp   the people who use it like the way the it is and do n't want some butt hurt non users fucking it up

the question is how does $ for 6.5 years fit into your budget or to put it another way what wo n't you be spending that money on housing food vacations retirement fund investments though you can invest your car fund in the meantime building a hefty emergency fund kids college funds saving for a down payment on a home charity etc are all other places that money could go i do n't know what your needs are today let alone 6.5 years into the future but i 'd encourage you to consider all your financial goals and evaluate where this expense would fit   it seems your plan is to save up to the total cost of the car and then buy it in cash that 's a valid strategy but it means you 'll have no car unless you already own one for 6.5 years   do you need a car if so what will you drive in the meantime and even if you already own another car outright you 'll have gas and maintenance expenses if you do n't need a car then $ 100,000 is a rather extravagant purchase for something we just established you do n't need would you be happier having this expensive car in 6.5 years or having a series of less expensive cars starting now or buying a used model of the expensive car sooner or having no car at all also a lot can change in 6.5 years cars will evolve and there 'll be different models and options available maybe your salary will have doubled or maybe you 'll be unemployed you could be living in a different city have a different commute and maybe you 'll need a minivan to haul kids around or live in a place with bad winters and want a drive you 'll also need to be prepared for the additional expenses that generally come with expensive cars such as higher insurance and maintenance rates and parking could be costly if you live in an expensive city   the other option of course if the car is truly something you need want and can afford would be to save up a sizable down payment and finance the rest so you can get the car sooner finally there 's nothing wrong with saving your money for 6.5 years building up that fund and then what makes the most sense for you at that time maybe it will the car maybe something else but the nice thing about having savings is that it gives you more options

context clues hun i was talking about if you go to chilis and swipe your card for $ 20 and leave a $ 5 tip the processing amount the bank takes into account when telling you your available balance is much more likely to be $ 23 than $ 25 so the bank knows i went to chilis the second i swipe my card but does nt know the exact amount i was saying a lot of people do nt understand that they see they spent x at chilis processing and assume it to be fact i do n't understand why you 're having such a difficult time with this concept    also comparing swiping a debit card as credit to writing a check in terms of when they show up on your account is a terrible comparison when a check goes through the accurate balance is taken out all at once a few days later but when you swipe a debit card as credit a tentative balance is taken out immediately and adjusted to the actual balance when it settles    and calling me ignorant because i do n't need the help writing down where my money is at or goes is pretty ironic

gt people generally do not like labor especially if it is something they do not find fulfilling    i agree sort of of course people do n't enjoy doing work they find unpleasant but i think the idea that people do not like working as a rule is not as obvious as it seems after all that 's more of a guess as it has never been tested in any meaningful way humans throughout history have for the most part worked    while i have an easy time agreeing that it 's preferable for people to work on things they find fulfilling or at least not unpleasant than to work on things they hate i 'm not sold on the concept that people would actually prefer not working at all to working i think productivity and purpose are critical components to the human experience and work plays a big role in them in other words the idea of not working would n't necessarily match the reality of not working if we ever had a chance to properly explore it on a side note i think this is something absolutely worth experimenting with you could run some decent experiments for less than $ 50 m which is really a small amount to explore such a universally relevant topic    gt wage chattel slavery has never nor will it ever be a positive attribute to any society    this strikes me as a loaded statement and on the surface at least not one i agree with please help me understand your thinking here    how exactly do you define wage slavery    if you define it as working in order to survive would you consider maintaining a small working farm in order to feed your family as was done by many throughout history to be a form of wage slavery how about hunting and gathering not paid labor clearly but nonetheless difficult work that was done only because it was necessary for the worker to survive    is working for wages which you can then exchange to buy food and such different in kind from working to produce or capture food is working to afford enough food and shelter to survive different from working to afford more luxurious food or shelter    i 'm not being i 'm just trying to understand the implications of that statement    as far as a reduction in hours worked that is n't necessarily   disastrous it may be but it can also be mitigated for instance if fewer hours worked yield the same or higher income this is n't as radical as it sounds it could for example be viewed as value based pricing of results as opposed to input    that said in practice i think significant job loss due to technology would be handled poorly and thus very messy at least at first    however i do n't think that the shift in job markets will be as sudden or severe as many claim it will be i think that 's a bit of sensationalist fear mongering based more on predictions than evidence

he general advice i get is that the younger you are the more higher risk investments you should include in your portfolio i will be frank this is a rule of thumb given out by many lay people and low level financial advisors but not by true experts in finance   it is little more than an old 's tale and does not come from solid theory nor empirical work   finance theory says the following the riskiness of your portfolio should inversely correspond to your risk aversion   period it says nothing about your age   some people become more risk averse as they get older but not everyone   in fact for many people it probably makes sense to increase the riskiness of their portfolio as they age because the uncertainty about both wealth social security the value of your house the value of your human capital and costs how many kids you will have the rate of inflation where you will live go down as you age so your overall level of risk falls over time without a corresponding mechanical increase in risk aversion in fact if you start from the assumption that people 's aversion is to not having enough money at retirement you get the result that people should invest in relatively safe securities until the probability of not having enough to cover their minimum needs gets small then they invest in highly risky securities with any money above this threshold this latter result sounds reasonable in your case   at this point it appears unlikely that you will be unable to meet your minimum needs i'm assuming here that you are able to appreciate the warnings about underfunded pensions in other answers and still feel comfortable   with any money above and beyond what you consider to be prudent preparation for retirement you should hold a risky but still fully diversified portfolio   do n't reduce the risk of that portion of your portfolio as you age unless you find your personal risk aversion increasing

it 's pretty easy in the interview setup for check the box for self employment business income then during the process of filling everything out you 'll get a self employment screen it 'll ask for the name of your business but just put your own name since you do n't have one for the classification code click the button and look through the list for the industry that best matches the one for whom you wrote the technical report or you can go with independent artists writers and performers it does n't really matter that much so do n't worry if it 's a poor match it will also ask you for your income and expenses    i do n't know exactly what costs you might have incurred to write your report but you can likely claim a very tiny amount of home office expenses costs like rent or mortgage interest + property tax utilities and home insurance can be claimed but they have to be pro rated for the time you were actually doing the work and are based on the amount of space you used for the work   for example if you paid $ 1000 rent and $ 200 utilities for the month in which the work was done and it took you 20 of the 31 days in that month to actually do the work and you used a room that makes up about 10 of the square footage of your home then you can claim $ 1200 0.1 = $ for your home office expenses if you also used that room for non business purposes during that time then you reduce it even further say if the room was also used for playing video games 50 of the time then you 'd only claim $

they are not required to fulfill the trade that they have intended to execute   they are able to cancel or modify the trade at any point   example this is how insiders are able to manipulate the price of shares through there buying and selling intentions   a ceo would be able to disclose a buy order for a month from now or whatever time period is required   this would most likely increase the price of the stock as investors would see this as a good sign of company performance   up until the point when the buy order is scheduled to execute the ceo can then cancel the order and create a new sell order   since the stock is high in price his new order is likely to make him money based on the manipulation from his trading intentions    i am not an expert on the subject and only know as much as i do through personal research here is an interesting article about this kind of insider trading and manipulation fine line between legal and illegal insider

ideally you would negotiate a car price without ever mentioning and other factors that affect the price you and the dealer would then negotiate a true price for the car followed by the application of rebates followed by negotiating for the loan if there is to be one in practice this rarely happens the sales rep asks point blank what rebates you qualify for by asking get to know you questions like where you work or if you served in the armed forces you may not realize that these are do you qualify for a rebate questions before you 've even chosen a model they take that into account right from the beginning along with whether they 'll make a profit lending you money or have to spend something to subsidize your zero percent loan however unlike your veteran 's status your loan intentions are so when you get to the end you can ask if the price could be improved by paying cash or you could try putting the negotiated price on a credit card and when they do n't like that ask for a further discount to stop you from using the credit card and paying cash

4 finally do all companies reduce their stock price when they pay a dividend are they required to there seems to be confusion behind this question   a company does not set the price for their stock so they ca n't reduce it either   in fact nobody sets the price for a stock the price you see reported is simply the last price that the stock was traded at   that trade was just one particular trade in a whole sequence of trades   the price used for the trade is simply the price which the particular buyer and particular seller agreed to for that particular trade   no agreement well then no trade   there 's no authority for the price other than the collection of all buyers and sellers so what happens when nokia declares a 55 cent dividend   when they declare there is to be a dividend they state the record date which is the date which determines who will get the dividend the owners of the shares on that date are the people who get the dividend payment   the stock exchanges need to account for the payment so that investors know who gets it and who does n't so they set the ex dividend date which is the date on which trades of the stock will first trade without the right to receive the dividend payment   ex dividend is usually about 2 days before record date   these dates are established well before they occur so all market participants can know exactly when this change in value will occur when trading on ex dividend day begins there is no authority to set a different price than the previous day 's closing price   what happens is that all knowledgeable market participants know that today nokia is trading without the payment 55 cents that buyers the previous day get   so what do they do   they take that into consideration when they make an offer to buy stock and probably end up offering a price that is about 55 cents less than they would have otherwise   similarly sellers know they will be getting that 55 cents so when they choose a price to offer their stock at it will likely be about that much less than they would have asked for otherwise

most companies are taken over one can reasonably guess that company x will be taken over for a price p at some future point in time then the company has a value today that is less than price p by a large enough margin so that the investor will likely make out when the company finally is taken over at some unknown point in time the exception is a company like microsoft or apple that basically grow too large to be taken over but then they eventually start paying dividends when they become mature again the trick during the non dividend paying period e.g. ten or fifteen years ago is to guess what dividends will be paid in some future time and price the stock low enough today so that it will be worthwhile for the buyer

value investing is just an investment strategy it 's an alternative to technical investing buffet made money picking stocks   it 's not obvious how that adds value but it does everything about the stock market is ultimately about ipos without active trading of stocks after issue no one would buy at the ipo   the purpose of an ipo is to finance the long term growth of a business which is the point in the process where the value to the people gets created   there is a group of elites that needs to be dealt with you 're correct but i worry that your definition of this group is overly broad

in some countries   the mafia is an accepted part of the system like some areas in italy   in this country it is not but government taxes are as they provide services that the people want   that is decided by the majority not by the individual   and if you individually choose to not partake of that system you can either face criminal results or you can head out for a country with low no taxes   i hear somalia has no country taxes

in most markets there are fixed fees known as commissions for instance with a retail broker in the stock market you can expect every trade to cost you $ 7.00 as an example it is $ 7.00 regardless of if you place a trade for $ 25 or $ 25,000 you will see that just opening the trade with a smaller amount will eat up all of your profits and a majority of your capital but if you opened the trade with more capital through the investment group then the $ 7.00 commission will be much less of a tax on your trade basically the only advantage is that the tax of commissions will be less if you have a larger account if the commission is a fixed dollar value which is not always true either regardless at $ 25 per month not many markets will be accessible there is also the possible educational aspect of investing with a group of people or it can simply be ideals

retail has been in a slump for quite a few years now   these companies are short on cash cut costs take on debt to pay manufacturers and fund operating costs products do not sell short on cash cut costs take on debt again etc   go through this cycle enough times everyone starts to look for exits banks want to get paid on the loans and retailers want to lower the debt service   this usually ends up at the door step of a pe shop   these retailers are usually over levered by the time pe ships are involved   pe adds its own tranches of debt and off to the races the retailers go   many retailers are figuring out consumers just are not interested in buying from them no cash cut costs can not service debt ch 11 likely end up on the of another pe shop

congratulations the first savings goal should be an emergency fund   think of this not as an investment but as insurance against life 's woes   they happen and having this kind of money earmarked allows one to invest without needing to withdraw at an inopportune time    this should go into a high interest savings account or money market account   figure three to six months of expenses the next goal should be retirement savings   in the us this is typically done through 401 k or if your company does not offer one either a roth ira or traditional ira   the goal should be about 15 of your income   you should favor a 401k match over just about anything else and then a roth over that    the key to transforming from a broke college student into a person with a real job and disposable income is a budget   otherwise you might just end up as a broke person with a real job not fun   part of your budget should include savings spending and giving   all three areas are the key to building wealth    once you have all of those taking care of the real fun begins   that is you have an emergency fund you are putting 15 to retirement you are spending some on yourself and giving to a charity of your choice   then you can dream some with any money left over after expenses of course    do you want to retire early   invest more for retirement   looking to buy a home or own a bunch of rental property   start educating yourself and invest for that    are you passionate about a certain charity   give more and save some money to take time off in order to volunteer for that charity all that and more can be yours   budgeting is a key concept and the younger you start the easier it gets    while the financiers will disagree with me you can not really invest if you are borrowing money   keep debt to zero or just on a primary residence   i can tell you from personal experience that i did not started building wealth until i made a firm commitment to being out of debt buy cars for cash and never pay credit card interest   pay off student loans as soon as possible for some reason the idea of giving to charity   a cursory study of millionaires will indicate some surprising facts   most of them are self made most of them behave differently than pop culture and among other things most of them are generous givers   building wealth is about behavior   giving to charity is part of that behavior   its my own theory that giving does almost no good for the recipient but a great amount of good for the giver    this may seem difficult to believe but i ask that you try it

yes absolutely   the hsa when used for medical expenses allows you to essentially pay for your medical expenses tax free even if you do n't have extra room in your budget you can fund the hsa as you incur medical expenses then withdraw money to pay the expenses and you 'll see an immediate tax benefit at tax time   however let 's say that you have plenty of room in your budget and you do n't have a lot of medical expenses you already contribute the maximum to your 401(k or ira and you want to do more the hsa acts like a retirement account in this case allowing you to contribute before tax money and let it grow untaxed   the hsa does have a huge benefit that no other retirement account has if you choose not to reimburse yourself for medical expenses but you keep track of the unreimbursed expenses you incur then you can reimburse yourself for these expenses at any point in the future completely tax free essentially your contributions are treated like a traditional ira but your withdrawals are treated like a roth ira and can be done at any age if you do n't acquire enough medical expenses you can still withdraw whatever is left at age 65 and those withdrawals will be taxed like a traditional ira   the hsa provides for tax free contributions and growth if used for medical expenses and tax deferred growth if withdrawn after age 65 without medical expenses

one of the main advantages is that duplication from a few sources is no longer a vector   the two big examples the lesser first card skimming and breaches like target 's   the chip essentially generates a unique transaction code and that is generated inside the chip   so even if you installed a chip you 'd have to beat the merchant to using the code and it would only be good once   the same is true if you get something like the target breach   instead of a giant dump of card numbers you get a giant dump of used codes which are n't very useful for getting money   even if the risk of stolen cards goes up it should be a huge advantage for the banks    additionally a number of the banks are now implementing quick and short term freezes like the discover it card app   you simply click freeze in the app if you are n't sure where your card is and unfreeze it when you do   the assumption here is that people are more likely to freeze it and do so sooner than if they have to wait for a new card in the mail   theoretically there 's nothing stopping a consumer from keeping the card frozen all the time and it when they walk into a store except the of it

overpriced shares cheaper to raise new capital through secondary share offerings or debt using shares as a security off hostile take overs since the company is too dear when a company is taken over it needs only one set of management top management of the company that is taken over loses their jobs no one wants to lose their job shareholders love to see share price grow sale brings them profit secures jobs for company management shares are used as a currency during acquisitions if company shares are overpriced that means they can buy another company on the cheap paying with the overpriced shares undervalued shares more expensive to raise additional capital through secondary share offerings for the same amount of capital the management has to offer a bigger chunk of the company have to offer bigger chunk of a company as a security as well makes company vulnerable to hostile take overs company is makes it an attractive bargain once the company is taken over top management will almost certainly lose jobs falling price makes shareholders unhappy they will vote management out makes difficult to acquire other companies

the way they explain it is this say you contribute 1 million each month from july 2010 to june 2011 they wait for the 12 million at the end of the year and start to invest it at the start of the next financial year july 2011 to june 2012 so after june 2012 they 'll get the profit subtract admin costs and all then announce the balance as interest the interest announced applies to the whole 12 million from 2010 11 i guess the excuse here is that since they announce interest per financial year they would n't have enough time to properly invest money collected towards the end months of apr may and june if they were to announce interest in the following july so they 'd need another year to properly do the investing for that money collected   how else would you handle giving interest for money collected in june i can see their point but i just feel like there 's something off there

a constant answer which i see brought up in a variety of forums is the complaint that schools do n't teach money management budgeting and how to do taxes   another good bit of information would be to take apart a credit card statement show how the interest is calculated etc   i 'd start with those topics which might take a bit of research on your part many adults do n't understand many of these concepts either and then build from there    i remember the first time i was able to go from a list of transactions on a credit card statement and calculate the interest owed from the average daily balance and it was like a light coming on   most people use these concepts on a regular basis but have no of what 's going on beneath the surface

confirming whether the payment was an error the simplest method is to confirm manually with the university whether the payment was a mistake and satisfy that between yourselves if you 're concerned it 's i recommend calling the university finance office on a phone number you find on their website or call one of the people you know reversing the payment to formally reverse the payment i 'd check your product disclosure statement on your account with the bank there 's almost always a fee involved where a payment is reversed it 's probably easiest to just issue the payment back to the university to an agreed account number

if the strike price closest to the underlying has high open interest the options expiration is a bigger event    for instance   stock is at $ 20 w/ average volume of 100,000 shares per day     20 strike has 1000 open interest    in this example the stock will most likely pin at 20 if we were expiring tomorrow      as u prob know long calls at close turn into stock long puts at turn into short stock    option pros high of volume do nt want to be short or long after expiration    long call holders will sell above 20 to hedge and long put holders will buy below 20    1000 open interest is equivalent to 100,000 shares    that 's the same amount as the average volume    stock ca n't really move until after expiration    if i am long 10 $ 20 calls and short 1000 shares i am flat going into expiration unless the stock gets smoked and now i am synthetically long a put short stock + long long put then watch out cause it was artificially locked down

an exchange traded fund etf is a special type of mutual fund that is traded on the stock exchange like a stock   to invest you buy it through a stock broker just as you would if you were buying an individual stock when looking at a mutual fund based in the u.s. the easiest way to tell whether or not it is an etf is by looking at the ticker symbol   traditional mutual funds have ticker symbols that end in x and etfs have ticker symbols that do not end in x    the jpmorgan emerging markets equity fund with ticker symbol is a traditional mutual fund not an etf   jpmorgan does have etfs the jpmorgan diversified return emerging markets equity etf with ticker symbol is an example   this etf invests in similar stocks as however because it is an index based fund instead of an actively managed fund it has lower fees if you are n't sure about the ticker symbol the advertising prospectus of any etf should clearly state that it is an etf   in the example of above they put etf right in the fund name   if you do n't see etf mentioned it is most likely a traditional mutual fund another way to tell is by looking at the investment minimums of the fund   has a minimum initial investment of $ 1000   etfs however do not have an investment minimum listed because it is traded like a stock you simply buy whole shares at whatever the current share price is   so if you look at the fees and investment minimums section of the page you 'll see the fees listed but not any investment minimums

you would appear to be a swing trader like myself i have been trading futures and futures options for 29 years and have both made and lost a lot of money in that time my trades last hours to days to at most a few weeks from my experience the most important skills are 1 money management keeping trade size small in relation to total capital i typically risk 2 3 of my capital on a trade so a loss is fairly immaterial 2 risk management limit your loss on every trade either by using stop orders options or a combination of these 2 3 emotional discipline be prepared to exit a position or reverse from long to short or short to long   on a moment 's notice the market does n't care where you entered or whether you make or lose money do n't let your or the news influence your decisions but follow the market 4 methodology discipline test your analysis trade entry method to ensure that it is objective and has a reasonably good probability of success then stick with it variation will inevitably lead to indecision or emotional reactions 5 flexibility consider trading anything which can make you a profit but ensure that there is a lot of liquidity i trade 30 different futures markets as well as various option writing strategies in these markets   feel free to reach out if you want to discuss further i have about 500 yes 500 trading e books as well on every trading subject you can think of

for all stocks expected dividends are a part of the price it is traded for consider that originally the whole idea of stocks was to participate in the earnings of the company = get dividends the day the dividend is paid that expectation is of course removed and thereby the stock value reduced by just the amount of dividend paid you will see that behavior for all stocks everywhere the dividend in your example is just high relative to the stock price but that is a company decision they can decide whatever amount they want as a dividend in other words the day before dividend payments investors value the stock at $ plus an expected dividend payment of 12 $ which adds to 26 $ the day after the dividend payment investors still value the stock at $ plus no more dividend payment = 0 $ nothing changed really in the valuation

the first rule i follow is pretty simple get paid for what you do earn a return on what you own if you are running your company prudently you should earn a salary for the position and responsibilities you hold within the business this salary should be competitive you should be able to replace yourself in the business at this salary if your title is president or ceo look for market rate salaries for others in that position within your industry and company size if you wear multiple hats in a small business you will likely have to blend this salary based on those various positions   based on how you run your business the money left over at the end of the year after you and your team takes a competitive wage is your profit if there is n't any profit then you might want to do some work on your business model but if their is a profit then it 's a clear return on what you own and not just a payment for work completed the idea would be that you could exit the business as an operator pay someone else to do exactly what you do and you would continue to get that profit return at the end of the year this is when a business acts like a true asset   whether you take your money in salary or profit distributions or dividends depending on your structure taxes are about the same salaries get normal employee contributed taxes but then of course the company matches these it is identical if you take a guaranteed payment or distribution that gets hit with self employment taxes profits are also going to get hit with the same taxes   follow ups 1 a fair salary would be a competitive market wage for the position you hold within the business what is left over would be considered true profits and not just fabricated profits by taking a lower than market wage to boost the appearance of profitability 2 shareholders requesting salary information would be covered in your operating agreement or shareholder agreement this might be terms you set with your investors or you might simply set a term that you only need approval if a single salary exceeds a cap like $ 250,000 which would mean you would need to present why you deserve a higher salary and have your board approve if you are governed by said board via your investors profitability is a different ballpark your investors most likely have a right to see a monthly quarterly and/or annual profit loss statement which should clearly state profitability i ca n't imagine running a completely closed book company to my investors actually i ca n't really imagine ever investing in a company where i am not permitted to see the financials   something to also consider here is the threat of trying to keep your profit numbers low in order to not pay taxes or to pay yourself a higher salary if you ever plan to sell or exit the company most widely accepted valuations of a business are done from profits or you might think you are saving yourself a couple points on taxes by avoiding profits in the short term but if you exit the business and get a 3 5x or even up to in some cases multiplier on your annual profits you might be kicking yourself for trying to hide them through your accounting practices buyers will often sniff out an owner who created false profits by not paying themselves but what 's harder to do is figure out how much profits should have been when there were none on the books by saving yourself $ 100,000 in taxes this year could add up to close to $ 1,000,000 in an acquisition   good luck

if one of the euro countries goes bankrupt then it will the entire financial industry ie there would be many financial institutions banks credit union pension funds insurance funds corporates that are holding euro investments in that country will loose their money and this will have a impact similar and much bigger than us sub prime crisis of 2008 so if your money is in euro and you are staying in euro countires the inflation will mean your money is of less value if you are holding usd and staying in euro and country goes bankrupt then chances are that it will loose value with usd and hence you can convert them to euro and spend more euros to buy the same items

in the us market at least there is long term evidence that there 's no strong correlation between interest rates and house prices a less detailed canadian study found that house prices tended to increase when rates increase   one possible reason interest rates can increase when the economy is doing well needs less help which is also the time when people feel more confident about buying the are many reasons why toronto condo prices may come down such as oversupply or may increase empty downsizing   but by itself a small increase in interest rates appears based on history to be unlikely to lead to a substantial drop in prices over a short timescale

a. bank transfer is the normal way to do it the law society will eventually make good any losses incurred on money held by solicitors acting fraudulently so your money should not be at risk provided you make sure to transfer the money to the account number your solicitor gave you b. it 's not just normal but essential to transfer the money before exchanging contracts since the deposit has to be paid by your solicitor to the vendor 's solicitor as part of the   exchange process you ca n't wait to pay the deposit until after you 've exchanged because you have n't exchanged until you 've paid the deposit c. if you really want to put down the 10 deposit now and pay the rest upon completion that should be possible talk to your solicitor about it

the limit on sep ira is 25 not 20   if you 're self employed filing on schedule c then it 's taken on net earning which in your example would be 25 of $ 90,000 joetaxpayer is correct as regards the 401(k limits   the elective deferrals are per person that 's a cap in sum across multiple plans and across both traditional and roth if you have those   in general it 's actually across other retirement plan types too see below if you 're self employed and set up a 401(k for your own business the elective deferral is still aggregated with any other 401(k plans in which you participate that year but you can still make the employer contribution on your own plan this irs page is current a pretty good one on this topic   key quotes that are relevant the business owner wears two hats in a 401(k plan employee and employer contributions can be made to the plan in both capacities the owner can contribute both deferrals up to 100 of compensation earned income in the case of a self employed individual up to the annual contribution limit   $ 18,000 in 2015 and 2016 or $ 24,000 in 2015 and 2016 if age 50 or over plus nonelective contributions up to   25 of compensation as defined by the plan or for self employed individuals see discussion below it continues with this example the amount you can defer including pre tax and roth contributions to all your plans not including 457(b plans is $ 18,000 in 2015 and 2016 although a plan 's terms may place lower limits on contributions the total amount allowed under the tax law does n’t depend on how many plans you belong to or who sponsors those plans example ben age 51 earned $ 50,000 in w-2 wages from his s corporation in 2015 he deferred $ 18,000 in regular elective deferrals plus $ 6,000 in catch up contributions to the 401(k plan his business contributed 25 of his compensation to the plan $ 12,500 total contributions to the plan for 2015 were $ this is the maximum that can be contributed to the plan for ben for 2015 a business owner who is also employed by a second company and participating in its 401(k plan should bear in mind that his limits on elective deferrals are by person not by plan he must consider the limit for all elective deferrals he makes during a year notice in the example that ben contributed more that than his elective limit in total his was $ 24,000 in the example because he was old enough for the $ 6,000 catch up in addition to the $ 18,000 that applies to everyone else   he did this by declaring an employer contribution of $ 12,500 which was limited by his compensation but not by any of his elective contributions beyond the 401(k keep in mind that elective contributions are capped across different types of retirement plans as well so if you have a sep ira and a solo 401(k your total contributions across those plans are also capped   that 's also mentioned in the example now to the extent that you 're considering different types of plans that 's a whole question in itself one that might be worth consulting a dedicated tax advisor   a few things to consider not extensive list as for payroll self employment tax looks like you will end up paying medicare including the new additional medicare tax that came with the aca but not ss if you have wages as well as self employment    earnings the tax on your wages is paid first    but this rule only applies if your total earnings    are more than $ 118,500 for example if you    will have $ 30,000 in wages and $ 40,000 in    income in 2016 you will pay the    appropriate social security taxes on both your    wages and business earnings in 2016 however    if your wages are $ and you have $    in net earnings from a business you do n’t pay    dual social security taxes on earnings more    than $ 118,500 your employer will withhold    7.65 percent in social security and medicare    taxes on your $ in earnings you must    pay 15.3 percent in social security and medicare    taxes on your first $ in self employment    earnings and 2.9 percent in medicare tax on the    remaining $ 200 in net earnings other good irs resources

for any sort of investment you need to understand your risks first if you 're going to put money into the stock or bond market i would get a hold of graham 's the intelligent investor first or any other solid value investing book and educate yourself on what the risks are i ca n't speak about real estate investing but i am sure there are plenty of books describing risks and benefits of that as well i could see inflation deflation having an effect there but i think the biggest impact on the landlord front is quality of life in the area you are renting and the quality of the tenant you can get one crazy tenant and you will be driven mad yourself as for starting a business one thing i would like to say is that money does not automatically make money the business should be driven by a product or service that you can provide first and the backing seed capital second in my opinion you will have to put energy and time worth much more than the 100k into a business over time to make it successful so the availability of capital should not be the driving decision here hope this helps more than it confuses

i just read through all of the answers to this question and there is an important point that no one has mentioned yet oftentimes buying a house is actually cheaper than renting the identical house i 'm looking around my area suburbs of chicago il in 2017 and seeing some houses that are both for sale and for rent which makes for an easy comparison if i buy the house with $ 0 down you ca n't actually put $ 0 down but it makes the numerical comparison more accurate if you do my monthly payment including mortgage taxes insurance and hoa is still $ 400 less than the monthly rent payment if i put 20 down it 's an even bigger savings so in addition to the the tax advantages of owning a home the locked in price that helps you in an economy that experiences inflation and the accumulated equity you may even have extra cash flow too if you were on the fence when you would have had to pay more per month in order to purchase it should be a no brainer to buy if your monthly cost is lower from the original question get a loan and buy a house or i can live for the rest of my life in rent and save the extra money investing and stuff well you may be able to buy a house and save even more money than if you rent of course this is highly dependent on your location

losing the manufacturing jobs is a necessary evil of any developed nation yes germany is an exception but that is only because they specialise in expensive high quality items this transition has happened before in every developed nation when manufacturing replaced agriculture as the main sector of income and the same is happening again   the key is that we have to adapt and accept that rather than fight it fighting this transition will simply slow progress people simply have to retrain and adapt to a knew skill set yes it is n't easy but trying to artificially stop low paid jobs moving to places with a cheaper labour force is impossible companies have to remain globally competitive    i appreciate if everyone globally gets paid a descent salary this would n't be an issue however this is not the case and will not be any time soon the reality is manufacturing of non luxury goods will hardly exist in   developed nations and will be solely down by the likes of china and india however give it another 20 years china will be in exactly the same boat losing their manufacturing jobs to a less developed nations or maybe robots by then

they all basically mean the same thing a type of debt than can be exchanged for converted into equity at some point it 's only the mechanics that can be different a convertible bond is structured just like a regular bond it usually pays periodic interest and has a face value that 's due at maturity the difference is that the bond holder has the option to exchange the debt for equity at some point during the life of the bond   there can be restrictions on when that conversion is possible and they typically define a quantity of equity number of shares that the bond can be converted into   if the market price of the shares goes above a price that would make the shares more valuable than the bond it 's in the best interest of the bond holder to convert a convertible note is typically used to describe a kind of startup financing that does not pay interest or have a face value that 's redeemed but instead is redeemed for equity as part of a later financing round   rather than specifying a specific number of shares the bond holder receives equity at a certain discount to the rest of the market so they both are debt instruments that can turn into equity investments just through different mechanisms a debenture is a fancy word for unsecured debt and convertible debt could be used to described either structure above so those terms could mean either type of structure

yeah i agree what cat did was likely illegal but a lot of that was due to incompetence if done properly they could have ended up in the gray range where they could potentially justify their tax position to the irs    to the larger point though it just seems wasteful to play these games i understand everyone does it and that it 's part of the system it just all seems a bit ridiculous and i wonder if there 's a simpler solution that could benefit all stakeholders governments get similar revenues   without dealing with ridiculous complexities of tax avoidance schemes companies are more efficient and then efficiency or revenue gains can be passed onto workers my main worry however is that these gains would be passed onto executive bonuses instead

the simple answer is to not close your american bank accounts or if you have already done so open one make sure it allows for internet banking and use it to pay all your bills periodically move some money from your canadian account to your us account to cover the bills i have done this between canada and the uk for fifteen years now an alternative is to set up a usd account at your canadian bank   most organizations will happily mail your bills abroad unless the bills are actually associated with an address like a utility in which case you should get the person living there to take care of them much better is to use electronic billing for everything

hey guys i have a quick question about a financial accounting problem although i think it 's not really an accounting problem but just a bond problem   here it goes     corporation issued semiannual coupon bonds with a face value of $ 110,000 several years ago the annual coupon rate is 8 with two coupons due each year six months apart the historical market interest rate was 10 compounded when corporation issued the bonds equal to an effective interest rate of = 1.05 × 1.05 1 corporation accounts for these bonds using amortized cost measurement based on the historical market interest rate the current market interest rate at the beginning of the current year on these bonds was 6 compounded for an effective interest rate of = 1.03 × 1.03 1 the market interest rate remained at this level throughout the current year the bonds had a book value of $ 100,000 at the beginning of the current year when the firm made the payment at the end of the first six months of the current year the accountant debited a liability for the exact amount of cash paid compute the amount of interest expense on these bonds for the last six months of the life of the bonds assuming all bonds remain outstanding until the retirement date   my question is why would they give me the effective interest rate for both the historical and current rate   the problem states that the firm accounts for the bond using historical interest which is 10 semiannual and the coupon payments are twice per year   i was just wondering if i should just do the beginning balance which is 100000 in this case x balance so on and so forth until i get to the maturity value i got an answer of and was wondering if that 's the correct approach or not

i bought a house 6 months ago for $ 240,000 on an $ 80k salary am getting by just fine and am able to save money and i live on long island an extremely expensive area to live i would look at finding a few more interest rate quotes for instance wells fargo is offering 4.25 right now for fha first time home buyers loan which only require 3.5 down a lower interest rate will lower your monthly payment make the banks compete with one another this little bit of leg work will save you thousands upon thousands of dollars in the long run also try to negotiate to not paying a point down on the mortgage most of the time they are bull especially in this economy banks are desperate for new loans   however as others have said do not assume or count on rent coming in to be able to afford your mortgage unless you are married what if your friend moves out and you can not find another tenant   however i strongly recommend you talk to a financial adviser and your bank mortgage loan officer to work out the numbers you will be surprised what you can afford when you factor in your income tax and mortgage interest write offs

you are on the right track with your math but be wary of your assumptions if you can borrow money at x% and can afford to make payments on the debt and you can get a return of > x% from investing then you would make more money by keeping the debt and investing your savings another way to think of it by paying off the debt you are getting a guaranteed 5 return because that 's the rate you 'd have paid if you kept the debt be wary of your assumption of getting a 10 return in the s&p 500 nothing is guaranteed even over the long term actual results may well be less and you could lose money it does n't have to be all or nothing why not pay off the higher rate debt at 5 and keep the 3 debt that 's a guaranteed 5 return by paying off the loan and 3 is a pretty low interest rate if you can afford to make the payments i see nothing wrong with investing your savings instead of paying off the loan make sure you have an emergency fund too

how would this trade behave irl i do n't know how the simulation handles limit orders and bid ask spreads to know it 's feasible but buying at when the current ask is 8.00 seems unlikely   that would mean that all other sell orders between 8.00 and were fulfilled which means that there were very few sellers or that sell pressure spiked both of which seem unlikely in reality it seems more likely that your order would have sat there until the ask dropped to $ if it ever did and then you 'd have to wait until the bid rose to $ in order to sell them at that price however that kind of swing in option prices in not unrealistic   options near at the money tend to move in price at about 50 of the change in the underlying so if amazon suddenly dropped by $ 5 the option price could drop by $ from to $ and then rise back to $ if the price rose $ 8 which would be 1 swing and not unheard of intra day but it sounds like you got very lucky or the simulation does n't handle option trading realistically i 've traded options in the past and have had some breaks similar to yours   i 've also had bad breaks where i lost my entire investment the options expire out of the money so it should be a very limited part of your portfolio and probably only used for risk management e.g. buying put options to lock in some gains but keeping some upside potential

i wondered about this problem too so i looked into the maths and made this app it uses the free document format player if you try it out you can see what conditions favour renting vs buying   my own conclusion was to aim to buy a property outright upon reaching retirement age if not sooner example this example compares buying a £ 400,000 house with renting for £ 1,000 a month while depositing equivalent amounts in savings to total the same monthly outgoings as the buyer   mortgage rate deposit rate property appreciation and rent inflation can be specified   the example mortgage term is 20 years   as you can see the buyer and renter come out about even after the mortgage term but the buyer comes off better after that having no more mortgage to pay   of course the rent to live in a £ 400,000 house would probably be more than £ 1,000 but this case shows an equivalence point

you can make a start to learn how to make better investing decisions by learning and understanding what your current super funds are invested in does the super fund give you choices of where you can invest your funds and how often does it allow you to change your investment choices each year if you are interested in one area of investing over others eg property or shares then you should learn more on this subject as you can also start investing outside of superannuation your funds in superannuation are taxed less but you are unable to touch them for another 30 to 35 years you also need to consider investing outside super to help meet your more medium term goals and grow your wealth outside of super as well if you are interested in shares then i believe you should learn about both fundamental and technical analysis they can help you to make wiser decisions about what to invest in and when to invest   above is a chart of the asx200 over the last 20 years until january 2015 it shows the rate of change roc indicator below the chart this can be used to make medium to long term decisions in the stock market by investing when the roc is above zero and getting out of the market when the roc is below zero regarding your in your investments most would say that yes because you are still young you should be aggressive because you have time on your side so if there is a downturn in your investments then you still have plenty of time for them to recover i have a different view and i will use the stock market as an example refer back to the chart above i would be more aggressive when the roc is above zero and less aggressive when the roc is below zero how can you relate this to your super fund if it does provide you to change your investment choices then i would be invested in more aggressive investments like shares when the roc crosses above zero and then when the roc moves below zero take a less aggressive approach by moving your investments in the super fund to a more balanced or capital guaranteed strategy where less of your funds are invested in shares and more are invested in bonds and cash you can also have a similar approach with property learn about the property cycles remember super funds usually invest in commercial and industrial property rather than houses so you would need to learn about the commercial and industrial property cycles which would be different to the residential property cycle regarding your question about if you can increase your knowledge and skills in investing then yes switching to a smsf will give you more control and possibly better returns however i would avoid switching your funds to a smsf right now two reasons firstly you would want to increase your knowledge as mentioned above and secondly you would want to have at least $ 300,000 in funds before switching to a smsf or else the setup and compliance costs would be too high as a percentage of your funds at the moment $ 70,000 you do have time on your side so whilst you are increasing your funds you can use that time to educate yourself in your areas of interest and remember a smsf is not only an investment vehicle whilst you are building your funds during your working life but it is also an investment vehicle when you are retired and it becomes totally tax free during this phase where any investment returns are tax free and any income you take out is also tax free

short answer liquidity well you have to see it from an exchange 's point of view   every contract they put up is a liability to them   you have to allocate resources for the order book the matching engine the clearing etc   but only if the contract is actually trading they start earning the big money now for every new expiry they engage a long term commitment and it might take years for an option chain to be widely accepted and hence before they 're profitable   compare the volumes and open interests of big chains versus the weeklies and you 'll find that weeklies can still be considered illiquid compared to their monthly cousins having said that like many things this is just a question of demand   if there 's a strong urge to trade july weeklies one day there will be an option chain   but personally i think as long as there are the summer there will be no rush to ask for jul and aug chains

in short thanks to the answers and comments posted so far   no actual money is magically disappeared when the stock price goes down but the value is lost the value changes of a stock is similar to the value changes of a house the following is the long answer i came up with based on the previous answers and comments alone with my own any experts who find any of the following is 200 out of place and wrong feel free to edit it or make comments everything below only applies if the following are true the stock price is only decreasing since the ipo because the company has been spending the money but not making profits after the ipo the devaluation of the stock is not the result of any bad news related to the company but a direct translation of the money the company has lost by spending on whatever the company is doing the actual money do n’t just disappear into the thin air when the stock price goes down all the money involved in trading this stock has already distributed to the sellers of this stock before the price went down   there is no actual money that is literally disappeared it was shifted from one hand to another but again this already happened before the price went down    for example i bought some stocks for $ 100 then the price went down to $ 80 the $ 100 has already shifted from my hand to the seller before the price went down i got the stock with less value but the actual money $ 100 did not just go down to $ 80 it ’s in the hand of the seller who sold the stock to me   now if i sell the stock to the same seller who sold the stock to me then i lost $ 20 where did the $ 20 go it went to the seller who sold the stock to me and then bought it back at a lower price the seller ended up with the same amount of the stocks and the $ 20 from me did the seller made $ 20 yes but did the seller ’s total assets increased no it ’s still $ 100 $ 80 from the stocks and $ 20 in cash did anyone made an extra $ 20 no although i did lost $ 20 but the total cash involved is still there i have the $ 80 the seller who sold the stock to me and then bought it back has the $ 20 the total cash value is still $ 100 directly i did lost $ 20 to the guy who sold me the stock when the stock has higher value and then bought it back at a lower price but that guy did not increased his total assets by $ 20 the value of the stock is decreased the total money $ 100 did not disappear it ended up from one person holding it to 2 people holding it i lost $ 20 and nobody gained $ 20 how is that possible assume the company of the stock never made any profit since it ’s ipo the company just keeps spending the money to really track down where the $ 20 i lost is going it is the company has indirectly spent that money so who got that $ 20 i lost it could be the company spent $ 20 for a birthday cake the $ 20 went to the cake maker the company never did anything to make that $ 20 back so that $ 20 is lost again assume the stock price only goes down after   its ipo then buying this stock is similar to the buying a sport car example from joetaxpayer in one of the answers and buying an apple example from one of the comments from joetaxpayer ’s answer   go back to the question does the money disappears into the thin air when the value of the stock goes down no the money did not disappear it switched hands it went from the buyer of the stock to the company and the company has spent that money then what happens when the stock price goes down because bad news about the company i believe the actual money still did not just disappear if the bad news turn out to be true that the company had indeed lost this much money the money did not disappear it ’s been spent lost by the company if the bad news turn out to be false the stock price will eventually go up again the money is still in the hand of the company as a summary the money itself did not disappear no matter what happens it just went from one wallet to another wallet in many different ways through the things people created that has a value

for simplicity let 's start by just considering cash back in general cash back from credit cards for personal use is not taxable but for business use it is taxable sort of i 'll explain later the reason is most personal purchases are made with after tax dollars you typically are n't deducting the cost of what you purchased from your personal income so if you purchase something that costs $ 100 and you receive $ 2 back from the cc company effectively you have paid $ 98 for that item but that would n't affect your tax bill however since businesses typically deduct most expenses that same $ 100 deduction would have only been a $ 98 deduction for business tax purposes so in this case the $ 2 should be accounted for note you should not consider that $ 2 as income though that would artificially inflate your revenue it should be treated as a negative expense similar to how you would handle returning an item you purchased and receiving a cc refund now for your specific questions part 1 as a small business owner i wish to attend an annual seminar to improve my business i have enough credit card reward points to cover the airfare hotel and rental car will those expenses still be deductible at the value displayed on the receipt effectively no these expenses are not deductible if you deduct them they will be completely counter acted by the refund you receive for the payments part 2 does it matter if those points are accrued on my personal credit card rather than a business credit card this is where it gets hairy suppose your company policy is that employees make purchases with their own personal credit cards and submit receipts for reimbursement in this case the employer can simply reimburse and would not know or care if the employee is racking up rewards points cashback the trick is as the employee you must always purchase business related items normally so you have receipts to show and if you receive cashback on the side there seems to be a do n't ask do n't tell rule that the irs is ok with it works the same way with heavy business travelers and airline the free vacations those users get as perks are not treated as taxable income however i would not go out of my way to abuse this loophole typically things like travel airfare hotel car rental meals are expected but i would n't go purchase 100 company laptops on your personal card and ask the company to reimburse you the company should purchase those 100 laptops on a company card and effectively reduce the sale price by the cashback received or more realistically negotiate a better discount with your account rep and just cut them a check part 3 would there be any difference between credit card points and brand loyalty points if the rental car were paid for with points earned directly on the rental car company 's loyalty system not a cc would that yield a different result there is no difference perhaps the simplest way to think about this is you can only deduct an expense that you actually incur in other words the expense should show up on a bank or cc statement this is why when you volunteer and work 10 hours for a charity you ca n't call that a donation of any amount of money because there is no actual payment made that would show up on a bank statement instead you could have billed the charity for your 10 hours of work and then turned around and donated that same amount back to them but it ends up being a wash

debits and credits are terms used in double entry bookkeeping each transaction is entered in two different places to be able to double check accuracy the total debits and total credits being equal is what makes the balance sheet balance for explaining debits and credits has a good example using eggs that i found helpful as a student   debits and credits   when a financial transaction is recorded the debits dr and credits cr need to balance in order to keep the accounts in balance   an easy rule to remember is debit the asset that increases   for example if you want to practice accounting for cooking a simple breakfast you might proceed as follows   to record breaking the eggs and putting the eggs in the pan   in this transaction an asset the egg is split into parts and some of the asset goes in the pan and some in the trash a debit dr is used to show that the assets in the pan and the trash both increase a balancing credit cr is used to show that the amount of assets whole eggs in the egg has decreased   this transaction is in balance because the total credits equal the total debits everything that is covered by the debits white and shell is also covered by the credits one whole egg

how can they reduce the number of shares i hold they may have purchased them   you do n't say what stock it is so we can only speculate   let 's say that the stock is called penny   so they may have taken your 1600 penny shares and renamed them to 1600 shares   then they created a new $ 5 penny share and gave you shares of that in exchange for your 1600 shares   this suggests that your old shares were worth $ or less than a tenth of a cent each    as an example mylan did this in 2015 as part of their tax inversion moved official headquarters from the us to europe   they did not change the number of shares at that time but mylan is not a penny stock    this is the kind of thing that might happen in a bankruptcy    a reverse split where they give you one share in exchange for more than one share is also possible although you received an odd amount for a reverse split   usually those produce numbers   a number like sounds more like a market price as those can be bizarre

this is largely a cultural issue i would be appalled at the very idea that my parents would charge me interest for lending me money just as they would be appalled if i were to do so if lending them money i find the idea of attempting to make money off of your children fundamentally wrong   i realize that you only want to do this to teach them that you have their best interests in mind and not your own profit nevertheless what will actually happen were you to charge them interest is that you would accrue a monetary gain at the expense of your children is that really something you would be comfortable with now as i stated at the beginning this is clearly a cultural issue based on the other answers here many cultures probably including your own find nothing wrong with this i 've even heard of people charging their adult children rent when they come home for the holidays something that is completely baffling to me   the point i am trying to make is that asking other people 's opinions on whether you should do this is not very useful unless those people share your own cultural background my family and culture are such that the idea of charging interest to one 's family members seems downright immoral to me given that you are asking here it seems like you might be on the fence about it yourself however i freely admit that my answer is colored by my own cultural and may very well not be applicable to you   still ask yourself is a relatively small amount of money in the grand scheme of things or for that matter an entire fortune worth your relationship with your children do you really believe that having their parents retroactively charge them interest for a loan will somehow teach them something about the real world that your already adult children do n't know one of the main reasons they came to you and did n't go to a bank is precisely that they expected the loan to be interest free   so sure tell them that you wo n't lend any more until they repay what they owe even better sit them down and have an honest adult conversation explaining that the absence of the money they owe is making itself felt in your household and work out a way they can repay you   what in my opinion you most certainly should n't do is treat your relationship with your children as a regular business transaction it is n't and i am sure you do n't want it to be

what are pivot points pivot points indicate price levels that are of significance in technical analysis of securities pivot points are used to provide clarity for a trader as they are a predictive indicator of where a security might go there are at least 6 different types of pivot points pivot point fibonacci pivot etc and they are different based on their formulas but generally serve the same concept i will be answering your question using the pivot point formula pivot point formula generally any pivot point formula uses a combination of the open high low and close of the previous timeframe since you are technically a swing trader indicated by   say between a couple of days to a couple of weeks as i do n't want to    do day trading you should use a weekly 5 to 30 minute chart but you can also use a daily chart as well so for example if you use a daily chart you would use the open high low and close of the previous day example of fictitious stock money stack exchange open high low close 11.50 on level level r2 level level pivot point s1 level s2 level s3 level s4 level r = resistance s = support   how to identify these pivot points most charting software already have built in that will identify the pivot points for you but you can always find and draw them yourself with an tool since we are using the pivot point formula the important pivot point levels are the which is considered as the breakout pivot the s4 which is considered as the breakdown pivot and s3 are reversal pivot points once identify the pivot points how should you proceed in a trade this is the million dollar question and without spoon feeding you requires you to come up with your own strategy to distinguish yourself from being a novice and pro trader is to have a strategy in a trade now i do n't really have the time to look for actual charts to provide examples with but generally this is what you should look for to proceed in a trade potential buy short signals potential sell signals if a stock moves above the level but then crosses below it this would be a sell signal this is confirmed when their is a lower lower then the candle that first crosses below it sell a stock when s4 level is confirmed see above for the confirmation other useful tips use the pivot point as your support or resistance the pivot point levels can be used for your stop loss for example with an s3 reversal buy signal the s4 should be used as a stop loss conversely the pivot point levels can also be used for your target prices for example with an s3 reversal buy signal you should take some profits at level you should also use a combination of other indicators to give you more information to confirm if a signal is correct examples of a good combination is the rsi macd and moving averages read that book in my comment above

the two dimensions are to open the trade creating a position and to buy or sell becoming long or short the option if you already own an option you bought it to open and then you would sell it to close if you do n't own an option you can either buy it to open or sell it short it to open if you are already short an option you can buy it back to close if you sell to open covered the point is you 're creating a covered call which means you own the stock and then sell a call since you own the stock the covered call has a lot of the risk of loss removed though it also subtracts much of the reward possible from your stock

to start with you are right there should n't be any additional fees other than the currency exchange fee i 'm not sure of the exact fee for natwest but for this was around 2.5 for big currencies like the euro however germany does n't actually use debit cards nearly as much as we do here in the uk so you will almost certainly need cash rather than taking this from a currency exchange booth what you should do in order to get the lowest fees is head straight to the atm of any bank and put your card in to make a cash withdrawal it will almost certainly ask if you want to use their exchange rate which it will show you and you will almost certainly be better turning this down and allowing natwest to do this for you dependent on the bank their currency exchange spread may be as high as 4.5 i hope this helps it certainly saved me a lot of money when i have been going abroad

allowances are calculated as your total deductions divided by the tax year 's personal exemptions as mentioned above it is a multiplier for 2015 the standard deduction for a married couple filing jointly is $ 12,600 and each of you gets 1 personal exemption $ 4,000 in 2015 that 's a total of $ 12,600 + or $ divide this by the personal exemption and you get roughly 5 allowances now say your employer offers health insurance and a 401(k plan your total health insurance or cafeteria contributions are $ 2,000 for the year and your total 401(k plan contributions are $ 6,000 for the year this would give an additional $ 2,000 + $ 6,000 = $ 8,000 divided by $ 4,000 = 2 allowances thus you would file with 7 allowances note that tax credits are not included in the allowance calculation that is because they do not affect your taxable income but rather directly reduce your taxes due

yes you will need an emergency fund for the rental besides appliances or a roof that might need to be replaced you will also have to protect against being unable to rent the unit   another risk is that you may have a tenant damage the unit while you can get the money through the courts it may take months or longer you ca n't wait for the money before you repair the unit keeping the rental unit funds separate from the rest of your funds will allow you to make sure you are adequately protecting yourself

since you already have twice your target in that emergency fund putting that overage to work is a good idea the impression that i get is that you 'd still like to stay on the safe side what you 're looking for is a balanced fund   in a balanced fund the managers invest in both stocks and bonds and cash since you have that diversification between those two asset classes their returns tend to be much less volatile than other funds also because of their intended audience and the traditions from that class of funds long history they tend to invest somewhat more conservatively in both asset classes   there are two general types of balanced funds conservative allocation funds and moderate allocation funds conservative allocation funds invest in more fixed income than equity the classic mix is 60 bonds 40 stocks moderate allocation funds invest in more equity than fixed income classic mix 40 bonds 60 stocks a good pair of funds that are similar but the difference between conservative allocation and moderate allocation are vanguard 's income fund for the former and vanguard 's wellington fund for the latter disclaimer though both funds are broadly considered excellent this is not a recommendation good luck sorting this out

you walk into the finance company with a written quote from the supplier for the equipment you want to buy you then fill out forms and sign a promissory note the finance company then writes out a check to the supplier for the amount of the quoted equipment usually you need to provide at least 3 things they will require you to provide your social security number and sign a document allowing them to check your credit history which they will look up using the social security number note that banks will generally give better rates on a personal loan than a finance company people usually only use finance companies when their credit is so bad that a bank will not loan them money heating and cooling companies that provide equipment will often loan the money to buy that equipment as a point of advice it is generally poor financial management to take out personal loans and may indicate a person that is wasting money or be in financial difficulties for personal loan items furniture cars clothing jewelry etc you are far better off saving money to buy the item not borrowing beyond your means if you need a new furnace and it is an emergency for example if it were winter which it is not and your furnace could not be repaired then that might justifiable but borrowing money at a high rate to just upgrade a furnace or get a luxury like ac is unwise

employers are not supposed to give cash gifts to their employees even if you try to call it a gift for tax purposes presumably the reason your wife 's employer gave her cash was to be nice and save her taxes on that amount her employer already paid tax on that money so that your wife does n't have to if she plans to declare it anyway then she should instead give it back and ask for it to be added to the w2 as an end of year bonus this way her employer could then deduct the payment and pay her a larger amount of money the additional amount would be approximately their tax rate minus about for fica in fact if your wife 's tax rate is more than 15 lower than her employer 's then this is actually mathematically best for both parties

well perhaps have a dedicated tax advisor is an answer then i    would n't have thought of this as it 's not specifically about    taxation is it or more broadly consult with a dedicated    professional for the situation in detail yes that is the only real answer you can get anything else will vary between highly localized to entirely incorrect pensions are rarely defined benefit anymore and not many countries still keep state sponsored defined benefit pension plans for most what 's left is social security system which is in no way a pension this is an insurance and is paid as tax which is rarely refundable but you wo n't always have to pay it if you 're a foreigner in the country usually social security benefits are only available to citizens and in some rare cases residents of that country so it is unlikely although possible that you 'll benefit from social security payments of more than one country some countries have treaties that make your social security payments in one count in the other if you 're in a country that has such an agreement with the netherlands you 're lucky your personal pension savings are basically tax deferred investment accounts but tax deferral in one country does n't necessarily work in another in the us you have 401k or ira accounts but in your own country they may very well be taxable so you gain the tax deferral in the us but if your own country taxes them you lost the benefit and you will still have to abide by the us tax rules when taking the money out if you do n't plan properly you can easily be hit by double taxation in such cases bottom line you need to plan your pension savings on your own privately with a good and solid tax advice and pension planning advice that would be relevant to all the countries that you are tax resident at at any given time you can easily be resident for tax purposes in more than one country these advisers have to take into account the laws of the countries involved the tax treaties between themselves and between them and the country of your citizenship   and the future countries you 're planning on visiting or getting old at its complicated and most likely you wo n't be able to predict everything especially because the laws and treaties tend to change over time

traders sometimes look at the depth of the book number of outstanding limit orders to try and gauge the sentiment of the market or otherwise use this information to formulate their strategy   if there was a large outstanding buy order at $ there 's a decent chance this could increase the price by influencing other traders however a limit order at $ 2 is like an amazon.com price of $ 200,000 for a book   it 's so far away from realistic that it is ignored   people would think it is an error submitting this type of order is perfectly legal   if the stock is extremely thinly traded it might even be encouraged because if someone wanted to sell a bunch and did a really bad job of it the price could conceivably fall that far and the limit order would be adding liquidity   i guess   your example is pretty extreme it is not uncommon for there to be limit orders on the book that are not very close to the trading price   they just sit around   the majority of trades are done by algorithmic traders and institutional traders and they do n't tend to do this but a retail investor may choose to submit an order like that just hoping against hope also buy orders are not likely to push prices down no matter what their price is   a sell order yes even if it is n't executed

i was told if i moved my 401k into a roth ira that school purposes is one reasons you can withdraw money without having to pay a tax incorrect   you will need to pay tax on the amount converted since a 401(k is pre tax and a roth ira is after tax   it will be added to your regular income so you will pay tax at your marginal tax rate is there any hidden tax or fee at all for withdrawing money from a roth ira for educational purposes   you still will need to pay the tax on the amount converted but you 'll avoid the 10 penalty for early withdrawal i know that tuition books and fees are covered for educational purposes can i take out of my roth ira for living expenses while i 'm attending school rent gas food etc room and board yes so long as you are half time but not gas food   possibly only room and board for staying on campus but i 'm not certain although i doubt you could call your normal house payment education expense with my 401k being smaller would it just be better to go ahead and cash the whole thing and just pay the tax and use it for whatever i need it for what is the tax if i just decide to cash the whole thing in   you pay your marginal tax rate plus a 10 penalty for early withdrawal   so no this is probably not a wise move financially unless you 're on the verge of bankruptcy or foreclosure where distress costs are much higher then the 10 penalty i ca n't answer the other questions regarding grants i would talk to the financial aid department at your school bottom line transferring your 401(k is very likely a bad idea unless you can afford to pay the tax in cash meaning without borrowing   my advice would be to leave your 401(k alone it 's meant for retirement not for school or living expenses ideally you should pay for as much as you can out of cash flow and do n't take out more student loans that may mean taking fewer classes getting another part time job finding a different cheaper school applying for more grants and scholarships etc   i would not in any circumstance cash out your 401(k to pay for school   you 'll be much worse off in the long run and there are much cheaper ways to get money

credit card fees on a credit card used for personal expenses are not tax deductible credit card fees on a business credit card are deductible on schedule c or whatever form you 're using to report business income and expenses if you are using the same card for both business and personal well for starters this is a very bad idea because it creates exactly the question you 're asking if that 's what you 're doing stop and get separate business and personal cards if you have separate business and personal cards and use the business card only for legitimate business expenses then the answer is easy you can claim a schedule c deduction for any service charges on the business card and you can not claim any deduction for any charges on the personal card in general though if you have an expense that is partly business and partly personal you are supposed to figure out what percentage is business and that is deductible in an admittedly brief search i could n't find anything specifically about credit cards but i did find this similar idea on the irs web site generally you can not deduct personal living or family expenses however if you have an expense for something that is used partly for business and partly for personal purposes divide the total cost between the business and personal parts you can deduct the business part for example if you borrow money and use 70 of it for business and the other 30 for a family vacation you can deduct 70 of the interest as a business expense the remaining 30 is personal interest and is not deductible refer to chapter 4 of publication 535 business expenses for information on deducting interest and the allocation rules so probably you could add up all the charges you made on the card figure out how much was for business and how much for personal calculate the business percentage and then deduct this percentage of the service fees if the amount involved is not trivial you might want to talk to an accountant or a lawyer

those are some very broad questions and i do n't think i can answer them completely but i will add what i can barron 's finance and investment handbook is the best reference book i have found it provides a basic description definition for every type of investment available it covers stocks preferred stocks various forms of bonds as well as mortgage pools and other exotic instruments it has a comprehensive dictionary of finance terms as well i would definitely recommend getting it   the question about how people invest today is a huge one there are people who simply put a monthly amount into a mutual fund and simply do that until retirement on one side and professional day traders who move in and out of stocks or commodities on a daily basis on the other

gt;1 the us mint is a private business there 's your first flaw of any argument about currency before we talk further   policies are set by the us congress and the mint operates under the of the us treasury you do n't point out how any of this relates to anything so i guess no point in going any further    that small percentage value of the penny not being worth your time is a huge fallacy it might not be worth anything to him but i generally would be intent on getting a few cents back that are due to me similarly using his example of 3 cents adding 2 seconds to the transaction ends up at a rate of $ that 's quite a bit of money to be considered   if we assume that any penny related transaction is equally likely to have 1 4 pennies involved and we take the 2 second figure as accurate then we come up with $ 45 per hour however there is the time of the cashier and anyone behind you to consider that 2 seconds is multiplied by everyone but only you get the pennies if we figure you have to wait as often as you receive pennies on the whole then the figure gets slashed i 'm guessing under $ 10 an hour    your figure also fails to account for what would happen if the penny were removed from circulation most likely outcome would be that transactions where you 'd make 1 or 2 pennies would be rounded down and transactions where you 'd have gained 3 or 4 pennies would be rounded up you are n't actually on the whole gaining or losing any money at all    no machines take pennies fair enough not really the fault of the penny itself but more so a fault of inflation   this is n't about establishing guilt pennies are tools and symbols if they do n't serve their purpose then maybe we should consider removing them    supposing the penny does get removed the axe gets held above the neck of the nickle inevitably then the dime and so on    so   also see a massive disruption in handling of accounting principles and tax rates due to being forced into rates all adjustable yes but it does cause a whole new mess of issues in it 's own right   this can be acknowledged one might take issue with massive but a transition would not be free of labor and education costs    lincoln 's face has nothing to do with this argument 25 seconds worth of video wasted that 's about 35 pennies worth   maybe it did n't hit home with you but the obviously felt he was addressing someone 's concern the psychological impact of change or the not strictly to traditions or history would have to be taken into account in a fair evaluation of implementing a big change

congratulations on deciding to save money and choosing to invest it one thing to know about mutual funds including index funds is that they typically require a minimum investment of a few thousand dollars $ 3000 being a typical amount unless the investment is in an ira in which case $ 1000 might be a minimum in some cases automated monthly investments of $ 50 or $ 100 might need to be set up if you are beginning with a small balance there is nothing wrong with your approach you now should go and look at the various requirements for specific index funds the fidelity and vanguard families are good choices and both offer very low cost index funds to choose from but different funds can have different requirements regarding minimum investments etc you also have a choice of which index you want to follow the s&p 500 index midcap indexes small cap indexes total stock market indexes etc but your choice might be limited   until you have more money to invest because of minimum investment rules etc    most important after you have made your choice i urge you to not look every day or even every month to see how your investment is doing you will save yourself a lot of anxiety and will save yourself from making wrong decisions   far too many investors ignore the buy low sell high and pull money out of what should be long term investments at the first of a downturn and end up buying high and selling low finally the time is approaching when most stock funds will be declaring dividends and capital gains distributions if you invest now you may end up with a paper profit on which you will have to pay taxes in   non tax advantaged accounts on your 2012 tax return this is called buying a dividend and so you might want to spend some time investigating now but actually make the investment in late december after your chosen fund has made its distributions the date for this will be on the fund 's web site or in early 2013

if you buy a cd through a brokerage the trade confirmation will indicate whether the cds is fdic insured unless you have authorized the broker in writing to exercise discretion in your account meaning they can act in your account without contacting you first they must contact you and discuss the specific investment with you before buying it if they have misled you and the cd is not actually fdic insured you have a right to ask them to reverse the transaction   keep in mind that brokerages are also required to insure the assets in your account which they hold on their balance sheets cash bonds stocks mutual funds but not commodities this is provided by sipc the equivalent of fdic in the brokerage world most large brokerages also insure you beyond the sipc minimum keep in mind unlike fdic you 're not insured against market risk only against a bankruptcy of the brokerage also sipc is funded by the securities industry not by the us government

your total salary deferral can not exceed $ 18 k as of 2016 you can split it between your different jobs as you want to maximize the matching   you can contribute non elective contribution on top of that which means that your self proprietorship will commit to paying you that portion regardless of your deferral that would be on top of the $ you can not contribute more than 20 of your earnings though so if you earn $ 2 k you can add $ 400 on top of the $ 18 k limit ignoring the se tax for a second here keep in mind that if you ever have employees the non elective contribution will apply to them as well also the total contribution limit from all sources deferral matching non elective can not exceed $ 53 k for 2016

1 for fha loans pmi is required for where there is not at least 20 equity   bank financed non fha loans may have other standards if you are getting an fha loan if possible put down 20   so that you do not have to pay pmi   that said your pmi costs should be reduced by the size of your down payment since the pmi covers the difference between your equity value based on the appraisal at time of purchase and 20 equity value of the home so if you buy a home for 100 appraisal price 20 equity would be 85k   so if you put 10 down you would be paying pmi until you accrue an addition in equity   and you will be paying pmi on that for about 12 on 30 year mortgage or until you home appraised at higher value than purchase price where you would have 20 equity   there are ways to get out of pmi early but few banks are willing to help you through the hoops unless you pay more closing costs 2 different banks offer better rates or other benefits for paying points   we paid $ 300 for a 1.5 reduction in our interest rate less than 1 but it was called a point we were offered a few other points .25 for 2500 and an one time on demand interest rate adjustment for but declined but they may make more sense on a home than our more modest one   you can talk to a banker about this now get helps with getting offers accepted sometimes and find out more details about the mortgage they will offer you   this meeting should be would say will but some bank would charge just to prove me wrong and help answer your questions more than anyone here can    3 the costs will come out of your down payment   so if you put down down your costs will come out of that   so you will probably end up with being applied towards your purchase price with the rest going for costs   you can tell the banker you want to put 10 towards the price and the banker will give you a down payment probably around 50k to cover costs etc   my figures are hopefully intentionally high better to find out that it will cost less than my than get your hopes up just to find out the costs are higher than expected

without knowledge of the special provisions of your loan contract the one with the highest interest rate should be paid first or if one 's fixed payment is much larger than the other and it is a burden then it should be paid first but refinancing may be an option socially speaking and possibly even economically since it could affect your reputation it is probably best to either refinance the cosigned loan or pay that off as rapidly as possible economically speaking i would recommend no prepayment since the asset that is leveraged is your mind which will last many decades probably exceeding the term of the loan but some caveats must be handled first many would disagree but i finance the way i play poker tight aggressive

i agree we should be efficient with the food we produce especially meats but i do n't like using food production efficiency overall as an encompassing statistic    it comes with all sorts of problems largely due to artificial fertilizer productions extremely demanding gmo plants and of course overall pesticides   pushing for extreme yields out of fields using artificial fertilizer can result in disastrous circumstances down the road over utilization of a field gives better returns now but we ca n't do that indefinitely and depletes the top soil of many and healthy bacteria over time yields will decrease and if it ever gets taken that far you end it with more problems even if you stop before it gets that bad you then have to suffer years of less than average yield to build the back up to health just so you can get average yield again and then there is the problem of how artificial fertilizer is made which while currently necessary to produce enough food currently 50 of the world 's food is produced directly due due to use of artificial fertilizer it utilizes fossil fuels both as and to burn for power to fuel the process of turning fossil fuels into fertilizer   if we really want to be sustainable we should be utilizing more farm land to make up for reduced yields from avoiding as much artificial fertilizer as we can

taxing wealth is an easy idea but i do n't think it can ever work wealth is too easily hidden transformed or taxing actual cash flows works because two parties have to declare it taxing wealth would cause huge conflicts as to how wealth is measured that said i 'm a big fan of the idea that the estate tax should be massively increased and would only involve a single evaluation per taxpayer rather than every year taxing more measurable forms of wealth like stocks would cause wealth to flow from stocks into property which would then be valued as low as possible causing a general market crash and another great depression   i 'm most curious about a tax scheme which is where taxes are levied on un improved property per wikipedia based on the belief that people should own the value they produce themselves but that the economic value derived from land including natural resources should belong equally to all members of society    so most taxes in society would be generated by those who owned property as a speculation and did n't invest in it incentives would be to make all property held privately be as economically productive as possible

in october 2011 in the united states you just do n't have any options   save your money in a savings account and that is the best you can do   your desire to buy a house means you are a saver not an investor and you risk tolerance on this pile of money is 0 save it in a bank account i highly doubt chasing an interest rate will pay off with any significance being highly dependent on your opinion of significant

it is comparing apples to oranges from govt or institution point of view defined contribution is better than defined benefits as they do n't have to carry obligations although defined benefit sounds good one ca n't guarantee it will be enough when you retire compared to inflation it often becomes political issue defined contribution puts you in charge

okay so you do n't know what other options are available understood no need to be a dick in other industries deals and transactions are invalidated reversed refunded or other measures taken all the time when they 're based on invalid information hence why i was asking what options there are for these situations i know that if i saw go down 40 and the info scanned on official sources that i would dump a ton of money into buying it up if i had it available i mean hell it 's cisco systems who practically owns the internet they 'll be back up from that hit and fairly quickly to find out that was all just because some over worked programmer put a where there should have been a period would have me on the if trend was actually the other way with the amount of money that flows through such a system there has to be some kind of process for dealing with these things if you do n't know then no worries there 's no need to jump on me for asking a question when a simple i do n't know would suffice

by basic public pension i assume you mean social security which is pretty much the only quasi universal pension like thing in the usa   if she has any other sort of pension e.g. from a job you 'd need to get more specific info about that as for social security as described here while you are working your earnings will reduce your benefit amount only until you reach your full retirement age according to the calculator on that site if she is 65 now her full retirement age would be 66 so if she retires after that age her ss benefit wo n't be reduced due to extra income as described here if she has considerable income apart from ss she may have to pay taxes on her ss income   this would not reduce her income but means the benefit of her extra blog income would be reduced   this page describes how to calculate your provisional income to determine whether ss benefits will be taxed   according to that page if your provisional income is less than $ 25,000 for single or head of household returns or $ for joint returns then your social security benefits will not be taxed based on the numbers you gave this suggests she would not incur an ss tax   however she should probably take a look at the social security retirement estimator and other tools on that site if she has n't already done so to get a sense of what sort of income ss will be providing her i 'd suggest that she talk to a retirement planner and/or cpa to get a handle on what her finances would be like   at the least she should find someone knowledgeable about social security policies and tax issues in the usa   as you say you are unfamiliar with the way these matters work in the usa so your ability to help her make financial decisions is limited
