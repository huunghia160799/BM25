translation funds managers that use methods to select stocks will have less success than those who use artificial intelligence and computer programs to select stocks   meaning the use of computer programs and artificial intelligence is the way to go for hedge fund managers in the future because they give better results   no man is better than a machine but no machine is better than a man with a machine alternative article hedge fund firms wall street journal a little whatever is well conceived is clearly said and the words to say it flow with ease wrote nicolas in

leverage here is referring to financial leverage this is the practice of levering ie increasing like the use of a lever to increase the amount of weight you can lift the value of your investment by taking on debt   for example if you have 100k in cash you can buy a 100k rental property assume the property makes 10k a year net of expenses 10 now assume the bank will also give you a 100k mortgage at 3 you could take the mortgage plus your cash and buy a 200k rental property this would earn you 20k from the rental property less 3k a year in interest costs the 3 your total income would be 17k and since you only used 100k of your own money your rate of return would now be 17 instead of 10 this is financial leveraging note that this increases your risk because if your investment fails not only have you lost your own money you now need to pay back the bank beta riders appears to be negative commentary on investors who use beta to calculate the value of a particular stock without regard to other quantitative factors therefore leveraged beta riders are those who take on additional risk by taking on debt to invest and invest in a manner that the author would perhaps considered blindly following beta however i have never seen this term before and it appears tainted by the author 's views on quants a quant process driven discipline appears to be positive commentary on investors who use detailed quantitative analysis to develop rules which they rigorously follow to invest i have never seen this exact phrasing before and like the above it appears tainted by the author 's views on quants i am not providing any opinion on whether beta riding or quant processes are good or bad things this is just my attempt to interpret the quote as you presented it note that i did not go to the article to get context so perhaps something else in the article could skew the language to mean something other than what i have presented

berkshire hathaway would be a good example of a company that has yet to pay dividends yet is a highly valued stock a couple of key points here to note is how on the first hand you have that the dividend policy will never change yet could n't one argue that there will always be new investors wanting more shares and thus the price keeps going up until someone gains control and decides to issue dividends   i 'm just pointing out how on the one hand you are claiming a never changing and yet on the other thinking there will be a termination when the reality is that unless there is a zombie apocalypse of some form life will continue and there will be new people to want to buy the stock and some people be willing to sell at the new prices

this will happen automatically when you open an interest bearing account with a bank    you did n't think that banks just kept all that cash in a vault somewhere did you   that 's not the way modern banking works    today and for a long long time banks will keep only a small fraction of their deposits on hand called the reserve to fund daily withdrawals and other operations   the rest they routinely lend out to other customers which is how they pay for their operations someone has to pay all those tellers branch managers loan officers and pay interest on your deposits as well as a profit for their owners it 's not a charity service   the fees charged for loan origination as well as the difference between the loan interest rate and the deposit rate make up the profit    banks rarely hold their own loans   instead they will sell the loans in portfolios to investors sometimes retaining servicing rights they continue to collect the payments and pass them on and sometimes not the payments are now due to someone else   this allows them to make more loans    banks may sometimes not have enough capital on hand   in this case they can make inter bank loans to meet their short term needs   in some cases they 'll take those loans from a government central bank   in the us this is the fed or the federal reserve bank    in the us back around the late 1920 's and again in the 1980 's some banks experienced a run or a situation where people lost confidence in the bank and wanted to withdraw their money   this caused the bank to have insufficient funds to support the withdrawals so not everyone got their money   people panicked and others wanted to take their money out which caused the situation to snowball   this is how many banks failed   in the 80s it was savings and loans that failed still a kind of bank   today we have the fdic federal deposit insurance corporation to protect depositors   in the crashes in the early 2000 's many banks closed up one night and opened the next in a and then were literally doing business as a new bank without depositors necessarily even knowing   this protected the consumers   the bank as a company and its owners were not protected

i found the following on a stock to mutual conversion for insurance firms for ohio pulling from that link   any domestic stock life insurance corporation incorporated under a general law may become a mutual life insurance corporation and to that end may carry out a plan for the acquisition of shares of its capital stock provided such plan a has been adopted by a vote of a majority of the directors of such corporation b has been approved by a vote of stockholders representing a majority of the capital stock then outstanding at a meeting of stockholders called for the purpose c has been approved by a majority of the policyholders voting at a meeting of policyholders called for the purpose each of whom is insured in a sum of at least one thousand dollars and whose insurance shall then be in force and shall have been in force for at least one year prior to such meeting   and any stockholder who has to the plan or who has been concluded by the vote of the stockholders and any stockholder who has objected and made demand in writing for the fair cash value of his shares subsequent to which an agreement has been reached fixing such fair cash value but who fails to surrender his certificates for cancellation upon payment of the amount to which he is entitled may be ordered to do so by a decree of the court of common for the county in which the principal office of such corporation is located after notice and hearing in an action instituted by the corporation for that purpose and such decree may provide that upon the failure of the stockholder to surrender such certificates for cancellation the decree shall stand in lieu of such surrender and cancellation   since they successfully became a mutual insurance company i would guess that those stocks were acquired back by the company and are leftover from the conversion they would not represent an ownership in the company but might have value to a collector

great question while investing in individual stocks can be very useful as a learning experience my opinion is that concentrating an entire portfolio in a few companies stock is a mistake for most investors and especially for a novice for several reasons after all only a handful of professional investors have ever beaten the market over the long term by picking stocks so is it really worth trying if you could i 'd say go work on wall street and good luck to you diversification for many investors diversification is an important reason to use an etf or index fund if they were to focus on a few sectors or companies it is more likely that they would have a sided risk profile and might be subject to a larger downside risk potential than the market as a whole i.e. do n't put all your eggs in one basket diversification is important because of the nature of compound investing if you take a significant hit it will take you a long time to recover because all of your future gains are building off of a smaller base this is one reason that younger investors often take a larger position in equities as they have longer to recover from significant market declines while it is very possible to build a balanced diversified portfolio from individual stocks this is n't something i 'd recommend for a new investor and would require a substantial college level understanding of investments and in any case this portfolio would have a more discrete efficient frontier than the market as a whole lower volatility picking individual stocks or sectors would could also significantly increase or decrease the overall volatility of the portfolio relative to the market especially if the stocks are highly cyclical or correlated to the same market factors so if they are buying tech stocks they might see bigger and downswings compared to the market as a whole or see the opposite effect in the case of utilities in other words owning a basket of individual stocks may result in an unintended volatility beta profile lower trading costs and taxes investors who buy individual stocks tend to trade more in an attempt to beat the market after accounting for commission fees transaction costs bid ask spread and taxes most individual investors get only a fraction of the market average return one famous academic study finds that investors who trade more trail the stock market more trading also tends to incur higher taxes since short term gains < 1 year are taxed at marginal income tax rates that are higher than long term capital gains investors tend to trade due to behavioral failures such as trying to time the market being speculating on stocks instead of long term investing following what everyone else is doing and getting in and out of the market as a result of an emotional reaction to volatility ie buying when stocks are high rising and selling when they are low falling investing in index funds can involve minimal fees and discourages behavior that causes investors to incur excessive trading costs this can make a big difference over the long run as extra costs and taxes compound significantly over time it 's hard to beat the market since markets are quite efficient another reason to use funds is that it is reasonable to assume that at any point in time the market does a fairly good job of pricing securities based on all known information in other words if a given stock is trading at a low p e relative to the market the market as a whole has decided that there is good reason for this valuation this idea is based on the assumption that there are already so many professional analysts and traders looking for arbitrage opportunities that few such opportunities exist and where they do exist persist for only a short time if you accept this theory generally obviously the market is not perfect there is very little in the way of insight on pricing that the average novice investor could provide given limited knowledge of the markets and only a few hours of research it might be more likely that opportunities identified by the novice would reflect of relevant information trying to make money in this way then becomes a bet that other informed professional investors are wrong and you are right options traders for example prices are unpredictable behave like random walks if you want to make money as a long term investor owner rather than a speculator trader than most of the future change in asset prices will be a result of future events and information that is not yet known since no one knows how the world will change or who will be tomorrow 's winners or losers much less in 30 years this is sometimes referred to as a random walk you can point to fundamental analysis and say x company has great free cash flow so i will invest in them but ultimately the problem with this type of analysis is that everyone else has already done it too for example warren buffett famously already knows the price at which he 'd buy every company he 's interested in buying when everyone else can do the same analysis as you the price already reflects the market 's take on that public information market theory and what is left is the unknown i would n't use the term random overall i think there is simply a very large potential for an individual investor to make a few mistakes with individual stocks over 20 + years that will really cost a lot and i think most investors want a balance of risk and return versus the largest possible return and do n't have an interest in developing a professional knowledge of stocks i think a better strategy for most investors is to share in the future profits of companies buy holding a well diversified portfolio for the long term and to avoid making a large number of decisions about which stocks to own

but the flat would be occupied all the time famous last words are you prepared to have a tenant move in and stop paying rent in the us it can take 6 months to get a tenant out of the apartment and little chance of collecting back rent i do n't know how your laws work but here they do not favor the landlord   the tiny sub 1 profit you make while funding principal payments is a risky proposition it seems to me that even normal repairs heater appliances etc will put you to the negative   on the other hand if this property has bottomed in terms of price and it rises in value you may have a nice profit but if you are just renting it out it feels like it 's too close to call   by the way if you can go with a 30yr fixed i 'd suggest that this would get you to a better cash flow sooner a shorter mortgage simply means more money to principal each month   edit as far as equity goes at the beginning it seems the equity build up is really from your pocket definitely so by switching from the 30 to the 15 what is your goal the assumption i may have made is you wish to be a real estate investor with multiple properties doing so means saving up for the next down payment given the payoff time even if the property ran a high profit i imagine you 'd want to focus on cash flow minimize the monthly expense maximize what you can take each month to save for the next down payment it 's your choice years from now to have one paid property or 3 properties each with that 30 down payment and let time be your friend

from wikipedia   to calculate the value of the s&p 500 index the sum of the adjusted    market capitalization of all 500 stocks is divided by a factor    usually referred to as the divisor for example if the total adjusted    market cap of the 500 component stocks is us$ 13 trillion and the    divisor is set at billion then the s&p 500 index value would be    from a strictly mathematical perspective the divisor is not canceling out the units and the s&p index is dollar denominated even though it 's never quoted that way a case in point is that the s&p is often said to have a p e and especially an e the earnings attributed to one unit of s&p. and if you buy a mutual fund sporting a low expense ratio you can invest exactly that much money the current s&p index value and see the dividends accrue to your account less the fee

probably the biggest driver of the increased volumes that day was a change in sentiment towards the healthcare sector as a whole that caused many healthcare companies to experience higher volumes following any spike not just sentiment related spikes the market tends to bounce back to about where it had been previously as analysts at the investment banks start to see the as being overbought or oversold this is because the effect of a spike on underlying ratios such as the sharpe ratio or the pe ratio makes the stock look less attractive to buyers and more attractive to sellers including short sellers note however that the price is broadly still a little higher than it was before the spike as a result of this change in sentiment looking at the price trends on bloomberg the price had been steadily falling for the year prior to the spike but was out at just over $ 1 in the few months immediately prior to the spike the increased interest in the sector and the stock likely added to a general change in the direction of the price trend and caused traders as opposed to investors to believe that there was a change in the price trend this will have lead to them trading the stock more heavily intraday exacerbating the spike note that there traders will include hft bots as well as human traders you question the legality of this volume increase but the simple answer is that we may never know if it was the target of traders manipulating the price or a case of insider trading what we can see is that taking animal spirits into account without any evidence of illegality there are plenty of potential reasons why the spike may have occurred spikes are common where traders perceive a change in a trend as they rush to cash in on the change before other traders can and then sell out quickly when they realise that the price is fundamentally out of sync with the firm 's underlying position you yourself say that you have been watching the stock for some time and by that fact alone it is likely that others are for the same reasons that you are otherwise you would n't be looking at it where people are looking at a stock expecting it to take off or drop you expect volatility and volatility means spikes

no they certainly are not compensated the same way   some are paid by commission that they earn from the products they sell ie certain mutual funds insurance etc   others are paid for their advice based on an hourly fee or a percentage of the portfolio you have to invest this is a great question because too many of us just assume that if someone is in the business they will give trustworthy advice   this may certainly be the case but think about it the financial planner at your bank who also is a mutual fund specialist just flip that handy business card over is employed by bank x.   bank x sells mutual funds gic 's insurance all kinds of great products   that bank x employee is not likely to tell you about products from bank z down the street that might be a better fit for you find a fee based planner someone you can pay by the hour for advice and let them help you review products across the industry   it 's like asking your bank for mortgage advice they will discuss the options they offer but may not tell you about a deal down the street   using a mortgage broker helps you find the best deal across the board i believe the current issue of magazine has an insert discussing planners   their magazine and website are good sources of reliable canadian financial advice

          legit after 5 minutes of googling and using the search bar in reddit for these jobs   actually since you edited your response here 's why i found it kinda naive you have a pretty good gig as a petroleum engineer in a company the only thing in your description that you 're interested in a job is a corporate job which is for the most part all professional jobs its ok to be curious but saying i do n't like engineering but i like corporate jobs so tell me about corporate sounding jobs even though google has tons of articles on it sounds entitled and naive     corporate finance controllers fp&amp;a treasury is a catch all for jobs that quantify and manage a company 's money this includes figuring out how much money the business is making budgeting and gaining access to money for future plans they spend most of their day on excel browsing reddit and complaining that other departments do n't take them seriously there is work life balance unless your company is at risk of bankruptcy but pay will likely be the least of this group     corporate strategy development is about finding ways to achieve the vision goals of the c suite corporate development usually are ex ib people and focused on finding companies to acquire integrate and achieve the goals of the acquisition synergies returns on investment technology product acquisition corporate strategy is usually broader and could be focused on improving the brand figuring out new uses for a product finding new partners or generally looking for good ideas to improve the company     business development usually is about growing the company through finding new customers markets or partnerships instead of selling specific products or services you 're selling your company 's abilities and brand    i 'd say with your engineering background if you can swing a corporate strategy gig you 'd have the greatest for any vp you decide i 'd say if you want to sell or are good at selling then business development may be compelling if i were you corporate finance would be the least appealing unless you are truly interested in finance

houses burn down a lot more frequently than banks fail also i 'll bet the odds that fdic will insure the loss of money in a bank is much higher than the odds of a homeowner 's policy believing a huge pile of cash burned up in your house and even then your policy probably would n't have coverage limits high enough to reimburse you for substantial cash losses oh yeah then there is theft floods etc the biggest danger is that routine inflation will eat up that money faster than the rats in the basement now having some cash for a small emergency on hand is n't a terrible idea but using your closet as a personal bank does n't seem very smart

you are right if by a lot of time you mean a lot of occasions lasting a few milliseconds each this is one of the oldest in the book and there 's plenty of people constantly on the lookout for such situations hence they are rare and do n't last very long most of the time the relationship is satisfied to within the accuracy set by the bid ask spread what you write as an equality should actually be a set of inequalities   continuing with your example suppose 1 gbp ~ 2 usd where the market price to buy gbp the offer is $ and to sell gbp the bid is $   suppose further that 1 usd ~ 2 eur and the market price to buy usd is and to sell usd is   then converting your gbp to eur in this way requires selling for usd receive $ then sell the usd for eur receive   going the other way converting eur to gbp it will cost you to buy 1 gbp   hence so long as the posted prices for direct conversion are within these bounds there is no arbitrage

could it be done yes it could subject to local law a variant of such an approach has been suggested for those countries experiencing collapse of demand one might consider whether whether it applied to secured loans such as mortgages unsecured loans or both whether it would be capped at a certain absolute say £ 100k or proportional first 50 of each mortgage whether it would cover first homes only or all homes and so on   these details would radically change the feasibility and consequences of any such intervention see the related question such a policy of debt cancellation would have several consequences beyond initial stimulation of demand that would need additional policies to deal with them inflation the resultant surge in demand would in the absence of any other intervention result in a massive surge in inflation there are some interesting questions about whether this burst of inflation would be a one off or not one could make an argument that as housing has become much more affordable at least for home owners it would increase the downward pressure on wages which would be in itself counter inflationary in the medium long term nevertheless it would be injecting much more money into the economy than has been seen in qe to date so the risks would be of extraordinarily high inflation which might or might not get entrenched in order to manage the short term risk and long term inflation expectations it might be necessary to incorporate a lot of tightening either fiscal higher taxes and/or lower public spending or monetary higher interest rates unwinding qe new requirements for higher core capital for banks moral hazard there are risks of moral hazard for individuals however as a society we were prepared to accept the moral hazard for financial institutions and their staff so that may or may not be an issue it is likely to be a question of long term expectations if the expectation is that this is at most a once in a lifetime occurrence then the consequential risk from moral hazard ought to be lower excess profits to lenders lenders will typically work on the basis of a certain proportion of defaults so paying off all loans effectively gives them an artificial boost to their profits worsening balance of payments there is to a degree a prisoners dilemma facing nations here pressing the reset button on personal debt across many of the countries experiencing demand collapse would benefit all of them however if just one such country were to do it alone they alone would increase domestic demand resulting in a large increase in imports but no significant increase in exports

value is one area where economic theories tend to diverge and the very basic schools of thought both have excellent points in their favor you 've identified both here one being that economic value can always be determined by net labor or at least cost of inputs and the other being that economic value does not exist in and of itself and that only a market can determine value in some ways it is just a question of world view as much as anything but the concepts of natural prices or innate worth are difficult to argue against at the same time without exchange the concept of value has little meaning so as usual it is some mixed with some sense   both have elements of truth and both are considerably more complex than they seem at first interestingly though neither seems to work very well as predictive models despite providing the basis for some incredibly complex and interesting mathematical        note that net labor is the sum of all labor involved and is incredibly difficult to quantify accurately

the scenario you mention regarding capital gains is pretty much the core of the issue here 's a run down from that explains it a bit it 's important to focus on it being the tax rate not the tax amount which i think you get but i want to reinforce that for other readers   basically most of buffett 's income comes from capital gains and    dividends income from investments he makes with the money he already    has income earned by buying and selling stocks or from stock    dividends is generally taxed at 15 percent the rate for long term    capital gains and qualified dividends buffett also mentioned that some of the mega rich are hedge fund    managers who earn billions from our daily labors but are allowed to    classify our income as carried interest thereby getting a bargain    15 percent tax rate we do n't know the taxes paid by buffett 's secretary who was mentioned    by obama but not by buffett buffet 's secretary would have to make a    high salary or else typical deductions such as the child tax credit    would offset taxes owed let 's say the secretary is a particularly    well compensated executive assistant making adjusted income more than    $ in income yes that sounds like a lot to us too but    remember we 're talking about the secretary to one of the richest    people in the world in that case marginal tax rates of 28 percent    would apply then there would be payroll taxes of 6.25 percent on the    first $ money that goes to social security and another 1.45    percent on all income which goes to medicare the secretary ’s overall    tax rate would be lower than 28 percent since not all the income    would be taxed at that rate only the income above $ buffett meanwhile would pay very little if anything in payroll    taxes in the new york times op ed buffett said he paid percent    in taxes thinking of the secretary it gets a little complicated    given how the tax brackets work but basically people who make    between $ 100,000 and $ 200,000 are paying around 20 percent in federal    taxes including payroll and income taxes according to an analysis    from the nonpartisan tax policy center so in this case the secretary 's rate is higher because so much of    buffett 's income comes from investments and is taxed at the lower    capital gains rate here 's buffet 's original op ed in the nyt for those of you that are n't familiar

i am a tax lawyer and all the responses above are 1/2 correct but also 1/2 wrong and in tax law this means 100 wrong because any part incorrect under tax law will get you a huge and/or prison time by way of the irs   so in essence all the above answers are wrong let me enlighten you to the correct answer in 5 parts as people that do not practice tax law may understand but you still probably will not understand if you are not a lawyer 1 all public companies are corporations shown by ltd. 2 only shareholders of public companies ie traded on the nyse stock market are never liable for debts of a bankrupt company due to the concept of limited liability 2 now banks may ask a sole proprietorship who wants to for example to give collateral such as owners stocks bonds or his her house but then of course the can tell the bank no thanks and find a lender that may charge higher interest rates but lend money to his company with little to no collateral 3 of course not all companies are publicly traded and these are called private companies liability has nothing to do directly with subsequent shareholders the above answer is inaccurate it relates rather to initial owners investment in their company limiting the amount of owner loss if the company goes bankrupt 5 share face value is usually never related to this as shares are sold at market value in real life instances above or below face value or the most money investments banks or owners can fetch for the shares they sell not what the stock 's face value is set at upon issuance never forget stocks are sold in our capitalistic system to whomever pays the most as it is that buyer who gets to purchase the stock

oh god you 're one of those people normally i do n't feed trolls but i 'm bored today so here goes   first i ask for peer reviewed literature and you respond with blog posts newspaper articles and links to   now to business i 'm not going to address what 's discussed in the versions of the stories you shared they are just journalists take on a few studies instead i 'll address the study itself which i 'm guessing you did n't bother to read    first study you indirectly linked gt;the results were n’t what we expected but they tie in with previous research on addiction which has found that substance people who are dependent on cocaine or for example have altered systems   i 'm not exactly seeing how that proves your point of course chronic drug addicts are not going to be productive members of society but nobody is debating that    gt;it could also explain the which has been described in cannabis users but whether such a syndrome exists is controversial   so this very study doubt on the phenomena you describe   gt;we only looked at cannabis users who have had like experiences while using the drug   hmm hardly seems like these results should be applied to the general population of all cannabis users then    second study you indirectly linked   gt;it has also been proposed that long term cannabis users might also have problems with motivation even when they are not high however we compared people dependent on cannabis to similar controls when neither group was and did not find a difference in motivation   so this study literally the core tenant of your overall argument thanks for the link    third article you linked is shit it does n't give us details on the study no a link to the research it just cherry picks a few quotes thankfully it does refer to the same research linked in your fifth article which i 'll discuss shortly but seriously kid you did n't bother to actually read any of these did you   fourth study you indirectly linked is literally the same study referenced in the second article you did n't read any of these did you   fifth study you indirectly linked as i said before it 's the same research discussed in the third link and here 's the really important part    gt; we do not to report a causal ship between cannabis dependence and economic social   problems cannabis dependence could be a marker of a   life trajectory characterized by social and economic adversity   you do know the difference between correlation and causation right but seriously this was actually a really good bit of research that i enjoyed reading and it does bring up a few points that support your point of view if you can be bothered reading articles that do n't have pictures give this one a shot   sixth study you indirectly linked again pretty hard to discuss because the denver post did not bother to include a link to the research itself but again i think you 're confusing correlation with causation all this article proves is that like cigarette use marijuana use is more strongly concentrated among lower income americans there is no claim that marijuana use caused these people to earn less money that 's your own opinion and it 's not supported by any facts     now where is that bitch slap you mentioned

i think what you 're asking is   can i buy 1000 shares of the stock at $ 1   for $ 1000    it goes up to $ 2 then sell 500 shares of the stock with proceeds of $ 1000 now    having my original $ 1000 out of it and still owning 500 shares     and that not create a taxable event since all i    did was take my cost basis back out and did n't collect any gains    and then i want to repeat that over and over nope not in the usa anyway    each sale is a separate taxable event the first sale will have proceeds of $ 1000 and a cost basis of $ 500 with $ 500 of capital gains and taxes owed at the time of that sale the remaining stock will have a cost basis of $ 500 and proceeds of whatever you sell it for in the future the next batch of stock will have a cost basis of whatever you pay for it    the only thing that works anything like the way you 're thinking is a roth ira    you can put your cost basis in pull it back out and put it back in again all tax free    but every time your cost basis cycles in that counts your contribution limits unless you do it fast enough to call it a rollover

as an easy and rough rule of thumb a job for $ 55,000 per year is $ 55 per hour as a contractor that 's roughly twice the hourly rate   in return the company gets the rate to vary your hours or cease your employment with less financial legal or managerial overhead than a full time employee   you have less stability less benefits perhaps need to put some time into finding another job sooner of course the ultimate though less helpful answer is whatever the market will bear

i have considered doing the same thing one idea i have tossed around is investing in a reit a reit is kind of like a mutual fund for real estate they normally own a large portfolio of real estate perhaps apartments or commercial space etc and by owning a share you get some of the upward swing without the hassle of ownership i.e. you can sell instantaneously the reit sometimes handles the whole lifecycle of property management finding renters collecting rent maintenance etc there are a lot of public reits in the us that you can buy another option might be to buy shares in a home building company like homes   yet another option that ties onto your lack of retirement savings is the little known fact that after tax roth ira contributions can be withdrawn without penalty since 401ks can be rolled over into a roth ira normally you have to leave your employer in theory a 401k contributions can also be cashed out you just need to be careful about tracking your contributions

do n't ever quantify a stock 's preference performance just based on the dividend it is paying out volatility defined by movements in the the stock 's price affected by factors embedded in the stock e.g. the corporation the business it is in the economy the management etc etc apple was n't paying dividends but people were still buying into it same with amazon berkshire google these companies create value by investing their earnings back into their company and this is reflected in their share prices their earnings create more value in this way for the stockholders the holding structures of these companies also help them in their motives supposedly $ 100 invested in either stocks for keeping things easy you invested at the same time in both single annual dividend and prices more or less remain constant company a $ 5/share at 20 annual dividend yield   dividend = $ 20 company b $ 10/share at 20 annual dividend yield   dividend = $ 20 you receive the same dividend in both cases volatility affect you unless you are trading or the stock market tanks or some very bad news comes out of either company or on the economy volatility in the long term averages out except in specific outlier cases e.g. lehman bankruptcy and the financial crash which are rare but do happen in general case the price movements in both stocks would more or less follow the markets not exactly though except when relevant news for either corporations come out

how often do investors really lose money all the time and it 's almost always reason number 1 let 's start with the beginner investor the person most likely to make some real losses and feel they 've learned that investing is no better than vegas this person typically gets into it because they 've been given a hot stock tip or because they 've received a windfall decided to give this investing a try and bought stock in half a dozen companies whose names they know from their everyday lives i own a bit of google how cool is that these are people who do n't understand the cyclic nature of the market bear gives way to bull gives way to bear and on and on and so when they suddenly see that what was $ 1000 is now $ 900 they panic and sell everything especially as all the pundits are declaring the end of the world they always do until the moment they sold they only had paper losses but they those losses made them real and ended at a loss then there 's the trend follower these are people who do n't necessarily hit a bear market or even a downturn in their early days but never really try to learn how the market works in any real sense they jump into every hot stock then panic and sell out of anything that starts to go the wrong way both of these reactive behaviours seem reasonable in the moment it 's gone up 15 in the past week buy buy buy and i 've lost 10 this month on that thing get rid of it before i lose any more but they work out over time to lots of buying high and selling low the very opposite of what you want to do then there 's the day trader these are people who sit in their home office buying and selling all day to try and make lots of little gains that add up to a lot the reason these people do n't do well in the long run is slightly different to the other examples first fees yes most platforms offer a discount for frequent traders but it still ai n't free second they 're playing in the big leagues of course there are exceptions who make out like bandits but day traders are playing a different game than the people i 'd call investors that game unlike buy and hold investing is much more like gambling and day traders are the enthusiastic amateurs sitting down at a table with professional poker players institutional investors and the computers and research departments that work for them even buy and hold investors even the more sophisticated ones can easily realise losses on a given stock you say you should just hold on to a stock until it goes back up but if it goes low enough it could take a decade or more to even just break even again more savvy stock pickers will have a system worked out something like ok if it gets down to 90 of what i bought it for i cut my losses and sell this is actually a sensible precaution because defining hard rules like that you eliminate emotion from your investing which is incredibly important if you want to avoid becoming the trend follower above it 's still a loss but it 's a calculated one and hopefully over time the exception rather than the rule there are probably as many other ways to lose money as there are people investing but i think i 've given you a taste the key to avoiding such things is understanding the psychology of investing and defining the rules that you 'll follow no matter what as in that last example or just go learn about index investing that 's what i did

buying back shares is an indication that the company does not believe that there is justification to invest in production employee training or technology in the end what it mostly does is pump up the share price which very directly pumps up the value of share based compensation that the ceo has   on mergers and acquisitions i do n't have the time to look for the source right now but i 've read a few reports that showed that the vast majority of mergers and acquisitions actually the value when compared to the two separate companies they cite reasons like overblown expectations clash in company cultures and manipulations up top as a reason to do this on paper they all sound great but these are very things to which only the very best management teams manage to work out   the above parties are part of the real economy as long as they are companies that produce goods or services which is often the case it contrasts with the paper economy which is the world of bonds hedge funds share markets and commodity markets the money moving around in this world seldom makes a to anybody but the directly involved the share market is a classic example of this although the value of stocks may be high most people who own the stocks do n't actually have more money to spend unless obviously they sell the shares the value is on paper until it is transacted and can collapse like a house of cards    the real economy is much more stable and and has a large impact on the majority of the population it wo n't vary hugely from one month to the next like the stock market can   i do n't have any in economics other than curiosity on how these things work i read krugman 's blog and generally google any term or concept that my fancy i also partake in quite a few discussions here on reddit that frequently prompt me to go some more i do n't to be some sort of expert but i do have concise ideas of how things work and have a very strong bias of looking at evidence and fact based rather than ideology

i 've traded covered calls now and then this is a recent trade bought 1000 shares of radio shack and sold 10 calls so i own the stock at a cost of $ but have to let it go for $ 7.50 there 's a dividend in november so the call buyer will call it away even if the stock trades below the strike so i 'm expecting this is a 10 month trade for a 24 return   this is one strategy where options clearly take down the risk of course i did not say remove just lessens the stock can be 10 lower a year out and i 'm still ahead by 8 plus the dividend if it 's not canceled   note it 's a rare case for a one year trade to return 20 or more at a flat stock price more common is 10 12   i hope this example is acceptable as an example of this type of trade if not i can edit to xyz corp to remove the stock name so if anyone comments please do not repeat name in case i need to remove

maybe not but i think the point was making is that you chart a pretty tight relation to price hikes by barrel and price increases at the pump over time    price drops by barrel are n't usually followed by a drop at the pump though as it takes a while for competition to drive that down    so while it 's good news that oil prices are dropping per barrel for non gasoline uses it 's fair to be totally cynical about the prospect of a cheaper prices at the pump when you hear news like this   watching that per barrel rate drop and knowing this means a nice cushy profit trough for exxon always comes with a slight taste of

sounds nice in theory but let 's be honest here   competition between channels is weak   there do exist people who go on google and search for products though generally these people are looking for reviews which they will later go to amazon to purchase but most people go directly to amazon and use it as a product search engine   amazon owns search they own the marketplace they own the distribution   and they get to look at all your data if and when they see you got a good thing going they can choose to manipulate their listings to favor themselves and drown you out   it 's easy to say yeah being in the marketplace sucks just do n't do it   but if you do n't participate in their marketplace you 're probably going to go out of business   there is not a sufficient amount of competition in the other markets that are viable to go somewhere else ebay sears marketplace google shopping they 're a pittance

genius answer do n't spend more than you make pay off your outstanding debts put plenty away towards savings so that you do n't need to rely on credit more than necessary guaranteed to work every time   answer more tailored to your question what you 're asking for is not realistic practical logical or reasonable you 're asking banks to take a risk on you knowing based on your credit history that you 're bad at managing debt and funds solely based on how much cash you happen to have on hand at the moment you ask for credit or a loan or based on your salary which is n't guaranteed except in cases like professional athletes where long term contracts are in play   you can qualify for lower rates for mortgages with a larger down payment but you 're still going to get higher rate offers than someone with good credit   if you plan on having enough cash around that you think banks would consider making you credit worthy why bother using credit at all and not just pay for things with cash   the reason banks offer credit or low interest on loans is because people have proven themselves to be trustworthy of repaying that debt based on the information you have provided the bank would n't consider you trustworthy yet even if you have $ 100,000 in cash they do n't know that you 're not just going to spend it tomorrow and not have the ability to repay a long term loan you could use that $ 100,000 to buy something and then use that as collateral but the banks will still consider you a default risk until you 've established a credit history to prove them otherwise

i was going to comment above but i must have 50 reputation to comment this is a question that me and i 've given it some thought in the past morningstar is a good choice for simple well organized financial histories    it has more info available for free than some may realize   enter the ticker symbol and then click either the financials or the key ratios tab and you will get 5 10 years of some key financial stats   a premium subscription is $ 185 per year which is not too outrageous the american association of individual investors provides some good histories and a screener for a $ 29 annual fee allows you to chart a metric like eps going back a long ways and so you can then click the chart in order to get the specific number   that is certainly easier than sorting through financial reports from the sec   a message just popped up to say that i 'm not allowed to provide more than 2 links so my contribution to this topic will end here   you can do a search to find the website   i love stackexchange and usually consult it for coding advice   it just happens to be an odd coincidence that this is my first answer   i might even have added that aside in a comment but again i ca n't comment as of yet it 's problem however that the universe of free financial information is a of good resources that no longer exist   it seems that eventually everyone who provides this information wants to cash in on it   littleadv above says that someone should be paid to organize all this information however think that some basic financial information organized like normal data and hey this is not rocket science but excel 101 should be readily available for free   maybe this is a project that needs to happen   with a mission statement of not selling people out later on the closest thing out there may be quandl ca n't link do a search which provides a lot of charts for free and provides a beautiful and flexible api   but its core us fundamental data provided by costs $ 150 per quarter   so not even a basic eps chart is available there for free with all of the power that corporations have over our society i think they could be this information for us rather than providing it to us in a data dumb format that is the equivalent of printing a sql database as a pdf   a company that is worth hundreds of billions on the stock market and it ca n't be bothered to provide us with a basic excel chart that summarizes its own historical earnings   or with all that the government does to try to help us understand all of these investments they can not simply some basic financial information for us this stuff matters a great deal to our lives and i think that much of it could and should be available for free to all of us rather than mainly to financial professionals and those creating annual reports so i disagree that yet another entity needs to be making money off providing the basic transparency about something as simple as historical earnings thank you for indulging that tangent   i know that se itself on focused answers   a wonderful resource that i greatly appreciate

gt   google would be forced to actually compete with companies vs. giving everything away free that creates employment opportunities for other startups to compete in a fair environment vs. trying to acquire millions of users on no revenue   tl;dr do n't blame business blame the politics that let bad business happen   business does n't work like that specially for a publicly traded company free goods or services are used as a loss leader to drive their profits in other sectors of the company whether it 's for pr marketing or sales no company drives their business at a loss somewhere somehow the free things they do are driving their business towards higher profitability money is n't being lost on the economy by providing these things as free it 's just being used in different ways sure it could be used to pay for the wages of an employee at a startup which provides the same service but if google is providing it at or below the most efficient market price then it would be wasting money to have less efficient companies providing essentially the same product or service that money could instead be used in more profitable sectors of the economy which could in turn generate a healthier and/or faster growing economy overall working smarter not harder   secondly startups are n't designed for profitability in the first few years of their operations they 're designed to capture users   and information or as patent holders but that 's largely unrelated to my main point that can later be acquired by larger companies who are looking to target those users why else would any company pay for a startup while they 're operating at a loss the revenue for startups comes much later on as they 're bought out by bigger companies or they find a way to monetize their user base generate stable sources of revenue    if your argument is that employment by start ups drives the economy at large i have to ask if the economy is operating less efficiently by supporting start ups in replacing the market share currently held by much more efficiently operating large companies ~ by employing more people how is this healthier for the economy as a whole    supporting start ups is good but it has to be done in such a way that it does n't hurt existing business just for the sake of making jobs the size of a company does n't make them bad as long as they compete fairly with everyone else in the market   ~ caveat being where large companies do not form an oligopoly ie comcast twc etc which is obviously inefficient to begin with which is largely a product of bad politics rather than market forces

to be fair i do n't necessarily think that our guy was actively trying to screw us over in retrospect i 've known a few people like him people with major control issues who get extremely anxious and when something is n't in their hands and who kind of develop this authoritarian mindset because they do n't trust the group as a whole that leads to a lot of paranoia and projection i think he kind of developed a sort of oh no i think he 's gon na kill me well i 'll kill him first mentality and that affected his thinking   every complaint he brought up privately with our president was something he was actually the one bringing to the table they think i 'm power hungry actually we did n't but thank god we found out that he actually was before it was too late they do n't trust me as the executive to make the decisions he seemed to be the strongest and guiding voice in the meetings but apparently was n't actually or expressing any of his actual plans because he did n't trust us to know them they 're gon na cut and run and we 'll be left to keep things together he set of a chain of events which led to us having to to get everything out of his name in order to keep our original timetable after this all went down it came to light how absurdly and specific his fears were down to my wife for being controlling or something because i wanted to discuss my portion of the buy in with her before i paid it when he 'd never even met her   anyway i 've had actual adult bosses like this and they invariably find ways of bringing people down over little personal disagreements regardless of how well they 're performing the paranoia and ego driving things for that personality type can be hard to see at first because they 're invariably charismatic and on message and capable of really looking like they 're taking the whole of the picture into account before making reasoned suggestions and you need somebody with these skills for top leadership positions i do have a measure of pity for these people as they seem to live in a state of really subtle but profound internal dissonance that nobody else really gets a look at   the main problem here is that it 's easy to conflate image with substance as you have to have a fair amount of knowledge about the topic being discussed to parse their behavior and especially once a large power structure around the guy the of can really build which makes it tough to distinguish between a well reasoned interpretation of reality and a specious one well our last meeting with the new structure was great and we 're more excited than ever about getting started with less baggage

what do you mean does n't allow private entities to attach to the fixtures   do you mean fixtures like lamp posts etc   this would only be suitable for small cells anyway   putting a small cell on a rooftop is silly   a roof site would be a full build site with sector an equipment cabinet or two and a power battery cabinet   if you mean attach fixtures to buildings i do n't believe that   create a business to lease the space   bob 's rooftop inc. etc   make sure they carry sufficient insurance and that it includes protection for your building against any contractor error roof damage accidentally drill something damage to cosmetic materials etc against fire and basically anything else   i 've only seen cell equipment catch fire a couple of times both of which were the result of lightning strikes   on the other hand the bank of batteries they use for backup power is pretty big and has more than enough power to do some accidental arc welding   are they limited to leasing to a single carrier   you need this all spelled out in writing   pm me the name of the vendor if you are allowed to   i do n't need the name of the carrier   you do n't need to give me too much identifying information so there is no exposure for you   are they offering the $ 350 or are you asking it   i feel like a minimum of $ 1000 is reasonable   try to find out what they will be paid by the carrier   you might be able to negotiate something like 65 of the money the carrier pays   do remember that the vendor does basically nothing other than make the space available   they do n't build the site and they do n't maintain it

gt it 's been years since my finance classes but it seems to me the best course of action after selling the property and paying corporate taxes would be to reinvest the money at the corporate level to then pay out dividends rather than pay each of the 3 shareholders out and have us then pay personal tax on a large amount   full disclaimer no one here is or is acting in capacity as a tax accountant or lawyer    my understanding is as follows assuming you 're in the us   1 the c corp owns the property if you sell the property the corporation will receive the proceeds of that sale if a capital gain is recognized the corporation will pay the appropriate tax rate that rate is apparently the same as normal income    2 if you then issue a dividend with the proceeds of that sale you are actually not reinvesting the proceeds you 're distributing them to shareholders shareholders will then need to pay tax on the dividends at their personal rates as income   if you reinvest the cash it will stay in the business it will not go directly to shareholders the cash will need to be invested somewhere else within the company you will get hit with taxes regardless at least once if you distribute to shareholders those proceeds will be taxed twice    example   both cases   sale proceeds $ 100   less corporate tax of 35 $ 35   after tax proceeds $ 65     if distributed   distributed to shareholders $ 65   less income taxes at 25 $   after tax distribution to shareholders $     if retained   no distributions   retained earnings + $ 65   cash + $ 65   book value of equity + $ 65   shareholder wealth increase $ 65

you re assuming that gdp shows the amount of wealth created and is an indicator of the standard of living but it is not govt spending adds to gdp but takes away from the productive of the private sector which is the part of the economy that is making things that people want and need the govt can spend 1 trillion on building a to obama and that would increase gdp by 1 trillion but no wealth is created and the govt shift a trillion of tax revenues to the workers who built the if a company spends 1 trillion building building some new gadget then the people who spend money to buy i have something to show for it and the workers have their wages as well so now the company makes back 1.2 trillion and the consumers have their gadget ie real wealth has been created    the wealthy may be on of cash but its not just sitting under their mattress its spread out between investments and savings savings is to build up productive capabilities the money the rich have sitting in banks is being used to help other businesses grow not just collecting dust i wish it were as simple as giving every poor person 10 grand and watching the economy take off remember when bush gave everyone a 1000 tax refund it sure was fun blowing that on a ps3 i ca nt argue with that but prosperity can not be printed it must be earned through hard work and productive activity what we need is not monetary stimulus we need the govt to stop the private sector with burdensome regulations and taxes we need lower barriers to entry so we maximize competition in every industry we need the govt spending less and pushing more workers into the private sector making things that american can get some utility from its not going to be a smooth ride getting there there will be lots of lay offs in the short run as the economy but if the govt got out of the way and let the free market prosper our society would be far better off in the future

brokerages offer you the convenience of buying and selling financial products they are usually not exchanges themselves but they can be typically there is an exchange and the broker sends orders to that exchange the main benefit that brokers offer is a simpler commission structure not all brokers have their own liquidity but brokers can have their own allotment of shares of a stock for example that they will sell you when you make an order so that you get what you want faster regarding accounts at the exchanges to track actual ownership and transfer of assets it is not safe to assume that s how that works there are a lot of shortcomings in how the actual exchange works since the settlement time is 1 3 business days depending on the product so upwards of 5 to 6 actual days in a fast market the asset can change hands many many times making the accounting completely incorrect for extended time periods better to not worry about that part but if you 'd like to read more about how that is regulated look up failure to deliver regulations on short selling to get a better understanding of market it is a very antiquated system

unfortunately that 's a call only you can make and whichever route you choose comes with advantages and disadvantages   if you manage your money directly you may significantly reduce costs assuming that you do n't frequently trade index funds or you use a brokerage like robinhood and take advantage of market returns if the indexes perform well   on the other hand if the market experiences some bad years a professional might and this is a huge might have more self discipline and prevent a panic sell or know how to allocate accordingly both before and after a rise or fall keep in mind investors often get too greedy for their own good like they tend to panic at the wrong time   as an example of why this might is important one family member of mine trusted a professional to do this and they failed they bought in a rising market and sold in a falling market to avoid the above example if you do go with the professional service the best course of action is to look at their track record if they 're new you might be better on your own   since i assume this one or more professionals at the company testing to see what they 've recommended over the years might help you evaluate if they 're offering you a good choice finally depending on how much money you have you could always do what scott did he took a portion of his own money and managed it himself and tested how well he did vs. how well his professional team did if i recall i believe he came out ahead of his professional team   with two decades left that may help guide you the rest of the way even through retirement

because the hft bought them in response to the guy buying the hft was only able to get them faster because his server and internet connection were faster that in combination with the fact that they intentionally just spray the exchange with a huge combination of buys if they do n't have anyone on the hook they just cancel    so the hft sends the exchange a bunch of buy orders they know 99.9 wo n't match up with a guy who 's looking to buy and cancel them however when they get a guy on the hook they let that one go through and do n't cancel it    a traditional market maker does n't do that they let all the orders go through and charge a higher price when someone wants it however this is accepted as fair because they 're providing volume they 're making sure that buyers and sellers will have an active market so it 's expect that they should be able to profit for having that convenience   when a hft can cancel their orders at will they 're not providing volume   it 's not uncommon for a market maker to buy as many shares as possible and then force you to pay more for it however they give people the ability to buy or sell shares    hft do n't do this they are fast enough to cancel buy orders unless they have a buyer on the hook as a result they can be a market maker without any losses that would be one thing but they do n't provide the market with liquidity they just dump the shares as soon as they 're done taking their haircut tax

i agree with mark   i was quite confuse about the short position at first but then i did a lot of learning and found out that as long as you have enough cash to cover your margin requirement you do not pay any interest since you do not have a debit on your margin balance   this is not true for a long position though supposed you have 5k cash and 5k margin balance if you buy 10 k worth of stocks then you will need to pay interest on the 5k of the margin balance since it is a debit   since shorting is done at a credit basis you actually get interest from the transaction but you still may need to pay the borrowing fees for the stocks so they could simply balance each other out   i have shorted stocks twice through two different companies and neither time i noticed any interest charges   but make sure you have enough cash to cover your margin requirement because once your margin balance is used to covered your position then interest would accrual learn

one reason a company might choose to pay a dividend is because of the desire of influential stockholders to receive the dividend    in the case of ford for example there are 70 million shares of class b stock which receive the same dividend per share as do the common stock holders   even though there are 3.8 billion shares of common stock the class b owners which are ford family hold 40 of the voting power and so their desires are given much weight    the class b owners prefer regular dividends because if enough were to sell their class b shares all class b shares as a block would have their voting power drop from 40 to 30 and with further sales all special voting would be lost and each class b share would be equivalent to a common share in voting power hence the class b owners both for themselves and for all of the family members holding class b avoid selling shares and prefer receiving dividends

i have a slightly different take on this compared to the other answers in general i think your emergency fund should always be at least 3 k especially if you own a used car that is out of warranty any number of unlucky auto repairs could easily cost over so if you have 7 k in savings i would personally buy a car that is 4 k or less or finance any amount of the car over 4 k if you can get a relatively low interest rate then i would pay down the financed portion of the car as quickly as possible while maintaining at least a 3 k emergency fund that being said notice i mentioned in general your situation may actually be quite different if you do n't have much debt with your income you might be able to build up a couple of thousand in savings in a single month and if so the above does n't really apply even if you spent the entire 7 k on a car you 'd likely have at least 3 k in your emergency fund within 60 90 days as for what 's responsible there are too many factors to dictate that if you do n't have many other expenses you could possibly afford a $ 40 k car and i do n't think anyone here could fairly call that irresponsible if you spent that much though surely no one would call it responsible either perhaps the best advice is to buy the least expensive car you will be happy with many people regret overspending on a vehicle but few regret unless they got a lemon that requires lots of repairs finally you could also consider another option you could get a very cheap car for 1 k or less and drive it for a year by then you may have closer to 20 k saved up for a much nicer car than you can afford today

i think that its ok to keep your emergency fund money in cash in your home by emergency fund i mean $ 1,000 2,500 that does n't get touched there are risks you have a risk that the money will be stolen or be wholly or partially destroyed or even lost if you stash it somewhere and forget you 're also not going to earn interest so go for it but keep your emergency funds in cash if you want to buy silver and gold that 's fine you need to treat them as commodity investments

the point of title insurance is that when you buy a house it is possible that you may eventually find out that the seller did n't actually own the property either because they were trying to deceive you or some transfer of ownership in the past was n't carried out properly if that happens you can find yourself with no house and still owing the the purchase price hardly anybody can afford to take that kind of hit which is why you need some form of protection against it the traditional way of doing this was to get a lawyer to do a title search in which they check that everything in order however this costs tens of dollars at least to do the work for every sale and hardly ever finds anything title insurance is a company volunteering to take the hit for you if there turns out to be a problem in return for a payment of less than the title search would cost in essence they are saying that it 's cheaper to take the risk than do the work what are the statistics this report seems to indicate that payout is around 5 of premium but title insurance is a one off premium and the payout can theoretically happen many years down the line however it is almost certain that the insurance companies have done the math and believe that selling this insurance will be profitable for them so they believe that payouts are going to be substantially less than 100 is title insurance worth it for you if the payout is 5 of premiums the in a purely statistical sense it is not worth it you would on average gain more by not taking it however that is true of almost all insurance the policy is there to protect you in the unlikely but not impossible event where you would otherwise lose a huge amount of money unless you can afford to lose the value of your house you need some form of protection we 've already seen that the only other form of protection is a title search and they cost more the other issue is that if you are taking a mortgage your will absolutely insist that you have either a title search or title insurance there is no other way and title insurance is the cheaper of the two in this case it is best to look on the title insurance as simply a cost of doing business it 's irrelevant whether it 's worth it or not you ca n't do the transaction without it

loan officer here yes you pay the per diem i 'd recommend not paying it off for like 6 months you can pay it down to basically nothing and then hold it for six months and pay it off better for credit if it 's a simple interest rate most car loans are multiply the current principal balance by the interest rate and divide it by 365 that 's the per diem or daily interest for example 10,000 dollar auto loan at 3 10000 300 so each day the balance is 10k the loan cost 82 cents so in a month your first payment is 100 dollars goes to interest goes to principal then the new principal is so the next month another 30 days with the new per diem of the 100 payment is in principal in interest and so on

what you are looking for is a 1031 exchange whenever you sell business or investment property and you have a gain you generally have to pay tax on the gain at the time of sale irc section 1031 provides an exception and allows you to postpone paying tax on the gain if you reinvest the proceeds in similar property as part of a qualifying like kind exchange gain deferred in a like kind exchange under irc section 1031 is tax deferred but it is not tax free you may also sell your house for bitcoin and record the sales price on the deed with an equal or lesser amount that you bought it for

the share price on its own has little relevance without looking at variations in your case if the stock went from 2.80 to you should care only about the 88 drop in value not what it means in pre split dollar values you are correct that you can un split to give you an idea of what would have been the dollar value but that should not give you any more information than the variation of 88 would as for your title question you should read the chart as if no split occurred as for most intents and purposes it should not affect stock price other than the obvious split

since the bondholders have voted to reject the emergency manager 's plan which would have paid them pennies on the dollar the city is now attempting to discharge its short term and long term debt if they get what they want in court it is likely these bonds will become worthless even if they are only able to restructure the debt its likely that bondholders will need to accept large concessions however this may not be immediately reflected in bond prices as it 's very possible that the market for these bonds will be very limited in terms of who they could sell them to if you were to buy them now that would be a bet on some outcome other than bankruptcy and the discharge of the city 's long term obligations president obama has already stated that he monitoring the situation and it seems unlikely to me that after all of the support given to the auto industry in the last several years that the federal government will do nothing if only to avert job losses however i think it 's likely that state aid will be limited at best as michigan 's economy has been struggling for a number of years there are n't many large precedents to look at for guidance one of the largest public entities to declare bankruptcy orange county was a very different situation because this was due to malfeasance on the part of its investment manager whereas detroit 's situation is a much larger structural problem with its declining economy and tax base i think the key question will be whether the federal government will consider a detroit bankruptcy to be a large enough failure to take significant action

the company had been through many rounds of private financing prior to that   there was a particular round where mercedes benz invested a lot of money which elon credits with saving the company   elon says that the company would probably have survived but just taken longer to get to market or done so at a slower ramp without the government money   of course he may be saying that for whatever pr reasons but he 's been pretty open about when the company was on the brink of death before so i tend to believe it   keep in mind they had already made money on the roadster prior to the government loan not a lot but had they not been spending on model s r&amp;d it would have produced a profit but the whole intent to begin with was to fund model s r&amp;d with the roadster   also the government loan was a loan and that loan was paid back   i do n't see people criticizing nissan for example for taking government loans even though theirs was 10x the size of tesla 's and has not yet been paid back by the way i also am not criticizing nissan for that i 'm just saying neither should be criticized   tesla in fact got the least money of any company out of that particular loan program   including who got more money despite having a worse business plan

one of the things that you have to be aware of is a little gotcha in the credit utilization rate they or at least the credit company i worked for used the high balance in figuring the credit utilization not the ending balance for example say you had a single card with a $ 2000 credit limit and used it to charge everything during the month say that the high balance was $ 1900 and you paid it down to zero at the end of the month the company would calculate your credit utilization at 95 this is not good and not really fair but that was the way it was done increasing the credit limit helps but you can also usually make interim payments say as a paycheck comes in during the month if you have an online account

i do n't think this is a french thing   it 's like this everywhere   banks always want people to open accounts of every type   a person with a checking account should be easy to sell on a savings account at the same institution given that it does not appear that they will have any chance to recover the money they spend to get customers to open these accounts there are no fees and they have to pay out the interests even if very small oh they recover it   banks make money by having deposits that they can use to lend out   they do pay interest on deposits but not as much as they earn on your money   if they persuade you to have a savings account in addition to your checking account then you might find it convenient and then move your money out of a different institution into their savings account   or you might stop hoarding it under your mattress   or whatever   more money in their accounts means more profit for them i do n't know whether banks make more profit per dollar in savings or checking accounts   i see banks pushing for both   i think they simply view more accounts as a good thing because it can lead to more total savings in their institution   that 's how they make money

i 'll assume that you would work as a regular part time employee in this case you are technically a you will need a specific kind of swiss permit allowing you to work in switzerland your employer typically takes care of this they have more experience than you you being non eu might make matters a bit more complicated your employer will withhold 4.5 of your gross income as source taxes when you do your tax declaration your entire income will be taxed in germany since this is where you live this will happen after your first year of work be prepared for a large tax bill or think of this as an interest free loan from germany to you however due to the dba the 4.5 you already paid to switzerland will be deducted from the taxes you are due in germany judging from my experience the tax authorities in germany are not fluent in the dba particularly in areas far away from the swiss border i had to gently remind them to deduct the source taxes explicitly referring to the dba the bill was revised without problems but i strongly recommend making sure that your source taxes are correctly deducted from your german tax liability once your local german tax office understands your situation you will be asked to make quarterly prepayments which will be calculated in a way to minimize your later overall tax liability budget for these you did n't ask but i 'll tell you anyway social security will normally be handled by switzerland as the country of employment not the country of residence your employer will automatically deduct old age unemployment and accident insurance and contribute to a pension plan all in switzerland however if you do a lot of your work in germany > 25 which certainly applies if you plan on mostly working remotely your social security will be handled by your country of residence this is a major pain for your employer because now your swiss employer needs to understand the german social security system how much and to whom to co pay and so forth this is a major area of study and your employer may not want to spend all this effort my employer has looked at this and requires anyone living outside of switzerland to limit working from home to less than 25 because by extension they would some day also need to do the same for employees living in france italy austria or even the uk they do n't want to dig through half the eu states social security regulations therefore you would not be able to work remotely from germany for my employer this is actually a fairly recent development that only entered in force at the beginning of 2015 before that this was all a bit of a gray area your prospective employer may not be aware of all details so you will need to think about whether you actively want to point them at this possibly ruining your plans of working remotely or not and possibly getting major problems and post payments years later finally i think you can choose whether you want to have your health insurance in switzerland or in germany unless your swiss obligation to be insured is waived because of your part time status some swiss health insurers offer plans where they cooperate with german health insurers so you can go to german doctors just like a german resident source i have been a from germany into switzerland off and on for over ten years now i ca n't say anything about whether your german visa restricts you from working in switzerland you may want to ask about this at se but i 'd much rather ask your local german authorities than random strangers on the internet

with my experience because i hate generalizations of an entire country   i 'm indian born and raised but came to the us to do my undergrad uni and now work out of the us i had a lot of the same qualms about working with my indian peers but i 've found that it also depends on the support structure that companies offer high turnover is definitely an issue but that seems to be because companies focus more on hiring and less on retention offering signing bonuses but then little to no continued progress limited growth opportunities rigid hierarchy terrible working hours   i have someone who reports to me in india now and it 's an experiment on how to better engage them and it 's worked better turns out you can expect more when you also treat them like an american employee while expecting american results there are definitely still cultural in work ethic etc but they can be overcome if you get people to stick around long enough   of course this is anecdotal but that 's my two cents

he sounds like a very bad salesman and i should know because i was a sales manager at a bike shop which sold bikes from $ 200 to $ 10k now i had a clear goal which is to sell as many bikes at the highest price possible but i did n't do that by making customers uncomfortable each customer received different treatment depending on what they were looking for   for example the $ 200 beach cruiser buyer was going to be told you look great on that bike can i ring you up whereas the interested in saving grams will receive a detailed discussion about his bike options   the $ 200 bike customer wo n't have very sophisticated questions although i could give a lecture on so giving out too much info complicates a likely quick impulse buy   on the other hand we are building a relationship with the which will include detailed fitting sessions and time consuming mechanical service   while i also want to close a high priced sale it will take several visits to prove both i have the right bike and this is the best shop but no matter what you were buying i was always pleasant and and my customers left happy    specifically with this situation of high pressure tactics the problem is the competition with internet sales   often customers will have only 2 criteria the model and the price and if a shop does not meet both the customer walks right out    possibly this sales guy is a bit cynical with his tactics but the reality is that if you have no relationship with that shop you fall into the category of internet buyer   one thing the sales guy could have done was not tell you we was n't going to honor this price if you came back   occasionally there would be an internet buyer and i showed no even though internet sellers could crush our brick and mortar shop   i would mention a competitive price and if he bought it great and if not that 's just business    as for the buyer i would treat these tactics with a certain   i would personally chuckle at his treatment and ask if i could kick the tires an user car saying    i suppose the bottom line is if you are ready to buy this specific model and if the price is right and the shop is ethical so you wo n't get ripped off with garbage then you have to be ready to buy on the spot i will point out one horrible experience i had at a car dealership   i came in 15 minutes before closing and a sales person gave me a price almost a third cheaper than list   i was n't ready to buy on my first visit ever to a dealership and of course buying a car has all kinds of hidden fees   i asked will this be the price tomorrow and he said absolutely not   i told him so if i come in tomorrow morning your dealer clock has only gone 15 minutes but that logic did not register with him    maybe he thought i was going to spend 15k on the spot and pressure tactics would work on me   i never came back but i did go another dealership and bought a car after a reasonable negotiation

the only way you will incur underpayment penalties is if you withhold less than 90 of the current year 's tax liability or 100 of last years tax liability whichever is smaller   so as long as your total tax liability last year not what you paid at filing but what you paid for the whole year was more than $ you should not have any penalty what you pay or get back when you file will be your total tax liability less what was withheld for example you had $ withheld from your pay for taxes   if after deduction and other factors your tax liability is $ you will owe $ 111 when you file   on the other hand if your tax liability is only $ 1,000 you 'll get a refund of $ when you file since you 've had more withheld that what you owe since your income was only for part of the year and tax tables assume that you make that much for the whole year i would suspect that you over withheld during your internship which would offset the lack of withholding on the other $ 6,000 in income

for insight on what will happen i suggest looking at the situation from the lender 's perspective if your setbacks are temporary and you are likely to get back on your feet again they will protect their investment by making accommodations and probably charging you extra fees along the way if your financial hardship seems they probably try to squeeze you for as much as possible and then eventually take your house protecting their investment as best they can if they are going to foreclose they may be reluctant to do it quickly as foreclosure is expensive takes man power and looks bad on their books   so it may get pushed off for a quarter or a fiscal year but if you are asking if they 'll help you out from the goodness of their heart well a bank has no heart and creditors are interested in roi   they 'll take the easiest path to profit or failing that the path to minimum financial losses    the personal consequences to you are not their concern once you realize this it may change your thinking about your own situation    if you think you have a path to financial recovery then you need to make that clear to them in writing with details   make a business case that working with you is in their own best interests if you can not make such a case recognize that they 'll likely squeeze you for as much as possible in penalties fees interest payments etc before eventually foreclosing on you anyway   do n't play that game if your home is a lost cause financially plan how to get out from it with the smallest losses possible   do n't pay more than you need to and do n't throw good money after bad

alright a few things   1 the crisis is likely a recession type thing there are arguments to be made for avoiding debt less hurt from a downturn in sales or for taking on the debt rack up the sales early take the hit then press on i 'm in the latter category everyone 's going to take a hit not everyone is going to have the inertia from previous rounds to sustain themselves through it   2 in that case i might just hold off until before that date this only makes sense if you know exactly when it 's going to happen if you do n't then you 're making a large gamble even if you do you 're sacrificing growth for security    3 the balance sheet should n't have too much of an effect debt loads will debt coverage and interest coverage will    4 debt is a tool it amplifies losses and gains a company with a lot of debt and a good sales year will outperform a company with no debt and an excellent sales year you 're in a closed system of competition you need to be hyper aggressive   5 there are only two things a company does innovation and marketing the rest are all cost   6 assuming this is a manufacturing type of company i.e. pay attention to your r&amp;d max out your marketing budget and pay close attention to your capacity and production read the rules to ensure they make sense and make a model spreadsheet if it makes sense coordinate with team members rigorously    7 win

credit cards and debit cards make up the bulk of the transactions in the us   visa and mastercard take a percentage of each credit card transaction   for the most part this fee it built into the price of what you buy   that is you do n't generally pay extra at the grocery store if you use a credit card gasoline purchases are a notable exception here if you were getting something like 2 of a third of all the retail transactions in the us you 'd probably not want to rock the boat too much either   since there is little fraud relative to the amount of money they are taking in and it can often be detected using statistical analysis they do n't really stand to gain that much by reducing it through these methods   sure they can reduce the losses on the insurance they provide to the credit card consumer but they risk slowing down the money machine   these companies want avoid doing something like reducing fraud by 0.5 revenues but causing purchases with the cards drop by 1   more security will be implemented as we can see with the slow introduction of chip cards in the us but only at a pace that will prevent disruption of the money machine   emv will likely cause a large drop in cc fraud at brick and mortar stores but wo n't stop it online   you will likely see some sort of system like you describe rolled out for that eventually

to add to 's answer this is almost certainly a scam   the money deposited into your account is not from a person that made an honest mistake with account numbers   it 's coming from someone that has access to send money that is n't their own   i do n't know exactly what they 're doing to send the money but at some point in the near future your bank will claw that money back from you on the grounds that it was transferred to you in the first place   if you send someone money on the premise that you 're returning this money then that will be a separate transaction which wo n't be undone when the deposit in question is undone another possibility is that this person has gained access to an account from which they can send domestic wires but not international wires   their hope is to send money to someone domestically you and that this person will then send the money on to nigeria   if you comply with them you in a worst case scenario could be seen as a money laundering in addition to having the deposit taken back from you   it 's not very likely you would n't be seen as another victim of a scam but people have been thrown in jail for less you should not respond to this person at all   do n't answer the phone when they call and ignore their emails   do n't delete the emails it 's possible that someone at the bank or le want them   call your bank immediately and tell them what 's up

split transactions are to anybody interested in accurately tracking their spending if i go to the big box pharmacy down the road to pick up a prescription and then also grab a loaf of bread and a of milk while there then i 'd want to enter the transaction into my software as i desire entering precise data into the software so that i can rely on the reports it produces often i do n't need an exact amount and estimated category totals would have been fine e.g. to inform budgeting or compare to a prior period however in other cases the expenses i 'm tracking must be tracked accurately because i 'd be using the total to claim an income tax deduction or credit   consider how internet access might be commingled on the same bill with the home 's cable tv service   one is a reasonable business expense and deduction for the work at home web developer whereas the other is a personal non deductible expense were split transaction capability not available the somewhat unattractive alternatives are ignore the category difference and say categorize the entire transaction as the larger or more important category   but this deliberately introduces error in the tracked data rendering it useless for cases where the category totals need to be accurate or split the transaction manually this does n't introduce error into the tracked data but suffers another problem it makes a lot of work first one would need to manually enter two or more top level transactions instead of the single one with sub amounts   perhaps not that much more work than if a split were entered worse is when it comes time to reconcile   now there are two or more transactions in the register but the credit card statement has only one   reconciling would require manually adding up those transactions from the register just to confirm the amount on the statement is correct   major pain i 'd place split transaction capability near the top of the list of must have features for any finance management software

generally when you open a new account you 'd be given a checkbook usually starter checks with no personal information but some banks will later mail you a proper checkbook with your personal details and a debit card again some banks will give you a starter one on the spot with a personalized following up in the mail others will mail you with the debit card you can use your bank 's atm to withdraw cash from your account or use it for purchases will debit as the name says directly from your account you can also use it in other atms but that will usually be with significant fees $ per withdrawal to both the atm owner and your bank checks you can write a check to someone or use the check to go to the cashier in the bank and withdraw money although usually they have special withdrawal slips for that in the branches so you do n't really need to waste your own checks as to how to deposit money in your home country you 'll have to check with the bank you have an account at back at home usually you can wire transfer money from your boa account to the account back home but that is usually comes at a fee of about $ per transfer in the us additional fees may be charged at the receiving end + currency conversion costs you can also write yourself a check and deposit that check at the home country bank but that depends on the specific bank whether it is possible how much it would cost and how long it would take for them to credit the money to your account after they take your check may take weeks with personal checks

in general currency has no expiration date specifically in canada the bank of canada has been issuing banknotes since and these are still considered legal tender even though they do n't look much like the modern banknotes   before that canadian chartered banks issued currency and these also still have value however there are a few things to note   first of all with currency of that age it often has more value as a collector 's item than the face value   so spending it at a store would be foolish second store clerks are not experts in old currency and will not accept a bill that they do not recognize   if you want the face value of your old currency you may need to exchange it for modern currency at a bank having said all that there are certainly cases where currency does expire   generally this happens when a country changes currency   for example when the euro was introduced the old currencies were discontinued   after a window of exchange the old currency in many cases lost its value   so if you have some old french franc notes for example they can no longer be exchanged for euros these types of events can not be predicted in the future of course so it is impossible to say when if ever the canadian currency you have today will lose its spending value in canada

most of the time when a stock splits to create more shares it is done to bring the price per share down to a level that makes potential investors more comfortable there are psychological reasons why some companies keep the price in the $ 30 to $ 60 range others like to have the price keep rising into the hundreds or thousands a share   the split does n't help current investors with the possible exception that the news spurs interest in the stock which leads to a short term rise in prices but it also does n't hurt current investors when a reverse stock split is done the purpose is for one of several reasons

amazon uses their aws profits to subsidize all their other businesses they can afford to sell groceries at a loss until most of the competition goes out of business it 's good for consumers in the short term but i would n't say it 's capitalism working as intended unprofitable businesses are supposed to fold not be propped up indefinitely by deep pocketed investors it 's monopolistic behavior without the monopoly which i do n't think we 've ever seen on this scale before so we are n't sure what if anything to do about it

there 's no such thing as when enforcing the law not knowing the law as you have probably heard is not a valid legal defence tax law is a law like any other that said some penalties and fines can be if the error was done in good faith and due to a reasonable cause first time penalties can be in many cases assuming you 're compliant otherwise for example first time late filing penalty can be if you 're compliant in the last 5 years not many people know about that examples for a reasonable cause from the irs reliance on the advice of a tax advisor generally relates to the    reasonable cause exception in irc for the accuracy related    penalty under irc see return related penalties and if the taxpayer does not meet the criteria for penalty relief under    irc the taxpayer may qualify for other penalty relief for    instance taxpayers who fail to meet all of the irc criteria    may still qualify for relief under reasonable cause if the irs    determines that the taxpayer exercised ordinary business care and    prudence in relying on the irs ’s written advice    erroneous advice or reliance    reg there are more is the internal revenue manual the book of policies for the irs agents   of course you should seek a professional advice when you 're non compliant and want to ask for and become compliant again talk to a cpa ea licensed in your state

the question you should be asking yourself is this why am i putting money into a 401(k for many people the answer is to grow a large nest egg and save for future retirement expenses investors are balancing risk and potential reward so the asset categories you 're putting your 401(k contribution towards will be a reflection on how much risk you 're willing to take per a us news world report article ultimately investors would do well to remember one of the key tenants    of investing diversify the narrower you are with your investments    the greater your risk says vanguard 's diversification    does n't ensure against a loss but it does help lessen a significant    loss generally investing in your employer 's stock in your 401(k is considered very risk in fact one forbes recommends not putting any money into company stock finra notes simply stated if you put too many eggs in one basket you can expose yourself to significant risk in financial terms you are under diversified you have too much of    your holdings tied to a single investment your company 's stock    investing heavily in company stock may seem like a good thing when    your company and its stock are doing well but many companies    experience fluctuations in both operational performance and stock    price not only do you expose yourself to the risk that the stock    market as a whole could but you take on a lot of company    risk the risk that an individual firm your company will falter or    fail in simpler terms if you invest a large portion of your 401(k funds into company stock if your company runs into trouble you could lose both your job and your retirement investments for the other investment assets vehicles you should review a few things personally i prefer to keep my portfolio simple and just pick just a few options based on my own risk tolerance from your fund examples without knowing specifics about your financial situation and risk tolerance i would have created a portfolio that looks like this when i was in my 20 's i avoided the bond and income money market funds because the growth potential is too low for my investing horizon like some of the other answers have noted the target date funds invest in other funds and add some additional fee overhead which i 'm trying to avoid by investing primarily in index funds again your risk tolerance and personal preference might result in a completely different portfolio mix

increasing rates from .75 to 1 is an attempt to control debt   the new 1 rate drives down demand for bonds based on the old .75 rate and drives down demand for stocks who have decrease profit because they pay more interest on debt   this is the federal reserves primary tool inflation    1 is what the banks pay to borrow money they base their lending rates on this 1 figure   if a person can guarantee a .75 return on money borrowed at 1 they will opt to save and instead lend their money out at 1

i would n't say that this is specific to student loans i think nowadays debt is just becoming a bigger and bigger thing partially due to the increasing wage gap as the standard of life moves up way faster than wages move up debt becomes necessary also debt is a very appealing thanks to the interest rates people will pay so more banks want to give them out and more people want to take them to be able to go to good schools own a nice house etc we 've gone from a generation that expected to be able to earn and save up for everything within a reasonable time to one that normalizes debt as something that everybody just gets into to have a normal standard of life

if you 're able to pop this data into excel you can quickly calculate the solution every one of these problems boils down to interest rate term payment present value and future value fv will typically be zero excel has a formula to calculate any of these components based off of the other inputs    in this case the given information is interest rate   term 36 months monthly pmt $ 350 present value    you can use the = pv formula and input the other known values one caveat is that you 'll need to adjust the interest rate to account for the monthly compounding so the formula would be = this gives a result of $ which is the amount you 'd be able to borrow all of these can also be solved on the + but i do n't have my old calculator on me to walk through the steps   to calculate the total interest paid you would then find out how much you 'll be paying over the life of the loan if your monthly payment is $ 350 for 36 months the total amount you 'd pay is $ 12,600 $ 350 36 subtract the $ calculated in step one and you are left with $ worth of interest    hope that makes sense let me know if you want me to go over any of the steps in more detail as a former finance student i would highly recommend locking down the tvm functions as they will pop up quite often throughout your schooling career    best of luck

i 'd like to suggest a plan first i know you want to buy a house i get that and that is an awesome goal to work for you need to really sit down and decide why you want a house people often tell we that they want a house because they are throwing their money away renting this is just not true there is a cost of renting that is true but there is also a cost of owning there are many things with a house that you will have to pay for that will add little or no equity value now that equity is nice to have but make no mistake under no circumstance does every dime you put into your house increase its value this is a huge misconception there is interest fees repairs taxes and a bunch of other stuff that you will spend money on that will not increase the value of your home you will do no harm waiting a bit renting and getting to a better place before you buy a house with that out of the way time for the plan note i 'm not saying wait to buy a house i am saying think of these as steps in the large house buying plan get your current debt under control your credit score does n't suck but it 's not good either it 's middle of the road your going to want that higher if you can but more importantly than that you want to get into a pattern of making debt then honoring it the single best advise i can give you is what my wife and i did get a credit card you have one do n't get more and then get into a habit of not spending more on that credit card than you actually have in the bank if you have $ 50 in the bank only spend that on your credit card then pay it in full 100 every payday twice a month this will improve your score quite a bit and will in time get you in the habit of buying only what you can afford unless there has been an emergency you should not be spending more on credit than you actually have your car loan needs to get under control i 'm not going to tell you to pay it off completely but see point 2 your car debt should not be more than you have in the bank this again is a credit building step if you have in the bank and own on your car your ability to get a loan will improve greatly start envelope budgeting there are many systems out there but i like ynab a lot it can totally turn your situation around in just a few months it will also allow you to see your house fund growing breaking point so far this sounds like a long wait but it 's not it also sounds like i am saying to wait to actually buy a house and i 'm not i am not saying get your debt to 0 nor do i think you should wait that long the idea is that you get your debt under control and build a nice solid set of habits to keep it under control a look at your finances at this point now at this point you still have debt but your credit cards are at 0 and have been every payday for a few months your car loan still exists but you have money in the bank to cover this debt and you could pay it off it would eat your nest egg but you could you also have 15k set aside just for the house as you take longer looking for that perfect house that number keeps growing your bank account now has over $ 25,000 in it that 's a good feeling on its own and if you stick with your plan buy your house and put down $ 15k you still have plenty of wiggle room between credit cards that are not maxed out and a $ padding in case the roof falls in again it sounds like i 'm saying wait but i 'm not i 'm saying plan better all of these goals are very doable inside one year a rough year to be sure but doable if you want to do it comfortably then take two years in that time you 're looking searching and learning

one other consideration is that by paying off your mortgage early versus for example investing that capital in a mutual fund is that you are reducing your net liquidity to some degree that is if you find yourself needing an emergency infusion of cash it is easier to sell a stock fund than to sell your house or get a equity loan   i suppose if you were planning to need a lot of cash to start a business or invest in real estate then maybe it would make sense to keep your cash more liquid however in your situation i agree with joe pay it off it feels really good to write that last check

i 'm not sure if someone else answered already in the same manner i will i ca n't guarantee for sure if it 's the same in the it might since major credit cards companies like visa mc amex are american companies but in canada having keeping unused cc is a disadvantage because of the following banks and financing companies look more at the total amount of credit available to you than at how much purchases you have on your cards ex let 's say that you have the following visa cc with $ 10,000 limit and $ 2000 worth of purchases made more than 30 days ago on it mastercard cc with $ 10,000 limit as well and $ 1000 worth of purchases less than 30 days old a major retail store cc with $ 2000 limit and $ 0 balance hypothetical situation you want a bank loan to do some expensive house repairs and are looking for a lower interest rate than what your cc can offer the bank will not care about the amount on the cards they will add up all the limits of your cc and treat your loan request as if all your cards were filled to their respective limit   so in this case they will consider you as being right now in debt of $ k = $ 22,000 instead of only $ 3000 and they might   1 refuse you the loan 2 grant it only if you transfer all purchases on a single card and cancel all the others 3 once the $ 3000 is transferred on one of the cards and the others cancelled they can require that you reduce the limit of that card hope this helps

depending on what currency the price is quoted in and is originally sold currency fluctuation can also carry over onto the price in your currency an example for that would be bitcoin prices which sometimes show heavy ups and downs in one currency but seem totally stable in another and can be tracked back to changed exchange rates between currencies also like others have said prices on stocks are not actually fixed you can offer to buy or sell at any price only if 2 people want to buy or sell for the same price there will actually be a transaction

things i would specifically draw your attention to the contract typically allows for an option to purchase it does not typically compel purchase although this is seen the purchase price is negotiated before anything gets signed the option to buy is typically available to the renter for the period of the lease contract ie if it 's a 12 month contract the renter can opt to buy at any time in that 12 months the amount of rent paid over time that will be applied to the purchase price is negotiated up front before anything gets signed rent is paid at a slight premium as joe notes if the rent should be $ 1000 per month expect to pay $ 1200 per month if the renter walks away they walk away empty handed they do not get back the premium having said all that it 's a contract negotiated between renter and seller and all of this is negotiable   see also ehow for a good overview

that argument is an argument for investing generally not peer to peer lending per se and the argument as phrased thus you should invest your money at a peer to peer loan platform is a false dichotomy that said as soon as one is investing as opposed to just getting a small but guaranteed return then risk comes into play   in that sense any savings account is fundamentally different from any investment and in that reading the two should n't be compared as different approaches to investing   peer to peer lending as an investment could be compared with stock market investing for one

i came to us as an international student several years ago and i have also experienced the same situation like most of the international students in finding ways to build credit history below i list out some possible approaches you may want to consider i. get a student job at campus recommended i think the best way is to get a student job in university say a teaching assistant or student helper in this case you can be provided with a social security number and start to build your own credit history ii get credit card you can also consider to apply for a credit card there are indeed some financial institutions that can provide credit cards for international students with no or limited credit scores requirement say discover and bank of america however it is relatively hard to get approved simply because hey may put more restriction in other aspects for example you may be required to keep sufficient bank balance above several thousand dollars during a period of time or you should prove that you have relatives with citizenship in us who can provide your financial aid if needed iii apply for a loan recommended getting a loan product is another alternative to get out of this difficult situation but most of people do n’t realize that there are some fintech start ups in united states that specifically focus on international loan financing one representative example is an online lending company that specializes in providing car loan for international students with no ssn or credit history i once used their loan product to finance a honda accord and reported my loan transaction records to us credit bureau during my repayment process later when i officially got my ssn number i found my credit history has been automatically and i do n’t have to start from all over again it never be an easy journey for international students to build credit history in united states what approach you should make really depends on you own situation i hope the information above can be useful and good luck for your credit journey

yes eligibility for contributing to a roth ira is determined by your modified adjusted gross income magi which is based on your adjusted gross income agi now agi includes the net capital gains from your transactions and magi adds back in things that were subtracted off e.g. tuition deductions foreign earned income exclusion in arriving at the agi there is a worksheet in publication 590 that has the details you are always entitled to contribute to a traditional ira the magi affects how much of your contribution is tax deductible on that year 's tax return but not your eligibility to contribute   both the above paragraphs assume that you have enough compensation wages salary self employment income to contribute to an ira the contribution limit is $ 5500 or total compensation whichever is smaller if you earned only $ 2 k as wages you can contribute all of it not just your take home pay which is what is left after social security and medicare taxes federal taxes etc have been withheld from that $ 2 k if your entire income is from capital gains and stock dividends you can not contribute to any kind of ira at all

the whole point of a credit report and by extension a credit score is to demonstrate and judge your ability to repay borrowed funds   everything stems from that goal available credit payment history collections etc all serve to demonstrate whether or not you personally are a good investment for lenders to pursue revolving credit balances are tricky because they are more complicated than fixed loans for the rest of this answer i 'll just talk about credit cards though it also applies to lines of credit such as overdraft protection for checking accounts helocs and other such products having a large available balance relative to your income means that at any time you could suddenly drown yourself in debt   having no credit cards means you do n't have experience managing them and personal finances are governed largely by behavior meaning experience is invaluable   having credit cards but carrying a high balance means you know how to borrow money but not pay it back   having credit cards but carrying no balance means you do n't know how to borrow money or you do n't trust yourself to pay it back ideally lenders will see a pattern of you borrowing a portion of the available credit and then paying it down   generally that means utilizing up to 30 of your available credit   even if you maintain the balance in that range without paying it off completely it at least shows that you have restraint and are able to stop spending at a limit you personally set rather than the limit the bank sets for you so to answer your question 0 balance on your credit cards is bad because you might as well not have them   use it pay it off rinse and repeat and it will demonstrate your ability to exercise self control as well as your ability to repay your debts

you will want to focus on how much is needed for retirement and what types of investments within the current 401 k offerings will get you there also will need to discuss k investments such as an ira college savings savings for a house and an emergency fund   the 401 k should be a part of your overall financial picture how much you invest in the 401 k depends on the options you have roth 401 k available how much matching some a little or a lot and your family plans   you have a few choices   your company through the 401 k provider may provide this service they may have limited knowledge in what k funds you should invest in but should be able to discuss types of investment fee only planner they will be able to types of investments and give you some suggestions because they do n't work on a commission they will not make the investment for you you need to be able to make the actual selection of investments so make sure you get criteria to focus on as part of the package   commission based planner will make money off your investment choices may steer you towards investments that their company offers or ones that offer them the best commissions in that investment type if the 401 k does n't use funds that the planner can research you will need to provide a copy of the prospectus provided by the 401k. my suggestion is the fee only planner they balance the limited focus of the 401 k company without limiting themselves to the funds their company sells before sitting down with the planner get in writing how they fee structure works a flat fee or hourly fee planner will be expecting you to do all the investment work this is what you want let the fee only planner help you define your plan but also the plan every few years as your needs change

the most likely explanation is as you say that the letter was automatically generated a day or two before you met with your advisor assuming that your advisor is competent they will probably execute the instructions you gave them at the meeting the letter said you had ten days to change the investment and your advisor should be able to do it in that time to be on the safe side since people have been known to forget things i would call your advisor and tell them you got the letter and check they are going to do what you decided i would then follow it with a polite email just saying that you both decided at your meeting on such and such a date to go with the three month plan if that does n't happen you can point to the email as evidence do n't panic about this even though the bank says you are locked in to the decision if an advisor makes a mistakes these decisions are in fact reversible with the advisor paying any penalty
# 224816
littleadv has given you excellent general advice but to my mind the most important part of it all and the path which i will strongly recommend you follow is the suggestion to look into a mutual fund i would add even more strongly   go to a mutual fund company directly     and make an investment with them directly instead of making the     investment through a brokerage account   pick an index fund with low expenses e.g. there are s&p 500 index funds available with   expenses that are a fraction of 1 however many also require minimum investments on the order of $ 2500 or $ 3000 except for ira accounts   at this time your goal should be to reduce expenses as much as possible because expenses whether they be in brokerage fees which may be directly visible to you or mutual fund expenses which are invisible to you are what will eat away at your return far more than the difference between the returns of various investments

another possibly significant issue is that the number ten thousand is very important in the japanese language   in japanese you count in ones tens hundreds thousands ten thousands but instead of a hundred thousand you have ten ten thousands   and then one hundred ten thousands and then a thousand ten thousands    the ten thousand yen note equivalent roughly to the $ 100 bill is the main base of japanese currency   if you go to the bank for example you will almost always take out your money in ten thousand yen notes    knowing a little about the language i would say it would become quite strange and un natural to suddenly start using a hundred as the main note value   i doubt the japanese people would ever even consider that and my guess is the only people who are even put out by the large number of zeroes are foreigners who are used to dealing in dollars and cents

i sell gas to gas stations your profit is n't much in gas it 's in the convenience store so if you 're going to do it focus on your store here in the midwest we have a brand of stations called everyone loves these gas stations and will go out of their way if they need gas because they 're very clean and the workers are friendly   do n't build a branded station right now branded gas is cheaper than wholesale in a lot of markets but that 's not usually typical it 's better to have options and not be locked into a bp station where you can only buy their gas no matter the price additives are bs it 's a commodity    operating capital will be fairly high   roughly per truck at say 3.00 cents gal is about $ 22,500 in a high traffic area you could be pulling 1 truck per day to keep supply full this is an assumption based on what we sell to customers do some math and that 's quite a bit of operating capital can you finance that we set credit limits on our customers but they 're not high think 50 100k for small stations which is only a couple truck loads   i do n't think it 's a terrible business to be in but i would almost rather own the trucks hauling gas to your station and charging on the gallon or on the supply side of the equation where gas is more profitable

now a days your stocks can be seen virtually through a brokerage account back in the days a stock certificate was the only way to authenticate stock ownership you can still request them though from the corporation you have shares in or your brokerage it will have your name corporation name and number of shares you have you have to buy shares of a stock either through a brokerage or the corporation itself most stock brokerages are legit and are fdic or sipc insured but your risks are your own loses the $ 10 you are referring to is the trade commission fee the brokerage charges when you place an order to buy or sell a stock the brokerage will charge you $ 10 so for example if you bought 1 share of a $ 20 stock the total transaction cost will be $ 30 depending on the state you live in you can basically starting trading stocks at either 18 or 21 you can donate gift your shares to virtually anyone when you sell a stock and experience a profit you will be charged a capital gains tax if you buy a stock and sell it for a gain within 1 year you will taxed up to 35 or your tax bracket but if you hold it for more than a year you will taxed only 15 or your tax bracket

i feel like you did n't actually read your agent 's agreement which should say where the money actually comes from you sign it so that your agent can get paid by the listing agency from the net brokerage fees which the buyer pays in the united states real estate agents are prohibited from being paid a commission directly by the consumer citation the agreement will say exactly where your agent 's money is going to come from typically the listing agency receives the broker fees from the seller and then pays both the seller 's agent and the buyer 's agent from that it means both agents have to split the fee if for some reason the seller wo n't pay the buyer broker can i just not purchase the house pretty much yes though it wo n't be you saying deal 's off unless they have some really unusual contracts with their own broker if the seller refuses to pay fees their own side of the transaction is going to fall apart and the sale wo n't happen at all leaving you off the hook for your own broker 's fee

tl;dr roth earnings are not necessarily tax deferred but they might be this is a great question because imho the use of the wording tax deferred is slightly misleading when talking about a roth ira and roth 401k too the phrase tax deferred actually means you save tax now and you pay tax later i.e. you defer the tax as you pointed out this is the normal terminology used for describing a traditional ira/401k earnings on a roth ira are tax free not deferred but only if your distributions are qualified for the most part distributions are considered qualified if you wait until you are 59.5 years old before taking the money out but there are some exceptions if you choose to distribute more than your contributions meaning you are now taking out earnings the earnings are tax free only if your distribution is qualified for example if you take out the earnings before you are 59.5 and no other exceptions apply then you would pay tax on the earnings and also a 10 penalty so perhaps a better way to say it is that earnings in a roth ira are tax deferred

i 'll add this to others having non deductible portion in your ira requires additional tax forms to be attached to your tax return and tracking if you plan to have long term investments in your non deductible ira such as say target funds or long term stock positions that you expect to hold till retirement it may be better to keep them in a non ira account this is because the income tax on the withdrawals from the ira is at ordinary rates and from the regular investment account is at capital gains rate while the rates can definitely change traditionally capital gains rates are significantly lower than the ordinary income bracket rates so generally i think that having non deductible ira deposits is only useful if you 're planning a roth conversion in a near future

today typically a business needs to hold accounts in more than one currency banks in certain countries are offering what is called a dual currency account it is essentially 2 accounts with same account number but different currency so one can have an account number say and have it in say aud and usd so the balance will always show as x aud and y usd if you deposit funds electronic check or cash in usd your usd balance goes up likewise at the time of withdrawal you have to specify what currency you are withdrawing interest rates are calculated at different percentage for different currencies   so in a nutshell it would like operating 2 accounts with the advantage of remembering only one account number designate a particular currency as default currency so if you do n't quote a currency along with the account number it would be treated as default currency otherwise you always quote the account number and currency of course bundled with other services like free fx advice etc it makes the entire proposition very attractive edit if you have aud 100 and usd 100 if you try and withdraw usd 110 it will not be allowed unless you also sign up for a auto sweep conversion   if you deposit a gbp check into the account by default it would get converted into aud assuming aud is the default currency

it is unlikely that the plan is worth doing given the numbers you have used however your thinking is correct that given enough of a rate differential it could be worth doing consider that for each $ 100k of your mortgage and i assume your limit for an unsecured personal loan is likely far less than 100k you would save only $ by taking out a personal unsecured loan of 3 and paying off your mortgage instead such low unsecured rates may be a signal that it would be worthwhile for you to renegotiate your mortgage you will likely need to pay a fee but the savings could be significant   for each $ 100k of mortgage a 1 rate change from your current rate saves you 1k per year so if you can get a mortgage rate of 2 which may be possible if an unsecured loan costs you 3 compare the initial administrative fee against those savings over the course of the term of the ie $ 300k saves you 9k over 3 years so would be well worth even an initial $ 3k admin fee

you can split payments and nobody judges you because most prepaid cards are actually gift cards   they just think you have generous friends    when you use visa mc at a vendor they get dinged around 2 3 plus 35 cents flat rate   so when you ask them to charge 77 cents to the card you 're essentially asking they give half of it to visa mc   which is unfair   a charity wo n't turn it down but it 's wasted   so how do you solve this problem   if you see a small merchant using square or paypal here their merchant agreements charge a flat rate 2.75 and respectively with no flat rate per transaction   if you see they are on paypal square go for it    obviously paypal itself does n't have that problem because they have a really really good deal with visa and mastercard   so feel free to buy yourself credit on your paypal account with these residual values    amazon probably has a similar deal    you are getting these small amounts because you aim to pay a $ bill with a card that has $ 25 on it   reasonable but it causes this    flip it around pay a $ bill with a card that has $ 20 on it consume the $ 20 value and pay the $ in cash   you may need to tell the cashier exactly the amount to charge e.g. $ 20.00 especially if it is a visa mc card   it will certainly go faster if you do   the cashier may be able to pull up the balance but it 's an extra procedure and an inexperienced cashier may struggle with it have to call the manager etc not worth it in my book

allen welcome to money se you 've stumbled into the issue of debt snowball which is the low balance method of paying off debt the other being high interest i absolutely agree that when one has a pile of cards say a dozen there is a psychological benefit to paying off the low balances and knocking off card after card i am not dismissive of that motivation personal finance has that first word personal and one size rarely fits all for those who are numbers oriented it 's worth doing the math a simple spreadsheet showing the cost of the ds vs paying by rate   if that cost is even a couple hundred dollars i 'll still concede that one less payment envelope stamp etc favors the ds method on the other hand there 's the debt so large that the best payoff is 2 or 3 years away during that time $ 10000 paid toward the 24 card is saving you $ vs the $ 500 if paid toward 5 debt hard core do n't even want to discuss the numbers strangely enough   in your case you do n't have a pile of anything the mortgage is n't even up for discussion you have just 2 car loans send the $ 11,000 to the $ 19 k loan carrying the 2.5 this will save you $ 500 over the next 2 years vs paying the zero loan down once you 've done that the remaining $ 8000 will become your lowest balance and you should flip to the debt snowball method which will keep you paying that debt off   ds is a tool that should be pulled out for the masses the radio audience that the david dave ramsey radio show host appeals to they may comprise the majority of those with high credit card debt and have greatest success using this method but you exhibit none of their symptoms and are best served by the math by bringing up the topic here you 've found yourself in the same situation as the guy who happens to order a white wine at a wedding and finds his cousin offering to take him to an aa meeting the next day   in past articles on this decision i 've referenced a spreadsheet one can download it offers an easy way to see your choice without writing your own excel doc for the situation described here the low balance total interest is $ vs $ for the higher interest not quite the $ 500 difference i estimated the $ 350 difference is low due to the small rate difference and relatively short payoffs in my opinion knowledge is power and you can decide either way what 's important is that if you pay off the zero interest first you can say i knew it was a $ 350 difference but i 'd rather have just one outstanding loan for the remain time my issue with ds is when it 's like a religion and followers are told to not even run the numbers i wrote an article thinking about dave ramsey a number of years back but the topic never gets old

as mhoran said the risks of buying a bankrupt company are huge and even successful bankruptcy do n't involve keeping the same stock for instance the gm bankruptcy was resolved by the company more or less selling all its valuable assets brands factories inventory to a new version of itself using that money to pay off what liabilities it could and then dissolving the new company then issued new stock and you had to buy the new stock to see it rise the old stock became worthless aa could have gone the same way delta could have bought it out of bankruptcy and consumed it outright with any remaining shareholders being paid off at market value that 's probably the best the market was hoping for instead the deal is a much more equal merger brings a very large airport network and aircraft fleet to the table and delta brings its cash an also considerable fleet and network and a management team that 's kept that airline solvent the stockholders therefore expect to be paid off at a much higher per share price either in a new combined stock in delta stock or in cash

i think the idea here is that because of the way mortgages are amortized you can drop additional principal payments in the early years of the mortgage and significantly lower the overall interest expense over the life of the loan a heloc accrues interest like a credit card so if you make a large principal payment using a heloc you will be able to retire those chunks of debt quicker than if you made normal mortgage payments i have n't worked out the numbers but i suspect that you could achieve similar results by simply paying ahead making even one extra payment per year will take 7 9 years off of a 30 year loan i think that the advantage of the heloc approach is that if you borrow enough you may be able to recalculate lower the payment of the mortgage

no do n't bother   you need to decide what you are saving for and how much risk you are prepared to take it would make sense if you wanted the money only in x years and could n't afford to lose say 20 or more if the stock market crashed the day before you needed the cash   typically if you are about to retire and buy an annuity you want to protect your capital   this is n't you at 28 you might be saving for a wedding a deposit on a house possibly for school fees or for eventual retirement   it does n't sound like you need to get back exactly 24k in july 2022 keep the 6 months expenses in accounts that you can withdraw from at short notice   some of this in a current account some might be in a savings account that does n't pay interest if you make withdrawals after that i 'd stick most of the rest in stock market tracker funds but you might go for actively managed funds instead ask another question and take professional advice there will presumably be local tax considerations too and add in most of your monthly savings too   these should beat the 2.3 over the 5 years and you can liquidate them easily if you want to buy a house if there is a recession and a stock market dip you presumably have the flexibility to hold on to them longer for the economy to recover   and if you are intending to buy a house then a recession will probably also involve a fall in house prices so the loss in your savings will be somewhat balanced by the drop in the purchase price of your house of course the worst case scenario is a severe downturn where you lose your job are unemployed for a considerable period of time burn through your emergency fund and need to sell shares at a considerable loss to meet your expenses    you might have family or dependents that you can borrow from or would need to support which would change your tolerance for risk   having money locked away for 5 years in this scenario is even worse   so if you do n't want to put all your non emergency savings into the stock market you still want to choose something that is accessible at a slightly lower interest rate but ultimately it sounds like you can afford to lose some of your savings and the probability is that you will be rewarded with much better returns than 2.3 over 5 years

the securities investor protection corporation is roughly analogous to the fdic for investments   there are some important differences like a lack of 100 guarantee you get all of your funds back the sipc understands you invested knowing there was some risk and therefore you take that same risk in getting your money from a failed brokerage   however there is still a level of commitment and trust that lessen the risk of investing in the wrong place also do not typo the acronym at your work computer   in the us and perhaps elsewhere it is a racist term and you are likely to get some bad search results

there 's not a single answer here as the premium you pay for car insurance depends on multiple factors including but not limited to all these factors contribute to the likelihood of getting into an accident and the expected damage from an accident   so just having an accident and making a claim will likely raise your premium all else being equal but whether or not it will be cheaper in the long run depends obviously on how much your premium goes up which can not determined without all of the facts   your agent could tell you how much it would go up but even making such an inquiry would likely be noted on your insurance record and may cause your premium to go up although probably not by as much however the point of insurance is to reduce the out of pocket expenses from future accidents so the question to ask is how likely am i to have another accident and if i do can i pay cash for it or will i need to offset some cost with an insurance claim   do you risk making a claim and having your rates go up by more than $ 700 over the next 3 4 years the rough time it takes for a surcharge to expire   or do you just pay for the repair out of pocket and keep your premiums lower

damn helpful harry above me    so in general when compounding the value of an investment if you 're seeing an annualized interest rate of 4 and the interest compounds monthly or n number of times per year you 're going to multiply the principal p by the growth rate the interest rate adjusted for the number of periods that your investment grows in a year = p 1 + t where n = number of periods and t = number of years if the interest compounds annually you earn p if it compounds monthly you earn 1 + 1    apply this logic to discounting future cash flows to their net present value when discounting future cash flows you 're essentially the opportunity cost of now being unable to put your investment elsewhere and earning that corresponding interest discount rate    thus you would discount $ 1000 by 1 + and $ 2000 $ 3000 in a similar fashion then as icing on the cake sum up to get your cumulative net present value   please let me know if any portion of my explanation is unclear i would be happy to elaborate

i think the question can be answered by realizing that whoever is buying the stock is buying it from someone who can do the same mathematics ask your son to imagine that everyone planned to buy the stock exactly one week before christmas   would the price still be cheap   the problem is that if everyone knows the price will go up the people who own it already wo n't want to sell   if you 're buying something from someone who does n't really want to sell it you have to pay more to get it   so the price goes up a week before christmas rather than after christmas but of course everyone else can figure this out too   so they are going to buy 2 weeks before but that means the price goes up 2 weeks before rather than 1 week   you play this game over and over and eventually the expected increased christmas sales are priced in   but of course there is a chance people are setting the price based on a mistaken belief so the winner is n't the person who buys just before the others but rather the one who can more accurately predict what the sales will be this is why insider trading is so tempting even if it 's illegal   the price you see right now represents what people anticipate the price will be in the future what dividends are expected in the future how much risk people think there is and how that compares with other available investments
