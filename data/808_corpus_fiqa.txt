if you are just barely scraping by on your current income then you should n't be thinking about buying a car or house unless you can present at least to yourself clear evidence that doing so will actually lower your monthly expenses yes there are times when even buying depreciating assets such as a car can lower your expenses but you need to think hard about whether that is the case or if it is just something you want to get because you feel you should remember the old adage that rich people buy themselves income streams investments that either earn money or reduce expenses while poor people buy expenses if you are in the situation of barely scraping by on your current income then the first step in my mind is to find out exactly what you are spending your money on do this for a month or two and then try to include non regular or rarely bills such as subscriptions insurance perhaps utilities and so on once you know where your money is going right now outline that in a budget at this point you are n't judging your spending but rather simply looking at the facts once you have a decent idea of where your money is going only then try to think about what you can cut back on some things will be easier than others to change it 's much easier to cancel a premium tv channels package than to move to cheaper living quarters for example although in some cases simply picking the low hanging fruit alone wo n't help you make a revised budget for the next month based on the new numbers and try to live by it keep writing down what you actually spend your money on then rinse and repeat of course you can make a budget for whatever period of time works for you if you get paid every two weeks budgeting per two weeks might be easier than budgeting per month the bottom line is that a budget is useless without a follow up process to see how well your spending actually matches the budgeted amounts so you need to spend some time following up on it and making adjustments no budget will ever match reality exactly think of the budget as a map not a by guide for getting from a to b. when you find some wiggle room in your budget for example let 's say you decide to cancel the premium tv channels package you got some time ago because it turns out you are n't watching much tv anyway do n't put that money into a discretionary spending category there is an old rule in personal finance that says pay yourself first if you are able to find $ of wiggle room put it into savings of some kind if you are unsure what kind of savings vehicle you should use i 'd suggest starting off with a simple savings account it certainly wo n't earn you a great return you 'll be lucky if you can keep up with inflation but it will get you into the habit of saving which at this point is a lot more important and make that savings transfer as soon as the money hits your account if you can get the depositor to put a portion of your income directly into the savings account if you can not make the transfer yourself immediately afterwards and try to force yourself to live with the money that 's left not touching the savings account ideally you should save a decent fraction of your income i 've seen figures everywhere from 10 to 25 of your after tax income recommended by various people and start out by budgeting that to savings and then working with whatever is left in practice saving anything and putting the money anywhere is much better than saving nothing just make sure that the savings are liquid easy to convert to cash and withdraw without a penalty should the need arise set up a regular bank transfer for whatever amount you can find in that budget and try to forget about it until you get the bank statement for the savings account and get that warm fuzzy feeling for actually having a decent amount of money set aside should something ever happen making you need it then later you can decide whether to use the money to buy a car start a company take early retirement or something entirely different having the money will give you the options and you can decide what is more important to you yourself just keep on saving

you need a budget you need to know how much you make and how much you spend   how much you earn and what you choose to spend you money on is your choice   you have your own tolerance for risk and your own taste and style so lifestyle and what you own is n't something that we can answer the key to your budget is to really understand where you money goes   maybe you are the sort of person who needs to know down to the penny maybe you are a person who rounds off   either way you should have some idea how should i make a budget and how can i come up with a good personal daily budget once you know what you budget is here are some pretty standard steps to get started   each point is a full question in of itself but these are to give you a place to start thinking and learning you might have other priorities like a charity or other organizations that go into your priority like regardless of your career path and salary you will need a budget to understand where you money is where it goes and how you can reach your goals and which goals are reasonable to have

there is no good proxy for vix because it is a completely made up value most listed options trade on an underlying security   i can therefore choose to buy either the stock or a future or option on that stock   in this way the future and option are derivatives in that they derive their value in part based on something else in this case the stock price as of now vix is a different entity altogether   it is based on the volatility of the market using market expectation of near term volatility conveyed by stock index option prices   but the faq goes on to state that they are adding factors into the formula so right away there is no one equity stock that you can hold that will necessarily match the vix in any significant way because it is not directly based on stocks but indirectly through other options and computations in effect therefore the vix in indeed only available through its options and is not observable tradable in and of itself

@joetaxpayer 's answer outlines how to value it some other considerations as i understand it some public pensions may be tax free if you still live in the state that is paying the pension e.g. when a massachusetts teacher receives pension it is exempt from state taxes but if that person moves to vermont he will have to pay vermont income tax on those payments so if you plan to stay in the state post retirement this provides additional value pension payments are n't fully guaranteed by the pbgc and not all pension plans are fully funded depending on the political and economic environment when you hit retirement your retirement plan could suffer and if you are n't working you may not have a union vote any more when the other working members are voting on contract amendments that affect pensions i 'm not certain of all of the rules but i hear news reports from time to time that formulas like what you 've posted in the original question are changed through negotiation with the union if you make an employment decision using the formula in year x and then the formula changes in year your expected pension payment will change

based on my experience hiring working with a fortune 500 company legal team to make hiring decisions i do n't believe anything illegal necessarily happened   you 're allowed to discriminate against that list all the time like when hiring a model an actor or a pastor that have to be a specific age gender ethnicity religion etc or other jobs that require it   and yes any public facing position at an explicitly christian organization does require it   if i call a christian plumbing company i would expect them to send a christian plumber   you can also discriminate against the degree to which someone is religious as well   imagine if you could n't use answers like do you go to church regularly when interviewing a pastor   i worked previously for a christian organization that required many positions to be christians like salesmen and board members   all other internal positions like accountants etc they would not even ask are you christian for legal reasons because it was n't required for the job   so it was either explicitly required in the job description or they could n't ask or take it into account when hiring you

there are very few banks which offer two factor authentication   part of the reason is cost   providing a token to every account holder is expensive not just in the device or system but in providing support and assistance to the millions of people who wo n't have the idea how it works and complain that they no longer have access to their accounts that said it is sometimes available on request for personal accounts and many banks require it for their business clients my hsbc business account comes with two factor as default and it works extremely well there is also the pseudo two factor security offered by visa and mastercard secure which performs a similar function

i know i came a little late to this discussion but let me give you my opinion i think that purchasing the bmw is a terrible investment for obvious reasons once you drive the car off the dealer 's lot the car loses anywhere from 5 10k in value immediately its a terrible investment and something that you will regret in the future however whether you buy it now or you hold off we all know you are eventually still going to get it i graduated college and was in a similar situation as the one you are now i started making 60k after college and leased a brand new bmw like i said it was a terrible investment but i do not regret it for one day i ve had so much fun in that car that i ca n't even begin to explain we only live once and you do n't want to be one of those guys that looks back and says i should 've this i should 've that just do it we all know it wo n't be possible when you have a wife and kids so just splurge now and be responsible later lol

as far as i read in many articles all earnings capital gains and    dividends from canadian stocks will be always tax free right    there 's no withholding tax ie a $ 100 dividend means you get $ 100   there 's no withholding for capital gains in shares for anybody   you will still have to pay taxes on the amounts but that 's only due at tax time and it could be very minor or even a refund for eligible canadian dividends   that 's because the company has already paid tax on those dividends in contrast holding u.s. or any foreign stock that yields dividends    in a tfsa will pay 15 withholding tax and it is not recoverable correct but the 15 is a special rate for regular shares and you need to fill out a w8-ben   your broker will probably make sure you have every few years but if you hold the same stock in a non registered account this 15    withholding tax can be used as a foreign tax credit is this true or    not or what are the considerations that 's true but reduces your canadian tax payable it 's not refundable so you have to have some tax to subtract it from another consideration is foreign dividends are included 100 in income no mater what the character is   that means you pay tax at your highest rate always if not held in a tax sheltered account canadian dividends that are in a non registered account will pay    taxes i presume and i do n't know how much but the amount can be used    also as a tax credit or are unrecoverable what happens in order to take into account taxes paid by the company is i read also that if you do n't want to pay withholding taxes from foreign > dividends you can hold your stock in a rrsp or   you do n't have any withholding taxes from us entities to what they consider canadian retirement accounts   so tfsas and resps are n't covered note that it has to be a us fund like spy or vti that trades in the us and the account has to be rrsp   you ca n't buy a canadian listed etf that holds us stocks and get the same treatment   this is also only for the us not foreign like europe or asia also something like vt total world in the us will have withholding taxes from foreign europe asia mostly before the money gets to the us   you ca n't get that back just an mention for the uk there 's no withholding taxes for anybody and i hear it 's on sale but at some point if i withdraw the money who do i need to pay taxes > u.s. or canada canada

since then i wanted to move out of this house because the property taxes are so high and the mortgage payment is a killer as i understand this is a property jointly owned by your parents and you as they are not living staying in the house you have taken over the mortgage payments for this house along with any other maintenance if you move out of this house the rent is expected to cover the cost of maintenance and mortgage payments are we better of staying in jersey where our family and friends are   this is an individual decision it is not just family and friends but also schooling of kids if you change jobs would it also entail changing residence as the workplace would be more near from current home than the new home i want to convince my wife to make this move because it will save us at least 800 month but she fails to see how buying a second home is financially sound because we have to lose our savings and we have to pay interest on our second home there are quite a few posts on first time home buyer some question like this one and this one and this one are good reads there are historically times when the mortgage emi becomes equal or less than rent paid in such times it is good to buy home than pay rent otherwise quite a few invest advisor 's mention that fools buy house and wise live in it there are advantages to buying as well advantages to renting there is no simple answer and it depends on multitude of factors

does such insurance make any sense or is it just wasting money for passengers as with most insurance it depends if you just look at the probability of a payout the cost of the insurance and the payout amount then statistically it will always be better to avoid buying insurance this is because there is a certain amount of overhead in an insurance company like the commissions and salaries you mentioned the goal when buying insurance should be to avoid a cost that you can not afford or is inconvenient to be able to afford for example if your family would be devastated financially by your death then it would make sense for you to buy some sort of life insurance whether or not this particular insurance makes sense for you depends on your financial situation and risk tolerance

you did n't specify where in the world you account is scotiabank operates in many countries however for large amounts where there is a currency conversion involved you are almost guaranteed to be better off going to a specialist currency broker or payments firm rather than using a direct method with your bank such as a wire transfer based on my assumption that your account is in canada one provider who i have personally used with success in transferwise but the best place to compare where is the best venue for you is in the off chance that this is an account with scotiabank in the united states any domestic payment method such as a domestic wire transfer should do the job perfectly well the fees do n't matter for larger amounts as they are a single fee versus a percentage fee like you see with currency conversions

firstly going short on a stock and worrying if the price suddenly gaps up a lot due to good news is the same as being long on a stock and worrying that the price will suddenly collapse due to bad news secondly an out of the money call option would be cheaper than an in the money call option in fact the further out of the money the cheaper the premium will be all other things being equal so a good risk management strategy would be to set your stop orders as per your trading plan and if you wish to have added protection in case of a large gap is to buy a far out of the money call option the premium should not be too expensive something you should also consider is the time until expiry for the option if your time frame for trading is days to weeks you make consider a cheaper option that expires in about a month but if you are planning on holding the position for more than a month you might need a longer expiry period on the option which will increase the premium another option to consider if your broker offers it is to use a guaranteed stop loss order you will pay a little premium for this type of order and not all brokers offer it but if it is offered you will be protected against any price gaps past your guaranteed stop loss price

rebalancing a portfolio helps you reduce risk sell high and buy low i 'll use international stocks and large cap us stocks   they both have ups and downs and they do n't always track with each other international might be up while large cap us stocks are down and vice versa if you started with 50 international and 50 large cap stocks and 1 year later you have 75 international and 25 large cap stocks that means that international stocks are doing relatively well to large cap stocks     comparing only those two categories large cap stocks are on sale relative to international stocks    now move so you have 50 in each category and you 've realized some of the gains from your international investment sell high and added to your large cap stocks buy low the reason to rebalance is to lower risk    you are spreading your investments across multiple categories to manage risk    if you do n't rebalance you could end up with 95 in one category and 5 in another which means 95 of your portfolio is tied to the performance of a single asset category i try to rebalance every 12 months and usually get it done by every 18 months   i like being a hands off long term investor and this has proven often enough to beat the s&p500

i try to think of it as present money and future money   right now there 's still plenty of present wealth crops are growing there 's plenty of rubber steel glass and such being processed people still need toothpaste etc   stocks go way up when there 's expectations in the marketplace for future earnings and production profit   debt is issued read money is created when banks and lenders think production and profits will increase in the future   that future profit is what pays for the debt being issued money being created in the present   they essentially borrow from the future to create money today in exchange for a chunk of the future profits     right now there 's so much doom and gloom that everybody thinks future production and future profits will just not be there so nobody lends nobody invests and no money is created and thus money just kinda disappears     at least that 's how i think about it   present wealth vs expectations of future wealth   i 'm probably wrong though this stuff gives me a headache

if you 're able to pop this data into excel you can quickly calculate the solution every one of these problems boils down to interest rate term payment present value and future value fv will typically be zero excel has a formula to calculate any of these components based off of the other inputs    in this case the given information is interest rate   term 36 months monthly pmt $ 350 present value    you can use the = pv formula and input the other known values one caveat is that you 'll need to adjust the interest rate to account for the monthly compounding so the formula would be = this gives a result of $ which is the amount you 'd be able to borrow all of these can also be solved on the + but i do n't have my old calculator on me to walk through the steps   to calculate the total interest paid you would then find out how much you 'll be paying over the life of the loan if your monthly payment is $ 350 for 36 months the total amount you 'd pay is $ 12,600 $ 350 36 subtract the $ calculated in step one and you are left with $ worth of interest    hope that makes sense let me know if you want me to go over any of the steps in more detail as a former finance student i would highly recommend locking down the tvm functions as they will pop up quite often throughout your schooling career    best of luck

dumb coder has already given you a link to a website that explains your rights the only thing that remains is how to execute the return without getting more grief from the dealer though the legal aspects are different i believe the principle is the same i had a case where i had to rescind the sale of a vehicle in the us i was within my legal rights to do so but i knew that when i returned to the dealership they would not be pleased with my decision i executed my plan by writing a letter announcing my intention to return the vehicle the relevant laws involved with a space at the bottom of the letter for the sales person to acknowledge receipt of the letter and indicate that there was no visible damage to the car when the vehicle was returned i printed two copies of the letter one for them to keep and one for me to keep with the signed acknowledgement of receipt as expected they asked me to meet with the finance manager who told me that i would n't be able to return the car i him for meeting with me and told him that i would be happy to meet in court if i did n't receive a check within 7 days that was his obligation under the local laws that applied

in addition to the two options in your question pay off the entire loan depleting your emergency fund or continue as you are today there is a third middle ground option that might be worth considering since you currently have an emergency fund zero credit card debt and you stated we can afford these expenses i think i 'd be correct to assume that you 're currently making regular contributions to either the emergency fund itself or to another savings account etc temporarily stop making those contributions and divert those funds to make larger payments towards the upside down loan the additional amount will all be applied to the loan principal reducing the interest you 'll have to pay but you 'll avoid the risk of depleting the emergency fund additionally the insurance premium may possibly be avoided as in many places in the world it 's possible to de register the car for example in california usa you can submit an affidavit of non use then terminate the insurance on it however the car will likely have to be parked off street or in a location such as a private road governed by rules that do not include legal registration requirements

i know this an old thread but one that caught my interest as i just moved to the usa from australia as per the op i had never written a check in my whole life and upon arriving in the us i was surprised as to their in australia pretty much all bills you receive can be paid in a number of ways   for small amounts between friends cash is probably used most but for larger amounts direct transfer is popular your friend landlord will give you their bank account number and number which identifies their bank and then you transfer the money in we do n't have a ssn like some other countries cheques are still used by some however esp by the older generations now that i 'm in the us initially i had tried to set up direct transfer to pay my rent however the bank has a $ 1000 daily transfer limit i contacted the bank to get this increased however i was informed that this limit applies to all accounts at the bank i asked how do people pay their rents with this low limit and was told that most people used cheques this explains the strange look i got from my landlord when i asked for their bank account details so i could pay the rent i now have some bills to pay here and i use online banking you enter the biller 's name and address and then the bank actually prints off a cheque and posts it to the biller on your behalf my first couple of pays here were also cheques which were the first actual paychecks i had ever received

in the case of mutual funds net asset value nav is the price used to buy and sell shares nav is just the value of the underlying assets which are in turn valued by their underlying holdings and future earnings so if a fund hands out a billion dollars it stands to reason their market cap is a billion dollars less shareholder 's net worth is equal in either scenario but after the dividend is paid they are more liquid for people who need investment income to live on dividends are a cheap way to hold stocks and get regular payments versus having to sell part of your portfolio every month   but for people who want to hold their investment in the market for a long long time dividends only increase the rate at which you have to buy for mutual funds this is n't a problem you buy the funds and tell them to reinvest for free so because of that it 's a prohibited practice to sell dividends to clients

start with his website specifically his seven steps most everything else is around motivating people to actually do the plan as he often says personal finance is 80 personal and 20 finance by which he means that things that make sense financially paying off high interest debt first do n't necessarily motivate action so instead pay off the smallest debt first to get motivation really the rest is details around those seven concepts on his site there is a link to a free one hour podcast for the ipod and you can pay for the full three hours of his radio show on podcast he started on radio and it is probably his best format the reason dave ramsey has limited appeal beyond the us is that he is explicitly he views his system as an extension of his christian beliefs that sells very well in parts of the us but does n't port very well there is actually nothing religious in his program other than the occasional reference to biblical verses in an attempt to tie his program into his religion but people who are really interested and want to teach his program not just practice it are going to find they need to be an or at least a christian to fit in addendum i should mention that dave ramsey is changing the program and i expect it will trickle into other things to be more explicitly although apparently not overtly religious and have a stronger emphasis on budgeting see here

i do n't have as strong of feelings as others here do i actually like tipping in restaurants servers get paid more than they would getting a higher flat wage at least if they do a good job and i think it does encourage better service i do however dislike when people try to get tips out of every profession and especially something like this where people are and were already making pretty solid least in my area they do and now because a competitor offers it i should start tipping i 'd rather uber decided to give a larger share of the profits to their drivers or even to very slightly up the prices fact of the matter is there is n't really much of a difference between uber drivers in my experience with the rare big fuck up driving or terrible attitude most people are fine and driving someone from point a to point b does n't leave a lot of room to provide exceptional service worthy of a tip very much unlike being a server or something

if you want to do 1 then you should form an investment club this is an entity that is recognized by the sec and the irs   from the sec an investment club is a group of people who pool their money to make investments usually investment clubs are organized as partnerships and after the members study different investments the group decides to buy or sell based on a majority vote of the members club meetings may be educational and each member may actively participate in investment decisions you should do your own legal research on how to organize but i believe that a common way is to form a formal partnership which then provides the legal structure for distributing gains tax liability income and other costs to the members   irs publication 550 has a section on investment clubs from a tax perspective but i 'd definitely recommend get professional help on this in addition to whatever you can read yourself as for 2 i believe that 's illegal unless you 're licensed

in short i suggest you take a look at your w-4 form and adjust it properly and yes you can claim your self as a dependent unless someone else is claiming you but here is a more detailed explanation of how it works how income tax works while most people tend to only think about the tax system and the internal revenue service irs as the month of april approaches it 's actually a never ending process for our purposes a good way to explain how the system works is to give an example of one american income earner we will call him joe the tax process begins when joe starts his new job he and his employer agree on his compensation which will be figured into his gross income at the end of the year one of the first things he has to do when he 's hired is fill out all of his tax forms including a w-4 form the w-4 form lists all of joe 's withholding allowance information such as his number of dependents and child care expenses the information on this form tells your employer just how much money it needs to withhold from your paycheck for federal income tax the irs says that you should check this form each year as your tax situation may change from year to year once joe is hired and given a salary he can estimate how much he will pay in taxes for the year here 's the formula at the end of each pay period joe 's company takes the withheld money along with all of withheld tax money from all of its employees and deposits the money in a federal reserve bank this is how the government maintains a steady stream of income while also drawing interest on your tax dollars toward the end of the tax year joe 's company has to send him a w-2 form in the mail this happens by january 31 this form details how much money joe made during the last year and how much federal tax was withheld from his income this information can also be found on joe 's last paycheck of the year but he 'll need to send the w-2 to the irs for processing purposes at some point between the time joe receives his w-2 and april 15 joe will have to fill out and return his taxes to one of the irs service and processing centers once the irs receives joe 's tax returns an irs employee keys in every piece of information on joe 's tax forms this information is then stored in large magnetic tape machines if joe is due a tax refund he is sent a check in the mail in the next few weeks if joe uses e file or his refund can be direct deposited into his bank account

here is a simple example of how daily leverage fails when applied over periods longer than a day it is specifically adjusted to be more extreme than the actual market so you can see the effects more readily you buy a daily leveraged fund and the index is at 1000 suddenly the market goes crazy and goes up to 2000 a 100 gain because you have a 2x etf you will find your return to be somewhere near 200 if the etf did its job then tomorrow it goes back to normal and falls back down to 1000 this is a fall of 50 if your etf did its job you should find your loss is somewhere near twice that 100 you have wiped out all your money forever you lose the stock market does not in practice make jumps that huge in a single day but it does go up and down not just up and if you 're doing a daily leveraged etf your money will be gradually eroded it does n't matter whether it 's 2x leveraged or leveraged or inverse or anything else do the math get some historical data run some simulations you 're right that it is possible to beat the market using a 2x etf in the short run but the longer you hold the stock the more ups and downs you experience along the way and the more opportunity your money has to decay if you really want to double your exposure to the market over the intermediate term borrow the money yourself this is why they invented the margin account your broker will essentially give you a loan using your existing portfolio as collateral you can then invest the borrowed money increasing your exposure even more alternatively if you have existing assets like say a house you can take out a mortgage on it and invest the proceeds this is n't necessarily a good idea but it 's not really worse than a margin account investing with borrowed money is investing with borrowed money and you might get a better interest rate actually a lot of rich people who could pay off their mortgages do n't and invest the money instead and keep the tax deduction for mortgage interest but i digress remember that assets shrink liabilities loans never shrink if you really want to double your return over the long term invest twice as much money

gt;but suppose all the employers do this so now there are no employer provided health plans   which means the insurance bought by employees must get a whole lot cheaper i guess as there would be direct competition and lots of shopping around   gt and ten or twenty years down the line they 've all just taken advantage so that wages have n't kept up   so the employers suddenly do n't need to compete on the employee marketplace i mean in times with high unemployment not but this is to this in times with high unemployment they do n't need to compete with benefits either i guess   although in reality i agree with you let me offer a different but supporting perspective it is much easier to haggle a salary than to haggle anything else i 've always lived in european countries with different amounts of government mandated paid holidays and i have never ever heard of a person who a week of extra holiday in his package or a vip level additional private health insurance above the basic social security paid one the one that gets people more comfortable hospital rooms and better hospital food etc if people buy it here they always buy it privately not by the employer   or really anything but money the only extra i ever heard about is the private usage of a company car and even that is rare and that has more to do with easier accounting than anything else sometimes people get lunch tickets but that is usually because they are tax free   i do n't know why but it seems to be the general law either the government mandates some non monetary benefit or the employer decides to provide it because of competition but people privately can pretty much never haggle for it not even when they are badly needed strange   a possible explanation business are used to buying stuff with a simple monetary price as a buyer you have no other responsibilities than to pay for example a programming company will not demand that the client gives them a detailed specification they will gladly write one for a price so if anyone comes and tries to sell something and wants anything else but money it gets weird and i figure it is the same for employees

tl;dr sure do your own homework is sometimes a cop out but that does n't mean we should n't do our homework i agree that in many cases this is a cop out by commentators however even if you believe in perfect market efficiency there is benefit in doing your homework for many reasons one of which you already mention in the question different stocks all with the same value might have widely ranging risk another factor that might vary between stocks is their tax consequences high dividend stocks might be a better fit for some buyers than others one stock might be priced at $ 40 because there is a small chance they might get regulatory approval for a new product this might make this stock very risky with a 20 of being $ 150 in 12 months and a 80 chance of being $ 20 another stock might be priced at $ 40 because the company is a cash cow declining in revenues but producing a large dividend of $ 0.40 per quarter low risk but also with some potential tax disadvantages another stock might be priced at $ 40 because it 's a high growth stock this would be less risky than the first example but more risky than the second example and the risk would be more generalized i.e. there would n't be one day or one event that would be make or break the stock in short even if we assume that the market is pricing everything perfectly not all stocks are equal and not all stocks are equally appropriate to everyone sometimes when we hear an analyst say they should have done their homework they are really saying this was a high risk high reward stock they should have known that this had a potential downside and that all assumes that we believe in 100 pure market efficiency which many disagree with at least to some extent for example if we instead subscribe to peter lynch 's theories about local knowledge we might believe that everyone has some personal fields of expertise where they know more than the experts a professional stock analyst is going to follow many stocks and many not have technical experience in the field of the company this is especially true of small and mid cap stocks if you happen to be an expert in led lighting it is entirely feasible at least to me that you could be able to do a better job of doing homework on than the analysts or if you use a specialized piece of software from a small vendor at work and you know that the latest version stinks then you will likely know more than the analyst does i think it is somewhat akin to going to a doctor we could say to ourselves the doctor is more knowledgeable about me than medicine i 'm just going to do what they tell me to do and 99 of the time that is the right thing to do but if we do our homework anyway and research the symptoms diagnoses and drugs ourselves as well we can do get benefits sometimes we just can express our preferences amongst equal solutions sometimes we can ask smarter questions and sometimes we have some piece of knowledge that the doctor does n't have and can actually make an important discovery they did n't know and just like investing sometimes we can also have just enough knowledge to be dangerous and do ourselves harm if we go against the advice of the professionals

not to state the obvious but you realize this can only be done in hindsight sure you can project out to get a range of expected return but the tax laws can change every year your own income changes so your marginal rate will change you may have started with a 7 mortgage and refinanced now to 4.5 so you are far better off than the original plan i 'll repeat what others mentioned for your own home the rent you are not paying is most of your return a $ 100 k home may appreciate at whatever rate 3 5 say but the $ 800/mo rent you do n't have to pay is $ nearly 10 so when you imply that a house merely rising with inflation is a zero real return i 'd suggest that 's far from accurate all other expenses taken into account of course

i think you 're asking yourself the wrong question the real question you should be asking yourself is this   do i want to a give my parents a $ 45,000 gift b make them $ 45,000    loan or c neither the way you are talking in your question is as if you have the responsibility and authority to manage their lives whether they choose bankruptcy and the associated stigma and/or negative self image of financial or moral failure or choose to muddle through and delay retirement to pay off their debt is their question and their decision    look you said that loaning it to them was out because you 'd rather see them retire than continue to work but what if they want to continue to work for all the stress they 're dealing with now entrepreneurial people like that are not happy   you 're about in their lives like you can run it stop it you do n't have the right they 're adults there may come a time when they are too to be responsible for themselves and then you can and should step up and take responsibility for them in their old age just as they did for you when you were a child but that time is not now and by the way from the information you 've given the answer should be c neither if giving or loaning them this kind of money taps you out then you ca n't afford it

if you ca n't find anyone to lend you the shares then you ca n't short you can attempt to raise the interest rate at which you will borrow at in order to entice others to lend you their shares in practice broadcasting this information is pretty convoluted if there are n't any stocks for you to buy back then you have to buy back at a higher price as in place a limit buy order higher and higher until someone decides to sell to you this affects your profit regarding the public ledger this functions different in different markets united states stock markets have an evolving body of regulations to alleviate the exact concerns you detailed but canada 's or dubai 's stock markets would have different provisions you make the assumption that it is an efficient process but it is not and it is indeed ripe for abuse in us stocks the public ledger has a 3 business day delay between showing change of ownership many times brokers and clearing firms and other market participants allow a customer to go short with fake shares with the idea that they will find real shares within the 3 business day time period to cover the position during the time period that there is no real shares hitting the market this is called a naked short the only legal system that attempts to deter this practice is the fail to deliver list if someone fails to deliver that means there is a short position active with fake shares for which no real shares have been borrowed against too many 's allow for a short selling restriction to be placed meaning nobody else can be short and existing short sellers may be forced to cover

we all buy stuff from time to time that only satisfies us for a short time i was able to locate a few expenses that fall under that category i see a lot answers that focus on not getting these things i 'm going to tell you how to at least attempt to have your cake and eat it too if you can get these things without paying for them or by paying pennies on the dollar for them you 'll no longer want to buy them at full price begin by making a list of the items you ca n't stop thinking about   go to your local library and look for relevant items that are on your list if they are not yet available request that the library purchase them and reserve them for when the items come in   yes libraries are usually tax supported but to give back if you ca n't afford to contribute to the library immediately you can still promote their fund raising or book media drive efforts if you do n't mind buying things that may be second hand thrift stores and garage or yard sales can have anything the ones near you may have one or two items on your list of things you were looking for for pennies on the dollar   other items might be things you can share with friends borrow or swap things until you get bored of them if you do n't have a network of friends with shared interests there may be a local or relevant group you can join   the key here is to try to contribute more than you take and you probably have things you do n't need that you can start with trading and do n't keep careful score the upshot is you 'll not only save money but make friends while doing it you can sometimes have your cake and eat it too these recommendations can get you the short term happiness you were looking for without spending the money and when the happiness is gone you wo n't feel like you need to hang on to the item indefinitely you can pass it on for others to enjoy

there are in fact two balances kept for your account by most banks that have to comply with common convenience banking laws   the first is your actual balance it is simply the sum total of all deposits and withdrawals that have cleared the account that is both your bank and the bank from which the deposit came or to which the payment will go have exchanged necessary proof of authorization from the payor and have confirmed with each other that the money has actually been debited from the account of the payor transferred between the banks and credited to the account of the payee   the second balance is the available balance this is the actual balance plus any amount that the bank is floating you while a deposit clears minus any amount that the bank has received notice of that you may have just authorized but for which either full proof of authorization or the definite amount or both have not been confirmed this is what 's happening here your bank received notice that you intended to pay the train company $ x. they put an authorization hold on that $ x deducting it from your available balance but not your actual balance the bank then for whatever reason declined to process the actual transaction insufficient funds suspicion of theft fraud but kept the hold in place in case the transaction was re attempted holds for debit purchases usually expire between 1 and 5 days after being placed if the hold is not subsequently settled by the merchant providing definite proof of amount and authorization before that time the expiration time mainly depends on the policy of the bank holding your account holds can remain in place as long as thirty days for certain accounts or types of payment again depending on bank policy in certain circumstances the bank can remove a hold on request but it is the bank and not the merchant that you must contact to remove a hold or even inquire about one

firstly thank you for taking the time to respond let me see what i can answer to help give you a bigger picture   i am the rental manager but like i say it 's a small unit where the operations team is only 5 strong we all have a hand in everything really and it was my precedent for implementing procedures in the past that triggered them to ask me into looking into this   honestly i do n't think i have much of a budget that being said if there 's a price to anything and i can justify the company spending the money they will be fair   from a personal perspective i never even considered that third party software would be required for this kind of thing if there 's any you could recommend licensed or open sourced that would be greatly appreciated   from what i can tell the people in charge want a process in which we can fully understand from both a service and product standpoint we can use the information gathered from our service feedback to improve ourselves and we can use the information gathered about the vehicles we lease the products so we can market them correctly in the future seeing how the customer feels on the vehicle 's fuel economy performance comfort on the driver downtime etc which can lead us to marketing the vehicles better or influence what vehicles we purchase moving on   for the most part i think the working processes are going to remain the same where the customer support manager will have a more active role in getting these calls visits emails out to the customers and react accordingly   again thank you so much for your help

this article has a section titled do you need an umbrella policy to cover your personal liability risks that says if you have young children for example you might need a policy    because they have lots of friends these little might get into    some and hurt themselves at your home if so you ’re at risk    of being sued do you have people over often do you drive like a or a    do you have firearms on your premises do you have gardeners    and on the grounds all these are reasons why you might    want to own an umbrella policy although many people in the us are homeowners parents drivers etc not everyone falls into these categories for some people as low as the premiums for such a policy might be   the expected cost outweighs the expected benefit the cost of a lawsuit may be extremely high but someone may feel that the chance of a lawsuit being filed against them is low enough to be safely ignored and not worth insuring against i 'm probably not a great example but i 'll use my own situation anyway even though a liability policy probably would n't cost me too much i 'm almost certain that i would n't derive any benefit from it i live alone without children or firearms pet tigers gardeners etc in a 520 sq ft apartment so the probability that something bad would happen to someone on the small bit of property that i rent and that they would file a sizable lawsuit against me is small enough that i choose to ignore it

gt 1 funny how you picked the highest estimate for the us and the lowest estimate for the uk   mea it appears average cost for the us is $ blog guides coronary cost my personal family experience with it is $ 50 k though this means the us costs would have to come down by only 80 to be affordable by us families i still strongly disagree that this could be accomplished by deregulation of any kind and that 's not even considering the loss in quality that would likely accompany such a move   if anyone expresses wishful thinking it 's you   sources man sources there is no argument without facts    gt;i live in a country with uh    well then we 're both operating from a position of ignorance i do n't know what it 's like with uh and you do n't know what it 's like without it in that case all i can do is look at the money the us spends vs everyone else and then look at our national health outcomes vs. everyone else e.g. heart health maternity health life span etc america sucks at both    still have the same problems except that you get a hefty tax increase on top and end up shoving 50 60 of your income down the state 's throat in addition   there are a handful of countries that charge that much income tax but the bottom line is that those countries on the whole still spend less on healthcare than the so while that 10 or 15 of your check that goes towards uh sucks remember that if you were in the us you 'd be paying 20 to 30 to an outside company for insurance plus you 'd have to deal with pre existing conditions and finding doctors in network and jumping all the bullshit hurdles americans do on a daily basis without any of the convenience of having one single system to coordinate those resources    so you 're either paying down the government 's throat or your paying twice that down a private company 's throat it sucks either way but uh mitigates how bad it sucks   and one interesting note i thought you were full of shit about paying 60 in taxes but some places actually do charge that articles countries with the highest taxes in the so you could be right but two interesting correlations about those countries is that they all have uh and they all dominate the top spots in the un 's happiest places in the denmark as worlds happiest country un report    do n't underestimate the stress of living as a regular citizen without the benefit of a strong social safety net

i am a bit confused here as to how a 4 k loan will negatively effect your credit score if payments are made on time   fico scores are based upon how well you borrow   if you borrow pay back on time your score will not go down   perhaps a bit in the short run when you first secure the loan but that should come back quickly   in the long run it will help improve your score which seems like it would be more important to you having the provider finance your loan will probably not show up on your credit unless you fail to pay and they send to collections if the score is so important to you which i think is somewhat unwise then use a credit card   with a 750 you should be able to get a pretty good rate but assume it is 18   in less then 9 months you will have it paid off paying about $ in interest   you could consider that a part of the cost of doing business for maintaining a high credit score   again not what i would advise but it might meet your needs one alternative is go with lending club   with that kind of score you are looking at 7 or so   at $ 500 a month you are still looking at just over 8 months and paying about $ 100 in interest   much less money for improving your credit score edit based upon the comment my understanding is that using a significant portion of your available credit balance is bad for your credit even if you pay your bills on time define bad   as i said it might go down slightly in the short term   in three months you will have almost 33 of the loan paid off which is significantly lower then the original balance   if you go the credit card route you may be approved for quite a bit more then the 4000 which may not move the needle at all   are you planning on buying a home in the next 90 days   if not why does a small short term dip matter   will your life really be effected if your score goes down to 720 for three months keep in mind this is exactly the kind of behavior that the banks want you to engage in   if you worship your fico score which gives no indication of wealth then you should do exactly what i am suggesting

it depends on the relative rates and relative risk ignore the deduction you want to compare the rates of the investment and the mortgage either both after tax or both before tax your mortgage costs you 5 a bit less after tax and prepayments effectively yield a guaranteed 5 return if you can earn more than that in your ira with a risk free investment invest if you can earn more than that in your ira while taking on a degree of risk that you are comfortable with invest if not pay down your mortgage see this article mortgage prepayment as investment for example the borrower with a 6 mortgage who has excess cash flow would do well to use it to pay down the mortgage balance if the alternative is investment in assets that yield 2 but if two years down the road the same assets yield 7 the borrower can stop allocating excess cash flow to the mortgage and start accumulating financial assets note that he 's not comparing the relative risk of the investments paying down your mortgage has a guaranteed return you 're talking about cds which are low risk so your comparison is simple if your alternative investment is stocks then there 's an element of risk that it wo n't earn enough to outpace the mortgage cost update hopefully this example makes it clearer for example lets compare investing $ 100,000 in repayment of a 6 mortgage with investing it in a fund that pays 5 before tax and taxes are deferred for 10 years for the mortgage we enter 10 years for the period 3.6 if that is the applicable rate for the after tax return $ 100,000 as the present value and we obtain a future value of $ for the alternative investment we do the same except we enter 5 as the return and we get a future value of $ however taxes are now due on the $ of interest which reduces the future value to $ the mortgage repayment does a little better so if your marginal tax rate is 30 you have $ 10k extra cash to do something with right now mortgage rate is 5 ira cd apy is 1 and assuming retirement in 30 years if you want to plug it into a spreadsheet the formula to use is substitute your own values note the minus sign before the cash amount make sure you use after tax rates for both so that you 're comparing apples to apples then multiply your ira amount by to get the value after you pay future taxes on ira withdrawals

if you do n't think you 're necessarily going to stay in this area for five years consider another option renting five years is often quoted as the minimum length of time for buying over renting as the costs of the house purchase and the mortgage are significant and if you 're buying a new house every 5 years you 're putting several thousand dollars of fees up front each time   if you do n't assume that house prices will increase as they wo n't necessarily then you can consider these costs say $ for a $ 500k house an extra 1 or so of interest that first year   if you are there 5 years then you 're paying 0.2 extra more or less that 's reasonable but if you 're there only 2 years you 're adding 0.5 to your rate which is pretty significant you wo n't necessarily come out ahead here versus renting renting for a year or two gives you enough time to find out if you do like the area and if you do you buy then with more knowledge of the area and a chance to make a purchase at the right time for you you pay off your loans or at least a chunk of them now save some of the rest and then rethink in a couple of years   if you then do n't qualify for a doctor 's mortgage anymore you just save up the rest of the 20 before making the purchase

both models understand that the value of a company is the sum total of all cashflows in the future discounted back to the present they vary in their definition of cash the gordon growth model uses dividends as a proxy for cashflow under the assumption that this is the only true cash received by shareholders in theory counting cash is meaningless if there 's no eventual end game where the accumulated cash is up amongst the owners the gordon model is best used to value companies that have an established reliable dividend the company should be stable and the payout ratio high will underestimate the value of firms that consistently maintain a low payout ratio and instead accumulate cash there are multiple dcf models a firm valuation measures all cash available to both equity and debt holders a traditional equity valuation measures all cash that can be claimed by shareholders while the latter seems most intuitive and pertinent to a shareholder the former is very good at showing what a company can do regardless of their choice of capital structure a small add on to a firm valuation is the concept of eva or economic value add where the return on capital all capital both debt and equity is compared to the blended cost of capital the dcf model is more flexible optimistic than the gordon in its approach to cash the approach can be applied to many types of companies at every stage in their maturity even if they do n't pay a dividend a simplistic or single stage dcf is similar to the gordon the assumption is that the company is fully mature growing at a rate perhaps just slightly above inflation forever for younger companies a multi stage dcf can be employed where you forecast fairly confident numbers for the next 3 5 years then 3 5 years beyond that the forecast is less certain but assumed to be slowing growth and a generally maturing stabilizing company and then the steady state stage is tacked on to the end you 'll want to check out professor damodaran 's website he addresses all this and so much more and has a big pile of spreadsheets freely downloadable to get you started i also highly recommend his book investment valuation it 's the bible on the topic

you should also examine gross costs the us per capita is paying twice what canada does and is getting worse results lower life expectancy and higher infant mortality not exactly a bargain   a significant part of the rate of increase in costs is likely due to the shifting demographics bulge of baby boomers aging if you look at these topics you 'll see that there 's a a lot more folks in their 50 's than before and nearly one third of lifetime expenditures is incurred during middle age and nearly half during the senior articles   in the report you linked the medical trend reported includes the increases in both price inflation and utilization for 2009 so it 's impossible to say how much medical inflation there actual was i.e. is the cost of a flu shot rising faster slower than inflation which makes the report a bit slimy in that it compares directly against the rate of inflation

gt this seems like correlation and not causation somebody who 'll never overdraw their account wo n't bother getting overdraft protection   i would actually say that makes it a causation rather than merely a correlation   why because people who sign up for overdraft protection are less likely to be careful about their account balances or their spending habits see they have overdraft protection so why worry and therefore more likely to overdraw their accounts and to do so frequently   by contrast people who do not have or reject overdraft protection are more likely to monitor their account balances and control limit their spending in order to maintain a healthy balance   btw i highly doubt this is news to the banks they are almost certainly well aware of the phenomenon which is one reason they promote their overdraft protection

like many things there are pros and cons to using credit cards the other folks on here have discussed the pros and length so i 'll just quickly summarize convenience of not having to carry cash delay paying your bills for a month with no penalty build your credit rating for a time when you need a big loan like buying a house or starting a business provide easy access to credit for emergencies or special situations many credit cards provide rewards of various sorts that can effectively reduce the cost of what you buy protection against fraud extended warranty often up to one year damage warranty covering breakage that might be explicitly excluded from normal warranty   but there are also disadvantages one of the advantages of credit cards easy access to credit can also be a disadvantage if you pay with cash then when you run out of cash you are forced to stop buying but when you pay with credit you can fall into the trap of buying things that you ca n't afford you tell yourself that you 'll pay for it when you get that next paycheck but by the time the paycheck arrives you have bought more things that you ca n't afford then you have to start paying interest on your credit card purchases so now you have less money left over to pay off the bills many many people have gotten into a death spiral where they keep piling up credit card debt until they are barely able to pay the interest every month never mind pay off the original bill and yes it 's easy to say credit cards are great as long as you use them responsibly that may well be true but some people have great difficulty being responsible about it if you find that having a credit card in your pocket leads you to just not worry about how much you buy or what it costs because hey you 'll just put it on the credit card then you will likely end up in serious trouble if on the other hand you are just as careful about what you buy whether you are paying cash or using credit and you never put more on the credit card than you can pay off in full when the bill arrives then you should be fine

well that is another story altogether    i would say that having hk as an international financial center under chinese sovereignty makes it easy for officials within the to launder money outside the country because most people with money in china want to go elsewhere or because they feel uneasy about their chances of being shot for corruption why even xi has his two flats in the grand here   but hk is in trouble because this might not be reason enough

is this subreddit anti mba i think this notion written by the author is nothing new it 's been said a hundred times by those in the valley and has been by thousands more who are not really sure why they are saying it    personally i think when you make such a comment or even support it you need to think about the industry the person wishes to enter if they are going for something in the tech industry fine i 'm not going to argue against that because that industry is build on that seems to run around ridiculous business models aimed at fast exits   did i offend someone in the tech industry with that comment i hope so   now if you 're going into other fields that require some serious capital e.g. medical energy telecommunications then the chances that the person running the company does n't have some sort of advanced degree is very very small these days notice i said these days   chances are that person will have an mba     i have met scores of c suite folks in these startups in the of this country and find it ridiculously rare for anyone to not have an mba or equivalent experience leading a company that has acquired investment   that only exists in the tech industry and even the founders are generally replaced by more experienced personnel   this notion of being against advanced degrees is ridiculous and not supported by any data whatsoever everyone always in on the success stories of entrepreneurs who were able to do it but what folks fail to realize is those stories are a tiny fraction of the entrepreneurs who are able to lead a company through it 's development    long story short if an entrepreneur is looking for serious capital in a non tech related industry they will need to have an mba or advanced degree and/or years of experience in the industry before any investor will take them seriously if they do n't then the investors will request that they do bring on someone who does per the terms of the agreement

gt;since gold in this very simple hypothetical system has absolutely no use other than a store of value it is debt   but gold does have other uses it is a metal that 's used for jewelry it has decorative value exchanging something for gold is like a giving you a stone ax if you do some cave for him   if all the civilization disappeared gold would still have a value different from bank notes   gold is a convenient standard commodity for exchange for several reasons it 's it 's compact it 's easily recognizable all the gold ever mined in the world would fit inside a typical five story apartment building yet it does n't burn does n't spoil can be stored forever different from apples or oranges   gt;these firms would be adjusting their capacity and not sitting on trillions of dollars of currency that ought to be liquid    here s where the difference between actual work that has been performed and a promise make a real difference these companies are sitting on trillions of dollars of promises not products what they have is paper shares bonds debentures whatever    they are unable to transform those papers into products because they lack the manufacturing capacity to do so they do not have a million apples they have a paper where the farmer said he would grow a million apples   overall the corporations in the us have invested heavily in acquisitions of other corporations this trend has been going on for several decades now these papers can not be easily converted into anything useful for the moment they are just there with their nominal value that people agreed upon it 's not easy to turn that investment into production

you 're off to a great start here are the steps i would take 1 pay off any high interest debt 2 keep six to twelve months in a highly liquid emergency fund if the banks are n't safe also consider having one or two months of cash or cash equivalents on the premises 3 rent a larger apartment if possible until you 've saved more the cost of the land and construction will consume a very large portion of your net worth given the historical political instability in that region mentioned by the previous comments   i would hesitate to put such a large percentage of your wealth in to real estate   4 get a brokerage account that 's insured and well known if you 're willing to take the five percent hit to move assets offshore then consider vanguard i 'm not sure if they 'll give you an account but they 're generally acknowledged as an amazing broker in the us with low fees and amazing funds five percent 12,500 is worth it in my opinion as you accumulate more wealth you can stop moving cash overseas and keep a larger mix domestically   5 invest in your business and yourself even more   as far as finding new investment opportunities i would go through the list of all the typical major asset classes and consider the pros and cons fixed income stocks currencies real estate reits own a small business commodities etc

using cash to purchase a home allows you access to certain deals that mortgage buyers can not take advantage of   these are typically distressed properties and need to be moved off the books quickly   think of things like foreclosures and auctions this does not mean that it gives you an advantage with every house on the market   while you may be able to close quickly with cash some buyers may choose to wait for the presumably higher offers of mortgage buyers    there are complications to purchasing in cash then mortgaging to replace that cash   namely how was that cash invested   if one were in mutual funds or stocks with the money one will have to pay capital gains tax on any profit   if those investments increase in value during the time the money is tied up what do you do then   do you buy at the higher value or hold it back and dollar cost average it in

you can either borrow money credit card line of credit re finance your home home equity line of credit loan mortgage etc or you have other invest in your company as equity   they will contribute $ x to get y% of your company and get of the profits   note amount of profits does not necessarily have to equate to percentage owned   this makes sense if they are a passive investor where they just come up with the money and you do all the work   also voting rights in a company does not have to equate to percentage owned either you can also have a combination of equity and debt   if you have investors you would need to figure out whether the investor will personally guarantee the debt of your company recourse vs non recourse   if they have more risk they will want more of a return one last way to do it is crowdfunding similar to what people do on kickstarter   supporters customers come up with the money then you deliver the product   consulting practices do something similar with the concept of best of luck

if you keep the account in your name only and your girlfriend is depositing money into it then she is in effect making gifts of money to you if the total amount of such gifts exceeds $ 14 k in 2014 she will need to file a gift tax return irs form 709 due april 15 of the following year but not included with her federal tax return it has to be sent to a specific irs office as detailed in the instructions for form 709 she would need to pay gift tax as computed on form 709 unless she opts to have the excess over $ 14 k count towards her federal lifetime combined gift and estate tax exclusion   of $ and so no gift tax is due   most estates in the us are far smaller than $ 5 million and pay no federal estate tax at all and for most people the reduction of the lifetime combined is of no consequence   another point for your girlfriend to think about if you two should break up and go your separate ways at a later time you are under no obligation to return   her money to her and if you do choose to do so you will need to file a gift tax return at that time if you will be returning her contributions together with   all the earnings attributable to her contributions then keep   in mind that you will have paid income taxes on those earnings all along since the account is in your name only   finally keep in mind that the i in ira stands for individual and your girlfriend is not entitled to put her contributions into your ira account summary do n't do this or open a joint account as tenants in common no matter how much you love each other she should open accounts in her name only and make contributions to those accounts

i agree that you should consider a shares based dividend income sipp however unless you 've done self executed trading before enough to understand and be comfortable with it and know what you 're getting into i would strongly suggest that as you are now near retirement you have to appreciate that as well as the usual risks associated with markets and their constituent stocks and shares going down as well as up there is an additional risk that you will achieve sub optimal performance because you are new to the game i took up self executed trading in 2008 oh yes what a great time to learn and whilst i might have chosen a better time to get into it and despite being quite successful over all i have to say it 's the hardest thing i 've ever done the biggest reason it 'll be hard is emotionally because this pension pot is all the money you 've got to live off until you die right so even though you may choose safe quality stocks when the world economy goes wrong it goes wrong and your pension pot will still plummet somewhat at least unless you beat the market something you should not expect to do if you have n't done it before taking the rather abysmal as a benchmark all quality stocks right lol from last highs to this months lows and projecting that performance forwards to the end of march assuming you get reasonable dividends and draw out £ 1000 per month your pot could be worth £ k after one year where as with normal stable long term market performance i.e. no horrible devaluation of the market it could be worth £ k going forwards from those 2 hypothetical positions assuming total market stability for the rest of your life and the same reasonable dividend payouts this one year of devaluation at the start of your pensions life is enough to reduce the time your pension pot can afford to pay out £ 1000 per month from 36 years to 24 years even if every year after that devaluation is an extra 1 higher return it could still only improve to 30 years normally of course any stocks and shares investment is a long term investment and long term the income should be good but pensions usually diversify into less and less risky investments as they get close to maturity holding a certain amount of cash and bonds as well so in my view a sipp with stocks and shares should be at most just a part of your strategy and if you ca n't watch your pension pot payout term shrink from 26 years to 24 years hold your nerve then maybe a sipp with stocks and shares should be a smaller part when you 're dependent on your sipp for income a market crash could cause you to make bad decisions and lose even more income all that said now even with all the new taxes and loss of tax deductible costs etc i think your property idea might not be a bad one it 's just diversification at the end of the day and that 's rarely a bad thing i really don't think you should consider it to be a magic bullet though it 's not impossible to get a 10 yield from a property but usually you wo n't i assume you 've never done buy to let before so i would encourage you to set up a spread sheet and model it carefully if you are realistic then you should find that you have to find really really exceptional properties to get that sort of return and you wo n't find them all the time when you do your spread sheet make sure you take into account all the one off buying costs build a ledger effectively so that you can plot all your costs income and on going balance and then see what payouts your model can afford over a reasonable number of years say 10 take the sum of those payouts and compare them against the sum you put in to find the whole thing you must include budget for periodic minor and less frequent larger renovations your tenants won't respect your property like you would i promise you land lord insurance do n't omit it unless you maintain capability to access a decent reserve at least 10 20 k say i mean it it 's happened to me it cost me 10 k once to fix up a place after the damage and negligence of a tenant and it definitely could have been worse but i do n't really recommend you insuring yourself like this and taking on the inherent risk budget for plumber and electrician call out or for appropriate schemes which include boiler maintenance etc basically more insurance also consider estate agent fees which will be either finders fees and/or 10 management fees if you do n't manage them yourself if you manage it yourself fine but consider the possibility that at some point someone might have to do that for you either temporarily or permanently budget for a couple of months of vacancy every couple of years is probably prudent do n't forget you have to pay utilities and council tax when its vacant for do n't forget ground rent you can get a better return on investment by taking out a mortgage because you make money out of the underlying roi and the mortgage apr this is usually the only way you can approach 10 yield but do n't forget to include the cost of mortgage fees valuation fees legal fees etc every 2 years or however long and repeat your model to make sure it is viable when interest rates go up a few percent

the hidden fees in any transfer are usually foreign exchange transfer services are usually the cheapest option for sending money abroad when a conversion is involved they tend to offer ways to get the money to or from them cheaply or for free and they typically offer low or no fees plus much better exchange rates than the alternatives my preferred foreign exchange service is xe trade it looks like they support cad to transfers so you might check them out   in my experience they have not set a minimum on the amount i send although it does impact the exchange rate they will offer   the rate is still better than other alternatives available to me though note that for large enough transfers the exchange rate difference will dominate all other costs   for example if you transfer $ 10,000 and you pay $ 100 for the transfer plus $ 50 in wire fees $ 150 in fees but get a 2 better exchange rate than a free service you would save $ 50 by choosing the non free service

no if you are taking a loss solely and purely to reduce the tax you have to pay then it is not a good strategy in fact it is a very bad strategy no matter what country you are in no investment choice should be made solely due to your tax if you are paying tax that means you made a profit if you made a loss just to save some tax then you are loosing money the whole point of investing is to make money not lose it

the most important thing is not to tell yourself i 'll save more later in my career when i have more disposable income because of two factors 1 you will get raises over your career but unless you make it big it will never really feel like you have extra money you may double or triple your salary over a career but it usually happens in small increments which your lifestyle tends to adjust upwards to meet even though it does n't feel like it 2 later in your career you may have more money to save but now the commodity you have is time your total savings at retirement are going to be influenced in a massive way by both of these factors a good strategy is save something early in your career even if it feels like an insignificant amount then save larger amounts later in your career when you are earning more but have less time for your investments to grow and less tolerance for high risk high growth investments

typically you can chose in the transfer if you want to transfer in target currency or in source currency if you chose source currency the receiving bank for you in india does the conversion and charges the fees if you chose target currency the sending bank does the conversion and charges the fees the advantage is that they offer to generate a defined amount in the target currency so you can pay a bill exactly either way one of the two banks is going to charge you it absolutely depends on the banks which fee is higher from personal experience between europe and the us either direction mostly the receiving bank is cheaper incoming fees are set lower than outgoing i ca n't say for india you need to check with your bank

the cost will be around $ if you do it correctly it in florida and can be over a $ 1,000 if you do it in new york new york is more expensive due to a publication requirement that new york has for llc ’s   the price ranges i ’ve given include filing state fees getting a tax id number ein operating agreement membership certificates registered agent fees and publication fees if done in new york each state also have licensing boards and city fees that are applicable so you would want to also make sure that you are keeping compliant there yearly paperwork to keep the llc running wo n’t be so expensive expect the state to charge a yearly fee and require some basic information to be submitted   i had a quick look at florida and with someone filing it for you expect around $ 200 to $ 250 a year plus registered agent fees   if you are late in florida the penalty is $ 400 so you definitely would want a service that provides compliance calendar notifications to make sure you are on time with fees in regards to bookkeeping and taxes yearly tax filing will start at $ 250 to $ 500 for an llc and move up from there depending on the services being offered and the amount of time of work   i recently referred someone to an accountant that will charge $ 250 to file an almost zero tax return on an llc   i think $ 40 an hour is a little low for a bookkeeper but it all depends on where you are   i know in some major cities expect $ 75 an hour or higher so the expectation in miami and manhattan will probably be more expensive than and if you doing a little business do n’t expect the cost to be too much on the bookkeeping so breakdown $ fl $ 1,000 ny registration of llc + any business license city or other registrations $ 250 yearly fee + yearly registered agent + any business licenses city or other fee $ 500 tax return + bookkeeping fee banks will charge more than a personal account so expect $ 120 a year plus in regards to service i would look at companies that specialize in foreigners setting up   businesses in the us because they will have services designed to help you more than services that primarily specialize with us clients you are going to have some different needs based on not having a social security number or establishing from overseas

my first thought was that it must be due to inflation which causes such differences in many cases since a creditor needs to make back more than the rate of inflation in order not to effectively lose money but it seems that currently has only a very modest rate of inflation about 3 other possible reasons for different credit rates the latter is most likely it means that if debtors are generally poor and are often completely unable to pay back the loan or if there is no effective way to force debtors to pay e.g. when there are weak laws or overworked courts then creditors will lose a lot of money to defaults and have to raise rates to compensate for this

i appreciate your take thank you for responding that s another thing i did nt mention i also have several connections in the welding field that can possibly turn into lucrative careers my cousin has his own rig and crew and makes about $ welding in colorado i ve networked and met a supervisor for the local union and my brother is a structural engineer with the railroad so i have plenty of opportunity to find work and make some money    i guess i m looking a bit too far in the future with the restaurant expansion but it is in the realm of possibility once i ve built up some capital    that being said you re right i should probably focus on welding jobs right now rather than taking a higher risk at least until i can afford to gamble 50 100 thanks again man

well first off good luck getting many rational responses to a hypothetical economics question this sensitive lol    so in the interest of a purely academic exercise and expressly not any form of recommendation or road map for application let 's dig in   you would need to clarify a few things in order to assess the economic impact of adding slaves to your society   1 is the supply of slaves limited   2 is the ownership of slaves limited to a small sector of society or available at large to a wide portion of society   3 do your slaves represent a net increase to population or are you some percentage of your population   4 does the nature of work that slaves are capable of compete directly with or effect the employment levels of your population   5 is the level of and relative cost of automation robotics and artificial intelligence in your society advanced to the point where slaves would even be beneficial   6 does your society have the means of enforcement security and technological or otherwise to control a population of slaves over the long term   7 are other countries namely your trading partners also introducing slaves   8) what are the costs of acquiring housing feeding and maintaining slaves they are not zero cost   its not possible to answer the question without those answers but note that the addition of slaves is most likely deflationary in economic terms as you are increasing productive capacity at an assumed lower cost at the same time you are most likely some percentage of conventional paid workers thereby increasing unemployment which if the phillips curve still applies edges us towards lower inflation or deflation

unfortunately where i live minimum wage is what is available to high school graduates   we have an abundance of minimum wage jobs looking to hire and no and few greater than minimum wage jobs for people right out of high school   and minimum wage is n't enough to support a person here   i think school costs have gone up for more than just loans for everyone   our colleges have administration bloat huge wages for the top few and are being run like businesses rather than schools profit over people   their educational license still stands but they work to increase their profit rather than increase their quality of education   i understand that there is a large blame game going on about why people are poor or undeserving   they are lazy they are drug addicts and   they are entitled   any excuse we can come up with to not help the other guy   the other issue is how we help the other guy   do we hand them money and say go out and succeed   that 's been our current method   but both of these issues again fall to education   if we can improve education so it teaches people how to have an impact on their world how to find something they can do well and how to succeed then we can resolve the other issues   right now our schools teach basic skills math science reading to the extent that the students can past the tests   but the world is not built on math science and reading   they are important but more important are social skills resource allocation and utilization self learning testing and verifying   teach them the basics   we need them   but teach them to be self controlling self responsible people   i know this is part of the third paragraph but i find on the outset we may seem like we have completely different views when in reality it is simply where we put the emphasis not the actual view itself that differs

the history of the jews even outside germany is not a very nice on nevertheless it does not excuse your views on muslims nor should or are the muslims excluded when it comes to hate speech and crimes this year alone there were several raids against the radical muslim the hat speech law is a very good instrument to not have racist group rally against minority 's   muslim jews or otherwise and to go back to the topic which facebook has to respect as well if someone broke the law you have to act and pull that comment which they currently not do nearly fast enough my opinion stays your views are highly racial and not based on facts you are part of the problem because bot everyone is as smart as you i m sincere here a moron heres your speech translates it to beat up all muslims because they are the terrorists and will do so you talked about freedom tolerance and same rights for all if you truly want that you have to forgive and not fight with the same weapons we have something in common regarding our views of the muslim population they actually do have a big problem with antisemitism and this problem needs to be addressed but as you said same rights for everyone so we can not talk shit about them either in germany at the moment the anti islam problem has taken over and reached dangerous proportions that is why i defend this group so much and can not let half truths spread i think we are both a bit tired of this conversation so here is my proposal we say each other a final statement what we wish for the other to consider in the future so i try                  i really would want you to not succumb to simple prejudice please listen to the facts out there and look at the whole picture you said and posted a lot of things which are well known to be right propaganda the sweden thing is a 1a example or half truths like the rise if crimes of germany which us overall true but the rise does not come from rape or violence from immigrants but migration related topics while the right wing attacks against muslims and refugees rose considerably   as it stands i can only describe you as a jewish nazi which i really do not want to but have no choice considering your views sorry that this was not too friendly   i await your reply

if you want to retire in 7 years at age 35 and only currently have 150k and you need to ask this question of how to invest your money risk free then you will not be retiring at age 35 nor buying your house   it is possible to do but not risk free in fact you will need to take quite a bit of risk but you would need to have a detailed plan about how you would go about to achieve this goal what assets you would be investing in and what risk management you would have in place if you have to ask this question all you have is a goal but no plan you probably will need to do plenty of research in the types of investment you prefer and develop a plan to take you to your destination this could take you a year or 10 years depending on how motivated you are in your goals

i can understand why some people like using the razors due to their anecdotal experiences but the razors are essentially guided reasoning with assumptions      if you want to prove something in a rigorous way are usually not acceptable unless they are facts i.e. 5 is always less than infinity 7 is always bigger than 0 odd is even + 1 etc     merely by stating do n't attribute to malice stupidity usually fall under the fallacy of the conclusion       for example if a person a really is stupid and hate another person b he could do everything wrong to make person b suffer under both razors they 'd conclude that person a is just incompetent by proof of contradiction i 've just shown that the result of a model could be different from the truth thus either the model is wrong or the truth is wrong     edit a word

i am a numbers guy the math is great instead of jane was twice her son 's age when he married and is now 1.5 times his age questions in math class i think the math problems should mostly have dollar pound signs in front of them   in general i like the idea of relating to the kids situations as much as possible when my daughter 14 makes a purchase i 'd ask her to be aware of how many hours she had to work to make the money she plans to spend was it worth 4 hours babysitting to buy an ipad case was it worth 2 to buy lunch that we could have made you at home   note the convert price to hours worked is a concept that works great when teaching budgeting to anyone not just kids   the math of tax and discounts for comparison shopping works great as well so long as they understand value a $ 400 at 50 off is n't really a bargain in my opinion    next the math of balancing a checkbook should be high on the list accounting for the checks that did n't clear but are outstanding is beyond many people amazing enough   for the sport fan there are unlimited math problem one can create for game scores stats for the season etc young boys who will fall asleep during a stats class will pay attention if instead of abstract numbers you add goals home runs etc after the numbers   note this question is probably outside the scope of the board no right or wrong answer but i love it as a question in general and if not here i hope it finds a good home

how do treasury auctions work first the us government will issue a notice indicating how much money it would like to borrow below is an actual announcement issued by the treasury department that it will be having an auction to raise $ 23 billion   the announcement indicates the date of the auction march 8th 2011 in the example as well as deadlines for competitive am and noncompetitive am bids if you would like to participate in the auction then your bids must be submitted before these times competitive bid the bidder specifies the maximum price they will pay for the security all treasuries are priced in $ 100 so bids are submitted in terms of buying a security that will repay the owner $ 100 when the security matures $ 100 is the face or par value noncompetitive bid the bidder does not specify any maximum price requirement these bidders are first in line to be issued a bill but they will get whatever price is determined at auction there is a limit of $ 5 million that can be submitted as a noncompetitive bid per bidder per auction for competitive bids any one customer can be awarded a maximum of 35 of the total offering in order to better illustrate the mechanics of the auction let 's go back to the example the table below is a hypothetical list of bids for the $ 23 billion being issued the bids include the total amount the bidder is willing to purchase as well as the maximum price the bidder will pay based on a $ 100 par value note bid 1 $ 5 billion max price do n't care bid 2 $ 10 billion max price do n't care bid 3 $ 5 billion max price $ 98 bid 4 $ 5 billion max price $ 95 bid 5 $ 10 billion max price $ 92 bid 6 $ 5 billion max price $ 90 notice there is a total of $ 40 billion in bids the auction is only for $ 23 billion this means some bids will go unfilled the ratio between bids and the amount of the auction is called the bid to cover ration for our example it is $ a high bid to cover ratio indicates a strong demand for the bonds since there are a lot of bidders a low ratio indicates weak demand a ratio under 2.0 is considered weak the bids are filled in the following manner results of our example auction bid 1 $ 5 billion max price noncompetitive all $ 5 billion filled at $ 95 bid 2 $ 10 billion max price noncompetitive all $ 10 billion filled at $ 95 bid 3 $ 5 billion max price $ 98 all $ 5 billion filled at $ 95 bid 4 $ 5 billion max price $ 95 only $ 3 billion filled at $ 95 bid 5 $ 10 billion max price $ 92 not filled bid 6 $ 5 billion max price $ 90 not filled once the auction is completed the treasury will post the results of the auction below is the actual results of the auction   there are some additional items that are reported from the auction high rate this is the highest yield or the lowest price that was accepted at the auction for our example this would be $ 95 allotted at high this is the percentage of the total that was filled at the highest accepted yield or lowest accepted price for our example the last $ 3 billion we filled was at the lowest price so our allotment at high would be $ = 13 price price as determined by the auction median rate half of the competitive bids were submitted below this rate while the other half were above low rate the lowest yield or highest price submitted for the competitive bids the announcement also shows the breakdown of the amount of bids submitted versus competitively and how much was rewarded for those same categories there is an entry in the middle of the results announcement listed as this stands for system open market account this represents treasuries that are held by the federal reserve if the federal reserve has treasuries that are maturing then it is expected that they will use the proceeds from those maturing treasuries to buy new treasuries for our example auction the fed had no bills maturing at the time if they did then the fed would also get the same price determined at the auction here is an article i wrote with a little more detail on the auction process   i 've included my sources at the end of the article as for treasuries being a safe investment   i 'm not so sure   right now the yield on 10 years is around 2.5   who in their right mind would lend money to the government for 10 years at 2.5   not me

i 've been prompted to turn my comments into an answer   disclosure i am a realtor i work for an investor for whom an offer on a house he will buy describes him as a cash buyer this phrase most often means one of two things   the buyer has funds that are liquid enough to either wire the cash or produce a cashier 's check in some number of days a week or two would be common and not wait for another house to sell the other point of this is that the seller is not willing to finance the property the flip side being that the seller will take a down payment and let the buyer pay over time   i am nearly 54 and i 'm open to the fact that language changes definition follows usage in personal finance we refer to a stock bond cash mix here the word cash simply means money such as money market or short term t bills a mix does n't mean i have a of cash under my bed for that 10   to answer the op i 'd ask the seller does cash mean keep in mind when a seller has a buyer who needs to sell their home first there can be a chain going a few levels when it 's turtles all the way down it becomes too risky to the seller   no you are not out of luck i 'd open a dialog with the seller or their agent if any sales is all about understanding what each person 's goal is

firstly it is completely legal for a company to buy its own shares i do n't believe it would be legal to do so secretly it would also be very difficult to do that secretly    so hypothetically we have a company inc. it does n't have any assets other than $ 100 in a bank account and there are 100 shares each owned by a different person each share would be worth $ 1 so the company decides to buy one share now there is $ 99 in the account and 99 shares each share is still worth $ 1 so the company continues to buy shares until there is only one share left and $ 1 in the account if the company buys that last share it will no longer have any assets and will cease to exist effectively dissolving the company   tl dr it is called dissolving the company or dissolution and it happens fairly often with limited liability corporations

i have always found that the free planners are just salesmen pointing you in their best interests not that it wo n't get you a good deal in the processes but in my experience they usually just recommend products that give them the best commission finders fee kickback whatever   flat fee financial planners are not really to my liking either this is a taste thing but generally i feel like now that they have my fee what interest do they have in taking care of me that does n't mean that they do n't give good advise however they may be a good first step percentage based financial planners those that charge a percentage of assets under management are my recommendation the more money they make me the more money they make this seems to work out quite well   whatever you do you need to be aware that financial planners are not just about recommending products or saving money that 's part of it but a good planner will also help you look at monthly budgets current costs liabilities and investments you want to look for someone that you can basically tell your goal to i want to have x amount of money saved for y date for example or i want to reduce my bills by z amount in x months   run from any planner that looks only at the large sum as the solution or only source of money you want a planner that will look at your first house care loans income other investments etc and come up with a full plan for everything   if you 're only trying to invest the new house money and that 's it you 're better off just sticking with google and some research on your own

i strongly doubt that being executor will make the assets of the estate vulnerable to a suit against him personally the estate is it 's own separate legal entity with its own tin only creditors against the estate itself can make claims against it and after all creditors are paid then the balance is distributed in accordance with the terms of the will unless he has commingled assets and treated estate assets as his own the legal separation should be quite strong   whether his personal assets are at risk remember that the opposition will likely overstate their case to try to scare him into settling if the business was organized as an llp or llc his personal assets should be pretty safe if it was a sole proprietorship he has occasion to worry

a common response to poor labour conditions is if you do n't like your job leave and get a better one    however in idaho the state is trying to deregulate aspects of the labour market it 's making it easier for companies to enforce non compete agreements meaning you literally can not leave for a competitor if you do n't like your employer    that 's a natural consequence of labour markets it lets the companies with enormous budgets push around workers who are at the same time having their ability to organise into unions and bargain collectively undermined by companies who use said economic power to lobby against regulations that protect workers    so free market away but do n't convince yourself that a lack of regulation will somehow magically lead to a utopian allocation of resources where everyone gets what they need    in a totally unregulated market the wealth only trickles one way and it 's not down

this is of course a perfectly normal thing to happen people trade up to a bigger house every day when you 've found a bigger house you want to move to and a buyer for your existing one you arrange closing dates for both i.e. the date on which the sale actually happens usually you make them very close either on the same day or with an overlap of a few weeks you use the equity i.e. the difference between the house value and the mortgage in the old house as the down payment on the new house you ca n't of course use the part of the old house that is mortgaged if the day you buy the new and sell the old is the same your banks and lawyers do everything for you on that day if there is an overlap then you need something called bridge financing to cover the period when you own two houses banks are used to doing this and it 's not really that expensive when you take into account all the other costs of moving house talk to them for details as a side note it is generally not to be worth buying a house if you only intended to live there one or two years the costs involved in the process of buying selling and moving usually outweigh any gains in house value you may find yourself with a higher down payment if you rent for a year or two and save up a down payment for your bigger house instead

sales tax and luxury tax is what you will have to pay tax wise and they are non refundable in most cases but the rules vary area to area   this really tripped up some friends of mine i had come from england   the rules are complicated and regional   sales tax is anywhere from 0 to and are not usually applied to raw foods   luxury taxes are usually state level and only apply to things most people consider a large purchase jewelry cars houses etc not things your likely to buy small normal jewelry usually does n't count diamond covered clock probably has a luxury tax for sales tax it can change a lot do n't be afraid to ask people ask all the time it 's normal i personally add 10 to what i buy sales tax in my city is 7 county is 6.5 state is 6 so you can get different rates depending on what side of the street you shop on some times   under normal circumstances you do not get a refund on these taxes some states do give refunds usually however the trouble of getting that refund is n't worth it unless making a large purchase   you are not exempt from paying sales tax depending on where you go you may get asked business are exempt if they are purchasing things to re sell only the end customer pays sales tax   depending on where you go online purchases may not be subject to sales tax though they might that again depends on city county and state laws normally you will have to pay sales tax at the register it will be calculated into your total and show as a line item on your receipt also some products have other non refundable taxes rental car taxes fuel taxes and road taxes are all likely taxes you will have to pay   areas that have a lot of tourists usually but not always have more of these kinds of taxes   friendly note don't buy dvds here they wo n't work when you get home i know you did n't ask but this catches a lot of people same for electronics in many cases specially optical drives and wireless

first my economics professor would kill me if i did n't point out that lowering the price does n't change demand only quantity demanded there 's a pretty big difference between the two   anyway the answer to your question is it depends   you 're hoping that people who do n't buy your sandwich for the original price will start buying it at the lower price you 're also hoping that once you increase the price they 'll continue to buy it the relationship describing how much a change in price affects the quantity demanded is known as elasticity elastic demand means that small changes will have a big affect on buying decisions inelastic demand means that buyers are not very flexible and will continue to purchase even after a significant price increase theoretically at least   the decision to raise or lower a price is a very complex process with a lot of variables so i do n't think anyone can give you a right answer to your question   practically you need to figure out where these extra customers are coming from if they are n't buying your sandwiches now because there 's a cheaper alternative lowering the price might entice them to buy from you instead however this means that when you raise the price back they 'll likely leave again   if they do n't know about your deli or have n't tried your sandwiches yet a change in price is n't likely to do any good without a strong marketing campaign to back it up   the of your product could also have an effect if your product is subway quality at higher prices no one is going to stick around on the other hand if you lace your sandwiches with crack you might get some repeat customers long term loyalty is key   hopefully this rambling helps you it 's late and i need to sleep good luck

a mutual fund could make two different kinds of distributions to you capital gains when the fund liquidates positions that it holds it may realize a gain if it sells the assets for a greater price than the fund purchased them for as an example for an index fund assets may get liquidated if the underlying index changes in composition thus requiring the manager to sell some stocks and purchase others mutual funds are required to distribute most of their income that they generate in this way back to its shareholders many often do this near the end of the calendar year   when you receive the distribution the gains will be categorized as either short term the asset was held for less than one year or long term vice versa based upon the holding period the gain is taxed differently currently in the united states long term capital gains are only taxed at 15 regardless of your income tax bracket you only pay the capital gains tax not the income tax short term capital gains are treated as ordinary income so you will pay your probably higher tax rate on any cash that you are given by your mutual fund you may also be subject to capital gains taxes when you decide to sell your holdings in the fund any profit that you made based on the difference between your purchase and sale price is treated as a capital gain based upon the period of time that you held the mutual fund shares it is categorized as a short- or long term gain and is taxed accordingly in the tax year that you sell the shares dividends many companies pay dividends to their stockholders as a way of returning a portion of their profits to their collective owners when you invest in a mutual fund that owns dividend paying stocks the fund is the owner that receives the dividend payments as with capital gains mutual funds will redistribute these dividends to you periodically often quarterly or annually the main difference with dividends is that they are always taxed as ordinary income no matter how long you or the fund have held the asset i 'm not aware of texas state tax laws so i ca n't comment on your other question

i think you 're missing the point in terms of profit margin the trucks actually pay a larger percentage of their gross in overhead that is their net is a larger proportion of their gross than it is on average for restaurants they pay more for inspections they pay for services and many other things and licenses and permits than restaurants typically pay   what you are proposing is a law that would also bar another brick and mortar restaurant in your own words one that sells the same product for cheaper due to the lack of overhead say for example a chain fast food restaurant   are you saying that new businesses should n't be allowed to open next door to established businesses of the same type or does your argument only apply to food trucks   i am not a flag waving libertarian or anything but i do n't think that choosing which types of business model to protect should be on the list of things that city governments should be doing especially in the case of states like california and texas where the state vehicle code clearly states that the only regulation a municipality may enact on otherwise legal mobile vendor are rules that serve the public health and/or safety not competition   just because some people may not agree with you does n't mean that they are either simple minded or misread your point i understand your argument very well i just do n't happen to agree with it that does n't mean i think you are simple minded either i just think you 're a name calling jerk

the wikipedia page for repurchase agreement has two relevant pointers on this topic   the legal title for any securities used in a repo actually pass from seller to buyer during the term of the agreement in basic terms this means that if one sells a bond on repo with a promise to buy it back then the ownership actually transfers to the buyer for that period of time   if a coupon is paid during this time period it can either go to the buyer or the seller usually the coupon payment goes to the initial owner of the security pre repo our seller but sometimes the repurchase agreement will specify otherwise so again in basic terms usually the repo seller initial security owner receives any payments made during the term of the repurchase agreement both points are in the first paragraph of the section structure and terminology

there is no fundamental good reason i think that 's just how it 's done which is what all the other answers seem to be saying w/o coming out and admitting it just guessing but i 'll bet most of the reason is historical before up to the moment quotes were readily available that was a bit tedious to calculate update the fund 's value so enacted laws let it be done just once per day   quotes the security act of 1940 which certainly has been updated but also still might contain the results of like this there are genuinely different issues between funds and stocks though one share of a fund is fundamentally different from one share of stock there is a finite supply of company x stock and people are trading that piece of ownership around and barter to find an mutually agreeable price   but when you buy into a mutual fund the mutual fund suddenly has more shares it takes your money and uses it to buy shares of the underlying stocks in a ratio equal to its current holdings   as a consequence the mutual fund 's price is n't determined by two people bartering and agreeing on a price like stock there is exactly one sane way to price a mutual fund and that 's the weighted total of its underlying stock   if you wanted to sell your ownership of mutual fund z to a friend at there would n't be any bartering you 'd just calculate the value based on the stated value of the underlying stock at that exact moment so there 's no inherent reason you ca n't instantaneously price a mutual fund   but people do n't really buy sell funds to each other they go to the fund manager and essentially make a deposit or withdraw   the fund manager is only required by law to do it once a day and perhaps even forbidden from doing it more often so that 's all they do disclaimer i know very little about markets and finance but i recognize answers that are just because

he 's definitely right i buy a ton of stuff from amazon and get lots of problems both from amazon.com and 3rd party items i also sell on and basically everyone of my shipments has some problem in the warehouse either items get damaged or lost amazon will typically reimburse it but it 's still a pain   the worst thing that happened though was to a friend of mine he had 2 private label products that were great sellers he sent a shipment in and amazon mixed it up with somebody else 's stuff or something and he got like 100 orders of both products where the customer got the wrong thing because of amazon 's error they eventually paid him for the inventory his product got bad reviews and went from selling 20 + a day to 1 or 2 a week pretty much killed his business

the biggest concern is how you get $ 250,000 in unsecured credit it 's unlikely that you will be loaned that amount at a percentage lower than what you expect to earn unsecured credit lines are rarely lower than 10 and usually approach 20 on top of that for a bank to approve you for that credit line you have to have a high credit score and an income to support the payments on that credit line but lets suspend disbelief and assume that you can get the money you want on loan you would then be expected to pay back that 10 but investments do n't go up uniformly some years they go up 15 20 and other years they go down 10 what do you do if you have to sell some of your investments in a down year that money is no longer invested and you ca n't recover it with the following up year because you had to take too much out to cover the loan payments you 'll be out of money long before the loan is repaid because you can expect there will be bad years in the stock market that will eat away at your investment there were a lot of people who took their money out of the market after the crash of 2008 if they had left their money in through 2009 they would have made all that money back but if you have a loan to pay you have to pull money out in the bad years as well as the good years unless you have a lucky streak of all good years you 're doomed

when you get a loan car home student the lending company bank give the auto dealer previous home owner school money you as the borrow promise to pay this money back with interest   so in your case the 100,000 you borrow requires a payment for principal and interest of per month after 240 payments you will have paid the bank   so who got the in interest the bank did it was used to pay interest to the people who made deposits into the bank it was also used to pay the expenses of the bank salaries retirement rent electricity computers etc if the bank is a company with investors they may have to pay dividends to them to   of course not all loans are successfully paid back so some of the payment goes to cover the loans that are in default in many cases loans are also refinanced or the house is sold long before the 20 30 year term is up in these cases the amount of interest received for that loan is much less than anticipated but the good news is that it can be loaned out again

your maximum risk is 100 if you buy the stock 15 off and your company goes bankrupt tomorrow you 've lost everything it also sounds like you have foreign exchange risk one can debate how much risk this is in terms of expected outcomes but that was not your question however if you purchase the company stock and buy put options at the same time you can lock in a sale price ahead of time and absolutely limit your risk depending on the amount of stock we 're talking about you can buy currency futures as well to hedge the exchange risk you do n't necessarily have to buy the break even strikes you can buy the ones that guarantee a positive return these are probably fairly cheap   note that a lot of companies have policies that prohibit beneficiaries from shorting the company stocks in which case you might not be able to hedge yourself with put options

the definition of a whitepaper varies heavily from industry to industry which can be a little confusing for marketers looking to create one for their business the old school definition comes from politics where it means a legislative document explaining and supporting a particular political solution   in tech a whitepaper usually describes a theory behind a new piece of technology even in the business world there are a variety of definitions some more product centric than others   a whitepaper is a persuasive authoritative in depth report on a specific topic that presents a problem and provides a solution   in information technology a white paper is often a paper written by a lead product designer to explain the philosophy and operation of a product in a marketplace or technology context   here is white paper explained in definition i recommend to create account for they will not send any promotional emails instead you can log in and download as many white papers as you want is also a good option to read latest white papers though it a lot of time to download from their website

i assume you 've no debt if you do then pay that off i 'd be tempted to put the money into property   if you look at property prices over the past 20 years or so you can see returns can be very good   i bought a house in 1998 and sold it in 2003 for about 110 of the purchase price   disclaimer past performance is no guarantee of future returns it 's a fairly low risk option property prices appear to be rising currently and it 's always good to get your foot on the housing ladder as quickly as you can as prices can rise to the stage where even those earning quite a good salary can not afford to buy of course you do n't have to live in the house a rental income can be very handy without tying you down too much there are plenty of places in the uk where £ 60k will buy you a reasonable property with a rental income of £ it have to be near where you live currently just to put a few more figures in if you get a house for £ 50k and rent it for £ 400 a month perfectly feasible where i live then that 's very close to a 10 return year on year   plus any gains made by the price of the house the main downside is you wo n't have easy access to the money and you will have to look after a tenant if you decide to rent it out   also if you do buy a property make sure it is in a good state of repair you do n't want to have to pay for a new roof for example in a couple of years time ideally you would then sell the house around the time property prices peak and buy another when they bottom out again   not easy to judge though i 'd review the trust fund against others if you decide to keep it there as 12 over 6 years is n't great although the stock market has been depressed so it may compare keep some rainy day money spare if you can

say you 're buying a 400 k house your relative finances 120 k 30 say i 'm optimistic but the real estate market recovers and your house is worth 600 k in 5 6 years can happen with the inflation and all the gain is 200k. your relative gets 100k. you repay him 220 k on 120 k loan for 5 years roughly 16 apr quite an expensive loan i 'm of course optimistic it seems to me that so is your relative the question is if the house loses value in that term does your relative take 50 of the losses make calculations based on several expected returns optimistic realistic loss case etc and for each calculate how much in fact will that loan cost it will help you to decide if you want it otherwise your relationships with your relative might go very bad in a few years btw suggestion it 's a bad idea to mix business and friend family you do n't want to lose

it 's not usually apparent to the average consumer but there 's actually two stages to collecting a payment and two ways to undo it   the particular combination that occurs may lead to long refund times on top of any human delays like ben miller 's answer addresses when you pay with a credit card it is typically only authorized the issuing bank says i 'm setting this money aside for this transaction but no money actually changes hands   you 'll typically see this on your statement as a pending charge   only later in a process called settlement does your bank actually send money to the merchant 's bank   typically this process starts the same day that the authorization happens at close of business but it may take a few days to complete   in the case of an ecommerce transaction the merchant may not be allowed to start it until they ship whatever you ordered on the flip side a given transaction can be voided off or money can be sent back to your card   in the first case the transaction will just disappear altogether in the second it may disappear or you may see both the payment and the refund on your statement   can be as fast as an authorization but once a transaction has started settlement it ca n't be voided any more   sending money back a refund goes through the same settlement process as above and can take just as long so to specifically apply that to your question you get the sms when the transaction is authorized even though no money has yet moved   the refund money wo n't show up until several days after someone indicates that it should happen and there 's no reverse authorize operation to let you or your bank know that it 's coming

both of the other posters have some really good points worth remembering about the stability liquidity of a savings account and the often overlooked fact that you can withdraw any money you put in to a roth ira because it 's already been taxed i 'm 28 and found myself in a similar situation as you about a year or so ago i wanted a relatively liquid place that i could store and grow some money cd 's and savings accounts just were n't getting a high enough rate to make a return work for me especially with only a little money to start i would highly suggest checking out a social lending platform like prosper.com or i use prosper.com and this platform will give you some really nice benefits here 's a good article that can explain more about it and get you started just keep in mind that while there is some liquidity here you can resell the notes you invest in generally speaking expect to hold on to those notes for at least 3 years your share of the paid principal gets paid out to you in addition to the interest each month

it is not a riskless transaction as you put it whenever you own shares in a company that is acquiring or being acquired you should read the details behind the deal do n't make assumptions just based on what the press has written or what the talking heads are saying there are always conditions on a deal and there 's always the possibility however remote that something could happen to it i found the details of the tender offer you 're referring to quote terms of the transaction the transaction is subject to certain closing conditions including    the valid tender of sufficient shares which when added to shares    owned by men ’s and its affiliates constitute a majority of    the total number of common shares outstanding on a fully diluted    basis any shares not in the offer will be acquired in a    second step merger at the same cash price as in the tender offer financing and approvals the transaction which is expected to close by the third quarter of    2014 is subject to satisfaction of customary closing conditions    including expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period    under the hart scott antitrust act   both men ’s and    a. bank are working with the federal trade    commission to obtain approval of the transaction as soon as possible essentially there remains a small chance that one of these subject to conditions fails and the merger is off the chance of failure is likely perceived as small because the market price is trading close to the deal price when the deal vs. market price gap is wider the market would be less sure about the deal taking place note that when you tender your shares you have not directly sold them when they are taken out of your account rather your shares are being set aside deposited elsewhere so you can no longer trade them and later should the conditions be satisfied then you will be paid for your shares the deal price but should the deal fall apart you are likely to get your shares deposited back into your account and by that time their market value may have dropped because the price had been supported by the high likelihood of the transaction being completed i speculated once on what i thought was a sure deal a large and popular canadian company that was going to be taken private in a leveraged buyout by some large institutional investors with the support of major banks then the global financial crisis happened and the banks were let off the hook by a solvency opinion read the details here and here what looked like a sure thing was n't the shares fell considerably when the deal fell apart and took about four years to get back to the deal price

it depends on how much diversification you think you need and what your mutual fund options are for instance picking an index fund already provides a fair amount of diversification especially if you select a total market type of index readily available from fidelity and vanguard and many other fund families are you looking to balance domestic vs. international investments you may want to add an international index fund to the mix feel that a particular sector has tremendous potential add a sector fund this investment mix is up to you or your investment advisor however depending on your roth ira mutual fund choices some of these funds may have minimum investment requirement $ 3k to open a fund 's account for instance in that case you 'd have no choice but to put your entire investment into one fund and wait for subsequent years where you 'd be able to invest in other funds after providing additional contributions and/or any growth from your initial investment one thing to look at is whether you have an option of putting some of your contributions into a money market account within the roth ira you can then reallocate funds from that account into another fund after you can meet the minimum investment requirement however in my opinion if you start out by investing in a solid low cost index fund from a reputable mutual fund company you 've already picked up most of the diversification you need a single fund is enough

historically banks are mandated to take relatively safe risks with their money   in exchange they gain a de facto permission to invent new money   they have regulations about what mix of assets they are permitted to own   real estate speculation will be in a different category than a mortgage to someone with good credit second mortgages with a secured asset are pretty safe almost all of the time   that person might stop paying their mortgage but it is secured when that happens the bank gets the secured asset the right to apartment or house or what have you in a sense the bank loses only if both the person paying the mortgage is less creditworthy than they look and the secured asset can not recoup their losses in comparison the person paying the mortgage loses if the secured asset can not recoup their losses the bank is from risk two fold   what more the bank uses the customer to determine what to invest in deciding what to do with money is expensive and hard   by both having a customer willing to put their good credit on the line and doing due diligence on the apartment the bank in effect uses you as a consultant who decides this may be a solid investment   much of the risk of failure is on you so you have lots of incentive to make a good choice if the bank was instead deciding which apartment where worth buying who would decide   a bank employee whose bonus this year depends on finding a great apartment to invest in but the consequence of a bad choice does n't show up for many years   the people selling the bank the apartments such a business can exist   there are real estate companies that take money and invest it in real estate   often the borrow money from banks secured against their existing real estate and use it to build more real estate   notice the bit about it being secured against existing real estate things go south bank gets stuff the bank 's indirect investment in that apartment in the current system is covered by appraisals the seller the mortgage holder and the system deciding that the mortgage holder is creditworthy banks sell risk   they lend you money you go off and do something risky with it and they get a the low risk return on investment of your loan   multiple such low risk investments provides them with a relatively dependable stream of money which they give out to their bondholders deposit account customers shareholders or what have you when you take a mortgage out for that you are buying risk from the bank   you are more exposed to the failure of the investment than they are   they get less return if things go really well

i generally agree with the other answers   regarding the bit about your loan from your parents your arrangement with your parents is certainly material to you getting another   loan   the mortgage application will probably require you to disclose all outstanding debt   obviously if you choose to omit it and your parents do n't tell it probably wo n't come up   but that would be unethical definitely and illegal probably    whether this will interfere with you getting a loan is another question but since it 's your only debt it will probably be ok

all of these frameworks markowitz mean cara etc   sit inside a more general framework which is that returns are good and risk lack of certainty in the returns is bad and there 's a tradeoff between the two encoded as some kind of risk aversion number   you can measure lack of certainty in returns by vol weighted sum of higher moments but even sector region concentration   similarly do i want more returns or log returns or returns in the context of this tradeoff   you do n't need any formal notion of utility at that point and i do n't know what formal ideas of utility beyond i want more returns and less risk really buys you the sharpe ratio only really gets its meaning because you 've got some formal asset pricing notion of utility    in my view the moment that you 're putting constraints on the portfolio e.g. long only max weights do n't deviate too much from the benchmark really you 're operating in this more general framework anyway and you 're not in utility land anymore

the first thing i would try is to take out a loan from a local credit union if you do n't know of any that you 're eligible for start looking at the national credit union administration 's credit union locator you should be able to get a good rate since your credit is so good if for whatever reason you ca n't get the credit union loan i would open another credit card try hard to get the loan though because using a credit card will most likely be significantly more expensive if you ca n't cover your cash only expenses with cash you already have make sure that you can get cash from the card for example one of my cards regularly sends me checks that i could write to myself to get cash but be careful with this strategy usually the interest is much higher than normal purchases either way until you 've paid off this emergency debt and built up an emergency fund of 3 6 months of expenses cut your expenses as much as possible this experian article has some good tips

the most important thing is to keep in mind the deadline if you want to have it count for 2016 you need to open the account and transfer the funds by tax day do n't wait until the last day to do it or you could run out of time setting up the initial account and them verifying your information and transferring the money could take a few days first decide how much of a lump sum you want to invest   initially this will determine some of your options because the mutual fund will have a minimum initial investment many of the funds will allow subsequent investments to be smaller   the beauty of a ira or roth ira is that if the fund you want is out of reach for this initial investment in a few years you can transfer the money into another fund or even another fund family without having to worry about tax issues now decide on your risk level and you time horizon because you said you are student and you want a roth ira it is assumed that you will not need this money for 4 + decades so you can and should be willing to be a little more risky as said an index fund is a great idea many also advise an aged based fund my kids found that when they made their initial investments the age based funds were the only one with a low enough initial investment for their first few years   then pick a fund family based on the general low fees and a large mix of options the best thing is that in a few years as you have more money and more options you can adjust your choices

diversification is spreading your investments around so that one point of risk does n't sink your whole portfolio the effect of having a diversified portfolio is that you 've always got something that 's going up though the corollary is that you 've also always got something going down winning overall comes by picking investments worth investing in not to state the obvious or anything it 's worth looking at the different types of risk you can mitigate with diversification   company risk this is the risk that the company you bought actually sucks for instance you thought gold was going to go up and so you bought a gold miner   say there are only two abc and xyz   you buy xyz then the ceo reveals their gold mine is played out and the stock goes you 're wiped out but gold does go up and abc does especially now they 've got no competition   if you 'd bought both xyz and abc you would have diversified your company risk and you would have been much better off say you invested $ 10 k $ 5 k in each xyz goes to zero and you lose that $ 5k. abc goes up 120 and is now worth $ 11k. so despite xyz bankrupting you 're up 10 on your overall position   sector risk you can categorize stocks by what sector they 're in we 've already talked about one gold miners but there are many more like utilities bio tech transportation banks etc stocks in a sector will tend to move together so you can be right about the company but if the sector is out of favor it 's going to have a hard time going up     lets extend the above example what if you were wrong about gold going up then xyz would still be bankrupt and abc would be making less money so they went down as well say 20 at that point you 've only got $ 4 k left but say that besides gold you also thought that banks were cheap so you split your investment between the gold miners and a couple of banks lets call them and op for $ 2500 each in xyz abc and op say you were wrong about gold but right about banks goes up 15 and op goes up 40   at that point your portfolio looks like this xyz start $ 2500 -100 end $ 0 abc start $ 2500 + 120 end $ 5500 start $ 2500 + 15 end $ op start $ 2500 + 40 end $ 3500 for a portfolio total of $ or a total gain of   see how that works   region country currency risk so now what if everything 's been going up in the usa and everything seems so overpriced well odds are some area of the world is not over bought like brazil or england so you can buy some brazilian or english companies and diversify away from the usa that way if the market tanks here those foreign companies are n't caught in it and could still go up this is the same idea as the sector risk except it 's location based instead of business type based   there is an additional twist to this currencies   the use the pound and the use the real most small investors do n't think about this much but the value of currencies including our dollar fluctuates if the dollar has been strong and the pound weak as it has been lately then what happens if that changes say you own a british bank and the dollar weakens and the pound strengthens even if that bank does n't move at all you would still make a gain   example you buy british bank bbb for 40 pounds a share when each pound costs $ 1.20 say after a while bbb is still 40 pounds share but the dollar weakened and the pound strengthened such that each pound is now worth $ 1.50 you could sell bbb and because of the currency exchange once you 've got it converted back to dollars you 'd have a 25 gain    market cap risk sometimes big companies do well sometimes it 's small companies the small caps are riskier but higher returning when you think about it small and mid cap stocks have much more room to run than large caps do it 's much easier to double a company worth $ 1 billion than it is to double a company worth $ 100 billion   investment types stocks are n't the only thing you can invest in there 's also bonds convertible bonds cds preferred stocks options and futures it can get pretty complicated especially the last two but each of these investment behaves differently and again the idea is to have something going up all the time   the classical mix is stocks and bonds the idea here is that when times are good the stocks go up when times are bad the bonds go up because they 're safer so more people want them but mostly they 're there to providing steady income and help keep your portfolio from along with the stocks currently this may not work out so well stocks and bonds have been moving in sync for several years and with interest rates so low they do n't provide much income   so what does this mean to you i 'm going make some assumptions here based on your post you said single index self managed and do n't lower overall risk and return i 'm going to assume you 're a small investor young you invest in etfs and the single index is the s&p 500 index etf spy   s&p 500 is roughly the 500 biggest companies in the usa further it 's weighted how much of each stock is in the index such that the bigger the company is the bigger a percentage of the index it is   if is right the top 5 companies combined are already 11 of the index apple microsoft exxon amazon and johnson johnson the smallest news corp is a measly of the index   in other words if all you 're invested in is spy you 're invested in a of giant american companies and a little bit of other stuff besides   to diversify company risk and sector risk are n't really relevant to you since you want broad market etfs they 've already got that covered the first thing i would do is add some smaller companies get some etfs for mid cap and small cap value not small cap growth it sucks for structural reasons examples are for mid cap and for small cap value    after you 've done that and are comfortable with what you have it may be time to branch out internationally you can get etfs for regions such as the eu check out or countries like japan see but you 'd probably want to start with one that 's all major countries that are n't the usa check out efa   in any case do n't go too crazy with it as index investing goes the s&p 500 is not a bad way to go feed in anything else a little bit at a time and take the time to really understand what it is you 're investing in   so for example using the etfs i mentioned add in 10 each and then after you 're comfortable maybe add 10 efa and raise to 20 what the ultimate percentages are of course is something you have to decide for yourself   or you could just chuck it all and buy a single target date retirement fund from say vanguard or t. rowe price and just not worry about it

benefit from lower interest rates because it decreases the rate at which they can borrow from the federal reserve from   but what matters is the spread if rates on the borrowing and lending side go down the spread shrinks which makes banks less profitable that 's why bank stocks go up when higher rates are anticipated you can think of a bank stock as being long interest rates   that 's why bank stocks have lagged the rest of the market during this long bull market   's assets are n't all debt   the vast majority is for most banks gs and ms are the rare exceptions

according to mckinsey the consultancy it took six months for the us economy to recover its pre recession jobs level after the 1982 downturn following the 1991 recession that had risen to 15 months after 2001 it took 39 months meaning that the economy required almost the full business cycle to regain the jobs total by the previous one following the great recession of 2008 mckinsey forecast that the economy would take 60 months to reach the pre downturn jobs level   that now looks optimistic in december 2007 the us economy employed 146 m people four years later it at 140 m at the current rate of job creation it will take another two and a half years to regain 2007 levels taking the replacement cycle to as much as 78 months this is destruction minus the creativity even that the problem since in that time the population will have risen by more than 10 m   i know companies that employ senior engineers whose only job is to find ways to reduce the headcount says carl chief executive of kelly services a booming staffing agency based in michigan the name of the game everywhere is to reduce permanent headcount and we are still only at the early stages of this trend the second problem stems from the first america is employing a decreasing proportion of its people at the start of the recession the employment to population rate was per cent the rate is now per cent last month unemployment fell from 9 per cent to 8.6 per cent on the surface this looked like a welcome leap in job creation in reality more than half of the fall was accounted for by a decrease in the numbers actively seeking work the who dropped out of the labour market far exceeded the 120,000 new jobs   according to government statistics if the same number of people were seeking work today as in 2007 the jobless rate would be 11 per cent some have moved from claiming unemployment benefits to disability benefits and have thus permanently dropped out of the labour force others have fallen back on the charity of relatives others still have ended up in prison in 1982 there were just over 500,000 in jail today there are 2.5 m more than the combined population of atlanta boston seattle and kansas city according to the economic mobility project of the pew center a washington based think tank   finally a growing share of whatever jobs the economy is still managing to create is in the least productive areas of the five occupations forecast by the bureau of labor statistics to be the fastest growing between now and 2018 none requires a degree these are registered nurses home health customer service representatives food preparation workers and personal home care   manufacturing is nowhere in the top 20 and such jobs can not replace the pay and conditions once typical of that sector the food preparation industry can not sustain a middle class says dan chief executive of one of america ’s two remaining big steel companies whose company motto is a nation that builds and makes things   the are not with mr according to a study this year by michael a nobel prize winning economist from stanford university and all net job creation since 1990 has been in the non tradable sector between 1990 and 2008 the us added m jobs of which almost every one was in services almost half were in healthcare or the public sector both areas in which productivity growth is virtually zero conversely manufacturing ’s impressive productivity growth has tracked its shrinking headcount if there is an explanation as to why middle class incomes have stagnated in the past generation this is it whatever jobs the us is able to create are in the least efficient sectors the types that neither computers nor china have yet found a way of eliminating that trend is starting to lap at the feet of more highly educated american workers and as the shift continues higher paying jobs are also increasingly at risk argue prof and ms   what then can be done to the increasingly jobs market if the answer were simple it would have been on everyone ’s a long time ago unfortunately there is no precedent for the challenges america faces and thus little consensus among economists or policymakers on the best remedies however almost everyone agrees on how to ensure the situation does not deteriorate top of the list is a better education system for all stages of life   alas an increasingly mediocre school system is easier said than done nor is permanent realistic for large chunks of the workforce there may be lessons to be learnt from nations such as germany particularly on vocational education but there is little federal appetite to apply them every american is going to have to get used to the idea of a completely different work style says mr whose company farms out hundreds of thousands of temporary workers around the world from lawyers to office assistants what you learnt in college five years ago may already be obsolete   perhaps inevitably given the fiscal climate education and training budgets have gone in the wrong direction in the past few years state schools and vocational community colleges derive much of their funding from local property taxes that model brings two big disadvantages first it means community colleges are victims of zip code apartheid the lower the property values in an area the less money there is to train the workforce or educate the children   second it communities of the fiscal that they need during a prolonged home foreclosures crisis the areas worst hit by the housing crisis have experienced some of the steepest education cuts by contrast some of the best community colleges have kept their heads well above water but most budgets have taken a at a time when demand for retraining has surged it is absurd that we withdraw support from the community colleges just when they most need it says prof   economists also agree on the need for a of other measures from higher spending on infrastructure with the quality of roads and airports now rapidly approaching second world status to a more sensible immigration policy that encourages the most talented foreign students to remain in the us most also call for far higher public spending on research and development as well as better private incentives the us now has one of the least generous r&amp;d tax credits in the developed world   taken together these reforms would have an impact but few believe they would transform the picture the truth is that we do n’t know how to fix the us labour market we are in territory says peter mr obama ’s former budget director now a vice chairman of citi it would help to spend more on retraining and on infrastructure and to have a more rational immigration system but these would n’t fundamentally transform the situation for the middle

to answer your question the $ 30 and it accrues monthly if you carry the balance forward however do n't do that only use your credit card on things you can immediately pay off right away do n't pay extra money for things and do n't pay for things you ca n't afford as a recent college grad i 've seen way too many people have $ 1,000 + in credit card debt while in school that 's just if you have any other questions let me know

it does not matter your credit score is affected by late payments by credit usage and by age of credit do not pay late   paying early is only good in that it means you do n't pay late your credit usage is calculated by percentage of the credit you have that you actually use   keep your usage to under 20 of your limit and you look great as a credit risk as you have lots of buffer

disclaimer employee here   not speaking for of course all opinions are my own and my own alone   and i 'm not in any way connected w/ the negotiations w/ google or anyone else for that matter so i do n't have any inside information about either google or 's stance on the matter   a lot of what you 're saying here makes sense but there 's one thing that is n't quite right in my mind   you say that google subsidized firefox   that 's not at all how i 'd describe the relationship   yes it 's to google 's advantage to have the web as the platform and before chrome became such a player having ff around as a competitor to ie was a good move   but as i understand it this is a business deal pure and simple   ff 's market share may currently be on the decline but there is still somewhere in the neighborhood of that 's half a billion firefox users out there   that 's a lot of eyeballs seeing google as the default search engine and the default home page   which means a lot of google searches which means a lot of google revenue   i do n't know how much they make from that but i 'd guess it 's a whole lot more than the $ they 've been paying for that privilege   now if ff no longer defaulted to google they would n't lose all of those users   some people would still switch to google as the default and lots of people would just type in the address bar or make it their home page   but a lot more people just go w/ the default than you 'd first guess   i think that if google bailed on some renewal of the deal they 'd see a noticeable dip in their traffic w/ a resulting dip in revenue   this relationship has never been about philanthropy it 's about the money as usual   for this reason i 'm not gon na stress out too much about an article that seems to be little more than speculation   maybe i 'm wrong maybe a new deal will fall through   but i 'm going to wait until i hear that from someone who actually has inside information before i start freaking out about it

good question there are plenty of investors who think they can simply rely on intuition and although luck is always present it is not enough to construct a proper portfolio first of all there are two basic types of portfolio management passive and active the majority of abnormal gains are made with active portfolio management although passive managers are less likely to suffer loses   both types must be created with some kind of qualitative and quantitative research but an active portfolio requires constant adjustments market timing to preserve the desired levels of risk and return   the topic is extremely broad and every manager has his own preferred methods of quantitative analysis i will try to list here some most common in my opinion ways of stock picking and portfolio management 's criterion the best portfolio is that with the lowest probability that the return will be below a specified level   this is achieved by maximising the number of standard deviations between the return on the portfolio and minimum specified level max k = rp where rp return on portfolio rl specified minimum return sp standard deviation of portfolio return 's criterion maximise the minimum return rl subject to constraint that the chance of a return below rl is less than or equal to a specified value a maximise rl subject to prob rp < rl = < a for example assume that the specified value is 20 this will be met provided rl is at least standard deviations below rp therefore the best portfolio is the one that rl where rl = 's criterion maximise expected return subject to the constraint that the chance of a return below the specified minimum is less than or equal to some specified minimum a maximise rp subject to prob rp < rl = < a assuming same data as previously   rl = < and select the portfolio with highest expected return security selection now let 's look at some methods of security selection this is important when a manager believes some shares are mispriced the required return on security i is given by ri = where rf is a risk free rate return on the market bi security 's beta the difference between the required return and the actual return expected is known as the security 's alpha ai ai = rai ri where rai is actual return on security i stock picking one way of stock picking is to select portfolios of securities with positive alpha of a portfolio is simply the weighted average of the of the securities in the portfolio ap = where is sigma sorry for such weird typing have n't figured out yet how to type proper looking formulas n share of security in portfolio so another way of stock picking is ranking securities by their excess return to beta erb erb = ri the greater the erb the more desirable the security and the greater the proportion it will make up of the portfolio thus portfolios produced by this technique will have greater proportion of some securities than the market portfolio and lower proportions of other securities   the number of securities depends on a cut off rate c for the erb defined so that all securities with erb > c are included in portfolio while if erb   the cut off rate for a portfolio containing the first j securities is given by i 'm inserting an image cut from word below   here comes the tricky part basically what you do is first calculate erb for each security then calculate cj for each security mix gradually adding new securities one by one and cj each time then you select an optimum portfolio by comparing cj of each mix to erb 's of it 's securities let me show you a simple example say you have securities a b c and d you calculated erb 's also you calculated then you check erb(a),erb(b),erb(c are greater than c(a but c(a only contains security a so c(a is not an optimum mix erb(a),erb(b),erb(c are greater than but only contains securities a and b erb(a),erb(b),erb(c are greater than and contains a b and c so it is an optimum is lower than so is not an optimum portfolio finally the most important part below is a formula to find the share of each security in the portfolio   here you simply plug in already obtained values for each security to find it 's proportion in your portfolio i hope this somehow answers your question however there is a lot more than this to consider if you decide to manage your portfolio yourself some of the most important areas are   market timing hedging stocks vs bonds   good luck with your investments and remember the safest portfolio is the one that replicates the global market   the cut off rate for a portfolio containing the first j securities is given by i 'm

do you now own your new home or are you renting   this is a classic case of a mortgage ready to blow up these interest only would have a low rate say 3 so on $ 200 k the payment is $ 500/mo but no principal paydown even if the rate were still 3 it wo n't be the 23 yr amortization means a payment of $ after the 7 years end at 4 it 's $ 5 $ i would take this all into account as you decide what to do if you now own a new house you should consider the morally questionable walk away i believe you were sold an unethical product mb wrote shoot up considerably this is still an understatement a product whose payment is certain to double in a fixed time is bad bad in the biblical sense you have no obligation to keep any deal with the devil which is exactly what you have   there are some banks offering fha products that might help you i just received an offer from the bank holding a mortgage on my rental property it 's 4.5 for a refinance up to 125 of current value there 's a cost of $ 1800 but i owe so little and am paying it off faster than the time left i 'm not bothering you may benefit from such a program but i 'd still question if you can make a go of a house that even 2 underwater do some math and see if you started now with a 30 year loan how the numbers work out   forgive my soapbox stance on this there are those who criticize the strategic i think you fall into a group of innocent victims who were sold a product that was nothing less than a financial time bomb i am very curious to know the original interest only rate and the index margin for the rate upon adjustment if you include the original balance i can tell you the exact payments based on the new rates pretty easily

as a general proposition no you do not need to report money transfers into the us   if a transaction exceeds $ 10,000 then the bank must report it anyway   note that structuring your transactions to avoid a $ 10,000 deposit is illegal so be careful if you are moving lots of money as a general rule no transferring your own individual money from a foreign account to a us account does not incur taxes only lawyers are authorized to practice law in the us   they should generally be bar licensed in the state of practice   certified public accountants can assist you with tax preparation and return positions though tax lawyers may be necessary for some situations or for formal tax opinions   be sure to use an experienced advisor to file your tax returns and information reporting

i 'll give the tldr answer 1 you ca n't forecast the price direction if you get it right you got lucky if you think you get it right consistently you are either a statistical anomaly or a victim of confirmation bias countless academic studies show that you can not do this 2 you reduce volatility and importantly left tail risk by going to an index tracking etf or mutual fund that is loss is much lower in an index tracker what 's the trade off the good thing is there is no tradeoff your expected return does not go down in the same way the risk goes down 3 since point 1 is true you are wasting time analysing companies this has the opportunity cost of not earning $ from doing paid work which can be thought of as a negative return with all the successful investors including myself on a not infrequent basis going for individual companies directly actually academic studies show that individual investors are the worst performers of all investors in the stock market

largely because stock markets are efficient markets at least mostly if not entirely while the efficient market hypothesis is not necessarily 100 correct for the majority of traders it 's unlikely that you could on the long term find significant market inefficiencies with the tools available to an individual of normal wealth say < $ 500k that 's what frequent trading intends to do find market inefficiencies   if the market is efficient then a stock is priced exactly at what it should be worth based on risk and future returns   if it is inefficient then you can make more money trading on that inefficiency versus simply holding it long   but in stating that a stock is inefficient you are stating that you know something the rest of the market does n't or some condition is different for you than the other million or so people in the market   that 's including a lot of folks who do this for a living and have very expensive modelling software and hardware to run it on   i like to think that i 'm smarter than the far majority of people but i 'm probably not the smartest guy in the room and i certainly do n't have that kind of equipment especially with high frequency trading nowadays as such it 's certainly possible to make a bit of money as a trader versus as a long term investor but on the whole it 's similar to playing poker for a living   if you 're smarter than most of the people in the room you might be able to make a bit of money but the overhead in the case of poker the money the house charges for the game in the case of stocks the exchange fees and broker commissions means that it 's a losing game for the group as a whole and not very many people can actually make money   add to that the computer based trading so imagine a poker game where four of the eight players are computer models that are really good and actively maintained by very smart traders and you can see where it gets to be very difficult to trade at a profit versus long term investments which take advantage of the growth in value in the company finally the risk because of leverage and option trading which is necessary to really take advantage of inefficiencies makes it not only hard to make a profit but easy to lose everything   again to the poker analogy the guys i 've known playing poker for a living do it by playing 10 20 games at once because one game is n't efficient enough you would n't make enough money   in poker you can do that fairly safely especially in limit games but in the market if you 're leveraging your money you risk losing a lot   every action you take to make it safer removes some of your profit

finally some good examples    so clearly this is an issue and many large companies do similar shenanigans but the divisions being cut are massively unprofitable anyhow even with these crappy tricks    i agree that a company like ge should be looking long term but i 'm not sure what they do in technology r&amp;d so i 'm not prepared to be too harsh on that front   i absolutely agree that having non software engineers write software is a long term failure even smart engineers who can pump out software often do so without having learned the lessons that software companies learn resulting in short term results followed by long term pain    anyhow thanks for a real response i wonder if the divisions being cut need to be cut or sold off regardless but i think every large org should look at examples like this and not try to play the this quarter is good game

i did n't mean to imply that bankruptcy is a magical process i was using that to clarify my use of conservative vs. aggressive to be fair i guess it can vary depending on your perspective if you 're taking the perspective of the debt laden company then yes on the side of a higher value could be defined as aggressive if you 're taking the perspective of someone looking to acquire business i would say on the side of a higher value is conservative    if the debt is trading at say $ 0.20 on the dollar then yes i can agree that the market value of the debt is likely more representative of the book value i guess i was n't thinking of that type of extreme example a more common scenario i 'd encounter would be a the debt trading at maybe $ 0.95 on the dollar and b taking the perspective of someone looking to invest in the equity which is why i 'd say that it 's more conservative to use the higher value which is the book value   so i 'm persuaded that using market value of the debt can make sense in some cases but i would still argue that the book value might make more sense in other cases

in the case of an initial public offering the brokers underwriting the share issue will look at the current earnings being generated by the company and compare these to those of other competitor companies already listed in the stock market   for example if a new telephone company is undertaking an initial public offering then the share price of those telephone companies which are already traded on the stock market will serve as a reference for how much investors will be willing to pay for the new company 's shares   if investors are willing to pay 15 times earnings for telecom shares then this will be the benchmark used in determining the new share price in addition comparative growth prospects will be taken into account   finally the underwriter will want to see a successful sale so they will tend to slightly under price the new shares in order to make them attractive none of this is an exact science and we often see shares trading at a large premium to the initial offer price during the first few days of trading   more often that not prices then settle down to something closer to the offer price   the initial price spike is usually the result of high demand for the shares by investors who believe that past examples of a price spike will repeat with this initial public offering   there will also usually be high demand for the new shares from funds that specialise in shares of the type being issued in the case of a rights issue where an existing publicly traded company wishes to raise capital by issuing new shares the company will price the new shares at a significant discount to the current market price   the new shares will be initially offered to existing shares holders and the discounted price is intended to encourage the existing shareholders to exercise their rights since the new shares may have the effect of diluting the value of their shares   any shares which are not purchased by existing share holder will then be offered for sale in the market

from the 1st quarter 10q match funded advances on loans serviced for others result from our transfers of residential loan servicing advances to in exchange for cash the issue debt supported by collections on the transferred advances we made these transfers under the terms of our advance facility agreements these transfers do not qualify for sale accounting because we retain control over the transferred assets as a result we account for these transfers as and classify the transferred advances on our interim condensed consolidated balance sheet as match funded advances and the related liabilities as match funded liabilities we use collections on the match funded advances pledged to the to repay principal and to pay interest and the expenses of the entity holders of the debt issued by this entity can look only to the assets of the entity itself for satisfaction of the debt and have no recourse against    i 'm not an expert in the accounting of these things but i 'll take a stab from the view of a bond investor   let 's assume the in question have been pooled together and sold into the bond market in the form of a mortgage backed security mbs     when a homeowner falls behind on their payment scheduled principal and interest their monthly mortgage payment amount or is advanced as if the borrower is still current to the person who holds the mbs   this is typically done from the time they first fall behind until either they 1 catch up on their payments or 2 are foreclosed upon and the home is sold to repay the mortgage balance   in either instance the advanced monthly payments are recaptured by the servicer before the holder of the mbs is paid   in this sense the servicer develops a sort of prepaid asset over time by advancing money they are almost certain to recover at a future date usually via foreclosure and liquidation     due to a high number of borrowers falling behind on their payments since the housing crisis and the resulting time it takes to foreclose on a property the etc have built a large balance of advances on the asset side of their balance sheet   to free up this cash prior to liquidation of the home they have sold short term bonds against this asset via an thereby creating the liability you reference   so in essence they have say a home they expect to be liquidated in twelve months that they have advanced on   the short term bonds sold via the offset this asset at an equivalent term thereby making the asset and liability match funded

to dispute your first point it can be racist if it 's the truth the accuracy of a statement does n't impact it 's    if you were over weight and i called you a fat fuck it may well be true though it 's still mean   in the same way if your mother was dying of cancer and i was to say she is a weight on our social structures and she 's not likely to live long anyway all of those things may be factually correct however it is still malicious for me to say those things in that way    similarly even if what he says is factually is an issue i 'll get to does not change whether what he said and the way he said it was malicious or to a particular race now whether what he said is socially acceptable is a matter of culture you seem to think it 's perfectly acceptable as another said many of his business connections might also i happen to think it 's not acceptable clearly in line with op i 'm not looking to argue about whether it is acceptable to ever be racist because that is a nuanced line though fairly simple to keep away from that has been covered over and over in many other discussions arguments and protests    to the matter of whether or not what he has said is factually correct    i agree with you on this zimbabwe is incredibly rich in resource and is a largely untapped land in the modern seemingly not for long    however i would make the distinction in my argument in the causality is it the fault of the zimbabwe people that they have not fully taken advantage of their resource and if so is that fault in anyway linked to their skin colour    for me even if you the first the 2nd is untenable clearly seen in the rise of asia and of india through the 20th century education medicine social support and infrastructure play a much larger role in the ability of a society to effectively allocate resource than the vain colour of ones skin or the line of ones heritage   not to say the first is entirely true either as the mistakes of yours weigh on your ability as much as their success accelerates you   there are key resources and educations the places such as zimbabwe lacked the made them unable to use   resource historically in the same way as the modern western world water hygiene tool making resource most notably land able to support intensive farming and food storage       instead the cultures would have developed to use the land resources as is most efficient though may not be the cities and farming of europe     further i would argue education and infrastructure as was seen originally with the foundation of the us the america 's resource was untapped without the machinery or knowledge to take advantage of it which comes best from the close quarters of europe    writing also improving the transfer of information by orders of magnitude first created in the middle east taken up by the greeks then the romans therefore much of europe 's success amount other thing s can be credited to to romans and theirs to the greeks and theirs to the    clearly the nor even the romans were white by any pure standard especially noting england 's boom occurred after introduction of roman infrastructure and more recently asia with western international corporation 's     i would argue that the size of a society and it 's economic success which may not be the aim of the society has more to do with the tools available the location and access to trade infrastructure and social support including medicine    these are things that are not linked to the colour of ones skin therefore to say that blacks by virtue of being black lacking any other qualifying information are inherently less able to bring america into economic success than whites by virtue of them being white lacking any qualifying information is not entirely factually correct and is naturally open to criticism    by changing you argument to be less directed at the colour of ones skin and more toward the nature of the society and the capabilities of their technology your argument is made more tolerable though still entirely open to   but as soon as you change your argument to i 'm glad that people of america and bringing to to success did instead of people were n't able to america and bring technology with them the argument becomes somewhat null of course a society whether black white or any other with advanced technology and access to trade such as who had control of many trade lines and much of indian production would be able to and take advantage of resources better than a society which did not have those things control of large trade routes ships ect and these things have less to do with the colour on ones skin and more to do with infrastructure trade and social support    the fact is when the racism is taken out the argument is n't worth mentioning because the ability to speaks to a society that takes effective advantage of trade infrastructure and technology   this fact is and makes any attempt to justify the argument seem a thinly veiled justification for   as if not to be racist what is the argument actually a arguing what does his statement actually say without specifying the colour of ones skin   so to i 'm not entirely against the line of thought nor that the guy said he gets in the good books of his friends what i am against is a society that supports racism the society he is supporting in making that type of statement what i am against is the idea that if something is true it does n't matter how it 's said remember your fat ass mom i 'm what i am against is the use of null arguments to justify a controversial opinion if the controversial aspect of the sentence is able to be taken away and it was would it have any meaning   sorry if i was overly aggressive in this response and for any grammatical mistakes and if you have a response i would appreciate a similar amount of effort and will do my best to my bias   thank you   edit grammar

quant has been an interesting part of finance but i always thought they missed something really important    the standard methods of statistical analysis ca n’t explain what ’s going on with economy and firms otherwise quant hedge funds would have been making money all the time    the conventional quants find patterns in data test them then go live these models work until some fundamental or not so fundamental shifts in the market then they find themselves back in the drawing board looking for their next model this kind of analysis seems like a lot of grind for fairly   unpredictable returns    there are more and more companies that do n’t lend themselves well to fundamental analysis as we know it financial data and some poor flawed human analysts insights alone can no longer explain much    this is a unique set of challenges that data science more specifically ai could solve the speed at which ai can learn and process information is just mind boggling ai can learn the entire financial history of decision making in minutes it can recognize patterns make sophisticated analysis and constantly update its probability tables as the new information comes in this is something no human can compete with     imagine a quantitative engine that adapts as the economy changes it could draw heaps of data about a company learn from it in real time make course corrections and spit out its recommendations    to the degree that human decision making is involved in the strategic decision making of companies we will need the depth of context that can be provided by humans but i see the field moving away from excel spreadsheets with fairly poor predicting capacity to ai models with strong predictive capacity

i would advise against both at least in the way you are discussing it you seem to be talking about day trading speculating in either stock or currency markets this seems ill advised in each trade one of three things will happen you will end up ahead and the person you buy from sell to will end up behind you will lose and the counterparty will win or you both will lose due to trading fees that said if you must do one stick with stocks they have a reason to have positive returns overall while currency trade is net zero additionally as you said if it sounds like you can gain more with less money that means that there are many more losers than winners how do you know you will be a winner a lot of the reason for this idea that you can gain a lot with less is leverage make sure you understand it well on the other hand it may make sense to learn this lesson now while you have little to lose

the idea is great but us securities laws impose a huge burden on these businesses   specifically rule of reg d prohibits general solicitation and advertising such as using the internet   there is currently pending legislation to amend the us securities act of 1933 sec regarding public offerings to help reduce such barriers but as it stands there are significant barriers to entry in the market   sec filing and reporting requirements especially after dodd frank are onerous to say the least and running direct lending services are at the moment largely cost prohibitive due to these requirements

no you have to reimburse the current mortgage you have and a new one for your new house a mortgage is a loan from a financial institution that accepts to give you money if you pay it back the total amount adding interests interests are the price you pay to the financial institution for it to give you money for a while in the mortgage you have an legal agreement with the financial institution on how to reimburse the total amount that is given to you for a while breaking that agreement is breaking the law the fact of the matter is that when 30 of your mortgage is reimbursed the financial institution own your house legally for real at 70 your live in the house own by the financial institution at 70 it is the same exact logic for a car loan the mortgage goes with a specific house at a legal address that you live in as a primary residence

i know some ceos for both big and small companies   a few have admitted to me on a few occasions they themselves do n't have the slightest idea about being a ceo   the world changes too fast so they have absolutely no idea what 's going to work and what is n't when it comes time to make decisions   all they can do is rely on the recommendations of the people that work under them at which point it becomes a matter of trust   do you trust the recommendations from your cto   who did he trust to make that recommendation   the trust chain goes down and it makes you wonder if the people who know at the end of the chain should n't have been able to just make the decision themselves

vat = value added tax as an aussie think gst this is applicable in britain basically if you were in britain and if you could claim vat as a deduction that invoice is not sufficient proof to make the claim but you 're in oz so it does n't apply to you in any case for work related deductions like book purchases see   issues such as the books being second hand or purchased online are not cited in the instructions as relevant limiting factors in fact if you really want to get into the nitty gritty you could claim the work related proportion of your internet access fees as a deduction question instructions above cover that as well

my doubt is whether bank of india gives any explicit incentives to banks to offer cheaper home loans currently no in the past loan against gold was considered priority sector lending loans to poor and agriculture etc every bank need to lead around 25 to priority sector hence quite a few banks gave loans relatively cheaper to todays rate rather than giving it as farm loan that almost never get recovered it is no longer the case now as loan against gold is not considered priority lending if it were just demand supply i feel that gold loans should have been cheaper   it is demand and supply there are quite a few reasons for this

many reasons but let me pick my favourite   the incentive to save is n't there   any government subject to elections has the incentive to spend as much as possible to remain in power   what is worse it has a disincentive to save because the money it saves and which it pays for with bad will from the electorate who should really be smarter is going to be spent by the other guy who will then look incredibly good and be of re election   but is n't it afraid of accumulating debt you may ask and its simple somebody else will be there when the debt is due   the problem of incentives is a fundamental one

you need to contact the institution that is holding your current account have them sell your fund investment and then close your account and send you a check for the balance then you can open an account directly with vanguard or call 800 you do n't need an account with an online broker unless you want to be able to invest in funds outside the vanguard family fees will depend on the institution that you are currently using and the fund with some funds you have to pay a load percentage of your assets in the neighborhood of a couple of percent when you redeem shares your institution may charge you a fee for redeeming the fund anywhere from $ to maybe $ 40 or higher some institutions will charge a fee for closing the account i 've seen anything from $ to $ 40 but i have n't looked around in a while as mrchrister points out in a comment below this is not the best method for an ira in that case you 'd want to make a transfer and i 'd recommend calling both your current institution and vanguard or wherever you end up transferring funds to for forms and instructions on how best to do it

revenue canada allows for some amount of tax deferral via several methods the point is that none of them allow you to avoid tax but by deferring from years when you have high income to years when you have lower income allows you to realize less total tax paid due to the marginal rate for personal income tax the corporate dividend approach as explained in another answer is one way tfsas are another way but as you point out they have limits   since you brought tfsas into your question about the best and easiest tax deferral option available in canada is the rrsp if you do n't have a company pension you can contribute something like 18 of your income if you have a pension plan you may still be able to contribute to an rrsp as well but the maximum contribution amount will be lower the contribution lowers your taxable income which can save you tax interest earned on the equity in your rrsp is n't taxed tax is only paid on money drawn from the plan because it is deemed income in that year they are intended for retirement but you 're allowed to withdraw at any time so if you have little or no income in a year you can draw money from your rrsp tax is withheld which you may or may not get back depending on your taxable income for that year you can think of it as a way to level your income and lower your legitimate tax burden

as the other answer already states whether you should or should n't currency hedge your equity investments depends on a lot of factors if you decide to do so depending on your investment vehicles there might be a more cost efficient way than arranging a separate futures contract with a bank if you are open to or are already investing in etfs there are currency hedged versions of some popular etfs these are hedged against the currency risk for a specific currency for example if you are buying in and expecting to sell for usd you would buy an etf hedged to usd of course they have a higher expense ratio than non hedged etfs since the costs of the necessary contracts are included in the expenses

as soon as you specify fdic you immediately eliminate what most people would call investing the word you use in the title parking is really appropriate you want to preserve the value therefore bank or credit union deposits into either a high yield account or a certificate of deposit are the way to go because you are not planning on a lot of transactions you should also look at some of the online only banks of course only those with fdic coverage the money may need to be available over the next 2 5 years to cover    college tuition if needing it for college tuition is a high probability you could consider putting some of the money in your state 's 529 plan many states give you a tax deduction for contributions you need to check how much is the maximum you can contribute in a year there may be a maximum for your state also gift tax provisions have to be considered you will also want to understand what is the amount you will need to cover tuition and other eligible expenses there is a big difference between living at home and going to a state school and going out of state the good news is that if you have gains and you use the money for permissible expenses the gains are tax free most states have a plan that becomes more conservative as the child gets closer to college therefore the chance of losses will be low the plan is trying to avoid having a large drop in value just a the kid hits their late teens exactly what you are looking for

what options do i have realistically   get a regular full time job   work at it for a year or so and then see about buying a house that said i recently purchased a decent home   i am self employed and my income is highly erratic   due to how my clients pay me my business might go a couple months with absolutely no deposits    however i 've been at this for quite a few years   so even though my business income is erratic i pay myself regularly once a month   in order to close the deal with the mortgage company i had to provide 5 years worth of statements on my business and my personal bank accounts   also i had about a 30 down payment    this gave the bank enough info to realize that i could absolutely make the payments and we closed the deal i 'd say that if you have little to no actual financial history do n't have a solid personal income and do n't have much of a down payment then you probably have no business buying a house at this point   the first time something goes wrong water heater ac etc you 'll be in a world of trouble
