if the price of the property 1 increases a lot you will just break even on the huge expenses of home owning if the price of the property 2 increases a huge amount you will make lots of money due to the leverage if the price of the property 3 stays even you will lose a tremendous amount of money it 's much like owning a car constant expenses that 's all there is to it it 's well worth bearing in mind that property prices for your area your property need to be constantly increasing for you to merely break even note that over long periods of time prices tend to go up most anywhere but not everywhere many people basically base their thinking on that it will be ok in the long run which is fair enough i believe one huge factor is that it is enforced saving that is the number one advantage for most note too that in most all jurisdictions there are tremendous tax advantages even if it turns out to be situation 1 i.e. a waste of time you only break even note finally that there are indeed tremendous social financial advantages to having the equity it gets incredibly easy to get other loans for business or the like once you own a house this is undeniably an advantage perhaps press your husband on that one

the new york times offer a remarkably detailed buy vs rent calculator   you enter from all of this it advises the break even rent when monetarily it 's equal   i 'd suggest you keep a few things in mind when using such a tool logic common sense and a nobel prize winner named robert shiller all indicate that housing will follow inflation over the long term short term even 20 years the graphs will hint at something else but the real long term the cost of housing ca n't exceed inflation   the other major point i 'd add is that i see you wrote we rent a nice house most often people are looking to buy what they feel they ca n't easily rent whether it 's the yard room number or sizes etc this also leads to the purchase of too big a house you can find that you can afford the extra bedroom family room in addition to living room etc and then buy a house 50 bigger than what you need or planned on in my opinion getting the smallest house you can imagine living in no bigger than what you live in now and plan to get on a faster than 30 year repayment even with transaction costs in 10 years you 'll have saved enough to make the bump up to a larger house if you wish

it certainly seems like you are focusing on the emotional factors   that 's your blind spot and it 's the surest path to a situation where your husband gets to say i told you so   i recommend you steer straight into that blind spot and focus your studies on the business aspects of buying and owning homes    you should be able to do spreadsheets 6 ways from sunday be able to every tax deduction you 'll get as a homeowner know the resale impacts of 1 bathroom vs 2 tell a dirty house from a broken house etc   everybody 's got their favorites mine are a bit dated but i like robert and robert allen 's books   for instance a philosophy of allen 's that i really like never sell   this avoids several problems like the considerable costs of money time and nerves of actually selling a house stress about house prices mistaking your house 's equity for an atm machine and rules for capital gains tax mainly if you rent out the house which vary dramatically by nation   in fact the whole area of taxes needs careful study   there 's another side to the business of home ownership and that 's renting to others   there 's a whole set of economics there and that is a factor in what you buy   now airbnb adds a new wrinkle because there 's some real money there   come to understand that market well enough to gauge whether a duplex or will be a money maker   many regular folk like you have retired early and live off the rental income from their properties   joetaxpayer has an interesting way of looking at the finances of housing if a house does n't make sense as a a rental unit maybe it does n't make sense as a live in either    so learn how to identify those fundamentals the numbers   and get in the habit of evaluating houses   work it regularly until it 's second nature   then yes you 'll see houses you fall in love with partly because the numbers work   it also helps to be handy   it really really changes the economics if you can do your own quality work because you do n't need to spend any money on labor to convert a dirty house into a clean house   and lots of people do and there 's a whole se just for that   there is a huge difference between going down to the local building supply and getting the water pipe you need vs. having to call a plumber   and please deal with local businesses please do n't go to the big box stores their service is they will sell you a gadget salad of junk that does n't work together and i ca n't imagine a colder and less inviting scene to come up as a handy person

buying a house may save you money compared with renting depending on the area and specifics of the transaction including the purchase price interest rates comparable rent etc in addition buying a house may provide you with intangibles that fit your lifestyle goals in a community ability to renovate pride of ownership etc these factors have been discussed in other answers here and in other questions however there is one other way i think potential home buyers should consider the financial impact of home ownership buying a house provides you with a natural hedge against possible future changes in your cost of living assume the following if these two items are true then buying a home allows you to guarantee today that your monthly living expenses will be mostly fixed as long as you live in that community in 2 years if there is an explosion of new residents in your community and housing costs skyrocket does n't affect you your mortgage payment or if you paid cash the lack of mortgage payment is fixed in 3 years if there are 20 new apartment buildings built beside you and housing costs plummet does n't affect you your mortgage payment is fixed if you know that you want to live in a particular place 20 years from now then buying a house in that area today may be a way of ensuring that you can afford to live there in the future remember that while your mortgage payment will be fixed other costs of home ownership will be variable see below you may or may not save money compared with rent over the period you live in your house but by putting your money into a house you have protected yourself against catastrophic rent increases what is the cost of hedging yourself against this risk a the known costs of ownership closing costs on purchase mortgage interest property tax condo fees home insurance etc b the unknown costs of ownership annual and periodic maintenance closing costs on a future sale etc c the potential earnings lost on your down payment mortgage principal payments whether it is low risk interest or higher risk equity d you may have reduced savings for a long period of time which would limit your ability to cover emergencies such as medical costs unexpected unemployment etc e you may have a reduced ability to look for a better job based on being locked into a particular location though i have assumed above that you want to live in a particular community for an extended period of time that desire may change and f you ca n't reap the benefits of a rental market that decreases in real dollars if that happens in your market over time in short purchasing a home should be a lifestyle motivated decision it financially reduces some the fluctuation in your long term living costs with the trade off of committed principal dollars and additional ownership risks including limited mobility

a home actually is a terrible investment it has all the traits of something you would never want to plunge your hard earned money into the only way that buying a house makes good money sense is if you pay cash for it and get a really good deal it should also be a house you can see yourself keeping for decades or until you 're older and want something easier to take care of of course nothing can replace sense of ownership or sense of pride other than owning a house and your local realtor is banking really laughing all the way to the bank on your emotions overcoming your smart money savvy this post really goes to work listing all the reasons why a house is a horrible investment should be required reading for everyone about to buy a house why your house is a terrible investment tldr you must decide what is more important the money or the feelings but you ca n't have both if you read the article linked and still want to buy a house then you probably should

there still is some buying and selling to do in a passively managed fund   the stocks might pay dividends   if the fund manager did n't reinvest these dividends the fund would begin to accumulate a cash position which would cause it to stray from being an index fund   stocks come and go from an index as well if the fund is to maintain a composition that matches a particular index this must be taken into account as well the role of the manager is to ensure that the fund maintains the composition that it was intended to replicate   it does n't involve as much stock picking that active managers do   the manager has less leeway as to what s he buys and sells but there still is work involved

it depends on how immediately you think you 'll need your emergency fund cash if you anticipate running into problems where you need cash right away e.g. you live paycheck to paycheck and your car breaks down a lot put it into a checking or money market account if you do n't think your emergencies will require immediate access to cash e.g. unemployment then put it in a savings account or cd if there is a lot of money in your accounts that goes unused and you want a bigger safety net then consider investing it though it 's generally a better idea to pay off debts at this point i think the best idea is to split your emergency fund between your checking and savings maybe 20 checking and 80 savings that way you have some extra cash on hand when you need it while most of your money is growing in savings

i agree with that you may be well advised to pay off your loans first and go from there   even though you may not be required to make payments on your own loan based on your income that debt will play a large factor in your borrowing ability until it is gone which hinders your ability to move toward home ownership    if you are in a fortunate enough position to totally pay off both your loan and hers from cash on hand then you should   it would still leave you with more than $ and no debt which is a big priority and advantage for a young couple mind you this does n't keep you from starting an investment plan with some portion of the remaining funds the advice to keep six months income in the bank is very wise through perhaps a mutual fund if you do n't want to directly manage the investments yourself   the advantage of mutual funds is the ability to choose the level of risk you 're willing to take and let professionals manage how to achieve your goals for you   you can always make adjustments to your funds as your circumstances change again i 'd emphasize yourself of the student loan debt as the first move then looking at how to invest the remainder

is there any instance in which a large company whose corporate bonds are investment grade find it more attractive to take out a bank loan to raise finance rather than underwrite bonds    to my knowledge i ’m a first year at university so i ’m not 100 sure bonds are comparatively cheaper lower effective interest rate does not have the same caveats and regulations involved with usage of the loan i.e. no need to buy insurance and allow them to raise far more than most banks would be willing to risk i know loan exists but it ’s still rare to my knowledge    why would a such a company have any bank loan debt whatsoever if issuing bonds are objectively better the only one i can fathom is if the loan is so incredibly small that it ’s more time consuming to underwrite bonds but 1 i do n’t know if that ’s the case 2 why would a large company do this if they could simply pay out less dividends and reinvest a slightly larger portion of profits

devaluation is a relative term so if you want to protect yourself against devaluation of your currency against dollars just buy dollars inflation is something you can not protect yourself against because it is something that describes the purchasing power of the money you will still need to purchase and usually with money a side effect of inflation is usually devaluation against other currencies so one of the ways to deal with inflation is not to keep the money in your currency over time and only convert from a more stable currency when you need to make purchases another way is to invest in something tangible that can easily be sold for example and precious metals but it has other risks re what s legal and illegal in your country we do n't really know because you did n't tell what country that is to begin with but the usual channels like travelers checks or bank transfer should work carrying large amounts of cash are usually either illegal or strictly regulated

it 's not enough just to check if your order does n't exceed 10 of the 20 day average volume i 'll quote from my last answer about illiquid charges you may still be assessed a fee for trading otc stocks even if your account does n't meet the criteria because these restrictions are applied at the level of the clearing firm not the individual client this means that if other investors with your broker or even at another broker that happens to use the same clearing firm purchase more than 5 million shares in an individual otc stock at the same time all of your accounts may face fees even though individually you do n't exceed the limits the issues a charge to the clearing firm if in aggregate their orders exceed the limits and the clearing firm usually passes these charges on to the that placed the orders your broker may or may not pass the charges through to you they may simply charge you significantly higher commissions for trading otc securities and use those to cover the charges   since checking how the volume of your orders compares to the average past volume ask your broker about their policies on trading otc stocks they may tell you that you wo n't face illiquid charges because the higher cost of commissions covers these or they may give you specifics on how to verify that your orders wo n't incur such charges only your broker can answer this with certainty

gt could you discuss why the lack of restrictions on these subjects would make hedge funds more attractive to wealthy investors as opposed to mutual funds   well just think about it this way    you have two soccer players they both know the game extremely well they both have similar styles of plan and similar strategies they 're very good players    now you change the rules for one of the players he has to wear a 20 pound weight vest on him at all times and can only kick the ball with his right foot when shooting but his left when passing    who do you think would win in a one v. one     mutual funds are offered to the general public most of them anyways which works under certain assumptions about possible investors while investments with these funds are still considered risky the restrictions placed on mutual funds are designed to promote safety of principle for instance mutual funds are restricted in short selling and trading on margin mutual funds must also clearly state what securities they 're going to get into what strategy they 'll follow etc and deviations from this can get them into trouble   hedge funds have no such restrictions therefore they can pursue any type of investment they want hedge funds have invested or tried to invest in everything from stocks to private equity to bitcoin to art to rare to property to contracts to get boats to and from the statue of liberty to water rights to lawsuit settlements to    this relative freedom gives them much more flexibility and thus they can earn above average returns these lack of restrictions also makes them much riskier and additionally the way they 're legally set up means only a specific type of investor called an accredited investor in the u.s. can invest    what does it take to be an accredited investor basically either be rich in income $ 200k a year if single $ 300k if married or be rich in wealth net worth of $ 1mm not counting primary house

since you 're coming out of college you 're probably a new investor and do n't know too much about stocks etc i was in the same situation as well   i wanted to keep my cash liquid and wanted to make low risk investments what i ended up doing was investing the majority of my money in higher interest gics guaranteed investment certificate and keeping the rest in my chequing savings account i understand that gics are n't exactly the most liquid asset out there however instead of investing it all into 1 gic i put them in to smaller increments with varying lock in times and roll over options i.e. for 15000 keep $ 3000 on hand in your account invested for 2 years invested for 1 year invested for 180 days invested for 90 days when you find that you run out of cash from your $ 3000 you 'll have a gic expiring soon   the problem with gics is that redeeming them before the maturity period usually incurs a penalty in the form of no interest   keeping them in smaller increments allows you to redeem only the amount you need without losing too much interest   at maturity if you do n't need the money you can just have the gic renew    the other problem with gics is that interest rates though better than savings accounts are n't that much more   you 're basically just fighting off inflation   the benefit is that on maturity you are guaranteed your principal and the interest    this plan is easy to implement if your bank credit union allows you to create and manage gics online

according to the reference on the issue new york is a recourse state recourse means that the lender can go after you for the difference between the foreclosure discharge amount in new york the higher of the fmv or the actual sale price and the debt balance that includes your wages seizing your assets and any other method of collecting the judgement the relevant law is in the new york consolidated laws article 13 the option you 're talking about is the option any lender has anywhere not to sue you for the difference provision 3 of the paragraph if   no   motion   for   a deficiency judgment shall be made as herein    prescribed the proceeds of the sale regardless of amount shall be    deemed    to be in full satisfaction of the mortgage debt and no right    to   recover    any deficiency in any action or proceeding shall exist so if during the foreclosure they did n't sue you for the difference they can not change their mind after that if you 're not sure you can repay the loan you should probably walk away from the deal

yes your assumptions are correct the industry realizes that the equilibrium price of product a is $ 10 the government decides to increase the amount of people who can access product a. they do this by subsidizing $ 5 of the $ 10 dollar cost however the industry reacts by increasing the cost of product a by the amount of the subsidy so product a is now priced at $ 15 because the industry knows people already can afford paying $ 10   this is not exclusive to medicine it is also happening with higher education here is a paper that examines the effect of government subsidization of college tuition the study finds that as financial aid increased there was a 102 correlation with the increase in the cost of tuition

yes you can do that and it it wise to do so however you should make sure that the general trend of the stock is upwards and you buy during a in the uptrend so basically if the stock is making higher highs and higher lows on the daily or weekly charts then you would want to buy around one of the higher lows before the ex dividend date if the stock is making lower lows and lower highs then it is in a downtrend so never buy in this instance it is better to miss out on a dividend of $ 1 rather than to buy just for this $ 1 dividend and lose $ 5 or more when the price continues to drop further

this would be my suggestion i would approach the problem thinking about the loss of monthly income you as a couple will be facing due to your wife 's change to a part time job and divide that loss between the two of you this means that if she goes from 2200 to 1100 monthly you 'd be losing 1100 per month   to share this loss you could repay your wife your part of the loss 550 so both of you are 550 euro down however this 550 loss is a bigger burden for your wife than it is for you so this amount could be adjusted to make up for this inequality   to make calculations simple and avoid developing a complicated model you could give the 800 euro above your 3k to your wife for as long as she has to work part time

credit is like dignity it takes a long time to build but a short time to lose your credit history is mostly made up of your prior activity for several years there 's no quick fix to raise your credit score in a short period   paying your student loans on time will help but it will take quite some time for that activity to make a big difference in your credit if you ca n't get approved for a car loan of $ 15k then perhaps it 's time to either reset your expectations or save up enough to make a large down payment on a more expensive car   instead of prepaying your student loans that are not due save up that money for a down payment you can get an incredibly reliable car for much less than $ 15,000 also make sure that you will be able to afford the car payment when your student loans do become due based on your current salary not some hypothetical future salary   another plan drive your car for another year pay off your student loans in that time and then you might have enough credit history to get a better loan

we 'll he provides some figures on the burden on lower income households   it kind of makes sense   even if both middle class households and lower income households consume the same relative amounts of goods there will likely be a higher burden on the poor   it 's by the high tax rate on those goods the only way to remove that higher burden is for the poor to consume less vice than the affluent   that 's an awkward position to hold   it does n't make sin taxes bad public policy   they 're an effective tax strategy that can be dedicated to helping provide other necessary social services   but they can be regressive and push other values at the same time

most folks would loan out money for the purpose of being re loaned   depositing money in the bank is loaning the bank money who will re loan it   buying bond based mutual funds is another way that it could be viewed that people are loaning money for the purpose of the money being re loaned   the reason why banks always have money available for withdrawal is because of the reserve   fractional reserve banking in its simplest explanation is that banks are allowed to take deposits and loan them out so long as they keep a set reserve   if the reserve rate is 10 it 's really much lower and somebody deposits $ 100 then the bank is allowed to loan out $ 90 keeping $ 10 as a reserve   now even with a reserve a bank does run some risk of the deposits being withdrawn faster than the loans are paid back this is called a run   what protects banks most from this is that deposits withdrawals loans and loan repayments all happen at a fairly steady and predictable rate short term so banks are able to judge how many loans they should give out   even when banks do see their reserve depleting they have options   the first and most common is simply getting a loan from another bank   the rule with the reserve is that banks need to meet it at the end of the day so banks will loan each other money overnight for the purpose of making up for the slight fluctuations that occur in a normal business day   if you have ever heard the fed talking about the overnight rate they are talking about the rate banks loan each other money for the night   another common way for banks to make up for a deficit in deposits in a longer term solution is to sell assets   fairly rare for a bank to sell actual physical assets but the loans they hold are assets and they can sell them to other banks   most banks will also hold some bonds that are available to sell   the major functions that allow a bank to be profitable would still apply to the op 's idea   the only real difference would be that commercial banks have direct access to the central banks and the op 's idea would need to have a commercial bank to act as the middle man between the central bank

all of 's reasons to say no are extremely valid there are also two more first the cost of a mortgage is not the only cost of owning a house you have to pay taxes utilities repairs insurance those are almost always hundreds of dollars a month and an unlucky break like a leaking roof can land you with a bill for many thousands of dollars second owning a house is a long term thing if you find you have to sell in a year or two the cost of making the sale can be many thousands of dollars and wipe out all the savings you made from owning rather than renting i would suggest a different approach although it depends very much on your circumstances and does n't apply to everybody if there is someone you know who has money to spare and is concerned for your welfare your mention of a family that does n't want you to work for academic reason leads me to believe that might be the case see if they are prepared to buy a house and rent it to you i 've known families do that when their children became students this is n't necessarily charity if rents are high compared to house prices owning a house and renting it out can be very profitable and half the battle with renting a house is finding a tenant who will pay rent and not damage the house presumably you would qualify you could also find fellow students who you know to share the rent cost

former financial analyst here happy to help you first off you are right to not be entirely trusting of advisors and attorneys they are usually trustworthy but not always and when you are new to this the untrustworthy ones have a habit of reaching you first you 're their target market i 'll give you a little breakdown of how to plan and a starting investment first figure out your future expenses a lot of that money may go to medical bills or associated care do n't forget the costs of modifications and customizations to items so you can have a better quality of life cars can be retrofit to assist you with a you can build a chair lift into a things like that which will be important for mobility all depending on the lingering medical conditions mobility and independence will be critically important for you your past expenses are the best predictor of future expenses so filter out the one time legal and medical costs and use those to predict second for investing there is a simple route to get into the stock market and hopefully you will hear it a lot exchange traded funds etfs you 'll hear the s&p 500 increased by 80 points today on the news the s&p is a combination of 500 different stocks and is used to gauge the market overall you can buy an exchange traded fund as a stock and it 's an investment in all those components there 's an etf for almost anything but the most popular ones are for those big indexes i would suggest putting a few hundred thousand into an s&p 500 indexed etf do it at maybe $ 10,000 per month so you spread the money out and ensure you do n't buy at a market peak and then let it sit there for many years you can buy stocks through online brokerages like scottrade or etrade and they make it fairly easy they even have local offices that you can visit for help stocks are the easiest way to invest once you 've done this you can also open a ira a type of retirement account with special tax benefits and contribute several thousand dollars to it per year i 'll be happy to give more advice if when you need it but there are a number of good books for beginning investors that can explain it better than i. i would suggest that you avoid real estate especially if you expect to move overseas as it is significantly more complicated and has maintenance costs and taxes

yes when exercising a stock option you will be buying the stock at the strike price so you will be putting up your money if you lose that money you can declare it as a loss like any other transaction so if the stock is worth $ 1 and you have 10 options with a strike at $ 0.50 you will spend $ 500 when you exercise your options if you hold those shares and the company is then worth $ 0 you lost $ 500 i have not verified my answer so this is solely from my understanding of accounting and finance please verify with your accountant to be sure

http://www             how to break 90 golf is a lifelong pursuit that will always challenge may entertain and will almost certainly at times   for most players golf scores similar to those consistently seen from our favorite pros may be unattainable   a more reasonable goal for most is to find a way first to routinely break 90 but how do you get there   a few regular adjustments will provide the best opportunities to do so pre shot routine every needs a pre shot routine that happens every time you approach the ball for example during practice always visualize a target plan your shot and try to see the outcome take one or two practice swings to get a feel for the stroke before you step to the ball the key to this is consistency if it happens every time you can begin to take the guesswork out of your game golf    practice more than you play do n’t try to fix your mistakes on the back nine when you are on the course you should n’t be thinking about how to correct your stroke grip stance etc in fact if you ’ve done the work off the course you should n’t have to think about much at all trust your muscle memory to do what you have practiced   practice the minimum to perfect any physical skill it is important to focus on the smallest amount of information possible at one time you can not simultaneously pay attention to the plane of your stroke while thinking about the weight on your left foot and refining your grip try to pick one small thing to focus on at one time and work it into your muscle memory practicing the minimum will allow you to stop thinking about each factor of the game while on the course again the goal of this process is to make your motions automatic and fluid   care less   it may seem counterintuitive but when you step onto the golf course the more invested you are in each shot the less you can rely on the hard work you have put into your game during practice do the work on the driving range so that you do n’t need to worry about it when you need it   http://www

you missed the catch there is always a catch and in this case it is not well publicized    first some background congress both parties in 98 passed graham leach bliley it allowed commercial banks to invest securitize and insure securities it also had privacy provisions which prevented a of a mortgage from providing any personal information about the mortgage that means that as chase wrote these mortgage backed securities they were forbidden by law from telling the potential purchasers the addresses of the houses or ss 's of the purchasers    of course chase did not choose to insure these mbs 's themselves instead they chose a third party like aig because aig could not know personal information about the mortgages and was thus blinded to risk aig chose a middle of the road risk rating something like 2 risk of default    chase fraudulently represented the quality of the mortgages to the people writing the credit default swaps to insure them and to the potential buyers chase knew the mortgages were crap    fraud is fraud and is illegal in security sales even after graham leach bliley however to be clear in this case there does not need to be any faking of paperwork the loans can be passed along blindly with insurance as they were if it could be documented that chase misrepresented the quality of these aaa mbs 's they would be on the hook but the catch is that graham leach bliley offered them a cop out   aig were the real dummies in all this who writes insurance without having a good idea of the risk

you have a few correlated questions here   yes you can there are only a few investment strategies that require a minimum contribution and those are n't ones that would get a blanket recommendation anyway investing in bonds or stocks is perfectly possible with limited funds you 're never too young to start the power of interest means that the more time you give your money to grow the larger your eventual gains will be provided your investment is beating inflation if your financial situation allows it it makes sense to invest money you do n't need immediately which brings us to this is the one you have to look at most you 're young but have a nice chunk of cash in a savings account that money wo n't grow much and you could be losing purchasing power to inflation but on the other hand that money also is n't at risk while there are dozens of investment the two main ones to look at are bonds these are fixed income which means they 're fairly safe but the downside is that you need to lock up your money for a long time to get a better interest rate than a savings account index funds that track the market these are basically another form of stock where each share represents fractions of shares of other companies that are tracked on an index such as the s&p 500 or nasdaq these are much riskier and more volatile which is why you should look at this as a long term investment as well because given enough time these are expected to trend upwards look into index funds further to understand why but this is n't so much about what you should invest in but more about the fact that an investment almost by definition means putting money away for a long period of time so the real question remains how much can you afford to put away for that you need to look at your individual situation and your plans for the future do you need that money to pay for expenses in the coming years do you want to save it up for college do you want to invest and leave it untouched to inspire you to keep saving do you want to save for retirement i 'm not sure if you can start saving via iras and the like at your age but it 's worth looking into or do you want to spend it on a dream holiday or a car there are arguments to be made for every one of those   most people will tell you to keep such a low sum in a savings account as an emergency fund but that also depends on whether you have a safety net i.e. parents and how reliable they are most people will also tell you that your long term money should be in the stock market in the form of a balanced portfolio of index funds but i wo n't tell you what to do since you need to look at your own options and decide for yourself what makes sense for you you 're off to a great start if you 're thinking about this at your age and i 'd encourage you to take that interest further and look into educating yourself on the investments options and funds that are available to you and decide on a financial plan involving your parents in that is sensible not in the least because your post high school plans will be the most important variable in said plan to my first point and answer your main question if you 've decided that you want to invest and you 've established a specific budget the size of that investment budget should not factor into what you invest it in 1 for the record penny stocks are not an investment they 're an expensive form of gambling

john bensin 's answer covers the math but i like the plain english examples of the theory from william   bernstein 's fine book the intelligent asset allocator   at the author 's web site you can find the complete chapter 1 and chapter 2 though not chapter 3 which is the one with the multiple coin toss portfolio example i want to highlight i 'll summarize bernstein 's multiple coin toss example here with some excerpts from the book   another top user @joetaxpayer has also written about the coin flip on his blog also mentioning bernstein 's book bernstein begins chapter 1 by describing an offer from a fictitious uncle fred imagine that you work for your rich but eccentric uncle fred he    decides to let you in on the company pension plan you must pick    ahead of time one of two investment choices for the duration of your    employment certificates of deposit with a 3 annualized rate of return or a most peculiar option at the end of each year uncle fred flips a coin heads you receive a 30 investment return for that year tails a    minus 10 loss for the year this will be referred to as    uncle fred ’s coin toss or simply the coin toss in effect choosing option 2 results in a higher expected return than option 1 but it is certainly riskier having a high standard deviation and being especially prone to a series of bad   chapters 1 and 2 continue to expand on the idea of risk and take a look at various assets markets over time   chapter 3 then begins by introducing the multiple coin toss example time passes you have spent several more years in the employ of your    uncle fred and have truly grown to dread the annual coin toss    sessions he makes you another offer at the end of each year    he will divide your pension account into two equal parts and conduct a    separate coin toss for each half there are four possible    outcomes    being handy with numbers you calculate that your annualized return    for this two coin toss sequence is which is nearly a full    percentage point higher than your previous expected return of    with only one coin toss even more amazingly you realize that your    risk has been reduced with the addition of two returns at the    mean of 10 your calculated standard deviation is now only as    opposed to 20 for the single coin toss dividing your portfolio between assets with uncorrelated results increases return while decreasing risk    if the second coin toss were perfectly inversely correlated    with the first and always gave the opposite result hence outcomes    1 and 4 above never occurring then our return would always be 10    in this case we would have a 10 annualized long term return with zero risk i hope that summarizes the example well   of course in the real world one of the tricks to building a good portfolio is finding assets that are n't well correlated and if you 're interested in more on the subject i suggest you check out his books including the four pillars of investing and read more about modern portfolio theory mpt

1 it does n't have an almost perfect negative correlation its value decays very fast because of time   in fact something like 80 of options expire worthless   they typically have a lifespan of 30 90 days and unless you 're using them as a way to earn excess return you 'll likely just throw away your premium   2 you 're also making some assumptions about correlation and risk reward   you wo n't become wealthy by distributing risk all you can hope for is less volatility maybe that 's what you 're looking for but you can also expect your return to be less than the market over almost any period of time   3 options are n't really for diversifying   furthermore why diversify   it 's a myth that it adds any value   there 's around a 90 correlation for all asset classes since around 2000 so you 're being sold some blue sky if someone tells you otherwise   4 look up prices of put options   1 2 of your portfolio might buy you a handful of options but again there 's a high probability you 'll lose that 1 2 entirely every 30 90 days

you want to know if you should pay cash or use a credit card like cash there are so many benefits to the card like purchase protection cash back and postponed payments that there needs to be a really good reason to pay cash   if you are concerned about the 10 threshold ask your credit card company to raise your limit   if you are indifferent let the merchant decide for you by asking for a discount if you pay cash   the biggest reason is that credit cards when handled make your money work for you by keeping it in less liquid higher interest investments like inflation adjusted t bills you will still be able to access it by using the credit card to float large expenses without liquidating at a loss investment accounts like schwab one are great for this since you can borrow cash at a low interest rate against your securities until your security sale clears

i think she misses a little bit in that thee definitely needs to be some middle ground in due respect she did come from an undergrad at wharton with a background in banking by the time she entered the mba she was well averse in the financial and accounting theory this knowledge can be very useful to those however who chose to pursue the topics she discusses like design comp sci engineering etc as undergrads and are now seeking the business acumen necessary to run organizations    further i would like based on her background that she likely followed a pretty cookie cutter lifestyle throughout most of her career academically followed the path academia laid out etc    like any other experience an mba is what you chose to get out of it if she believed she would further develop accounting and finance skills having already been a wharton undergrad and banker then the fault lies with her yes the pursuit of ideas is extraordinarily valuable to mba 's and arguably they should focus on it more however you are an adult by that point and you should have the maturity and acumen to chose and understand what you want to get out of your degree even if that means sacrificing grades

when your options vest you will have the option to buy your company 's stock at a particular price the strike price a big part of the value of the option is the difference between the price that your company 's stock is trading at and the strike price of the option if the price of the company stock in the market is lower than the strike price of the option they are almost worthless   i say almost because there is still the possibility that the stock price could go up before the options expire if your company is big enough that their stock is not only listed on an exchange but there is an active options market in your company 's stock you could get a feel for what they are worth by seeing what the market is willing to buy or sell similar exchange listed options once the options have vested you now have the right to purchase your company 's stock at the specified strike price until the options expire   when you use that right you are exercising the option   you do n't have to do that until you think it is worthwhile buying company stock at that price if the company pays a dividend it would probably be worth exercising the options sooner options do n't receive a dividend   ultimately you are buying your company 's stock albeit at a discount   you need to see if your company 's stock is still a good investment if you think your company has growth prospects you might want to hold onto the stock   if you think you 'd be better off putting your money elsewhere in the market sell the stock you acquired at a discount and use the money to invest in something else if there are any additional benefits to holding on to the stock for a period of time e.g. selling part to fit within your capital gain allowance for that year you should factor that into your investment decision but it should n't force you to invest in or remain invested in something you would otherwise view as too risky to invest in a reminder of that fact is that some employees of enron invested their entire retirement plans into enron stock so when enron went bankrupt these employees not only lost their job but their savings for retirement as well

your edit indicates that you may not yet be ready to get heavily involved in investing i say this because it seems you are not very familiar with foundational finance investing concepts   the returns that you are seeing as yearly are just the reported earnings every 12 months which all public companies must publish those returns are not the same as the earnings of individual investors which will be on the basis of dividends paid by the company which are often annual sometimes semi annual and sometimes quarterly and by selling shares purchased previously note that over 3 months time investing in interest earning investments like bank deposits will earn you something like 0.5 investing in the stock market will earn you something like 2 but with generally higher risk than investing in something earning interest if you expect to earn significant amounts of money in only 3 months you will not be able to without taking on extreme levels of risk risk as high as going to a casino   safe investing takes time years in the short term the best thing you can do to earn money is by earning more through a better job or a second part time job or spending less budget pay down high interest debt and spend less than you earn i highly recommend you look through this site for more budgeting questions on how to get control of your finances if you feel that does n't apply to you i encourage you to do a lot more research on investing before you send your money somewhere you could be taking on more risk than you realize if you are not properly informed

what you have here is an interesting argument right now this is totally complicated by the state of forced insurance that is currently in such hot debate right now   as a general rule of thumb though most americans pay their medical bills in one way or another though it is also accurate to say that most americans have avoided paying a medical bill at one point or another   i will give an example that will help clarify my wife gets a iron infusion shot one every year or so we choose not to have insurance the cost to us is around $ 275 we know this upfront and have always paid it up front except for one year one year we had insurance the facility that does the charged us $ 23,500 to do the infusion that year the insurance paid $ 275 to them we refused to pay the remaining   $   this is a real example using real numbers   so while we are more then able to pay the normal amount and we could in theory pay the inflated amount we out right refuse to   the medical facility tried to negotiated the amount down to $ 11,000 but we refused they then tried to talk us into a credit plan we refused then they negotiated the entire thing down to $ 500 we refused finally after 2 years of fighting they agreed that the service had been pair for by the insurance and sent us a $ 0 bill   the entire time that facility was more then willing to keep doing this annual service for $ no time were we denied care we did have a dent in our credit for a while but honestly it did n't matter to us wrap up it is fair to say that most americans do pay their medical bills but it is also fair to say that most americans do not pay all their medical bills the situation is complicated and made more so by recent changes   heath insurance is the u.s. is nearly criminal and while some changes have been made in recent years the same overriding truth exists sometimes a medical bill when going through insurance is just plain silly and the only recourse you have as a customer is to not pay it for a while till you get it sorted out

i somewhat agree to alex b 's post   i was a finance manager for 7 years both prime and sub other words bad    the parts he 's 100 right on   hit up you local credit union then your bank   get your financing done first if you can   now 690 credit score is one of 3 bureaus not all banks and lending institutions use all three or the same one   also the score is n't everything   that could be good or bad   the 2 3 range is normally for the 720 + crowd unless its a manufacture   gm ford so on   with rates capping out at around 30 depending on state laws   however 690 should not be 19 on a new or late model car   at 690 at 19 you would have be going for a 70,000 + mile 6 year or older car if i had to guess assuming you have no bk 's and    some times dealerships have to pay banks to get people financed   its hidden in the cost and they by law are not allowed to tell you about it because it can not be passed on to you   however the banks do n't just fund any crazy amount of money either say like 115 of book and   that it   that is where and why they want that big down payment because that is used to off set the finance amount and what you pay   making the dealership money   and i can go on and on and on    but you should always try to get the funding prior   your credit union wo n't charge the hidden fees and they only care about your down payment to see that you are making a commitment   if you are buying used   save out 1500 for future repairs and tires and such   do n't buy paint and such   if you finance thru the dealership and put less than 20 down do buy gap insurance but that s it   i can go on and on but i wo n't   feel free to ask though    and to answer your original only question with not context is there any reason not to put a 35 down payment on a car yes if the money is better served paying off credit cards or long term mortgage assuming you do n't need the write off

you have to be the owner of record before the ex dividend date which is not the same day as the date the dividend is paid this also implies that if you sell on or after the ex dividend date you 'll still get the dividend even if you no longer own the stock   keep in mind also that the quoted price of the stock and on any open orders that are not specifically marked as do not reduce on its ex dividend date is dropped by the amount of the dividend first thing in the morning before trading starts if you happen to be the first order of the day before market forces cause the price to move you 'll end up with zero gain since the dividend is built into the price and you got the same value out of it the dividend in cash and the remaining value in stock as pointed out in the comments thanks you 'll still get a market price for your trade but the price reduction will have had some impact on the first trade of the day source nyse rule also remember that the dividend yield is expressed in annualized terms so a 3 yield can only be fully realized by receiving all of the dividend payments made by the company for the year you can of course forget about individual companies and just look for dividends to create your own effective yield over time but see the final point finally if you keep buying and selling just to play games with the dividends you 're going to pay far more in transaction fees than you will earn in dividends and depending on your individual circumstances you may end up paying more in capital gains taxes

yes that would qualify as a scam to me   i did n't think they could do most of those things especially buying insurance without your permission     when my area was reclassified as a flood area they told me i had to provide proof of flood insurance and if i did n't they would get it for me at a price that might be higher than if i did it myself   but there was no problem with my choice of an online flood insurance company that was much cheaper than my aaa insurance for the same   i think that at least some of the rules are from the underwriter like fannie mae or whoever it is that they work through   i do n't really know all the ins and outs though   i do know that when i had a loan through wells fargo i had to increase my insurance in one area to match the value in another i forget the details but i think i could have reduced coverage in an alternate category if i had so desired

i have several as well acquired the same way as you and i am happy with the idea   they are very stable and that is the reason they pay so little   i do n't think you can get a low risk and medium or high return   the interest does reset every six months so you do get a bit of the market should the fed set interest rates higher you bonds will eventually reflect that bonds and certificates of deposit are just one element of your investment portfolio   put the money you ca n't lose into bonds the money you can into higher risk stocks bonds are great from our grandparent 's perspective because they are not going to lose value my grandparents were depression era folks who wanted that stability   they are trivial to give as gifts   most other investment forms require a heavy bit more of legal work i would think

yes that is not an unusual number in some states the state tax rate is fairly flat and unless you are highly paid the social security and medicare taxes are also flat the big issue is the federal number several things can make make the federal taxes for the early paychecks larger than normal later checks will include these pretax amounts which will reduce the taxable income and the taxes though the net check will get smaller keep in mind that the size of the checks your first year are impacted by the fact that most recent graduates start in the summer the tax tables assume that each of the paychecks you receive will be essentially the same for those recent graduates the 1st real paycheck the average paycheck for the first part of the year this can put you in a higher bracket than you should be and result in a large refund when you file in the spring   you can adjust your withholding numbers after a few checks to counterbalance this of course the numbers will need to be changed back in year two to to avoid under withholding

excess cash = cash equivalents + long term investments current liabilities the problem this calculation of excess cash is that long term investments can be illiquid things like real estate another flaw is that it gives no credit for current assets like receivables which can be used to offset current liabilities the first thing i 'd do is net out current assets and current liabilities then add cash back in   excess cash = current assets current liabilities + cash equivalents it would be nice if gaap would require long term investments to be broken out as a liquid long term investments stocks bonds b illiquid long term investments real estate private equity etc

in its basic form a corporation is a type of privileged democracy instead of every citizen having a vote votes are allocated on the basis of share ownership in the most basic form each share you own gives you 1 vote in most public companies very few shareholders vote because their vote is statistically meaningless and they have no particular insight into what they want in their board this means that often the board is voted in by a ie of shareholders who are actually large institutions like investment firms or pension funds which own many shares of the company now what do shareholders actually vote on you vote to elect individuals to be members of the board of directors bod the bod is basically an overarching committee that theoretically the company in whatever way they feel best represents the shareholders because if they do not represent the shareholders they will get voted out at the next shareholder meeting the board members are typically senior individuals with experience in either that industry or a relevant one ie someone who was a top lawyer may sit on the bod and be a member of some type of legal issues committee these positions typically pay some amount of money but often they are seen as a form of high prestige for someone nearing after retirement it is not typically a full time job it will typically pay far far less than the role of ceo at the same company   the bod meets periodically to discuss issues regarding the health of the company their responsibility is to act in the interests of the shareholders but they themselves do not necessarily own shares in the company often the bod is broken up into several committees such as an investment committee which reviews and approves large scale projects a finance committee which reviews and approves large financial decisions such as how to get funding an audit committee which reviews the results of financial statements alongside the external accountants who audit them etc but arguably the main role of the bod is to hire the chief executive officer and possibly other high level individuals typically referred to as the c suite executives ie chief financial officer chief operating officer etc the ceo is the big cheese who then typically has authority to rule everyone below him her typically there are things that the big cheese can not do without approval from the board like start huge investment projects requiring a lot of spending   so the shareholders own the company and are therefore entitled to receive all the dividends from profits the company earns and members of the board of directors the bod oversees the company on the shareholders behalf and the ceo acts based on the wishes of the bod which hires him her so how do you get to be a member of the board or the ceo you become a superstar in your industry and go through a similar process as getting any other job you network you make contacts you apply you defend yourself in interviews the shareholders will elect a board who acts in their interests and the board will hire a ceo that they feel can carry out those interests if you hold a majority of the shares in a company you could elect enough board members that you could control the bod and you could then be guaranteed to be hired as the ceo if you own say 10 of the shares you will likely be able to elect a few people to the board but maybe not enough to be hired by the board as the ceo   short of owning a huge amount of a company therefore share ownership will not get you any closer to being the ceo

i wrote a little program one time to try to do this   i think i wrote it in python or something the idea was to have a list of projected expenses where each one would have things like the amount the date of the next transaction the frequency of the transaction and so on   the program would then simulate time determining when the next transaction would be updating balances and so on   you can actually do a very similar thing with a spreadsheet where you basically have a list of expenses that you manually paste in for each month in advance   simply keep a running balance of each row and make sure you do n't forget any transactions that should be happening this works great for fixed expenses or expenses that you know how much they are going to be for the next month   if you do n't know you can estimate for instance you can make an educated guess at how much your electric bill will be the next month if you have n't gotten the bill yet and you can estimate how much you will spend on fuel based on reviewing previous months and some idea of whether your usage will differ in the next month   for variable expenses i would always err on the side of a larger amount than i expected to spend   it is n't going to be possible to budget to the exact penny unless you lead a very simple life but the extra you allocate is important to cushion unexpected and unavoidable once you have this done for expenses against your bank account you can see what your low water mark is for the month or whatever time period you project out to   if this is above your minimum then you can see how much you can safely allocate to e.g. paying off debt   throwing a credit card into the mix can make things a bit more predictable in the current month especially for unpredictable amounts but it is a bit more complicated as now you have a second account that you have to track that has to get deducted from your first account when it becomes due in the following month   i am assuming a typical card where you have something like a 25 day grace period to pay without interest along with up to 30 days after the expense before the grace period starts depending on the relationship between your cut off date and when the actual expense occurs

regardless of how it exactly impacts the credit score the question is does it help improve your credit situation if the score does go up but it goes up slowly that was a lot of effort to retard credit score growth   learning to use a credit card wisely will help you become more financially mature start to use the card for a class of purchases groceries gas restaurants pick one that wo n't overwhelm your finances if you lose track of the exact amount you have been charging you can also use it to pay some utilities or other monthly expenses automatically as you use the card more often and you do n't overuse it the credit card company will generally raise your credit limit this will then help you because that will drop your utilization ratio just repeat the process by adding another class of charges to you credit card usage this expanded use of credit will in the long run help your score the online systems allow you to see every day what your balance is thus minimizing surprises

my super fund and i would say many other funds give you one free switch of strategies per year   some suggest you should change from high growth option to a more balance option once you are say about 10 to 15 years from retirement and then change to a more capital guaranteed option a few years from retirement this is a more passive approach and has benefits as well as disadvantages the benefit is that there is not much work involved you just change your investment option based on your life stage 2 to 3 times during your lifetime this allows you to take more risk when you are young to aim for higher returns take a balanced approach with moderate risk and returns during the middle part of your working life and take less risk with lower returns above inflation during the latter part of your working life a possible disadvantage of this strategy is you may be in the higher higher growth option during a market correction and then change to a more balanced option just when the market starts to pick up again so your funds will be hit with large losses whilst the market is in retreat and just when things look to be getting better you change to a more balanced portfolio and miss out on the big gains a second more active approach would be to track the market and change investment option as the market changes one approach which should n't take much time is to track the index such as the asx200 if you investment option is mainly invested in the australian stock market with a 200 day simple moving average sma the concept is that if the index crosses above the 200 day sma the market is bullish and if it crosses below it is bearish see the chart below   this strategy will work well when the market is trending up or down but not very well when the market is going sideways as you will be changing from aggressive to balanced and back too often possibly a more appropriate option would be a combination of the two use the first passive approach to change investment option from aggressive to balanced to capital guaranteed with your life stages however use the second active approach to time the change for example if you were say in your late 40s now and were looking to change from aggressive to balanced in the near future you could wait until the asx200 crosses below the 200 day sma before making the change this way you could capture the majority of the uptrend which could go on for years before changing from the high growth aggressive option to the balanced option if you where after more control over your superannuation assets another option open to you is to start a smsf however i would recommend having at least $ 300 k to $ 400 k in assets before starting a smsf or else the annual costs would be too high as a percentage of your total super assets

if a company is doing well it seems less likely to go bankrupt   if a company is doing poorly it seems more likely to go bankrupt   the problem is where is the inflection point between well and poorly   when does a company start to head into oblivion   sometimes it is hard to know   but if you do n't call that right and hold onto your shares when a company is tanking others who call it before you do will sell off devalue the share price and now you 've missed your chance to get out at a good profit   if you hang on too long the company may just go bankrupt and you 've lost your investment entirely a healthy profitability of the company therefore has to bolster investor confidence in avoiding this very unpleasant scenario   therefore the more profitable a company is the more shareholder confidence it and the more willing to pay for it in the form of increased share price   and this then has a meta effect in that each shareholder thinks all other investors think this way too and so each feels good about holding the stock since he knows he can likely easily liquidate it for good cash if he needs to either now or in the next year or sometime hence

i think i understand what you 're trying to achieve you just want to see how it feels to own a share right to go through the process of buying and holding and eventually selling be it at a loss or at a gain   frankly my primary advice is just do it on paper just decide for whatever reason which stocks to buy in what amount subtract 1 for commissions i 'm intentionally staying on the higher side here and keep track of the price changes daily    instead of doing it on mere paper some brokers offer you a demo account where you can practice your paper trading in the same way you would use a live account as far as i know interactive brokers and saxo bank offer such demo accounts go look around on their web pages   the problem about doing it for real is that many of the better brokers such as the two i mentioned have relatively high minimum funding limits you need to send a few thousand pounds to your brokerage account before you can even use it of course you do n't need to invest it all but still the cash has to be there   especially for some younger and inexperienced investors this can them to gambling most of their money away which is why i would not advise you to actually invest in this way it will be expensive but if it 's just for trying it on one share use your local principal bank for the trade   hope this gets you started

we need to be careful what we are talking about here inflation on a economy level scale at an expected rate will not change consumer habits because the price increase is manageable you have to realize that prices are not increasing in isolation wages will have to rise along too   high inflation that is expected will increase consumption of durable goods as people attempt to get rid of their money before the price changes on them a good example of this was post wwi germany where hyperinflation was so bad that offices began to pay their employees twice daily so they could adjust their wages and so that their employees could go out during lunch and after work to buy something with the money before the price changed on them unexpected inflation may cause a temporary dip in spending until wages adjust however consumers still need to buy so they will likely push for higher wages leading to consumption to stay about level there is another effect to inflation as well people who have savings will have their savings eroded over time if the economy is inflationary to preserve their wealth they will invest it in a deflationary environment money will increase in value simply by being hoarded so they will be less willing to invest it deflation also increases the cost of interest on a loan while inflation decreases it so the overall effect is for an increase in spending under inflation and a decrease under deflation the person you have quoted is quite wrong price increases in a particular sector will cause consumer spending to decrease but this is a bad example as it is not inflation but rather a supply demand problem of a particular consumer good they are applying a micro economic model price increases of a single good to a macroeconomic problem price increases in the entire economy when price increases at a global scale have the opposite effects a good theoretical test of this is what would happen if everyone in the us suddenly had twice as much money ignoring international trade of course the answer prices will double and nothing else will change the reason is people will have more money to spend but will require more money for their services so in the end it all cancels out

yes it is possible for you to refinance your existing auto loan and so long as you can get the loan on more favorable terms e.g. lower interest rate it is absolutely a smart thing to do in fact you would be well advised to do so as soon as possible if the car was a new car if you refinance a new car soon enough you will likely still be able to get new car interest rates even if it is a pre owned vehicle you should n't wait too long since your car will only depreciate in value   you will almost certainly get more favorable terms from any bank or credit union directly then you would when you go through the dealership because the dealership is allowed to mark up your interest rate several percentage points as profit for themselves your best bet would be to go to a local credit union their rates tend to be most competitive since they are owned by their members

gt;it 's tremendously more difficult to make large percentage gains on $ 1 billion than it is to make gains on $ 1 million   this is true however when you consider the 2 and 20 fee structure that is typical of hedge funds it becomes evident why managing more money is generally better with a fund with 1b under management they earn 20 million dollars for turning the lights on even if they only have a 3 return in a given year that 's another six million dollars    a fund managing a million in assets would have to have a return of 40 to net $ 100,000 so while the law of diminishing returns may be working in your favor if you are managing less money if your goal is to make money for yourself it 's pretty clear why managing more money is better

what explains the most of the future returns of a portfolio is the allocation between asset classes in the long term stock investments are almost certain to return more than any other kinds of investments for 40 + years i would choose a portfolio of 100 stocks how to construct the portfolio then diversification is the key you should diversify in time do n't put a large sum of money into your stock portfolio immediately if you have a large sum to invest spread it around several years you should diversify based on company size invest in both large and small companies you should also diversify internationally do n't invest in just us companies if you prefer to pick individual stocks 20 very carefully selected stocks may provide enough diversification if you keep diversification in mind during stock picking however careful stock picking can not be expected to yield excess returns and if you pick stocks manually you need to rebalance your portfolio occasionally thus if you 're lazy i would recommend a mutual fund or many mutual funds if you have difficulty finding a low cost one that is internationally diversified the most important consideration is the cost you can not expect careful fund selection to yield excess returns before expenses however the expenses are certain costs so prefer low cost funds almost always this means picking index funds avoid funds that have a small number of stocks because they typically invest only in the largest companies which means you fail to get diversification in company size so instead of euro stoxx 50 select stoxx 600 when investing to the european market etfs may have lower costs than traditional mutual funds so keep etfs in mind when selecting the mutual funds in which to invest for international diversification do not forget emerging markets it is not excessive to invest e.g. 20 to emerging markets emerging markets have a higher risk but they also have a higher return a portfolio that does not include emerging markets is not in my opinion well diversified when getting close to retirement age i would consider increasing the percentage of bonds in the portfolio this should be done primarily by putting additional money to bonds instead of selling existing investments to avoid additional taxes not sure if this applies to other taxation systems than the finnish one bond investments are best made though low cost mutual funds as well keep bond investments in your local currency and risk free assets i.e. select us government bonds whatever you do remember that historical return is no guarantee of future return actually the opposite may be true there is a mean reversion law if a particular investment has returned well in the past it often means its price has gone up making it more likely that the price goes down in the future so do n't select a fund based on its historical return instead select a fund based on low costs however i 'm 99 certain that over a period of 40 years stocks will return better than other investments in addition to fund costs taxes are the other certain thing that will be deducted from your returns research what options you have to reduce the taxes you need to pay 401-k was explained in another answer this may be a good option some things recommended in other answers that i would avoid

with 40 of your take home available you have a golden opportunity here actually two and the second builds out easily from the first   golden opportunity 1 layoff immunity ok not really immunity most people do n't think of themselves getting laid off and do n't prepare of course it may not happen to you but it can it 's happened to me twice the layoff itself is an emotional burden getting rejected is hard but then you 're suddenly faced with a gut how am i gon na pay the rent if you have no savings it 's terrifying put yourself in that spot imagine that tomorrow you 're out of a job for how many months could you pay your expenses with the money you have three months one not even that   how about shooting for 12 months it 's really really comforting to be able to say i do n't have to worry about it for a year 12 months saved up gives you emotional and financial stability and it gives you options you do n't have to take the first job that comes along   now saving 12 months of expenses is huge but you 're in the wonderful spot where you can save 40 of your income it would only take 2.5 years to save up a year 's worth of income but actually it 's better than that because your 12-month layoff immunity fund does n't have to include the amount for retirement or taxes or that 40 we 're talking about your expenses are less than 60 of take home you 'd only need 12 months of that so you could have a fully funded 12-month layoff immunity fund only in a year and a half   golden opportunity 2 freedom fund do you like your job would you still do it if you did n't need the money if so great but if not why not get yourself into a position where you do n't need it that is build up enough money from saving and investing to where you can pay your expenses forever from your investments the number to keep in mind is 25 figure out your annual expenses and multiply it by 25 that 's the amount you 'd need to never need a job again that works out to a 4 withdrawal rate adjusting for inflation every year with a low risk of running out of money it 's a rule of thumb but smart people doing a lot of math worked it out here you keep saving and investing that 40 in solid mutual funds in a regular taxable account between your savings and the compounding returns off the investments you could easily have a fully funded freedom fund by the time you 're 50 in fact by 45 is n't unreasonable   it could be even better if you live in that high rent area because of the job and would n't mind living were the rents are lower once you quit your target amount would be lower between that working toward this goal and maybe a little luck you might even be able to do this by age 40   final thoughts there are other things you could put that money toward like a house of course the key take away here is to save it and invest it   you 're in a unique position of being able to do that with 40 of your income that 's fabulous but do n't think it 's the norm most people ca n't save that much and once you lose the ability to save that much it 's very difficult to get it back expenses creep in lifestyle wants become needs and so on if you get into the habit of spending it it 's very difficult to shrink your lifestyle back down down to what right now you 're perfectly comfortable with so spend some time figuring out what you want out of life and in the mean time sock that 40 away

some of the information on the form would have been useful to complete the income tax paperwork the next spring it would have had numbers for taxes and interest that were addressed at the settlement it is possible it is mixed in with the next years tax information if i needed a form from 15 years ago i would n't ask the real estate agent i would ask the settlement company they might have a copy of the paperwork they might have to retrieve it from an archive so it could take time and they could charge a fee the local government probably does n't have a copy of the but they do have paperwork documenting the sale price when the transaction took place i know that the jurisdictions in my area have on line the tax appraisal information going back a number of years they also list all the purchases because of the change in ownership and many also list any name changes   you probably do n't want a screen capture of the transactions page but the tax office might have what you need this is the same information that the title search company was retrieving for their report question is there going to be capital gains for a single person there is no gains unless the increase in price is $ 250,000 for a couple it is $ 500,000 i am ignoring any time requirements because you mentioned the purchase was 15 years ago i am also assuming that it was never a rental property because that would require a lot more paperwork

yes   i 've spoken to mortgage officers from various banks who will do conventional loans with anything as low as 3.5 down however there are many more restrictions e.g. normally you can borrow funds from a parent or relative for a down payment in this case that was prohibited if you are already pre approved then your approval letter should state the specifics you need to adhere to   if you would like to modify that e.g. put a smaller amount down then you could still get the loan but your pre approval wo n't be valid i would recommend speaking with your lender and perhaps with a few others as well about the new home you are looking at

the current mortgaged owner would typically not have the right to sell any portion of the house without approval from the bank the bank does n't own the house through the mortgage but they do have a series of rights that in some cases look similar to ownership   remember that a mortgage is just a loan that uses a house as collateral to reduce the risk to the lender in the event of default if it was just a personal loan without collateral then there would be a much higher risk of default and therefore the interest rate would be closer to 20 than 2 but because the loan was taken with collateral that collateral ca n't be sold without the bank 's permission if the bank allowed this to happen then one risk would be exactly as you say that the mortgagee stops paying the bank and the bank no longer is able to recover the full value of the loan on selling the remaining 50 of the house owed as collateral

the benefit is not in taxes when you sell a portion of your stock you no longer have a portion of your stock when you get a dividend you still have a portion of your stock dividends are distributed from the net profits of a company and as such usually do n't affect its growth earning potential much although there may be cases when they do so while the price takes a temporary dip due to the distribution you 're likely to get the same dividends again next year if the company continues being similarly profitable if you sell a portion of your stock at some point you 'll end up with no more stocks to sell

while i agree with this i also think a tiny fraction of that mentality comes from the simple notion that you can find a desk job that pays great so why work a hard manual job that also pays great    take the average worker and tell them you can do manual labor for $ or you can do a desk job for $ most people will pick the desk job for obvious reasons so it 's not just the belief that certain jobs are below them although that is most of it but the simple notion that we were sold over the last 30 years that desk workers in cubicle farms can make as much money as someone working a labor manual job so go for the desk job

you say you want a more stable system recall from your introductory economics courses that money has three roles a medium of exchange here is $ give me goods a unit of account you owe me $ the business made $ last year and a store of value i have saved $ for the future i assume that you are mostly concerned with the store of value role being eroded due to inflation but first consider that most people still want regular currency so as a medium of exchange or accounting unit anything would face an uphill battle if you discard that role for your currency and only want to store value with it you could just buy equities and commodities and baskets of currencies and debt in a brokerage account possibly using mutual funds to store your value trillions of dollars worth of business takes place this way every year already virtual currency was a bit of a dot com bubble thing the systems which did n't go completely bust and are still around have been by money laundering and otherwise remain largely an ignored niche an online fiat currency has the same basic problem that another currency has you need to trust the central bank not to create more money and cause inflation or even just with the funds or go bankrupt get sued perhaps the federal reserve may be jerking us around on that front right now they 're still a lot more believable than a small private institution some banks might possibly be trustworthy enough to launch a currency but it 's hard to see why they 'd bother it ca n't be a big profit center because people are n't willing to pay too much to just use money and an online currency that 's backed by commodities e.g. gold is going to be subject to potentially violent swings in the prices of commodities imagine getting a loan out for your house denominated in terms of e gold and then the price of gold ouch

the stock price is not only based on the general market trend and the stock 's current profitability and prospects but is also based on prediction of how the stock 's prospects might change in the future in almost every case there are professional investors analysing the stock 's future prospects and considering whether it 's over or under values for its current price however even professionals can be totally wrong   if you feel like you have a good grasp on whether the stock will have improving or declining prospects over time then you might be if you 're right equipped to make a sensible decision on whether to hold the stock or not if you do n't think you have a good understanding about the stock then an understanding of the general market direction might at least make stock in general worth holding otherwise you are simply taking a if you know of another stock that has better prospects then ask yourself why you would hold onto the stock that you think will perform worse   but also bear in mind that in my understanding research has shown that on average people who try to pick stocks rarely do better than a random selection and more stock trades means more brokerage which thanks to brokerage losses would mean you will end up doing worse than average unless you really do know better than the market

as already noted options contain inherent leverage a multiplier on the profit or loss the amount of leverage is dictated primarily by both the options strike relative to the current share price and the time remaining to expiration options are a far more difficult investment than stocks because they require that you are right on both the direction and the timing of the future price movement with a stock you could choose to buy and hold forever buffett style and even if you are wrong for 5 years your unrealized losses can suddenly become realized profits if the shares finally start to rise 6 years later but with options the profits and losses become very final very quickly as a professional options trader the single best piece of advice i can give to investors in options for the first time is to only purchase significantly itm in the money options for both calls and puts do a web search on in the money options to see what calls or puts qualify   with itm options the leverage is still noticeably better than buying selling the shares outright but you have a much less chance of losing all your premium also by being fairly deep in the money you reduce the constant bleed in value as you wait for the expected move to happen the market moves sideways more than people usually expect to deeply itm options are the ones that options market makers like least to trade in because they offer neither large nor easy premiums and options market makers make their living by selling options to retail investors and other people that want them like you so connect the dots by trading only itm options until you become quite experienced you are minimizing your chances of being the average sucker all else equal some amateur options investors believe that similar benefits could be obtained by purchasing long expiration options like leaps for 1 + years that are not itm like atm or otm options the problem here is that your significant time value is bleeding away slowly every day you wait   with an itm option your intrinsic value is not bleeding out at all only the relatively smaller time value of the option is at risk thus my recommendation to initially deal only in to deeply itm options with expirations of 1 4 months out depending on how you wish to be with your move timing

you can take out the contributions to your roth tax and penalty free   that 's the good thing anything above the amount you contributed that you withdraw early will cost you ordinary income tax which is higher than capital gains tax plus a 10 percent penalty on that amount so if you have $ 15,000 in the account and $ 5,000 is gains and you withdraw $ 11,000 then you owe tax and penalty on $ 1,000   the penalty is 10 and your taxes high taxes are added to that   pretty bad deal if you kept it in a normal account and paid capital gains tax you just pay 15 or whatever on your gains and you get to offset income tax with your losses via tax loss harvesting so back to your question your idea works even better than you suggested if you only withdraw up to the amount that you contributed you pay no tax   take out any of the gains and you will be penalized more than you would if you just paid capital gains on them   leave those in until you are old enough to take them out penalty and tax free to me contributing to a roth making a bunch of gains on it and withdrawing only the contribution part whenever you want seems to make good sense

it 's not impossible to forecast the future price of a commodity however it 's exactly that an educated guess much like the weather and the further out that prediction is made the higher the percentage error is expected a lot of information is gathered by various instruments etc at a very high cost of time and money to produce a prediction that starts breaking down after about five days and is no more than a wild guess after about ten how accurately a price can be forecast depends on the commodity there are seasonal and thus cyclical changes in many commodities on top of which there is a general trend which is nearer term a pretty decent prediction can thus be arrived at with a relatively simple seasonally adjusted percentage change algorithm take a moving average of the last few measurements compute the percent change versus the same period last year current minus last divided by last and multiply it by last year 's number for the current day or month to arrive at a pretty decent prediction for the current and near future periods up to about as far ahead as you have looked behind another thing you may need to do is normalize many price graphs are very the price of a stock may fluctuate many percentage points on a single day and there 's a lot of noise inherent in them a common tool to normalize is a box and plot which for a given time period will aggregate all samples within that period and give you a measurement of the lowest sample highest sample median and the range of each 25 of the full sample space box plots can also be plotted on the range or middle fifty this throws away the very noisy outliers and a much more regular plot from the inner part of the bell curve you can reverse engineer a best fit line connecting the elements of each box and the closer two lines are the more likely the real future data will be around that area because the between those to lines is very dense 25 of the values are in a very small range meaning many samples occurred there lastly there are outside factors that are not included in simple percentage growth big news must be taken into account by introducing more subjective guesses about future data if you see an active hurricane season coming or a hurricane bearing down on houston then it 's reasonable to assume that the price of oil and/or refined oil products like gas and jet fuel will skyrocket a cyclical growth model will not predict these events but you can factor in the likelihood of a big change with a base onto which you add last year 's numbers and onto that you add regular growth conversely when a huge spike happens due to a non cyclical event like a natural disaster you must smooth it out by reducing the readings to fit in the curve otherwise your model for next year will expect the same anomaly at the same time and so it will be wrong these adjustments are necessary but the more of them you make the less the graph reflects real history and the more it reflects what you think it should have been

assuming be a taxable account and you 're an above average wage earner the following seem to be biggest factors in your decision tax advantaged income w/o retirement account protection so i 'd pick a stock stocks or fund that 's designed to minimize earnings taxable at income and/or short term gains rates e.g. dividends declining risk profile make sure you periodically tweak your investment mix over the 2 3 year period   to reduce your risk exposure    you want to be near savings account risk levels by the end of your timeline   but make sure you keep 1 in mind so probably do n't adjust by selling anything until you 've hit the 1-year holding mark to get the long term capital gains rates in addition to tax sensitive stock bond funds at the major brokerages like fidelity i 'd specifically look at tax free municipal bond funds targeted for your state of residence since those generally pay better than savings on after tax basis for little increase in risk assuming you stick w/ higher rated municipalities

there are two reasons to do a reverse split   those partial shares will then be turned into cash and returned to the investors for large institutional investors such as mutual funds or pension funds it results in only a small amount of cash because the fund has merged all the investors shares together if the company is trying to meet the minimum price level of the exchange they have little choice if they do n't do the reverse split they will be delisted if the goal is to reduce the number of investors they are using one of the methods of going private a publicly held company may its equity securities when they    are held by less than 300 shareholders of record or less than 500    shareholders of record where the company does not have significant    assets depending on the facts and circumstances the company may no    longer be required to file periodic reports with the sec once the    number of shareholders of record drops below the above thresholds a number of kinds of transactions can result in a company going    private including

often in life we have to choose the lesser of evils   whole life as an investment vs. term life and invest the difference is one of these times i assume the following statement is true the commissions on whole life are sick the selling agent gets upward of 90 of your first year 's premium but how does that compare to investing in mutual funds as one alternative    well according to vanguard the average mutual fund keeps 60 of the total returns over the average investors lifetime and of course income taxes on withdrawal consume another 30 or more of the dollars you withdraw from a tax deferred retirement plan like a 401k so you have to pick your poison and make the choice that fits your view of the future personally i do n't believe my cost of living in retirement will be radically lower than my cost of living while working additionally i believe income tax rates will be higher in the future than the in the present and so deferring taxes like a 401k does n't make sense to me   in 1980 a 401k made sense when the average 401k participant was paying over 50 in federal income tax and also got a pension so paying 90 of my first year 's premium rather than 60 of my gains over my lifetime seems acceptable   and borrowing tax free against my life insurance once retired with no intention of paying it back will i believe provide greater income than a 401k could

i am not a lawyer or a tax accountant but from the description provided it sounds to me like you have created two partnerships one in which you share 50 of bob 's revenue and another in which you share 50 of the revenue from the first partnership if this is the case then each partnership would need to file form k-1 and issue a copy to the partners of that partnership i think but i 'm not sure that each partnership would need an employer identification number ein you can apply for and receive these online with the irs you would only pay tax on the portion of profits that are assigned to you on the k-1 if you 've accidentally created a partnership without thinking through all the ramifications you probably want to straighten this out you can be held liable for the actions of your partners on the other hand if your contract with bob explicitly makes you a contractor and not a partner then bob should probably be issuing a 1099 to you similarly for you and joe if your contract with joe makes him a subcontractor then you may need to get an ein and issue him a 1099 at the end of the year the money you pay to joe is a business expense and would be deducted from the profits you show on your schedule c. in my opinion it would be worth the $ 200 fee paid to a good cpa to make sure you get this right

in maryland a landlord must hold your security deposit in an escrow account and pay you interest when returning the deposit   the interest is simple interest it does not compound the interest rate that they must pay has changed over the last 43 years   before october 1 2004 the rate was 4   until january 1 2015 the rate was 3   currently the rate is 1.5 or the simple interest rate accrued at the daily u.s. treasury yield curve rate for one year as of the first business day of each year whichever is greater   this year the rate is 1.5   maryland 's department of housing and community development has a security deposit calculator for easy calculation of this interest however it only works for deposits since january 1 2015 it is unclear to me whether the interest rate in effect is the one that was in place when the security deposit was made or if the rate changes over the years    at most if you get 4 interest every year i would expect you to receive $ which is $ 158 + $ 158 4 43   the interest is accrued every 6 months so you would not get any interest for the 3 months that you rented in your year with the new law that took effect this year interest is accrued monthly at least if the interest rate changes with the new laws i would expect you to receive $ which is $ 158 + $ 158 4 + $ 158 3 + $ 158 1.5 0.5 some text on the security deposit calculator suggests that the laws for prince george 's county are different than the rest of the state   if you are in that county you 'll need to check the local ordinances to see what security deposit policies apply

llc is as far as i know just a us thing so i 'm assuming that you are in the usa update for clarification other countries do have similar concepts but i 'm not aware of any country that uses the term llc nor any other country that uses the single member llc that is disregarded for income tax purposes that i 'm referring to here and that i assume the recruiter also was talking about further llcs vary by state i only have experience with california so some things may not apply the same way elsewhere also if you are located in one state but the client is elsewhere things can get more complex first let 's get one thing out of the way do you want to be a contractor or an employee both have advantage and especially in the higher income areas contractor can be more beneficial for you make sure that if you are a contractor your rate must be considerably higher than as employee to make up for the benefits you give up as well as the fica taxes and your expense of maintaining an llc in california it costs at least $ plus legal advice accounting and various other fees etc on the other hand oftentimes the benefits as an employee are n't actually worth all that much when you are in high income brackets do pay attention to health insurance that may be a valuable benefit or it may have such high deductibles that you would be better off getting your own or paying the penalty for going uninsured instead of a 401(k you can set up an ira update or various other options and you can also replace all the other benefits if you decide that being an employee is the way to go stop here if you decide that being a contractor is a better deal for you then it is indeed a good idea to set up an llc you actually have three fundamental options work as an individual the legal term is sole proprietorship form a single member llc disregarded for income tax purposes or various other forms of incorporation of these i would argue that the single member llc combines the best of both worlds taxation is almost the same as for sole proprietorship the paperwork is minimal a lot less than any other form of incorporation but it provides many of the main benefits of incorporating there are several advantages first as others have already pointed out the irs and department of labor scrutinize contractor relationships carefully because of companies that abused this status on a massive scale uber and now defunct for instance but also fedex and other old economy companies one of the 20 criteria they use is whether you are incorporated or not basically it adds to your legal credibility as a contractor another benefit is legal protection if your client or somebody else sues you they can usually only sue the legal entity they are doing business with which is the llc your personal assets are safe from judgments that 's why donald trump is still a billionaire despite his famous four bankruptcies which i believe were corporate not personal update for clarification some people argue that you are still liable for your personal actions you should consult with a lawyer about the details but most business liabilities do n't arise from such acts another commenter suggested an policy a very good idea but not a substitute for an llc an llc does require some minimal paperwork you need to set up a separate bank account and you will need a professional accounting system not an excel spreadsheet but if you are a single member llc the paperwork is really not a huge deal you do n't need to file a separate federal tax return your income will be treated as if it was personal income the technical term is that the llc is disregarded for irs tax purposes california still does require a separate tax return but that 's only two pages or so and unless you make a large amount the tax is always $ 800 that small amount of paperwork is probably why your recruiter recommended the llc rather than other forms of incorporation so if you want to be a contractor then it sounds like your recruiter gave you good advice if you want to be an employee do n't do it a couple more points not directly related to the question but hopefully generally helpful if you are a contractor whether as sole proprietor or through an llc in most cities you need a business license not only that but you may even need a separate business license in every city you do business for instance in the city where your client is located even if you do n't live there business licenses can range from not needed to a few dollars to a few hundred dollars in some cities the business license fee may also depend on your income and finally one interesting drawback of a disregarded llc vs. sole proprietorship as a contractor has to do with the w-9 form and your social security number generally when you work for somebody and receive more than $ they need to ask you for your social security number using form w-9 that is always a bit of a concern because of identity theft the irs also recognizes a second number the ein employer identification number this is basically like an ssn for corporations you can also apply for one if you are a sole proprietor this is a huge benefit because you can use the ein in place of your ssn on the w-9 instant identity theft protection however if you have a disregarded llc the irs says that you must use your ssn you can not use your ein update the source for that information is the w-9 instructions it specifically only excludes llcs

here is the investing for retirement theoretical background you should have you should base your investment decisions not simply on the historical return of the fund but on its potential for future returns and its risk past performance does not indicate future results the past performance is frequently at its best the moment before the bubble pops while no one knows the specifics of future returns there are a few types of assets that it 's relatively safe to make blanket statements about the future returns of your portfolio will primarily be determined by your asset allocation the general rules look like there are a variety of guides out there to help decide your asset allocation and tell you specifically what to do the other thing that you should consider is the cost of your funds while it 's easy to get lucky enough to make a mutual fund outperform the market in the short term it 's very hard to keep that up for decades on end moreover chasing performance is risky and expensive so look at your fund information and locate the expense ratio if the fund 's expense ratio is 1 that 's super expensive the stock market 's annualized real rate of return is about 4 so that could be a quarter of your returns all else being equal choose the cheap index fund with an expense ratio closer to 0.1 many 401(k providers only have expensive mutual funds this is because you 're trapped and ca n't switch to a cheaper fund so they 're free to take lots of your money if this is the case deal with it in the short term for the tax benefits then open a specific type of account called a rollover ira when you change jobs and move your assets there or if your savings are small enough just open an ira a traditional ira or roth ira and use those instead or yell at your hr department in the event that you think that 'll actually accomplish anything

you will often receive a lower bill if you simply wait for a second or third billing statement i was once given the advice to never pay a medical bill until after they had sent three notices because they will almost certainly reduce the amount due sounds crazy right i have excellent credit so the idea of risking it by ignoring bills disturbed me greatly and i at the advice   i then had a similar experience to you and decided to take the advice by the third statement the bill was reduced to less than half of the original with zero intervention on my part i then paid it without any impact to my credit whatsoever i 've since done that every time i receive healthcare services and the bill is always reduced on subsequent statements generally to less than half of the original bill sometimes it 's because insurance finally got around to paying sometimes a credit is mysteriously added sometimes line items disappear without explanation line items sometimes appear over time too but the overall balance generally goes down i do n't know the reason for it but it works this has happened with a variety of providers so it 's not just one company that does it granted i never called to negotiate the price so i ca n't say if i would've gotten a better deal by doing that i like it because it requires no time or effort on my part and it has greatly reduced my medical bills with zero impact to my credit i only have personal anecdotes to back it up but it 's worked for me

great response thanks i 'll do my best to answer your questions   1 i 'm a genuine believer that everything from calculus to charisma can be taught to most people some people do n't have the intelligence to ever learn calculus for example and some people will only ever be average at it but most people can at least improve in most areas through education    the messed up part is that professors are never formally taught to teach some of the things i listed i implicitly learned in grad school e.g. when doing research i learned how to filter out inaccurate information when writing research papers i learned how to organize information i learned theories of motivation because i was in an org program but i never learned how to apply them especially in a classroom setting i had to figure that out myself but yes i do believe it 's something that can be learned    2 i think the vast majority of work related skills that people develop are learned on the job as you mentioned there are some generic skills students learn in college that can be applied to their work however i 'm thinking of communication and social skills although i 'm probably biased since those are the two topics i teach college it seems to me is more about learning how to follow directions figure things out for yourself and work effectively in groups than any particular subject matter and i think those skills do transfer well to the workplace    3 i 100 agree with this we 're pressured to pass students and inflate grades character issues including being disorganized being dishonest or just being rude are diagnosed as psychological disorders and we have to accommodate students with these disabilities to be clear i 100 believe in psychological disorders and i 100 support accommodating students with these i just think they are these days     totally agree with your last paragraph

because a wire transfer requires the individual bank to bank process it is usually more expensive than an automated clearing house which requires minimal involvement by individuals at financial institutions many ach transactions come with only a small fee or even no fee at all since they are run with more efficiency however if you want a better guarantee that your money will arrive on time it might be worth it to pay the wire transfer fee with both cases it is possible for errors to be made however since you often get to review the information before it is sent with a wire transfer the method is a little more secure also because identities are verified with wire transfers that take place between bank accounts there is less chance of fraud wire transfers that take place between financial institutions are generally considered quite secure from

here are the specific vanguard index funds and etf 's i use to mimic ray dalio 's all weather portfolio for my taxable investment savings i invest into this with vanguard personal investor and brokerage accounts here 's a summary of the performance results from 2007 to today   2007 is when the commodity fund was created so that 's why my results are only tested back that far i 've tested the broader asset class as well and the results are similar but i suggest doing that as well for yourself i use to backtest the results of my portfolio along with various asset classes that 's been tremendously useful my opinionated advice would be to ignore the local investment advisor recommendations nobody will ever care more about your money than you and their incentives are as tony mentions in his book   mutual funds were chosen over etf 's for the simplicity of auto investment   unfortunately i have to manually buy the etf shares each month and gld i 'm 29 and do n't use this for retirement savings my retirement is 100 i 'll adjust this in 20 years or so to be more conservative however when i get close to age 45 50 i 'm planning to shift into this allocation at a market high point   when i approach retirement this is exactly where i want to be let 's say you had $ 2.7 m in your retirement account on oct 31 2007 that was invested in 100 us stocks in feb of 2009 your balance would be roughly $ if you wanted to retire in 2009 you most likely could n't if you had invested with this approach you 're account would have dropped to $ 2.4 m in feb of 2009   disclaimer i 'm not a financial planner or advisor nor do i claim to be i 'm a software engineer and i 've heavily researched this approach solely for my own benefit i have absolutely no affiliation with any of the tools organizations or funds mentioned here and there 's no possible way for me to profit or gain from this i 'm not recommending anyone use this i 'm merely providing an overview of how i choose to invest my own money take or leave it that 's up to you the loss gain from this is your responsibility and i ca n't be held accountable

the literal answer to your question what determines the price of an etf is the market it is whatever price a buyer is willing to pay and a seller is willing to accept but if the market price of an etf share significantly from its nav the per share market value of the securities in its portfolio then an authorized participant can make an arbitrage profit by a transaction creation or redemption that pushes the market price toward nav thus as long as the markets are operating and the aps do n't vanish in a puff of smoke we can expect price will track nav that reduces your question to why does nav = market value of the holdings underlying a bond etf share decrease when the market interest rate rises   let 's consider an example i 'll use us treasuries because they have very active markets are treated as risk free although that can be debated and excluding special cases like tips and strips are almost perfectly fungible and i use round numbers for convenience let 's assume the current market interest rate is 2 and 10-year treasury fund opens for business with $ 100 m invested via aps in 10-year t notes with 2 coupon at par and 1 m shares issued that are worth $ 100 each now assume the interest rate goes up to 3 this is an example not a prediction no one wants to pay par for a 2 bond when they can get 3 elsewhere so its value goes down to about 0.9 of par not exactly due to the way the arithmetic works but close enough and shares similarly slide to $ 90 at this price an investor gets slightly over 2 basis plus approximately 1 amortized capital gain slightly less due to time value per year so it 's competitive with a 3 coupon at par   as you say new bonds are available that pay 3 but our fund does n't hold them we hold old bonds with a face value of $ 100 m but a market value of only $ 90 m if we sell those bonds now and buy 3 bonds to try to replace them we only get $ 90 m par value of 3 bonds so now our fund is paying a competitive 3 but nav is still only $ 90   at the other extreme say we hold the 2 bonds to maturity paying out only 2 interest but letting our nav increase as the remaining term duration and thus discount of the bonds decreases assuming the market interest rate does n't change again which for 10 years is probably unrealistic ignoring 2009 2016 at the end of 10 years the 2 bonds are redeemed at par and our nav is back to $ 100 but from the investor 's point of view they 've forgone $ 10 in interest they could have received from an alternative investment over those 10 years which is effectively an additional investment so the original share price of $ 90 was correct

sounds like you have a in your ear the coinage act does n't restrict you from using foreign currency or lawful commodity or service to fulfill a debt you are free to do that whenever you enter into an explicit or implicit contract with another party if that was n't the case your kid trading his bag of chips for a bag of cookies at lunch would be a criminal act   it does mean that you ultimately must accept us currency to settle a debt following the previous example if your kid gives his friend the bag of chips but the cookies get destroyed somehow before being transferred the friend can offer a couple of dollars to complete the transaction the whole point of the coinage acts is to set a level playing field if you do n't pick one dominant store of value you have a situation where it is impossible to evaluate the cost of goods and services it has nothing to do with some competition with foreign currency a robust modern economy requires an adequate supply of capital and a common reference point for value within the economy think about it further with respect to article 1 section 10 of the constitution would you want a fiscally profligate state like california or new york to be able to print money and compel you as a contractor employee or creditor to accept their scrip as payment or worse require payment in gold or vermont issued dollars but pay you in their money of course not that 's why the federal government controls the currency and a dollar in alaska is the same as a dollar in georgia

with new cars it 's usually the other way around finance at a low apr or get cash back when you buy it outright with used cars you usually do n't know how much they have invested in the car so it 's more difficult to know how low they 're willing to go regardless i do think it 's odd that they would knock 2 k off the price if you finance with them but not if you pay cash the only reason they would do that is if they intend to make at least 2 k in interest over the life of the loan but they have no way of guaranteeing you wo n't refi therefore i suspect they are and would probably close the deal if you wrote them a check or put the cash on the table for 2 k less however if they wo n't budge and will only knock off 2 k if you finance you could finance and pay it off in full a week later just make sure they do n't have any hidden origination fees or pay off early fees

i think the idea here is that because of the way mortgages are amortized you can drop additional principal payments in the early years of the mortgage and significantly lower the overall interest expense over the life of the loan a heloc accrues interest like a credit card so if you make a large principal payment using a heloc you will be able to retire those chunks of debt quicker than if you made normal mortgage payments i have n't worked out the numbers but i suspect that you could achieve similar results by simply paying ahead making even one extra payment per year will take 7 9 years off of a 30 year loan i think that the advantage of the heloc approach is that if you borrow enough you may be able to recalculate lower the payment of the mortgage

that 's a really good idea though in most cases like this the template letter is sufficient someone with legal expertise drafts a template letter with the that this letter will probably have the desired effect under a specific set of circumstances if this set of circumstances apply to you then you can print this letter out and send it   legally a properly worded denial by an individual is no different than the same denial written by a lawyer so unless someone has actually began litigation there 's rarely a necessity to seek legal advice and in most cases firing off a denial or a fuck off letter is more legally advantageous than silence so it might not even be worth it

here 's an answer to a related question i once wrote i 'm here   i can but it takes a significant amount of time    i 'll do a short version which might leave more holes than you like basically traders do n't want to barter because it is hard to find the person with precisely the goods you want who wants to trade for the goods you have thus the need for coupons that represent value in a marketplace then you need to decide who gets to create coupons if too many can issue them problems arise and no one trusts the coupons will be good later eventually you want one large bank nation trader to be able to issue them so everyone has the same level of trust in them and you do n't have the economic inefficiencies of many coupon issuers   next the number of coupons needs to be enough to facilitate trade if the amount of trade increases a lot and the number of coupons does n't increase similarly they become worth more and people start to hoard them this causes deflation which causes less investment which causes less growth which hurts everyone in the long run    if there are too many coupons added this causes inflation which causes people to spent them quicker instead of holding them for reasons i wo n't cover here slight predictable inflation is much better than deflation so remember inflation is slightly preferred note that inflation is often caused not by the number of coupons but by external price changes   now for a modern economy to do well has to watch the economy measure it carefully and add subtract coupons into the system as needed coupons like all money have no real value whatever that means but only have value because the holder expects to be able to trade them later for goods and services you can not eat coupons use them for shelter usually or wear them but you want to trade them for such needs the same is true for paper money gold stones or almost whatever money system one uses money in all these forms is merely an iou tradable for future goods   the fed is tasked among other things with making sure there is precisely enough coupons in the economy to keep trade functioning as well as possible this is very hard to do since there are external and internal shocks to an economy think disaster foreign shutting off resources rapid changes in people 's tastes etc    central banks such as the fed need to be independent of political control since empirical evidence has shown that politicians tend to add more money to the system than is needed because the short term gains give them votes but the long term consequences rapid inflation unemployment lower economic growth are bad for society this is why the fed is largely out of congressional control and large amounts of empirical evidence across hundreds of years and dozens of cultures shows this to be good   note another function of the fed is to be a lender of last resort to help prevent bank panics that were widespread in the 18th and early 19th century something that none of us now remember but it was a real problem i 'll skip that part for now   so now we 're at the point where the fed needs to add subtract coupons from society to do this part justice takes significant time to cover all the reasons why various rules are in place banking reserve requirements for example and you can not learn it from one pass of reading   but i 'll try instead of being like the majority of internet fools that rail against the system try to learn the why of all this and you 'll be much wiser and understand that it is all a pretty good system   one method they use is the interbank lending rate banks have a reserve requirement which is the ratio of coupons they need to have on hand as a ratio compared to the total coupons depositors lent them this is usually around 1:10 the amount deposited that they can lend goes to business loans school loans mortgage loans etc and helps economies grow now when a bank on a given day falls short due to too many withdrawals other banks or the fed offers an overnight loan to meet reserve requirements and the fed sets the interest rate which in turn drives other interest rates in the system   this does not change the money supply very much   secondly the fed sets the reserve requirement which vastly can change the amount of money available to society but they change this rate so rarely all the historical data is on the st. fed site among others that it is not usually an issue i 'll explain below how this can drastically change the money supply though the money multiplier   thirdly and this is the part the poster above seems upset about they conduct open market operations this is the primary means by which the fed exercises control over the number of coupons in play the government like businesses like individuals often needs to borrow money in theory to invest in wise causes like infrastructure or perhaps money making enterprises such as technology and i know what they often use the money for causes many to complain the government like companies offers the sale of various contracts such as bonds to investors who want a place to park some accumulated coupons for safety and they get a return plus some interest so the government sells bonds on the open market to investors banks pensions foreign governments basically to whomever wishes to purchase them at the market rate and the government like many individuals and banks uses these loans to perform day to day functioning and possible smooth out volatility in spending needs by law the fed can not purchase directly from treasury now once on the market these bonds are traded packaged resold etc since they have inherent value and since those owning them want to buy sell them perhaps before maturity date this liquidity ability to sell your goods is necessary fewer would purchase an item if they could not sell it when they desire thus bonds are bought sold and traded and their prices fluctuate based on what the market thinks they are worth just like any good   now the fed can buy sell these bonds on the open market like anyone else so when the fed wishes to increase the money supply they can buy bonds that are not spendable money and inject money into the system note they now hold a bond that had at the time of transaction the same value as the money they injected note investors freely bought these from treasury meaning the market thought at the time of purchase that this was a good it is not the government merely wishing more money into it is market forces that require more money for trades and is selling goods from the marketplace of presumably equal value to the fed this increases liquidity but takes valuable assets from circulation when the fed wishes to shrink the money supply they sell these bonds back into circulation basically by offering better terms than treasury in fact you can find graphs of the fed operations and see how every december they inject money for more christmas need more coupons for more trade and every january they extract some   so open market transactions buying and selling goods at market prices in the marketplace along with other traders is how the fed injects and removes money from the money supply this is the primary mechanism that the fed uses to control the number of coupons in the economy   finally a little about reserve requirements and the money multiplier since it affects so much of the number of coupons in play this also i must simplify drastically each bank needs to hold 1/10 of all deposits in cash the rest can be lent which lands in another bank which again can be lent etc thus each $ 1 deposited can result in loans totalling 9/10 + + + = 9 more dollars many people claim that banks are printing money which is nonsense since each also has an equal debt to pay to the person they borrowed from when all loans are paid back there is no net money gain   however this allows for each $ 1 the fed injects by buying bonds for there to be up to $ 9 in the economy if banks all loan to the fullest banks tend to want to loan since loaned money makes them profit banks used to loan too much and runs on the banks caused significant problems which is why laws were made to require all banks to have the same reserve requirement   now when banks get scared and stop loaning this 9 fold multiplier dries up and the fed has much less on being able to target the proper number of coupons to keep the economy smooth during the recent crash when banks stopped loaning as each dollar was paid back on debts there was significant of available money for transactions and this kills the economy this is the liquidity crisis    hope this helps as i said this is vastly simplified and i can not go into all the reasons and historical items needed to understand it fully it is a vastly complex and necessarily so and takes significant study to grasp the genius of it it 's similar to not being able to understand nuances of particle physics in one go but as you study and work at it you see why things go as they do and you learn all the failed methods the gold standard is one example that were thrown out for many good reasons   cheers

i really like keshlam 's answer your age is also a consideration if you make your own target fund by matching the allocations of whatever vanguard offers i 'd suggest re balancing every year or every other year but if you 're just going to match the allocations of their target fund you might as well just invest in the target fund itself most not all just most target funds do not charge an additional management fee so you just pay the fees of the underlying funds same as if you mirrored the target fund yourself check the prospectus to see if an additional fee is charged or not you may want to consider a more aggressive approach than the target funds you can accomplish this by selecting a target fund later than your actual retirement age or by picking your own allocations the target funds become more conservative as you approach retirement age so selecting a later target is a way of moving the risk reward ratio i 'm not saying target funds are necessarily the best choice you should get professional advice etc etc

my advice would be to invest that 50k in 25 batches across 4 different money markets batch 1 lend using a peer to peer account 12.5k the interest rates offered by banks are n't that appealing to investors anymore at least in the uk peer to peer lending brokers such as zopa provide 5 to 6   annual returns if you 're willing to hold on to your investment for a couple of years despite your pre these investments are relatively safe although not guaranteed i must stress this zopa state on their website that they have n't lost any money provided from their investors since the company 's inception 10 years ago and have a safeguard trust that will be used to pay out investors if a large number of borrowers defaulted i 'm not sure if this service is available in australia but aim for an interest rate of 5 6 with a trusted peer to peer lender that has a strong track record batch 2 the stock market 12.5k an obvious choice this is by far the most exciting way to grow your money the next question arising from this will likely be how do i pick stocks this 12.5k needs to be further divided into 5 or so different stocks my strategy for picking stock at the current time will be to have 20 of your holdings in blue chip companies with a strong track record of performance and ideally a dividend that is paid bi quarterly another type of stock that you should invest in should be companies that are relatively newly listed on the stock market but have monopolistic qualities that is that they are the biggest best and only provider of their new and unique service examples of this would be tesla and just eat moreover i 'd advise another type of stock you should purchase be a sin stock to hedge against bad economic times if they arise a sin stock is one associated with sin i.e. cigarette manufacturers alcohol suppliers providers of gambling products these often perform good while the economy is doing well but even better when the economy experiences a 2007 2008 and type of meltdown finally another category i 'd advise would be large cap energy provider companies such as exxon mobil bp duke energy primarily because these are currently cheaper than they were a few months ago and the demand for energy is likely to grow with the population which is definitely growing rapidly batch 3 funds 12.5k having some of your money in funds is really a no brainer a managed fund is traditionally a collection of stocks that have been selected within a particular market at this time i 'd advise at least 20 of the 12.5k in emerging market funds as the prices are ridiculously low having fallen about 60 unless china brazil india just self destruct or get they will slowly grow again within the next 5 years i imagine quite high returns can be had in this type of funds the rest of your funds should be high dividend payers but i 'll let you do your own research batch 4 property 12.5k the property market is too good to not get into but let 's be honest you 're not going to be able to buy a flat house apartment for 12.5k the idea therefore would be to find a crowd funding platform that allows you to own a part of a property alongside other owners the uk has platforms such as property partner that are great for this and i 'm sure australia also has some such platforms invest in the capital city in areas as close to the city 's center as possible as that 's unlikely to change barring some kind of economic collapse or an strike i think the above methods of investing provide the following 1 diversified portfolio of investments 2 hedging against difficult economic times should they occur and the only way you 'll lose out with diversification such as this is if the whole economic system collapses or all out nuclear war although i think your investments will be the least of your worries in a nuclear war anyway this is the method of investing i 've chosen for myself and you can see my reasoning above feel free to ask me if you have any questions

in theory yes so as long as someone will accept you as a very mature student you plan to never earn over a year for the next 30 years no longer wiped out at 65 you could get a loan slightly unless you fancy doing the course also if you did have to start paying it back since interest rates are currently 6.1 this means the loan is doubling potentially just under every 12 years approx as to the side question of is it fraud   i could n't say   is a student getting maximum loans but planning on being a jobless bum for the rest of their lives and never paying back loans also committing fraud   one could argue yes but i do n't believe a lack of ambition is currently illegal

here is a simple loan payment calculator   if you allow early principal repayment then you should just be able to plug in the new principal amount to find his new monthly payment someone please correct me if i 'm mistaken are you averse to creating a spreadsheet yourself in excel   i suppose it could become quite an undertaking depending on how detailed you chose to get with the interest   seems like it would be more direct and serve the dual purpose of it 's important to agree in advance whether pre payments go to principal or go partly to interest prepaying for periodic amounts not yet due which are mixed principal and interest   it 's a family loan so it probably makes sense to allow the prepayments to pay down principal you do n't need to structure your interest income and prevent him from depriving you of interest income which many bank loans will do   allowing early principal repayment is pretty easy to calculate in your own excel spreadsheet since you just need to know the remaining principal time outstanding and the interest rate note that if you are a us citizen then the interest paid to you will be taxable income to you ordinary income rate   your brother will not be able to deduct the interest payments unless maybe they are used for something like his business or perhaps mortgage   there is no deduction for just a personal loan also if you instead structured it without interest then the interest not charged would be considered a gift under us gift tax law   as long as the annual interest were under the gift exclusion amount $ 14,000 then there would be no gift tax   with no interest and no gift you would not have tax consequences

when you invest in stocks there are two possible ways to make money many people speculate just on the stock price which would result in a gain or loss but only once you have resold the shares others do n't really care about the stock price they get dividends every so often and hopefully the return will be better than other types of investments if you 're in there for the long run you do not really care what the price of the stock is it is often highly volatile and often completely disconnected from anything so it 's not because today you have a theoretical gain because the current stock price is higher than your buying price that you will effectively realise that gain when you sell need i the numerous crashes that prevented this from happening returns will often be more spectacular on share resale than on dividends but it goes both ways you can lose a lot if you resell at the wrong time dividends tend to be a bit more stable and unless the company goes bankrupt or a few other unfortunate events you still hold shares in the company even if the price goes down and you could still get dividends and you can still resell the stock on top of that of course not all companies distribute dividends in that case you only have the hope of reselling at a higher price or that the company will distribute dividends in the future welcome to the next bubble

ok hate speech as a crime has to meet very specific criteria e.g. the group has to be identifiable and your speech has to be unjust harmful and generalized you gave a very good example of that aka the swedish 70 year old lady who said i googled the case muslims burn cars and piss and shit on the streets this is the message not the actual words was to lazy looking deeper into this so she didn't say she saw 1 guy pissing in the streets she knows to be muslim or he just looks like one how do muslims look by the way some i know look like seinfeld characters she said all muslims pissing and shitting in the streets and set cars on fire that s a big difference comments like this are extremely harmful to the mentioned groups because innocent people are branded with negative stereotypes the real world consequence is prosecution and violence which severely limits the freedom of this group why do people fyi people is not a specific group so no hate speech not get this if the same thing happens to a person and not a group it becomes clear e.g. raananh is a liar and steals everything he can and tends to shit on his bosses desk this is widely spread and you apply for a job in a law firm they do not hire you because the boss likes his desk clean harm was done to you you are pissed and sue me because it 's illegal to spread about you you can even do so in the usa omg freedom of speech sweden does many things right and is to this day one of the most open and free countries

this may not apply in your particular situation but i think it 's important to mention when a debt collector does n't act like a debt collector it may be because they are n't actually a debt collector it 's certainly strange that someone called you to collect money from you and when you asked for a simple document they not only got off the phone quickly but they also told you the debt would be cancelled that just does n't make sense why would they cancel the debt why would n't they send you the document my initial impression is that you were possibly being scammed the scam can take on many forms whenever you are called by a debt collector or someone pretending to be one it 's a good idea to verify their identity first more info here

well first problem is usually that you are trying to do too much you end up micro managing once a company becomes large enough this is impossible to keep doing at the same level    if you find that you do n't have enough time maybe it 's time to either hire someone new or promote transfer someone you need to trust and give freedom to your employees to do their job in their own way which may or may not be better than yours communicate with each at intervals    a lot of business owners struggle with this because it costs them money and that is wrong it 's cost your company money which is a separate entity than you a piece of property that makes you less money than the week before is still making you money you are not losing money so get that out of your head it 's not your money until you take it out of the business until then that money including profits are the property of the business this is how the law see it by the way    marginally an understaffed store will make a larger percentage of profits from revenue a well staffed store will make more actual profits from more actual revenue because it can handle the business coming into the store better which in turns should lead to more business on a particular day you may see more money in profit from an understaffed store someone calls out let 's say   but trust me when i say that will not continue for very long    on of the biggest challenges new business owners face is they are as in they do n't spend the money they need to this means buying new equipment and hiring and giving raises and promotions so you can handle new business as well let say you are making t shirts or really adding new designs to pre made plain shirts you can only press one at a time which for a while is enough but eventually you are going to need another press so you can do 2 at a time but a lot business owners will somehow expect an employee to produce more with what he has now orders are n't being filed and you are in a panic and possibly angry but guess what you are angry at the employee not the fact you were to stupid to realize that he needs 2 presses to do the job correctly that 's your own fault and you 're blind to it because you feel as if you are working twice as hard than them because of the problem you created and let 's say the problem is different now the press is n't getting hot enough and it take 20 per shirt to get it to stay on correctly and you decide to never fix it then a light goes out then blank then blank and suddenly you realize finally all of this needs to be replaced at the same time i 've seen things like this happen in new and old businesses things work fine for the first 5 years then normal maintenance is forgotten have a depreciation fund ready so it does n't feel like you are spending any money that 's what that fund is for and you put into it from the beginning need a $ 2k equipment i have $ 4k saved for this already it was money intended to be spent on this    but of course some of this is going to depend on the type of business you are running and since you have provided us no details i ca n't give an answer for you because all businesses are different but i feel that these things refusing to give freedom and authority to other employees and refusing to spend money when needed are the biggest pitfalls most business owners fall into

in general if there are no transactions for several years a bank will close the account in my experience they also send at least one warning notice if they do close the account they send it to the state each state has an unclaimed property office you can contact them regarding the procedure to get the money if this money was just turned over to the state there may be some lag time before you can get it back two notes the state government does n't charge a fee to get your money back do n't pay a company a finder 's fee bank account 's owned by minors do n't have the same activity requirements as those owned by adults

you must mean the current debt ceiling debacle the meaning of it is us government is constantly borrowing money by issuing treasury bonds and constantly repaying some of the bonds that come to maturity and also has other obligations it has to meet by law all the time such as social security checks bonds interest federal employees salaries and pensions etc by law total amount of money that can be borrowed at the same time is capped that means there can be situation where the government needs to borrow money to pay say interest on existing bonds but can not since the limit is reached such situation is called a default since the government promised to pay the interest but is unable to do so that does not mean the government has no money at all and will completely collapse or could n't raise money on the market if it were permitted by law to do so currently the market is completely willing to buy the debt issued by us government and with interest that is not very high though of course that may change it also does not mean the economy ceases to function dollars cease to have value or banks instantly go bankrupt but if the government breaks its promises to investors it has various consequences such as raising the costs of borrowing in the future breaking promises to other people like social security recipients would also look bad and probably hurt many of them going back to your bank account most probably nothing would happen to the money you store there even if the bank had invested 100 of the money in us treasury bonds which does n't really happen they still can be sold on the open market even if with some discount in the event of credit rating downgrade so most probably your account would not be affected as stated in another answer even if the fallout of all these causes a bank to fail there 's fdic and if your money is under insured maximums you 'll be getting your money back but if your bank is one of the big ones nothing of the sort would happen anyway as we have seen in the past years government would do practically anything to not allow any big bank failures

there are two key reasons consider a family of four two kids and two adults that has a net worth of $ 20 million each of these four people live in a top 1 household but any of those four people can die and their estate will not pay any estate tax both kids and one spouse can die and still no estate tax will be paid only when the last spouse dies would there be any estate tax also consider a person who dies but whose assets do not flow into their estate for example their assets could be held in an inter trust people with higher net are much more likely to use trusts to avoid or minimize estate taxes

while jb king says some useful things i think there is another fundamental reason why stock markets go down after disasters either natural or man made   there is a real impact on the markets in the case of something like 9/11 due to closed airport higher security costs closer inspections on trade goods tighter restrictions on visas real payments for the rebuilding of destroyed buildings and insurance payouts for killed people and eventually the cost of a war but almost as important is the uncertainty and risk nobody knew what was going to happen in the days and weeks after an attack like that is there going to be another one a week later or every week for the next year will air travel become essentially impractical will international trade be severely restricted all those would have a huge massive effect on the economy you may argue that those things are very unlikely even after something like 9/11 but even a small increase in the likelihood of a catastrophic economic crash is enough to start people selling there is another thing that drives the market down even if most people are sure that there wo n't be a catastrophic economic crash they know that other people think there might be and so will sell that will drive the market down if they know the market is going down then sensible traders will start to sell even if they think there is zero risk of a crash this makes the effect worse eventually prices will drop so far that the people who do n't think there is a crash will start to buy so they can make a profit on the recovery but that usually does n't happen until there has been a substantial drop

quickly check the escrow balance with the new lender what was supposed to happen is that the old lender would send the money they were holding in escrow to the new lender with information regarding how it was calculated and what you should be charged each month the new lender would continue servicing the escrow at the same monthly rate until they did a yearly or semi annually re analysis of the escrow account this is how all the mortgage transfers that i have had happened as long as it was n't due to a refinancing of the loan if it was a refinancing the escrow transfer was done at closing he said that they close the escrow account and refunded it and they    start a new escrow with the new lender the new company would not want to have the money sent to you because they would now have to require you to send the money on to them there could be a gap of several weeks they would have to pay any bills that come due during that gap without the cash in the escrow account if the escrow account is either zero or very low expect that the new company will be sending you a notice the old lender could have convinced the new lender to refund the money back to them or the old lender never transferred the funds if a notice comes from the new lender failure to replace the money will put your loan into default if the sum of money is large they may have to increase the monthly escrow amount to make it up in 6 to 12 months after that period the monthly escrow will return to a more reasonable level if the old lender comes after you expect that the request wo n't be over the phone   one thing the old lender could do is to request the loan be transferred back to them the funds would then flow back to their company but your escrow balance would now be zero and they would now up your monthly escrow amount to get back on track

you can not get your investment out and leave only the capital gains until they become taxable at the long term rate when you sell some shares after holding them for less than a year you have capital gains on which you will have to pay taxes at the short term capital gains rate that is at the same rate as ordinary income   as an example if you bought 100 shares at $ 70 for a net investment of $ 7000 and sell 70 of them at $ 100 after five months to get your initial investment back you will have short term capital gains of $ 30 per share on the 70 shares that you sold and so you have to pay tax on that $ the other $ 4900 = $ is tax free since it is just your purchase price of the 70 shares being returned to you   so after paying the tax on your short term capital gains you really do n't have your   initial investment back you have something less the capital gains on   the 30 shares that you continue to hold will become long term capital gains income to you only when you sell the shares after having held them for a full year or more the gains on the shares sold after five months are taxable income in the year of sale

this is a common occurrence i know people who moved and then only remember the next spring during tax season that they never filed a new state version of a w-4 which means for 3 or 4 months in the new year money is sent to the wrong state capital and way too much was sent the previous year in the spring of 2016 you should have filed a non resident tax form with michigan on that form you would specify your total income numbers your michigan income numbers and your other state income numbers with michigan + other equal to total that should have resulted in getting all the state taxes that were sent to michigan returned   it is possible that the online software is unable to complete the non resident tax form not all forms and situations can be addressed by the software so you may need to fill out paper forms you should be able to find what you need on the state of michigan website for 2015 taxes a quick read shows that you will probably need the michigan 1040 schedule 1 and schedule nr you may run into an issue if your license car registration voter registration and other documentation point to you being a resident for the part of the year you earned that income that means you will have to submit form statement to determine state of domicile you want to do this soon because there are deadlines that limit how far back you can files taxes the state may also get tax information from the irs and could decide that all your income from 2015 should have applied to them so they will be sending you a tax bill plus penalties for failure to file

in my experience they charge you coming and going for example if a brokerage firm is advertising that their commissions are only $ then that means you pay money to buy the stock plus $ 7 to them and later on if you want to sell that stock you must pay $ 7 to get out of the deal   so if you want to make any money on a stock say priced at $ 10 you would have to sell it at a price above $ that kind of sale could take a few years to turn a profit however with flat rate fees like that it is advantageous to buy in bulk

a is a promise to engage in or refrain from a specified action every company must do a balancing act while declaring the dividends in terms of companies interest can it use the surplus cash to generate more revenue to shareholders interests giving back to them the profits that due many countries have regulations governing as to when and how much the dividends may be given it also lays out the policy about declaring dividends to protect everyones interest for example if the company has a huge suit pending against it the company is not supposed to distribute the surplus cash as dividends and when the suit goes against it its left when no money to pay or other such examples where the interests of one or the other party is compromised the company law board ensures that all this is to in a fair manner so essentially these covenants include provisions about passing dividends means that due diligence has be exercised by the company in order to arrive at the dividends that are to be paid out

without providing direct investment advice i can tell you that bond most assuredly are not recession proof   all investments have risk and each recession will impact asset classes slightly differently before getting started bonds are loans   you are loaning money   do n't ever think of them as anything but that bonds loans have two chief risks default risk and inflation risk    default risk is the most obvious risk this is when the person to whom you are loaning does not pay back   in a recession this can easily happen if the debtor is a company and the company goes bankrupt in the environment inflation risk is a more subtle risk and occurs when the fixed interest rate on your loan yields less than the inflation rate   this causes the real value of your investment to depreciate over time    the second risk is most pronounced when the bonds that you own are government bonds and the recession causes the government to be unable to pay back its debts   in these circumstances the government may print more money to pay back its creditors generating inflation

no having to borrow money does not necessarily mean a company will have a hard time paying the interest on it similarly having to take out a mortgage on a house does not mean a person will not be able to make their mortgage payments borrowing money can be a way to spend future money instead of present money at a cost of course a company might not have all that money at the moment but that in no way implies they wo n't have it in the future and as you to in your question where you talk about funding some plans a company might be able to grow itself possibly increasing future profits by borrowing money

your analogy is a poor representation of my point my point being that finding success in life is hard no matter what you want to do an idea that is consistent in all ideologies    well it is solely controlled by s d kinda the things you listed all affect s d which controls the market of course there will always be waves of new graduates to fill min wage jobs because most everyone can do them that was kinda my point it 's not so much the company controlling demand as it is the company adjusting to it if there are an abundance of min wage jobs relative to the amount of workers they would n't be min wage jobs this premise of s d is in no way unique to capitalism and even the fluctuations in compensation to mirror your contribution and skills is n't unique to capitalism   sure capitalism favors those with more capital which is the point in order to acquire capital you need to do productive things which are productive to some degree to society as a whole so acquire more see it 's so easy

he 's misunderstanding buffett 's argument which is that all forms of investment compete and so when interest rates give you guaranteed low returns it makes sense for stocks to give you average low returns   that implies high prices for current stocks because your return on equities is the price tomorrow over the price today   buffett would likely agree with him that this implies slow growth in the future though he may not want to say so for competitive reasons   historical p e norms are a more wrong metric because they do n't capture any fundamental change that might have happened in the economy   what 's likely going on is a surplus of capital as business becomes more efficient i.e. generates more revenue with fewer workers that excess cash flow becomes investable capital but as it becomes more efficient i.e. less of that revenue filters down to workers in the form of wages that they can spend on consumer goods the amount of productive uses where that capital can be effectively deployed in income generating activities declines   more capital + fewer investable opportunities = higher supply + lower demand = the price of securities for the few areas of the economy that are doing well increases   this is why you see insane valuations for tech companies   if we do get a major economic crash it will likely come from a style financial crisis where all the money gets concentrated within emerging new industries focused on new technology who ca n't sell their products because nobody else has any money   we 're on the path to that already but it will likely take a decade or two to play out there 's still a lot of money left in the old economy which can be extracted   also these style of financial crises usually are accompanied by war and a breakdown of the established political order and so all bets are off anyway

the article john cites says no correlation but this chart from the article says otherwise   one sees the rate drop from 14 to 4 and housing rise from an index of 50 to near 190 reaching over to my ti ba-35 calculator i see that at 14 $ 1000/mo will buy $ worth of mortgage but at 4 it will buy $ 2 1/2 times the borrowing power for the same payment but wait my friends at west egg tell me that inflation means i ca n't compare $ 1000 in 1980 to the same $ 1000 in 2010 the $ 1,000 inflates to $ i.e. an income rising only with inflation no more and that can fund a mortgage for $ this is 6.5 times the original borrowing power yet the housing index only rose see that crazy chart housing actually got cheaper from 1980 to the peak statistics can say whatever you wish   interest rate change drove all the change in housing prices but not quite as much as it should have   to answer your question i expect that when rates rise and they will housing prices will take a hit in today 's dollars a current $ 1000 borrows at 4 nearly $ 210 k but at 6 just $ if rates took a jump from these record lows that 's the nature of the risk you 'd take

organize your expenses in order of the rate of return and pay them in that order   by far the highest rate of return on your list is nowhere else are you going to see an immediate 100 return or 50 depending on the company 's matching policy on every dollar you allocate to this pot second would probably be money that you do not allocate here will usually incur a penalty   outside of large expenses like a home education or a reasonable car you never want to pay to use your own money and borrowed money is still yours remember that someday you have to pay all of it back   avoiding a negative rate of return interest can be just as beneficial as finding a high positive rate of return on an investment continue down the list determining what must be paid first and what the highest rates are in the immediate future and the long run   meanwhile live within your means and set aside a portion of your monthly income towards things like a rainy day fund up to a level which is not touched when reached   additional savings through work or your personal investments should not be neglected money saved early and compounded is worth many times what a dollar saved down the road will gain especially if you are young in your career

if you want a ~12 rate of return on your investments too bad for returns which even begin to approach that you need to be looking at some of the riskiest stuff think emerging markets even funds like vanguard emerging markets etf mutual fund or fidelity advisor emerging markets income trust seem to have yields which only push 11 or so   but inflation is about nil so if you 're used to normal 2 inflation or so these yields are like 13 or so and there 's no tax on that last 2 yay remember that these investments are very risky they go up lots because they can go down lots too do n't put any money in there unless you can afford to have it go missing because sooner or later you 're likely to lose something half your money and it might not come back for a decade or ever investments like these should only be a small part of your overall portfolio so that said sites which make investing in these risky markets easy there are a good number but you should probably just go with their funds have low fees which wo n't erode your returns you can actually get lower expense ratios by using their brokerage account to trade the etf versions of their funds commission free though you 'll have to worry more about the actual number of shares you want to buy instead of just in and out dollar amounts you can also trade vanguard etfs and other etfs at almost any brokerage just like stocks and most brokerages will also offer you access to a variety of mutual funds as well though often for a hefty fee of $ which you should avoid or you can sign up for another fund providers account but remember that the fund fees add up quickly   and the better plan just stuff most of your money in something like vti vanguard total stock market index instead

no one can advise you on whether to hold this stock or sell it your carried losses can offset short or long term gains but the long term losses have to be applied to offset long term gains before any remaining losses can offset short term gains your question does n't indicate how long you have to hold before the short term gains become long term gains obviously the longer the holding period the greater the risk you also must avoid a wash sale selling to lock in the gains reset your basis then repurchasing within a month all of those decisions hold risks that you have to weigh if you see further upside in holding it longer keep the investment do n't sell just to try to maximize tax benefits

first of all to answer the basic question is one method correct might it depend on local laws yes it does depend on local laws because ultimately the business will have to file forms with the county city   these forms are going to ask for the total sales based on the tax category tax free x% y% each transaction could have parts that fall into each category the local taxing authority decides what goes into each category the local taxing authority also determines how often the business needs to submit the taxes they can even decide to base the rates used by where the customer lives   a business is not required to charge directly for sales tax that is why frequently at sporting events the price on the menu notes that all sales taxes are included i suppose not directly charging a sales tax makes the monthly calculation harder but the state will still get their money rounding up at the end of the entire transaction is enough to make sure they collect enough taxes so they do n't have to dip into their profits

an addition to the other answers more than a real answer i suspect note that fees are not the only way that you pay for foreign exchange where no foreign exchange fee is charged the issuer makes it back by giving an appalling spread on the rate be very careful not to go for a card that has no fees but an exorbitant spread i personally would open a cad denominated account in canada and convert a larger amount into that account when cad is historically weak the spreads will be better that way but do n't attempt to use it to mitigate exchange rate risk or to trade the two currencies for profit as that way madness and lie

this means that if your capital under my management ends up turning a profit i will keep half of those profits but if i lose you money i will cover half those losses the bold part is where you lose me this absolutely exists with the exception of the loss insurance   it just requires a lot more than the general retail consumer investor has to contribute   nobody wants to take on the responsibility of your money then split 50 of the gross proceeds of your $ 10,000 or whatever nominal amount of money you 're dealing with investment and return it all to you after a year   and no money manager will insure that the market wo n't decline hedge funds pe firms vc firms investment partnerships etc all basically run the way you 're describing again without your loss insurance   everyone 's money is pooled and investments are made   everyone shares the and everyone shares the losses   and to top it off the people making investment decisions have their money invested in the fund   all of them have to pay rent and accountants and other costs associated with running the fund and that will eat in to the proceeds to some degree because returns are calculated on net proceeds with enough money you can buy yourself in to a hedge fund for the rest of us there are etfs and other extremely fee reasonable investment options   and if you do n't think the performance and preservation of assets under management is not an incentive to treat the money with care you 're kidding yourself your first bullet point i 'll add that aside from skewing the manager 's risk tolerance toward guaranteed returns i doubt you would fair favorably over the long term compared to simply paying even an egregious 1 expense ratio on an etf   if you look at the s&p performance for 10 or 20 or however many years i 'd venture that a couple good years of giving up half of your gains would have you screaming for your money back   the bad years would put the money manager out of business and the good years would squander your gains

not everything is about marginal utility and trying to define people by their marginal utility is almost sociopathic     guess what labor is n't that interchangeable and markets are far from perfect   what is the other option other than government help   let these people starve and live on the street because they ca n't afford anything else   that is a great way to ruin a society

because the value of distressed assets is close to what they are selling for    when you lend money you know there is a risk of default   you gamble on that risk and you take the responsibility if you lose because the person taking the money ca n't pay   people who buy distressed debt on the idea that they can make more money off of it are only able to do that in two ways   not giving a shit what the impacts of wringing more money out create figuring out a legal way to make someone else pay for it through ripple effects other people also are impacted when a country ca n't function   if you back klarman you may say the point is you are teaching puerto rico and everyone else that they should n't take on debt they ca n't afford    but when has that ever worked   the pensioners who are bankrupt are the ones actually getting the pain of the lesson   another lesson could be to investors not to lend to people who ca n't pay them back   the people lending the money are the ones who now do n't have it because they made a bad choice     seth klarman could also learn a lesson about taking on distressed debt being a non lucrative pastime   or we can all learn a lesson that taking on distressed debt is very lucrative   a big change america implemented was getting rid of debtor 's prisons   this looks a lot like getting excited about debtor 's prison to me   edit   i should note i am thinking of the version of making a ton of money off of distressed national debt   as opposed to making a bit more money off of distressed debt because you were willing to let the collapse figure itself out   though i 'm not so sure about that either

former wfm team member here about a decade and still have a lot of store management staff as friends   wfm has always wanted to be the tech company of grocery stores but their implementation strategy has been absolutely worthless and piecemeal due to their method of expansion in in the 90s and early 2000s where they would buy up regional organic grocery chains across the nation and pretty much just integrate them into the company as a separate entity   imagine wfm as really 7 different companies that have almost zero in common with each other from policies to product selection to buyers to computer systems so they 've never been able to get the it part of their business to be effective even though they 've desperately wanted to because every region has had different it that was n't entirely compatible with the others   on top of that they tried to upgrade the current systems to a perpetual inventory system that did not work you ca n't just modify current systems to be fundamentally different from what their original intended function was   with amazon coming in hopefully they can gut the system and start over fresh using wfm 's current regional distribution as a hub for expanding their own product offerings honestly i think amazon was looking at its seattle store with no employees as a prototype for what they could achieve with an actual chain   a lot of what 's holding wfm back on the price of their products is that they huge distribution costs they 're relying on which is in my experience not exactly great if amazon can utilize what they do well inventory management shipping technology and business support services i think they can decrease the cost of their products by the 20 25 target they need to hit to remain competitive in natural and organic foods because right now they 're getting absolutely by kroger trader joe 's walmart sprouts and so many others

technically you owe self employment taxes not fica taxes because they are imposed under a different law however since se taxes are by design exactly the same rates as combining the two halves of fica employer and employee it is quite reasonable to treat them as equivalent se taxes and income tax also are based on your net self employment income after deducting business expenses but not non business items like your home mortgage dependent exemptions etc which factor only into income tax you owe se medicare tax 2.9 on all your se net income unless it is under $ 400 adjusted down by 7.65 to compensate for the fact that the employer half of fica is excluded from gross income before the employee half is computed you owe se social security tax 12.4 on your adjusted se net income unless and until the total income subject to i.e. your w-2 wages plus your adjusted se net income exceeds a cap that varies with inflation and is $ for 2017 otoh if income exceeds $ 200k single or $ 250k joint you owe additional medicare tax 0.9 on the excess if your w-2 income alone exceeds this limit your employer should withhold for it however the additional medicare tax is part of obamacare ppaca which the new president and republican have said they will repeal and replace whether any such replacement will affect this for ty 2017 is at best uncertain at this point yes se taxes are added to income tax on your 1040 with schedule se attached and schedule c e f as applicable to your business virtually so if you file electronically and paid together you are supposed to pay at least 90 during the year by having withholding increased on your w-2 job or by making quarterly estimated payments irs quarters are not exactly quarters but close or any combination but if this is your first year which you do n't say but someone who had gone through this before probably would n't ask you may get away with not paying during the year as normally required specifically if your w-2 withholding is not enough to cover your increased taxes for this year because of the additional income and se taxes but it is enough to cover your tax for the previous year and your agi that year was n't over $ 150k then there is a safe harbor and you wo n't owe any penalty although you must keep enough money on hand to pay the tax by april 15 but for your second year and onwards your previous year now includes se amounts and this does n't help similar related

p e alone would not work very well see for example and in short p e is affected too much by cyclical changes in profit margins or you might say booms inflate the e beyond sustainable levels thus making the p e look more favorable than it is here 's a random blog post that points to schiller 's normalized earnings measure i think even price to sales is supposed to work better than p e for predicting 10-year returns on a broad index because it effectively normalizes the margins normalized valuation explains the variance in 10-year returns better than the variance in 1-year returns i think i 've read you ca n't rely on things reverting to mean in only 1 year another issue with p e is that e is more subject to weird accounting effects than for example revenues for example whether stock compensation is expensed or one time write offs are included or whatever can mean you end up with an economically strange earnings number btw a simple way to do what you describe here would be to put a chunk of money into funds that vary equity exposure for example john hussman 's fund has an elaborate model that he uses to decide when to hedge say you invest 40 bonds 40 stocks and 20 in hussman strategic growth when hussman fully hedges his fund you would effectively have 40 in stocks and when he fully it you would have 60 in stocks this is n't quite the whole story he also tries to pick up some gains through stock picking so when fully hedged the fund is n't quite equivalent to cash more like a market neutral fund for hussman funds in particular he 's considered stocks to be overvalued for most of the last 15 years and the fund is almost always fully hedged so you 'd want to be comfortable with that there are other funds out there doing similar stuff there are certainly funds that vary equity exposure though most not as dramatically as the hussman fund some possibilities might be pimco all asset all authority pimco multi asset perhaps or just some value oriented funds with willingness to deviate from benchmarks definitely read the prospectus on all these and research other options i just thought it would be helpful to mention a couple of specific examples if you wanted to stick to managing etfs yourself morningstar 's premium service has an interesting feature where they take the by hand bottom up analysis of all the stocks in an etf and use that to calculate an or under valuation ratio for the etf i do n't know if the morningstar bottom up stuff necessarily works i 'm sure they make the pro case on their site on the con side in the financial crisis bubble bursting they cut their valuation on many companies and they had a high valuation on a lot of the financials that blew up while i have n't run any stats and do n't have the data in several specific cases it looked like their bottom up analysis ended up assuming too high profit margins would continue broad brush normalized valuation measures avoided that mistake by ignoring the details of all the individual companies and assuming the whole index had to revert to mean if you 're rich i think you can hire gmo to do a varied equity exposure strategy for you   you could also look at the fundamental indexing etfs that weight by dividends or p e or other measures of value rather than by market cap the bottom line is there are lots of ways to do tactical asset allocation it seems complex enough that i 'm not sure it 's something you 'd want to manage yourself there are also a lot of managers doing this that i personally am not comfortable with because they do n't seem to have a discipline or method that they explain well enough or they do n't seem to do enough backtesting and math or they rely on macroeconomic forecasts that probably are n't reliable or whatever all of these tactical allocation strategies are flavors of active management i 'm most comfortable with active management when it has a fairly objective and logical discipline to it such as style value investing hussman 's statistical methods or whatever it is   many people will argue that all active management is bad and there 's no way to distinguish among any of it i am not in that camp but i do think a lot of active managers are bad and that it 's pretty hard to distinguish among them and i think active management is more likely to help with risk control than it is to help with beating the market still you should know and probably already do know but i 'll note for other readers that there 's a strong argument smart people make that you 're best off avoiding this whole line of tactical allocation thinking and just sticking to the pure cap based index funds

sadly people with millions of dollars rarely give it away to complete strangers that they found at random on the internet in exchange for trivial efforts anyone who claims to be willing to give you millions of dollars for just about nothing in return is almost certainly pulling a scam it does n't matter if you ca n't figure out how they 're going to cheat you they have plan   just because your father has no money does n't mean he ca n't be robbed the scammer is almost surely planning to move some money around and leave your father with a debt that he will be legally obligated to pay she 'll then take off with the money of course you figured out that the picture is fake it may not even be a pretty young girl that may well just be a persona the scammer created to appeal to your father it might really be a fat old man your father would be smarter to sit in his back yard and wait for money to fall from the sky

paying off a loan early is n't a bad thing   having a credit card for 6 months and then closing it is probably unneeded pay it off and then keep it as an emergency card    the key is debt available credit ratio   look at this article for example which explains the different elements the only one you 're affecting here is the second your debt load   if you 're not planning on asking for another loan in the next six months none of this really matters assuming you are paying it off for sure in six months your debt will be gone and your credit score recovered from any hit it takes and if you get a $ 1500 credit card and only put $ 300 on it it might actually improve your credit but having an open $ 1500 credit card with a 0 balance will probably improve your credit rating unless you have a really high amount of available credit   it will improve your debt credit ratio ie total $ you owe divided by total $ you could put on your ccs revolving credit this is all aside from the is it a good idea to borrow money for a 3 month vacation before starting working which the answer is well not exactly   that 's not from a credit perspective just from a living within your means perspective   if you have a firm job that will easily pay off the vacation it 's probably not a bad thing but definitely a certain number of people will take this and end up in spending bad habits that last their life   be aware of that and if you 're just loaning yourself money from the future make sure you understand the terms of that loan and are certain you can pay it off

so this has been true forever i mean can we agree that there is enough corruption to be the dividing line between the 1 and the rest of society the system is built to protect the rich and grow the wealth of the already wealthy the middle and lower class are being farmed like animals while food quality is disgusting due to fda failure medicine is becoming a periodical subscription because modern disease is trending towards lifelong health insurance is a for profit business that now has more investments than banks and while millions suffer and are dry of any savings keeping the middle east in turmoil is how we get cheap oil peace means they have the right to negotiate their exports while desperate we basically take it for free everything is based on money     everytime i use quotes just think what if this is designed i mean follow the money medicine benefits if you 're just sick enough to pay up every month and not die the fda approves all kinds of sickness inducing trash why is n't that their one job to say oh this is n't healthy it causes cancer we will not allow it apparently not what big pharma paid the fda to allow crap food the reason it 's crap is because it 's cheap the food industry like mcdonald 's wants cheap food so they can become global billionaires i mean c'mon

i would start by taking it to your bank and asking them what they think they can probably call the bank on the check and find out if it is still good if they let you deposit the check i would wait a couple of weeks before spending the money in case the issuing bank decides that the check is no good and your bank wants its money back   if you are told that the check is not good anymore the next thing i would do is to check with your state 's treasurer 's office and see if they have any unclaimed money for your mother

the vendor needs to do this using apportionment according to the vat rules for mixed supplies if you make mixed supplies and the individual supplies are not liable to vat    at the same rate then you need to work out the tax value of    each supply in order to calculate how much tax is due if the tax    value is based on the total price you charge see paragraph 7.3 you    do this by splitting that price between the supplies this is called    an apportionment there is no special method of apportionment however your calculations must be fair and you must be able to justify them it is usually best to use one of the methods shown in section 32 the section 32 referred to really relates to use between business and non business purposes but it implies that splitting up the total price in proportion to the original prices would probably be fair so in your example the vendor might split the £ 5 discount equally between the spoon and the as they had the same gross cost and pay vat as if each had cost £ 7.50 gross the vendor could also do it in proportion to their net pre vat prices and thus a bit more of the discount to the than the spoon but as this would lead to them paying slightly more tax overall they probably would n't choose to however none of this is likely to be too relevant to a consumer since in the uk prices must be presented as the gross vat inclusive amounts and so the discounts will also apply to those amounts it will of course affect how much of the purchase price the vendor ends up paying on to the government and thus might indirectly affect what discounts the vendor is willing to offer
