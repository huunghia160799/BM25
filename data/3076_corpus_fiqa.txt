for instance and to give a comparison to the us in austria almost everybody gets a credit card without a credit history e.g. a young person with a bad credit history with a good credit history   the credit history is in the usa much more important than in austria in future the way to assess a credit history will change due to analysis of social networks for instance this can be considered in addition to traditional scoring procedures is your credit history score like a criminal record nope i mean is it always with you   not really cause a criminal record will be retained on a central storage to state it abstract and a credit history can be calculated by private companies also are there other ways to get credit cards besides with a bank that depends on the country in austria yes

that is an opinion   i do n't think so   here are some differences if you use credit responsibly and take the time to make sure the reporting agencies are being accurate a good report can benefit you   so that is n't like a criminal record what is also important to know is that in the united states a credit report is about you not for you   you are the product being sold   this is in my opinion and unfortunate situation but it is what it is   you will more than likely benefit for keeping a good report even if you never use credit there are many credit scores that can be calculated from your report the score is just a number used to compare and evaluate you on a common set of criteria if you think about it that does n't make sense   the score is a reflection of how you use credit   having and using credit is a commitment   your are committing to the lender that you will repay them as agreed your choice is who you decide to make agreements with   i personally find the business practices of my local credit union to be more palatable than the business practices of the national bank i was with   i chose to use credit provided by the credit union rather than by the bank   i am careful about where i take auto loans from and to what extent i can control it where i take home loans from since it is absolutely a commitment you are personally responsible for making sure that you like who you are making commitments with

two kinds of lending going on the first occurs when the federal reserve purchases government securities   this creates reserves at the federal reserve in another bank the second kind of lending comes when this bank lends out the money   this is the multiplier effect the reason for the excess reserves now is that banks are gun shy and afraid to lend   their money is safer at the fed than with commercial and personal borrowers   when this changes either by a recovery or by the fed penalizing banks for excess reserves which it can do but has n't then we 'll see inflation and a consequential rise in prices

the answer depends on how much you spend every month the dti is calculated using the minimum payment on the balance owed on your card   credit card minimum payments are ridiculous often being only $ 50 for balances of a couple thousand dollars in any case when you get the lender will tell you based on your dti the maximum amount they will approve you for if your minimum payment is $ 50 that 's another $ 50 that could go towards your mortgage which could mean an additional $ 10,000 financed it 's up to you to decide if $ 10,000 will make enough of a difference in the houses you look at

tl;dr because stocks represent added value from corporate profits and not the price the goods themselves are sold at this is actually a very complicated subject   but here 's the simplest answer i can come up with   stocks are a commodity just like milk eggs and bread   the government only tracks certain commodities consumables as part of the consumer price index cpi   these are generally commodities that the typical person will consume on a daily or weekly basis or need to survive food rent etc   these are present values stock prices on the other hand represent an educated guess or bet on a company 's future performance   if apple has historically performed well and analysts expect it to continue to perform then investors will pay more for a stock that they feel will continue pay good dividends in the future   compound this with the fact that there is usually limited a supply of stock for a particular company unless they issue more stock if we go back to apple as an example they can raise their price they charge on an iphone from $ 400 to $ 450 over the course of say a couple years   some of this may be due to higher wage costs but efficiencies in the marketplace actually tend to drive down costs to produce goods so they will probably actually turn a higher profit by raising their price even if they have to pay higher wages or possibly even if they do n't raise their price   this in economics is termed value added finally is absolutely correct in his comment about the stocks in the s&p 500 not being static   additionally the s&p 500 is a hand picked set of winners if you will   these are not run of the mill penny stocks for companies that will be out of business in a week   these are companies that standard poor 's financial services llc thinks will perform well

based on what you asked and your various comments on other answers this is the first time that you will be making an offer to buy a house and it seems that the seller is not using a real estate agent to sell the house that is it is what is called a fsbo for sale by owner property and you can learn a lot of about the seller 's perspective by visiting on the other hand you are a ftb first time buyer and i strongly recommend that you find out about the purchase process by googling for first time home buyer and reading some of the articles there but most important i urge you do not make a written offer to purchase the property until you understand a lot more than you currently do and a lot more than all the answers here are telling you about making an offer to buy this property   even when you feel absolutely confident that you understand everything hire a real estate lawyer or a real estate agent to write the actual offer itself the agent might well use a standard purchase offer form that his company uses or the state mandates and just fill in the yes you will need to pay a fee to these people but it is very important for your own protection and so do n't just wing it when making an offer to purchase as to how much you should offer it depends on how much you can afford to pay i will ignore the possibility that you are rich enough that you can pay cash for the purchase and assume that you will like most people be needing to get a mortgage loan to buy the house most banks prefer not to lend more than 80 of the appraised value of the house with the balance of the purchase price coming from your personal funds they will in some cases loan more than 80 but will usually charge higher interest rate on the loan require you to pay mortgage insurance etc now the appraised value is not determined until the bank sends its own appraiser to look at the property and this does not happen until your bid has been accepted by the seller what if your bid say $ 500 k is much larger than the appraised value $ 400 k on which the bank is willing to lend you only $ 320 k well you can still proceed with the deal if you have $ 180 k available to make the pay the rest or you can let the deal fall apart if you have made a properly written offer that contains the usual contingency clause that you will be applying for a mortgage of $ 400 k at rate not to exceed x% and that if you ca n't get a mortgage commitment within y days the deal is off absent such a clause you will lose the earnest money that you put into escrow for failure to follow through with the contract to purchase for $ 500k.   making an offer in the same ballpark as the market value lessens the chances of having the deal fall through note also that even if the appraised value is $ 500 k the bank might refuse to lend you $ 400 k if your loan application and credit report suggest that you will have difficulty making the payments on a $ 400 k mortgage   it is a good idea to get a pre approval from a lender saying that based on the financial information that you have provided you will likely be approved for a mortgage of $ z that is the bank thinks that you can afford the payments on a mortgage of as much as $ z that way you have some feel for how much house you can afford and that should affect what kinds of property you should be bidding on

you 're lending the money to your business by paying for it directly   the company accounts must reflect a credit the amount you lend to it and a debit what it then puts that loan towards    it 's fairly normal for a owner driven company to reflect a large loan account for the owners   for example if you have a room at home dedicated for the business it is impractical to pay rent directly via the company   the rental agreement is probably in your name you pay the rent and you reconcile it with the company later you could even charge your company taxable interest on this loan when you draw down the loan from the company you reverse this debit your loan account and credit the company paying off the debt as far as tracking that expenditure simply handle those third party invoices in the normal way and file them for reference

to short a stock you actually borrow shares and sell them the shorter gets the money from selling immediately and pays interest for the share he borrows until he covers the short the amount of interest varies depending on the stock it 's typically under 1 a year for large cap stocks but can be 20 or more for small illiquid or heavily shorted stocks in this scam only a few people own the shares that are lent to so they essentially have a monopoly and can set really high borrow costs the shorter probably assumes that a pump and dump will crash quickly so would n't mind paying a high borrow cost

i feel that getting money sooner than later is always advantageous if i offered you the choice between getting which option would you take i would take the last option and for the same reason from a purely numbers point of view i would argue that getting paid biweekly is preferable assuming the the annual salary is pro rated fairly and barring any compulsive spending habits your calculations suggest to me that they are trying to answer the question looking at a single year or month or some other fixed amount of time in a vacuum is there any financial benefit to being paid bi weekly over monthly the analysis seems to be focusing on comparing the two pay schedules on a month by month basis noting when one is paid bi weekly some months you get paid more times than the other however one could also compare the two pay schedules on a fortnight by fortnight basis and note that when one is paid monthly many you do n't get paid at all and some you get paid a lot or one could compare the two pay schedules on an hour by hour basis too but in the long run the money adds up to be the same amount i prefer getting it as soon as i can

a free $ 50 looks too good to be true as others already pointed out these offers are common to many cards that want you to build loyalty towards a particular company e.g. airlines cards give lots of mileage for a decent initial spend should i get this card for the $ 50 why and/or why not how much do you spend on amazon or are planning to do so in future this offer has been around for ages earlier they used to offer much smaller amounts of $ 20 for signing up and you never saw it so probably you wo n't be really using the site frequently in that case its just a matter of whether $ 50 is worth the hassle for you to sign up and then later cancel if you do n't want to manage another new card the hit to credit score is likely to be minimal unless you do such offers often as such for a person who rarely buys on amazon i would n't advise you to sign up for this card there are better rewards cards that are not as tied to a particular site such as chase freedom discover etc if however you are a regular shopper but just never noticed this prompt earlier then it is worthwhile to get this or even consider the prime version which you will get or be automatically upgraded to if the account has prime membership that gives 5 back instead of 3 on amazon

all of 's reasons to say no are extremely valid there are also two more first the cost of a mortgage is not the only cost of owning a house you have to pay taxes utilities repairs insurance those are almost always hundreds of dollars a month and an unlucky break like a leaking roof can land you with a bill for many thousands of dollars second owning a house is a long term thing if you find you have to sell in a year or two the cost of making the sale can be many thousands of dollars and wipe out all the savings you made from owning rather than renting i would suggest a different approach although it depends very much on your circumstances and does n't apply to everybody if there is someone you know who has money to spare and is concerned for your welfare your mention of a family that does n't want you to work for academic reason leads me to believe that might be the case see if they are prepared to buy a house and rent it to you i 've known families do that when their children became students this is n't necessarily charity if rents are high compared to house prices owning a house and renting it out can be very profitable and half the battle with renting a house is finding a tenant who will pay rent and not damage the house presumably you would qualify you could also find fellow students who you know to share the rent cost

a specific strategy to make money on a potentially moderately decreasing stock price on a dividend paying stock is to write covered calls   there is a category on money se about covered call writing but in summary a covered call is a contract to sell the shares at a set price within a defined time range you gain a premium called the time value which when i 've done it can be up to an additional return on the position   with this strategy you 're collecting dividends and come out with the best return if the stock price stays in the middle if the price does not shoot up high enough that your option is called you still own the stock and made extra return if the price drops moderately you may still be positive

basically in any financial system that features fractional reserve banking the monetary supply expands during times of prosperity stable low inflation of 2 4 keeps capital available while keeping the value of money stable it also discourages hoarding of wealth banks are n't vaults they take deposits and make an explicit promise to repay the depositor on demand since most depositors do n't need to withdraw money regularly the lend out the money you deposited and maintain a reserve sufficient to meet daily cash needs when times are good banks lend to people and businesses who need capital who in turn do things that add value to the overall economy when times are bad people and businesses either can not get capital or pay more for it which reduces the number of times that money changes hands and has a negative impact on the wider economy people who are trying to sell you commodities or who have a naive view of how the economy actually works decry the current monetary system and throw around scary words like fiat currency and inflation is theft what these people do n't realize is that before the present system where the value of money is based on promises to repay the gold and silver backed systems also experienced inflation with gold silver based money inflation was driven by discoveries of gold and silver deposits

all governments need to do is figure   out how to monitor regulate and tax whenever btc or any crypto is converted into dollars or merchandise   the public ledger does n't have names associated with it but it does have public keys which can be used to determine what other transactions have taken place that might not have been reported and how much crypto is in that wallet   i agree with there could be a dark side to crypto that we 're not paying attention to because we 're all so excited about the money we 're making but it 's only money if we can spend it and that 's where it starts to get concerning   every transaction recorded is a bean counters wet dream

i 'm not sure if someone else answered already in the same manner i will i ca n't guarantee for sure if it 's the same in the it might since major credit cards companies like visa mc amex are american companies but in canada having keeping unused cc is a disadvantage because of the following banks and financing companies look more at the total amount of credit available to you than at how much purchases you have on your cards ex let 's say that you have the following visa cc with $ 10,000 limit and $ 2000 worth of purchases made more than 30 days ago on it mastercard cc with $ 10,000 limit as well and $ 1000 worth of purchases less than 30 days old a major retail store cc with $ 2000 limit and $ 0 balance hypothetical situation you want a bank loan to do some expensive house repairs and are looking for a lower interest rate than what your cc can offer the bank will not care about the amount on the cards they will add up all the limits of your cc and treat your loan request as if all your cards were filled to their respective limit   so in this case they will consider you as being right now in debt of $ k = $ 22,000 instead of only $ 3000 and they might   1 refuse you the loan 2 grant it only if you transfer all purchases on a single card and cancel all the others 3 once the $ 3000 is transferred on one of the cards and the others cancelled they can require that you reduce the limit of that card hope this helps

the prices we pay for goods and services is set by our level of income because we have a huge choice of price levels from luxury to economy class and diy this was true of rent and mortgage payments before the real estate bubble there is still some choice though from a tiny house or trailer to a mansion none of these are one set demand decided by someone else as with land value tax many people like where they live and want to stay there those people create a cross generational community land and homes must be affordable and we should have as much freedom about what we do with our homes as possible

the main thing you 're missing is that while you bear all the costs of manipulating the market you have no special ability to capture the profits yourself you make money by buying low and selling high but if you want to push the price up you have to keep buying even though the price is getting high so you are buying high this gives everyone including you the opportunity to sell high and make money but you will have no special ability to capture that others will see the price going up and will start selling within a tiny fraction of a second you will have to keep buying all the shares they keep selling at the artificially inflated price so as you keep trying to buy more and more to push the price up enough to make money everyone else is selling their shares to you you have to buy more and more shares at an inflated price as everyone else is selling while you are still buying when you switch to selling the price will drop instantly since there 's nobody to buy from you at the inflated price the opportunity you created has already been taken by the very people you were trading with billions have been lost by people who thought this strategy would work

i do n't buy the house prices will always increase due to the increased cost of raw materials argument in a lot of countries you will find that the cost of a property is substantially lower than its perceived sale value if it was n't there would be no incentive for developers to take the risk of buying the land and building houses on it say the cost of building the house is 50 of the sale price which might already be generous materials probably account for half of the building cost so you 've got 25 tail 75 dog i 'd start to worry if people buy property as a get rich quick scheme which seems to be what you 're describing

having someone else paying you rent is always going to be the better deal financially the question is what does $ 450k buy in the neighborhood in which you want to live vs $ 800k i 'm going to assume you can afford either option buying a $ 450k home and not selling or an $ 800k home and selling your current one whether someone 's paying you rent or not let 's make up some numbers here a $ 450k home financed 80/20 principal at 4 for 30 years will cost you about $ in p&i payments per year plus escrows such as re taxes pmi and homeowners insurance where applicable an $ 800k home financed 80/20 principal at 4 for 30yr will give you payments of about $ before taxes and insurance so the worst case overall is that you buy a 450k home in the new neighborhood and are not at any given time collecting rent on the old property that would assuming the mortgage terms on both home loans were comparable cost you $ and you 'd be living in a $ 450k home in a neighborhood where 450k may not buy a home as nice as the one you moved out of the question as i stated above is this assuming you had a reliable tenant in your home for the entire remaining life of the loan on your current home which is more acceptable to you buying $ 450k of home which might be a downgrade in sqft or amenities and paying $ 2020 in p&i or paying about a grand more $ for a much nicer home in the new location strictly from a money perspective the renter is going to be the best option if you get reliable tenancy for the entire life of the mortgage on that house you 'll be paying $ for 30 years which is $ to end up with $ of total home value plus adjustments for actual home value appreciation depreciation that 's the only way you 'll come out ahead on any mortgage have someone else pay most of it for you if you do n't rent the $ 800k home will cost you $ while two $ 450k homes will cost you $ the percentage of home value over total payments for the 800k home would be 72 you will have paid 137 of the value of the home while you will have paid of the value of two 450k homes

so child your goal is to make money this is usually achieved by selling goods say lemonade at a price that exceeds their cost say sugar water and well lemons options at first are very much same in that you can buy the right to engage in a specific future trade you make money in this situation if the eventual returns from the scheduled trade cover the cost of purchasing the option otherwise you can simply opt out of the trade you purchased the right to trade after all not any type of obligation makes sense good because what follows is what makes options a little different that is if you sell that same right to engage in a specific trade the situation is seemingly reversed you lock in your return at the outset but the costs are n't fully realized until the trade is either consumed or declined by the owner of the option and keep in mind that it is always the owner of the option who is in the driver 's seat they may sell the option hold on to it and do nothing or use it to engage in the anticipated trade and that 's really all there 's to it

when economies are strong it is particularly to have a single currency as it makes trade and tourism simpler and helps reduce costs the problem comes when individual member economies get into trouble because the eurozone is a loose grouping of nations there is no direct equivalent of the us federal government to coordinate a response there is instead an odd mixture of national and central government that makes it harder to get a unified approach to the economy ok it 's maybe not so different to the us in reality   this lack of flexibility means that some of the key levers of international finance are compromised for example a weak economy ca n't float its currency to improve exports similarly individual country 's interest rates ca n't be adjusted to balance spending i suspect the main reason though is political and based on concepts of sovereignty and national pride the uk does the majority of its trade with the eurozone so the pros would possibly outweigh the cons but the uk as a whole and some of our papers in particular have always regarded europe with suspicion most only speak english and find france and germany a strange and obtuse place the almost common language makes it easier to relate to the us and canada than our near neighbours it seems the perception amongst the political establishment is that any attempt to join the euro is political suicide while that is the case it is unlikely to happen purely from a personal perspective i 'd welcome the euro except it means a lot of the products i routinely buy would become a lot more expensive if price is for an example compare the price of the ipod touch in the uk £ to the french pay £ at the current exchange rate which is close to 25 more ouch see also my question about canada adopting the us dollar

this is called net operating loss and it is in fact applicable for individuals as well you can under certain circumstances have nol even as an individual but it is far more common in the corporate world what happens is that you can carry it back or forward and get refund on taxes paid or adjust income for taxes to pay in your example you could carry the $ 75 nol back and deduct it from the prior year earnings reducing the taxable income from $ 100 to $ 25 getting $ of the $ 25 paid as taxes back the link is for individual nol corporate rules are different but the principle is the same

if the equity market in the usa crashed its very likely equity markets everywhere else would crash the usa has a high number of the world 's largest businesses and there are correlations between equity markets so you need to think of equities as a global asset class not regional your question is then a question about the correlation between equity markets and currency markets   here 's a guess if equity markets crashed you would see a lot of panic selling of stocks denominated in many currencies but probably the most in usd due to the large number of the world 's largest businesses trading on us stock exchanges therefore when the rest of the world sells us equities they receive cash usd which they might sell for their local currency that selling pressure would cause usd to fall but when equity markets crash there 's a move to safety of the bond markets the world 's largest bond markets are denominated in which currency probably usd so those who receive usd for their equities are going to spend that usd on bonds in which case there is probably no correlation between equity markets and currency markets at all a quick google search shows this kind of thing

is this really a net effect of concentration of wealth when so few people hold all the money you need more money to keep the system running imagine we need 10 trillion to keep the economy running if 1000 people hold 50 you effectively need 5 trillion just to keep the economy running   it is somewhat ironic that the last time we had full employment was basically the real estate bubble where tons of money was dumped into the system by liar loans with no credit check   not saying we want to go back there but perhaps we need that level of money in the system to get full employment if we want to get there safely we need to buy back our debt invest more in our infrastructure and provide more services this is the only way we are going to get full employment

as the name says its for income earned in a foreign country if you have been paying us income tax on this while living in the us nothing is going to change here you should be informing yourself on how to avoid double taxation in your new country of residence passive income earned abroad dividends interest also do not fall under this exemption   the purpose of the foreign earned income exclusion is to make it easy for expats who work abroad to avoid double income taxation without going through the complicated process of applying for tax credits the us is the only industrial country that taxes its residents regardless of where they reside that is also why it only goes to about $ 100,000 a year if you are a high earner they want to make it more difficult also as a side note since you are going to be abroad for a year i will point out that if you have more than $ 10,000 in foreign accounts at any point in the year you need to declare this in an fbar form this is not advertised as well as it should be and carries ridiculous penalties for non compliance i ca n't count the number of times i have heard a us expat say that they were unaware of this

i admit in the long term there are a good number of to work out but in the end i want to see some system where people in general can seize the means to their own well being without stepping on one another   the management you talked about is another reason why i prefer worker co ops to be the optimum form of issuing business because its not just a few people in charge it 's a whole social group acting in     when you discuss the mom and pop store having no suppliers it would be good to promote some way of each money supply to have a share of each industry within it   there are always some people in every trade looking for their next job   they just have to find a supply where there trade is in demand   the process is self feeding   next off or course the mechanism of the system would work in a way that firm 's ca n't just pay themselves with their own debt they have to issue it to their creditors first and even then it 's practically impossible to accept your own debt as payment   you would have to take some from a competitor at best     what i 've been trying to do is find some system where no one institution or no one alliance holds the keys to the definition of value   if you have five to eight dictators fighting at once as opposed to one financial dictator who can oversee all like the fed scenario you just described it 's more possible for people who are freer relatively to survive freely between the borders of these of influence as they can play each dictator off the other   at least from your dialogue i can see you 're one of those who gets what i 'm trying to aim for     here 's another idea i 've explored with it that 's similar but may make the environment slightly different so let me know what you think   what i call the revolving tax window where the government accepts different both in quantity and specific of notes in intervals of every business quarter so that the demand for specific notes changes four times a year   from january until the end of march they could accept taxes in notes from firms a f h and t and for april into june it could be just b and s and so on   the options for note issuing could be set on a list of firms registered with the sec or whoever    the combination for the quarter could be picked at random by a algorithm so no firm could make a plan to be a market dictator and a sense of is maintained in the economy     obviously the more firms are properly registered on this list the more combinations of monetary combinations you have and the more power is distributed from too much control by anybody     what you can do is choose whether or not you want there to be less or more notes in the next quarter because just like fiscal policy and conventional monetary policy the extremes have trade offs but different ones to few currencies the economy may be stimulated but you get market dictators via monetary oligopoly even if temporary   too many you avoid market dictators who will be more focused on getting a real return by investing in competing ventures based on what will actually return investment but the economy may not be as stimulated   what do you think of this structural alternative   one of the sources i 've been building my economic policy on has been debt the first 5,000 years by david if anyone 's familiar

standard nfc for payments reads a straight copy of the card details does not generate any one time use card number does not employ any over the air encryption or even a challenge response system the normal contactless payment process does involve transaction specific signatures   however what process is used depends on the vendor equipment and the scheme visa mastercard amex a mode if supported allows the card number and expiry date to be read there is a good description at which covers magnetic stripe mode and emv mode etc for each scheme mastercard visa etc do things differently mastercard contactless mastercard transactions can be performed in either emv mode or mag stripe mode after entry point has initiated a transaction the mastercard kernel issues a get processing options command in the response from the card a data object called the application interchange profile determines whether the transaction will continue in either emv mode or mag stripe mode the also determines if on device cardholder verification is supported emv mode m chip the commands exchanged with the card for emv mode closely resemble those used for an emv contact transaction with read record commands being used to retrieve all the card data followed by a generate application request to obtain a unique transaction specific from the card once all of these exchanges have been completed the card can be removed from the rf field however unlike for contact transactions not all the transaction processing occurs before the card exchanges have been completed this is to the contactless transaction performance by reducing the amount of time the card is required to remain in the rf field my emphasis according to visa uk our technology uses the chip on your card to generate unique that ’s techie speak for a type of puzzle that consists of a short piece of encrypted or encoded text and digital signatures to protect your payments digital signatures are like handwritten signatures in some ways but they are much more difficult to forge my emphasis according to the uk card association a fraudster can steal my details from my contactless card fact you have to be extremely close to someone for their gadget to be able to read your card and even then all they would ever get is the card number and expiry date that ’s the same information you see by simply looking at the front of any card there ’s no way anyone can get the security code on the back of the card your name and address or bank account details the vast majority of online retailers require additional details like these and others to make a purchase however according to a guardian newspaper report of 2015 07 25 researchers bought cheap widely available card scanners from a mainstream website to see if they could steal key details from a contactless card they tested 10 different credit and debit cards that were meant to be coded to mask personal data and were able to read crucial data that was meant to be hidden it then went shopping with the information it had obtained and was able to successfully place orders for items including a £ 3,000 television set so yes even in the civilized world our security is undermined by a combination of how does apple pay work see apple pay must be using the mag stripe mode of the emv contactless specifications clearly apple pay must following the emv contactless specifications of books and for mastercard visa and american express transactions respectively more specifically it must be following what i called above the mobile phone profile of the contactless specifications it must be implementing the contactless mag stripe mode since magnetic stripe infrastructure is still prevalent in the us it may or may not be implementing contactless emv mode today but will probably implement it in the future as the infrastructure for supporting payments with contact cards is phased in over the next year in the us

let 's assess the situation first then look at an option this leaves you with about $ in cash flow provided you spend money on nothing else entertainment oil changes general merchandise gifts etc so i 'd say take $ 200/mo off that as backup money now we 're at $   question what have you been doing with this extra $ 800/mo if you put $ of that extra towards the 10 loan it would be paid off in 12 months and you would only pay $ in interest if you have been saving it like all the wisest people say you should then you should have plenty enough to either pay for a new transmission or buy a good enough car outright   10 interest rate on a vehicle purchase is not very good not sure why you have a personal loan to handle this rather than an auto loan but i 'll guess you have a low credit score or not much credit history   cost of a new transmission is usually $ $ 3,500 not sure what vehicle we 're talking about so let 's make it $ 3,000 to be conservative   at your current interest rate you 'll have paid another $ in interest over the next 33 months just trying to pay off your underwater car   if you take your old car to a dealership and trade it in towards a new to you car you might be able to roll your existing loan into a new loan now i 'm not sure when you say personal loan if you mean an official loan from a bank or a personal loan from a friend family member so that could make a difference i 'm also not sure if a dealership will be willing to recognize a personal loan in the transaction as i 'd wager there 's no lien against the vehicle for them to worry about but if you can manage it you may be able to get a lower overall interest rate if you ca n't roll it into a new financing plan then you need to assess if you can afford a new loan provided you even get approved on top of your existing finances one big issue that will affect interest rates and approvals will be your down payment amount the higher it is the better interest rate you 'll receive ultimately you 're in a not so great position but if your monthly budget is as you describe then you 'll be fine after a few more years the perils of buying a used car is that you never know what might happen what if you do n't repair your existing car buy another car and it breaks down in a year it 's all a bit of a gamble do n't let your emotions get in the way of making a decision you might be frustrated with your current vehicle but if $ 3,000 of repairs makes it last 3 more years by which time your current loan should be paid off then you 'll be in a much better spot to finance a newer vehicle of course it would be much better to save up cash over that time and buy something outright but that 's not always feasible   would you rather fix up your current car and keep working to pay down the debt or would you rather be rid of the car and put $ 3,000 down on a new to you car and take on an additional monthly debt there 's no single right answer for you first and foremost you need to assess your monthly cash flow and properly allocate the extra funds get out of debt as soon as reasonably possible

if you have multiple accounts you have to empty them all before you can deduct any losses your loss is not a capital loss its a deduction it is calculated based on the total amount you have withdrawn from all your roth ira 's minus the total basis it will be subject to the 2 agi i.e. if your agi is > 100 k none of it is deductible and you have to itemize to get it bottom line think twice summarizing the discussion in comments if you have a very low agi i would guess that your tax liability is pretty low as well even if you deduct the whole $ 2 k and all of it is above the other deductions you have which in turn is above the standard deduction of almost $ 6 k you save say $ 300 if you 're in 15 tax bracket that 's the most savings you have however i 'm assuming something here i 'm assuming that you 're itemizing your deductions already and they 're above the standard deduction this is very unlikely with such a low income you do n't have state taxes to deduct you probably do n't spend a lot to deduct sales taxes and i would argue that with the low agi you probably do n't own property and if you do you do n't have a mortgage with a significant interest on it you can be in 15 bracket with agi between roughly $ 8 k and $ 35 k i.e. you can not deduct between $ 160 and $ 750 of the $ 2 k so it 's already less than the maximum $ 300 if your agi is $ 8 k the deduction does n't matter might cover all of your taxes anyway if your agi is $ 30 k you can deduct only $ 1400 so if you 're in the 15 bracket you saved $ 210 that again assuming it 's above your other deductions which in turn are already above the standard deduction highly unlikely as i said in the comments i do not think you can realistically save on taxes because of this loss in such a manner

here 's my attempt without talking about apples or anything   essentially the money supply is determined by the central bank since they are the issuers of money you can read on your us dollars that they are issued by the federal reserve an excellent measure of the money supply is ngdp since this is the number of dollars traded every year that sort of how many dollars are available to be captured by working trade etc unfortunately in 2008 the us fed decided to adopt an ultra tight monetary policy resulting in a severe drop off in ngdp relative to previous trend the worst since the great depression graphs here   it does not look like it will ever recover to the previous trend so the money supply is much smaller than people would have expected before 2008 in theory the nominal value of money should n't matter in the long run however since people before 2008 signed contracts read 30-year mortgages anticipating a much higher aggregate money supply this has triggered a shortfall in demand ever since which has left our economy in the tank

security eugene kaspersky has declared cyber warfare as the internet 's greatest threat kaspersky believes that cyber warfare has over threats such as cyber crime and privacy issues to become the most dangerous issue facing the web he spoke at the australian convention about the potential damage of cyber super weapons and the future of internet security cyber weapons can damage a physical object as badly as a traditional weapon kaspersky was quoted as saying during his presentation in sydney it is a realistic scenario against any country because we all have the same systems all it takes is the wrong people with the right motives while both the public and private sector have been scrambling in recent years to protect critical infrastructure against cyber attacks experts have suggested that most hypothetical attacks would likely be limited in scope to a local or regional scale kaspersky argues that the only way to prevent a catastrophic series of attacks in the future would be for countries to come together and sign international against the use of cyber weapons i 'm afraid that there 's only one way that they can be protected and that 's international agreements against cyber weapons same as was done with nuclear weapons chemical weapons and biological weapons kaspersky said both china and the us showed positive signs for peace when they held cyber security earlier this year in a sign of solidarity during his speech kaspersky pointed to the stuxnet virus as a barometer for the power of cyber warfare the highly sophisticated virus successfully infected iran 's nuclear programme and is believed to have caused critical damage to uranium enrichment equipment

i 'm aware that this is not how modern economics works i considered pursuing a graduate degree in the subject but chose not to because i disagree with the foundations of the approach     my ideas are n't based in explicit observation of reality as i prioritize reason above observation the difference between the two approaches is similar to the difference between pure mathematics and applied mathematics where the my perspective is pure math and the the modern economist is applied math if you would include the and of pure mathematics as fantasy then my ideas are indeed based in fantasy but you 'd then have to explain why such an approach is wrong given how often the seemingly useless work of pure math ends up proving highly valuable in the long run e.g. number theory and computer science

served lends itself to optimization in a bad way serving content as large as one can get away with   personally i think models that work well for monetization without ads are those that start with free content and later donations e.g. patreon reddit gold or those that start with free content and ask for payment for more similar content later e.g. first album is free but later albums by the same artist cost money they keep the supplier honest because people can tell if the content is crap before they pay of course those who want to sell crappy content will resist any such model

as others have noted us law says that if you have over half the bill it 's worth the full value under half is worth nothing i presume if it is very close to half if even careful measurements show that you have you 'll have difficulty cashing it in precisely because the government and the banking system are n't going to allow themselves to be easily fooled by someone cutting bills in half and then trying to redeem both halves i 've seen several comments on here about how you 'd explain to the bank how so many bills were cut in half what if you just told them the truth not the part about killing someone of course but tell them that you made a deal neither of you wanted to bother with complex contracts and having to go to court if the other side did n't pay up so your buddy cut all the bills in half etc as you now have both halves and they clearly have the same serial number this no real evidence of fraud okay this is technically illegal 18 us code section whoever cuts or or or together or does any other thing to any bank bill draft note or other evidence of debt issued by any national banking association or federal reserve bank or the federal reserve system with intent to render such bank bill draft note or other evidence of debt unfit to be shall be fined under this title or not more than six months or both but you did n't do it the other guy did i presume the point of this law is to say that you ca n't get a hold of currency belonging to someone else and it so as to make it worthless as he 's now given you both halves i doubt anyone would bother to track him down and prosecute him just btw while checking up on the details of the law i stumbled across 18 usc 336 which says that it 's illegal to write a check for less than $ 1 with penalties of 6 months in prison i just got a check from at&t for 15 cents for one of those class action suits where the lawyers get $ 100 million and the victims get 15 cents each apparently that was illegal

st. john 's church richmond virginia march 23   mr president no man thinks more highly than i do of the patriotism as well as abilities of the very worthy gentlemen who have just addressed the house but different men often see the same subject in different lights and therefore i hope it will not be thought to those gentlemen if entertaining as i do opinions of a character very opposite to theirs i shall speak forth my sentiments freely and without reserve this is no time for ceremony the question before the house is one of awful moment to this country for my own part i consider it as nothing less than a question of freedom or slavery and in proportion to the magnitude of the subject ought to be the freedom of the debate it is only in this way that we can hope to arrive at truth and fulfil the great responsibility which we hold to god and our country should i keep back my opinions at such a time through fear of giving offence i should consider myself as guilty of treason towards my country and of an act of toward the of heaven which i above all kings   mr. president it is natural to man to indulge in the illusions of hope we are apt to shut our eyes against a painful truth and listen to the song of that till she us into is this the part of wise men engaged in a great and struggle for liberty are we disposed to be of the number of those who having eyes see not and having ears hear not the things which so nearly concern their temporal salvation for my part whatever anguish of spirit it may cost i am willing to know the whole truth to know the worst and to provide for it   i have but one lamp by which my feet are guided and that is the lamp of experience i know of no way of judging of the future but by the past and judging by the past i wish to know what there has been in the conduct of the british ministry for the last ten years to justify those hopes with which gentlemen have been pleased to solace themselves and the house is it that insidious smile with which our petition has been lately received trust it not sir it will prove a to your feet suffer not yourselves to be with a kiss ask yourselves how this reception of our petition with these war like preparations which cover our waters and our land are fleets and armies necessary to a work of love and reconciliation have we shown ourselves so unwilling to be reconciled that force must be called in to win back our love let us not deceive ourselves sir these are the implements of war and the last arguments to which kings resort i ask gentlemen sir what means this martial array if its purpose be not to force us to submission can gentlemen assign any other possible motive for it has great britain any enemy in this quarter of the world to call for all this accumulation of and armies no sir she has none they are meant for us they can be meant for no other they are sent over to bind and upon us those chains which the british ministry have been so long forging and what have we to oppose to them shall we try argument sir we have been trying that for the last ten years have we anything new to offer upon the subject nothing we have held the subject up in every light of which it is capable but it has been all in vain shall we resort to and humble what terms shall we find which have not been already exhausted let us not i you sir deceive ourselves sir we have done everything that could be done to avert the storm which is now coming on we have we have we have we have ourselves before the and have its to arrest the tyrannical hands of the ministry and parliament our have been our have produced additional violence and insult our have been disregarded and we have been with contempt from the foot of the in vain after these things may we indulge the fond hope of peace and reconciliation there is no longer any room for hope if we wish to be if we mean to preserve those privileges for which we have been so long we mean not to abandon the noble struggle in which we have been so long engaged and which we have pledged ourselves never to abandon until the glorious object of our contest shall be obtained we must fight i repeat it sir we must fight an appeal to arms and to the god of hosts is all that is left us   they tell us sir that we are weak unable to cope with so an but when shall we be stronger will it be the next week or the next year will it be when we are totally and when a british guard shall be in every house shall we gather strength by and inaction shall we acquire the means of resistance by lying on our backs and hugging the phantom of hope until our enemies shall have bound us hand and foot sir we are not weak if we make a proper use of those means which the god of nature placed in our power three millions of people armed in the holy cause of liberty and in such a country as that which we possess are by any force which our enemy can send against us besides sir we shall not fight our battles alone there is a just god who over the of nations and who will raise up friends to fight our battles for us the battle sir is not to the strong alone it is to the vigilant the active the brave besides sir we have no election if we were base enough to desire it it is now too late to retire from the contest there is no retreat but in submission and slavery our chains are forged their may be heard on the plains of boston the war is let it come i repeat it sir let it come   it is in vain sir to the matter gentlemen may cry peace there is no peace the war is actually begun the next that sweeps from the north will bring to our ears the clash of arms our are already in the field why stand we here idle what is it that gentlemen wish what would they have is life so dear or peace so sweet as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery forbid it god i know not what course others may take but as for me give me liberty or give me death   this speech is the best response i can give

the reason a company creates more stock is to generate more capital so that this can be utilized and more returns can be generated it is commonly done as a follow on public offer typically the funds are used to retire high cost debts and fund future expansion what stops the company from doing it    are small investors cheated    it 's like you have joined a car pool with 4 people and you are that you own of the total seats so when most of them decide that we would be better of using minivan with 4 more persons you can not complain that you now only own 1/8 of the total seats even before you were having just one seat and even after you just have one seat overall it maybe better as the ride would be good

that does n't really matter it 's already figured out in the percentage japan makes more money but also has more debt   what does matter is that japan has a high probability of being damaged by natural disasters and losing hundreds of billions of infrastructure and goods not only that but as long as global temps rise the chance of major disaster rises with it greece is comparatively well insulated compared to japan if you were to say which nation looks better at a 100 + year projection you have to consider these things the tsunami that hit japan was not large by standards and that means japan has a reasonable probability of near total in the coming centuries certainly not a good place to make a long term bet on

here is my perception of the situation obtained from reading degiro 's client agreement if degiro shuts down it will notify you about the fact at least one month in advance and you will have enough time to order a transfer of your positions to a different broker if degiro shuts down unexpectedly your assets will remain to be held at spv a separate legal entity which degiro uses to hold the financial instruments belonging to the clients since spv does nothing else but holding the assets it is very unlikely that something bad will happen with it on its own with some help from degiro and/or the regulator you should be able to transfer your assets from spv to a different custodian and broker and thus regain control over them if you have a non custody account you have slightly higher chances of losing your assets because degiro can borrow your securities held at spv if both the client for whom degiro borrowed a security and degiro itself go bankrupt at the same time the lent security will not be returned to spv there will arise a shortage which will be proportionally distributed among the accounts of the clients holding this particular security however then the investor compensation scheme should kick in and help you recover up to 20000 eur of your losses

starvation is a highly physical state people are well motivated to avoid if one finds themselves in that state it is because something perhaps circumstances perhaps something else prevents them from adding value to society this is not a personal judgement of the individual its reality   his circumstances add no value to the egg the egg would provide the same nutrition to the starving man as it would the fed man and sustain each of them for exactly the same amount of time the starving mans desire for food does not make him more willing to pay it makes him willing to pay for smaller quantities of cheaper poorer quality eggs the well fed man is able to afford greater and better qualities of egg thus he is more willing to pay

without knowing actual numbers it 's tough to say   personally i would pay off the car then going forward use the money that would have been paid on your car note toward your mortgage   i always think of things in the worst possible scenario   it 's easier and faster to repossess a car than to foreclose on real estate   also in an emergency situation depleting your fund for your car loan and your mortgage would be significantly more detrimental than only paying a mortgage with a car owned outright   fewer obligations means fewer things to draw down your funds in an emergency whether the tax deductability of the mortgage interest outweighs the lower rate on your car loan will depend on a lot of factors that have n't been shared   i think it 's safe to assume with only 1 of separation the real difference is n't significant   i think when determining which credit cards to pay off choosing the one with the highest rate is smart   but that 's not the situation you 're in if you do n't have foreclosure concerns i 'd still pay off the car then start investing

yes   the investment world is extremely fast paced and competitive there are loads of professional traders with working day in and day out to make smarter faster trade decisions than you if you try to compete with them there ’s a better than fair chance you ’ll lose precious time and money which kind of defeats the purpose a good wealth manager in short they can save you time and money and help you take the most advantage of your current savings or you can think about it in terms of cost most wealth managers charge an annual fee as a of the amount invested for their services this fee can range anywhere from close to zero to 0.75 depending upon how sophisticated the strategy is that the money will be invested in and what kind of additional services they have to offer investing in the s&p500 on the behalf of the investor should n’t need a fee but investing in a smart beta or an alpha strategy that generates returns independent of the market ’s movement and certainly commands a fee but how does one figure if that fee is justified it is really simple what is the risk adjusted performance of the strategy what is the sharpe ratio large successful funds like renaissance technologies and citadel can charge 3 in addition to 30 of profits because even after that their returns are much better than the market i have this rule of thumb for money management fees that i am willing to pay

see solid reading literature for investment retirement income taxes not exactly the same question but a great reading list for you you are putting the cart before the horse here first you learn then you invest there 's a large danger in confusing intelligent investing with fooling around the idea that you think you 'd like to use derivatives without knowing how or why is a tough one   i suggest you go to yahoo finance and set yourself up with a portfolio click on the my portfolios tab in effect creating your own simulated account assume you are starting with some reasonable amount of money say $ 10,000 but not $ 1 m as part of real investing is to learn how to asset allocate the funds you have learning that way for a time is the smarter way to start that said individual stocks are not for everyone most investors can lead a successful investing life by using etfs or mutual funds of one type or another learning to pick individual stocks can be a life 's work and if you put too little time into it are likely to be disappointed but learning by paper trading can be a good learning experience nonetheless

do n't it as an employee whether of your own corporation or of someone else you get a salary and there are deductions taken out as the owner of a business you get hopefully business profits as well and in general you often have other sources of income from investments etc your estimated tax payments are based on the difference between what was withheld from your salary and what you will owe based on salary business income and other sources so in essence you just add up all the income you expect estimate what the tax bill will be and subtract what 's been withheld that 's your estimated tax payment

make sure to check the language describing the discount the company may be matching your contribution by 5 instead of a discount   you will likely be taxed on the match as compensation and your benefit would net to less than 5    the next risk is that you 've increased your exposure if your company does poorly   in the worst case scenario you could lose your wages to a layoff and your portfolio to a falling share price   investing in other companies will diversify this risk as for benefits you get the 5 less taxes for free which is n't a bad thing in my book just do n't put everything you own into the stock   it should be part of your overall investing strategy

your company wants to raise $ for a new project but costs are incurred by issuing securities underwriting legal fees etc first you must determine how much of the $ is going to be debt and equity the company 's target d e ratio is 50 or .50 for every $ 0.50 of debt raised they want to raise $ 1.00 in equity $ 1.00 + $ 0.50 = $ 1.50 $ = 1/3 debt that leaves the equity portion being 2/3 $ 1/3 = $ debt   and $ 2/3 = $ equity using the weighted average cost then you would do something like this = 1/3 + 2/3 = = $ = $

i think you are making this more complicated that it has to be   in the end you will end up with a car that you paid x and is worth y. your numbers are a bit hard to follow   hopefully i got this right i am no accountant this is how i would figure the deal the payments made are irrelevant   the downpayment is irrelevant as it is still a reduction in net worth    your current car has a asset value of <   that should make anyone pause a bit    in order to get into this new car you will have to finance the shortfall on the current car the price of the vehicle the immediate depreciation say 7,000   in the end you will have a car worth 38 k and owe   so you will have a asset value of <   obviously a much worse situation   to do this car deal it would cost the person of net worth the day the deal was done   as time on it would be more as the reduction in debt is unlikely to keep up with the depreciation additionally the new car purchase screen shows a payment of $ if you bought the car with zero down   except you do n't have zero down you have down   making the car payment higher i with months   so rather than having a hit to your cash flow of $ for 69 more months you would have a payment of about $ 1000 for 84 months if you could obtain the interest rate of 3.5 those are the two things i would focus on is the reduction in net worth and the cash flow liability    i understand you are trying to get a feel for things but there are two things that make this very unrealistic   the first is financing   it is unlikely that financing could be obtained with this deal and if it could this would be considered a sub prime loan   however perhaps a relative could finance the deal secondly there is no way even a moderately financially responsible spouse would approve this deal   that is provided there were not assets like a few million if that is the case why not just write a check

the auction market is where investors such you and me as well as market makers buy and sell securities   the auction markets operate with the familiar bid ask pricing that you see on financial pages such as google and yahoo   the market makers are institutions that are there to provide liquidity so that investors can easily buy and sell shares at a fair price market makers need to have on hand a suitable supply of shares to meet investor demands   when market makers feel the need to either increase or decrease their supply of a particular security quickly they turn to the dealer market in order to participate in a dealer market you must be designated a market maker   as noted already market makers are dedicated to providing liquidity for the auction market in certain securities and therefore require that they have on hand a suitable supply of those securities which they support   for example if a market maker for apple shares is low on their supply of apple shares then will go the dealer market to purchase more apple shares   conversely if they are holding what they feel are too many apple shares they will go to the dealer market to sell apple shares   the dealer market does operate on a bid ask basis contrary to your stated understanding the bid ask prices quoted on the dealer market are more or less identical to those on the auction market except the quote sizes will be generally much larger this is the case because otherwise why would a market maker offer to sell shares to another market maker at a price well below what they could themselves sell them for in the auction market   and similarly with buy orders   if market makers are generally holding low quantities of a particular security this will drive up the price in both the dealer market and the auction market similarly if market makers are generally holding too much of a particular security this may drive down prices on both the auction market and the dealer market

here 's another answer on the topic saving for retirement how much is enough an angle on it this question made me think of a good approach here is to focus on savings rate which you can control rather than the final number which you ca n't plus it will fluctuate with the markets and make you nervous for example focus on saving at least 10 of your income annually 15 is much safer   if you focus on the final number the way it works in the real world is that you save as much as you can but there are lots of random factors and unknowns some people end up having to work a lot longer than they hoped to others end up able to retire early others retire on time but have to spend less than they hoped but the one thing you can often control as long as you have an income and no catastrophes anyway is that you spend less than you make

insurance is a funny product   as you said it is a little like gambling   when i buy term life insurance i 'm essentially betting that i 'm going to die within the next 20 years and the insurance company is betting that i 'm not   i 'm hoping to lose that bet besides all of the reasons that other answers mentioned i think part of the reason is psychological   as in my example i 'm setting up a kind of a win win situation for myself here   let 's go with car insurance a less morbid example than my first example   if i do n't get into a car accident great   if i do get into a car accident then the traumatic event is at least offset by the fact that the financial impact to me is minimal   win win

big banks are not the only big money out there   in fact big banks have way more oversight than most other businesses   everyone uses banks for most things   it 's kind of hard not to these days   but banks are built to handle money   that 's what they do   of course banks are almost always involved in everything that requires money   i do n't understand why you brought this up at all   it does n't really support your point and has little to do with my point

i certainly think there is some truth here but a lot of those jobs have become more competitive because of schooling requirements you do n’t have to study to be electrician but it ’s 2017 it will certainly give you a leg up everyone requires some kind of schooling unions are great but those dying or dead in most places it ’s nice your husband ’s place offers apprenticeships because those are few and far between today    i think it ’s partially true that people do n’t look in the right places i do n’t think people are lazy then you also have to keep in mind socio economic status a lot of people are very poor and mildly educated and those jobs just are n’t there for them it ’s beyond a jobs problem at this point a lot of people are studying people in grinding poverty like victims    this is why i was trying to say that i do n’t really know how to fix it a lot of people are beyond help at this point and telling them to get off their lazy ass and get a job is n’t as easy as it sounds it ’s great your husband has a union and a good job but that ’s not the case for everyone there are a lot of moving parts there check out a little background research on that it brings a little more perspective it ’s complex    edit i ’m reading that a lot of trade unions will sponsor apprenticeships which goes to my other point that unions are dead come to wisconsin and try to find a union job good fucking luck

firstly comparing debt to gdp is comparing a stock to a flow you 're committing a that is warned about in econ 101   secondly i appreciate your concern about the height of debt but it 's really just a measure of the flow of capital debt is an investment too and the headline debt number mixes government corporate and consumer debt which have very different attributes in fact the holders of most government debt are normal citizens and pensioners more concerning might be the levels of consumer debt but i would argue that only becomes an issue if debt starts being issued fraudulently to people who should n't be receiving it e.g. ahead of the mortgage crisis    there may be nothing i can say to convince you otherwise and i 'm not saying that is n't something to be concerned about but i 'm trying to remind you that the story is more complicated than you 're letting on   finally respectfully please do n't about derivatives the notional value is very high but derivatives are a zero sum market unlike the stock market e.g. and in fact the majority of derivatives are for hedging and reducing risk while it 's certainly possible to use derivatives to leverage oneself this really only happens with hedge fund type operations and even if the derivative market blew up i highly doubt it would affect average people very much   tl;dr if there 's another crash in the next 5 years i doubt it will be due to debt outside of perhaps china but i think that 'd lead to more of a recession than a full blown crisis it definitely will not be because of derivatives

the short answer is it depends mainly on the type of record and how old it is most retained records should be organized by year first then by type have a look at this typically you should do the following
# 273925
you 're making $ 100k together per year you 're not in the hole you 're in the top 25 of all households and the top 10 of non family households as yours would be   to be blunt you 're not in the rely on assistance area you 're in the save up for your downpayment sector my suggestion would be to figure out a way to save more than $ a month for now   $ 100k gross income means you have about $ 8k net income per month $ 2k for rent and other necessities means you have $ 6k per month that you can potentially save   even half of that $ 3k per month means you have $ saved by the end of this year and $ on an annual basis as far as marriage or domestic partnership i would n't get into one based on whether it helps you afford a home   it might be a good idea because it helps you handle some of the details arising when you have joint property perhaps but not solely for the financial aspect and as far as how much home is realistic   $ 250k is certainly realistic if you can save up enough for a good down payment   try to get to the 20 25 range   if you 're already halfway there another year of renting wo n't kill you and it will mean no pmi and much better rates    also consider a 15 year mortgage we 're in the same general income category as you and manage a 15 year on a $ 250k range house quite nicely   it does n't add all that much to your monthly payment amount compared to what you 'd expect particularly since the monthly payment includes property taxes which wo n't increase based on the length of the mortgage now that we have actual numbers from the op so without cutting anything you have $ 2k yourself you can be saving   this assumes your rent number of $ is your portion of rent and not the 100 amount   that 's $ per year just by yourself   on top of that you 've got another $ 40k or so coming from your partner at least some of which should be available as well if he she is going to be co owning   but if not at least you have about $ 2000 a month you can be saving   you could also downsize the car cut cable tv downsize the phone and have another $ 500 or so available but it does n't really look like you need to do that given how much you have available now i 'd look at what you 're doing with that per month right now and see how you can free most of it up   you have n't mentioned a few things like utilities not sure if that 's just or if your partner is paying them so perhaps not all of it is available   but even $ 1000 a month is $ 12000 to add to the $ 20000 you have now which makes a big dent in that down payment

if i invest in individual stocks i will from time to time sell stocks that are n't performing well if the value of my portfolio has gone up by 10 then the value of my portfolio has gone up by 10 regardless of whether selling those stocks is labeled as failures same thing for mutual funds selling underperforming stocks is perfectly ordinary and calling it failures in order to imply some sort of dishonesty is simply dishonest

are you asking why you are n't entitled to money that someone gave you by mistake i think the answer is obvious even if you do n't like it if you overpaid your taxes how would you feel if the government said sorry finder 's it is n't our mistake you ca n't do math   your best course of action is to work with the agency to see if they will work out a payment plan so it is n't a big hit all at one time they are likely to work with you since it was their mistaken advice that got you into the situation

because people bought their shares under the premise that they would make more money and if the company completely lied about that they will be subject to several civil and criminal violations if people did n't believe the company was going to make more money they would have valued their shares lower during the ipo by not forming much of a market at all

one economic reason to turn down a raise is if your company gives bonuses based on performance reviews when you get a raise in salary your boss usually expects a better performance from you that being said if you get the raise and your performance review is worse you might get a smaller annual income

tax wo n't be an issue you have a personal tax free allowance of £ this coming year so your first £ will be tax free is pretty abysmal sorry but we 've wrecked the economy for you young so you 'll only earn about £ 84 a month not as awesome as you were expecting i think would recommend getting advice on other means of generating an income with your 100k because if you bought a cheap flat cheap enough to own without a mortgage you could probably earn between £ a month fairly comfortably i 'm not suggesting you become a landlord just that interest rates currently suck

wow where to start   your ad hominem attack was when you shifted away from the discussion and started questioning me on whether or not i had been around low skilled workers and even going as far as to give a judgment on if was around average people the definition is of an argument or reaction directed against a person rather than the position they are maintaining you went away from the topic and instead directed your argument at me which has nothing to do with my position on minimum wage you seek to discredit me as to say my views are invalid because in your opinion i have n't had enough experience with low skill workers it does n't matter if i have or had n't one 's experience or lack thereof with low skilled workers does n't make their position any more wrong or right this is a textbook example of ad hominem   your straw man was when you shifted the position to suggest things i did n't say in order to argue against them the definition is an intentionally misrepresented proposition that is set up because it is easier to defeat than an opponent 's real argument you say i assumed things i never even mentioned such as your claim that i would say rich people did n't earn their success and that poor people were not at fault for their low achievement once again no where did i suggest this and this suggestion by you away from my argument on paying people a live able wage basically one could say this was brought up by you to argue about something you felt would be easier to defeat   there were clear reasons i threw those fallacies out you tell me i do n't know what i 'm talking about yet you do n't even get it right and overlook everything that was stated smh   your whole response keeps proving my point once again you are so focused on whether i 've had experience working with or managing people nice goal post moving btw as if that makes your position more qualified ad hominem again when the reality is i can have a rational thought about something by reading up on logical and rational positions on this and seeing what the statistics and research say oh by the way i have had multiple economics classes in college did you i read up and studied this stuff and my tests and papers on it so now what does my collegiate backed economics understanding now outweigh the fact you just simply hired some low skilled workers   there are many topics out there you and i have no experience with but we can have a well thought out position on them because we talk to experts and read up on the research let me restate this again just because you have more experience with low skill labor does not make you any more qualified over me to have a smart logical and rational understanding of the effects of raising the minimum wage the same with the fact that just because i probably have had more collegiate studies on economics than you it does n't mean my position is any more right than yours or someone else 's   gt;you read a study that is incredibly biased and take it to the grave   this gave me a laugh because it 's the equivalent of your arguments do n't agree with mine so clearly your 's is the biased one dude we all are biased and stand for things you are just as biased as me i do n't have to give equal time to every position out there as if both are equal it 's often a false equivalence to do so anyways for example the idea that we should not raise minimum wage more because poor people are lazy and undeserving does not deserve the same consideration as inflation has caused the purchasing power of workers on the minimum wage to decrease to levels where they can not afford to live and thus now must seek out tax payer backed public assistance programs in order to make ends meet so a solution would be to raise the minimum wage   last your argument against raising the minimum wage comes down to i do n't think they deserve it because some people do n't work hard and my response is i do n't give a shit if someone works that job no matter how low skilled it is they deserve to be paid at a level that is live able other than that it 's their fault if they do n't do a good job and get fired   have you ever considered why the minimum wage came about in the first place it was to keep businesses in check because they were taking advantage of people and paying them poor wages wages were so low that some would argue they were technically slave wages yet as inflation rises and the purchasing power falls instead of bumping those wages back up people like you sit there and are like nah they are lazy and do n't deserve it trust me i know a guy that 's lazy that works those jobs he 's dumb too and does n't have a high school diploma you argument one again is just attacking their character with no consideration of statistical analysis and the economic effect of a change in the minimum wage    now to step away from the whole argument you and i have different values you do n't value people at low skilled levels as if their job is almost worthless yet you need them for your business sure you smile and say hello to the guy that brings you your burger or your coffee but the reality is you mostly do n't care about him in your mind if he only makes $ 7.25 then you have the right to assume that he does n't work hard and is undeserving of proper pay unless he 's proven it in some way to you your mindset is a problem because you are okay with people and then you assume whatever negative traits about them that you can as your justification for it   i do n't give a shit about how many houses have been built in houston or how many painters your friend brought to seattle it 's completely irrelevant to all of this

yes very prohibitive a common thing i was doing over 8 years ago was in fact    the problem with this method is that later one we wanted the users to be able to change their username so instead we started doing something like this   of account   was a script that used every even character 's binary representation to modify the string itself like my own function that was not good enough for professional use but unique enough that it drastically changed the final hash most people would probably say this was overkill but i did n't want to just be sending two hashes into a in case some day someone created a rainbow table specifically designed to crack hashes of hashes   the timestamp of account creation was stored with the username in it 's own table and accessing that table was logged differently and audited separately so a hacker would have to be doing some really weird things in order to get that info

if you or they feel uneasy about you simply paying more rent than them for equal usage you can work out an agreement where they pay in other ways for example i once lived with someone that made about double what i did and so he paid more rent than i did in exchange i was responsible for cleaning the kitchen if your roommates hate cleaning then you could substitute something like running errands cooking or looking after plants landscaping if they have some specialized skills then they might be able to provide those instead car maintenance financial management etc of course you 'll want to agree ahead of time on what the conditions of satisfaction for the task are such as how often the kitchen will have to be cleaned and what the definition of clean is you also ca n't be a jerk and make their job extra hard such as by completely trashing the kitchen every night   obviously it will depend on the temperament of your roommates whether or not they 'll be happy with this or feel insulted being the help it worked for us because it was a task he hated and one i did n't mind and it kept me from feeling like i was off him i would feel them out when you propose a possible rent and utilities split if they feel like it 's an unfair burden on you but they ca n't afford more then you could suggest this as a way for everyone to contribute equally whatever you decide to do do n't hold it over their heads that you pay more agree on something that everyone feels is fair whatever that is if you want a concession due to paying more such as you get the garage get to pick the art on the walls whatever then agree to that up front then accept that you 've made a fair deal and they do n't owe you anything beyond what you 've all agreed to it 's awful to feel like you live in someone else 's home and that you are getting into ever deeper debt with a close friend or significant other and it will breed resentment if you ca n't do that then do n't share an apartment with them at all the most important thing is that everyone feels it 's fair regardless of the numbers if you can not get to that agreement through dollars alone you can have them contribute to the home in other ways such as cleaning cooking or performing maintenance just make sure that everyone truly does feel it 's fair and that you are all equals

why is the us still working with paper checks when europe went digital about a decade ago tax filing is just another area in which the us is lagging it costs money and the us is quite close to bankruptcy as seen by the repeated government   also the us tax code is quite complicated for instance i doubt there 's anyone who has a full and complete list of all allowed deductions   some comments wonder about multiple incomes this does n't require tax filing either my local tax authority just sends me a combined statement with data from 2 employers and 2 banks and asks me to confirm the resulting payment this is possible because tax number usage is strictly regulated ssn abuse in the us presumably makes this problematic

yes that 's true excerpt from the warren buffett way   in november 2000 warren buffett and berkshire hathaway paid about $ 1 billion for benjamin moore amp co. the mercedes of paint companies founded in by the moore brothers in their brooklyn basement benjamin moore today is fifth largest paint manufacturer in the united states and has an unmatched reputation   for   quality it was reported that buffett paid a 25 percent premium over the stock ’s   then   current   price   on   the   surface   that   might   seem to contradict one of buffett ’s iron clad rules that he will act only when the price is low enough to constitute a margin of safety   however   we   also   know   that   buffett   is   not   afraid   to   pay for   quality   even   more   revealing   the   stock   price   jumped   50 percent to $ per share after the deal was announced this tells us that either buffett found yet another company that was undervalued or else that the rest of the investing world was betting   on   buffett ’s   acumen   and   traded   the   price   up   even   or   both

it 's not impossible to forecast the future price of a commodity however it 's exactly that an educated guess much like the weather and the further out that prediction is made the higher the percentage error is expected a lot of information is gathered by various instruments etc at a very high cost of time and money to produce a prediction that starts breaking down after about five days and is no more than a wild guess after about ten how accurately a price can be forecast depends on the commodity there are seasonal and thus cyclical changes in many commodities on top of which there is a general trend which is nearer term a pretty decent prediction can thus be arrived at with a relatively simple seasonally adjusted percentage change algorithm take a moving average of the last few measurements compute the percent change versus the same period last year current minus last divided by last and multiply it by last year 's number for the current day or month to arrive at a pretty decent prediction for the current and near future periods up to about as far ahead as you have looked behind another thing you may need to do is normalize many price graphs are very the price of a stock may fluctuate many percentage points on a single day and there 's a lot of noise inherent in them a common tool to normalize is a box and plot which for a given time period will aggregate all samples within that period and give you a measurement of the lowest sample highest sample median and the range of each 25 of the full sample space box plots can also be plotted on the range or middle fifty this throws away the very noisy outliers and a much more regular plot from the inner part of the bell curve you can reverse engineer a best fit line connecting the elements of each box and the closer two lines are the more likely the real future data will be around that area because the between those to lines is very dense 25 of the values are in a very small range meaning many samples occurred there lastly there are outside factors that are not included in simple percentage growth big news must be taken into account by introducing more subjective guesses about future data if you see an active hurricane season coming or a hurricane bearing down on houston then it 's reasonable to assume that the price of oil and/or refined oil products like gas and jet fuel will skyrocket a cyclical growth model will not predict these events but you can factor in the likelihood of a big change with a base onto which you add last year 's numbers and onto that you add regular growth conversely when a huge spike happens due to a non cyclical event like a natural disaster you must smooth it out by reducing the readings to fit in the curve otherwise your model for next year will expect the same anomaly at the same time and so it will be wrong these adjustments are necessary but the more of them you make the less the graph reflects real history and the more it reflects what you think it should have been

p e ratio is useful but limited as others have said another problem is that it does n't show leverage two companies in the same industry could have the same p e but be differently leveraged in that case i would buy the company with more equity and less debt as it should be a less risky investment to compare companies and take leverage debt into account you could use the ev ebit ratio instead its slightly more complicated to calculate and is n't presented by as many data sources though enterprise value ev can be said to represent the value of the company if someone would buy it today and then pay off all its interest bearing debt ev is essentially calculated like this market capitalization plus cash cash equivalents   minus interest bearing debt   this is then divided by ebit earnings before interest and tax to get the ratio one drawback of this ratio though is that it ca n't be used for financials since their balance sheet pretty much consists of debt and the enterprise value therefore does n't tell us very much also like the p e ratio it is dependent on fresh numbers a balance sheet is just a glimpse of the financial situation on one day and this could and probably will although not drastically for bigger companies change to the next day

in 1929 the dow jones industrial average peaked at roughly 390 just prior to the great depression it did not return to that level again until 25 years later in 25 years is a long time to go without any returns especially if you are a retiree there is no easy answer with investing trying to time the tops and bottoms is widely regarded as a foolhardy endeavor but whenever you invest you expose yourself to the possibility of this scenario the only thing i highly recommend is not to base your decision on the historical returns from 1975 to 2000 that the other answers have presented these returns can be explained by policy changes that many are coming to understand are unsustainable the growth of our debt income inequality and monetary manipulation by central banks are all reasons to be skeptical of future returns

ca n't tell you where to go for a good policy but i can tell you that most brokers make a hefty commission out of your payments for at least a year before you even start funding the tax sheltered investment account that you 're trying to buy under the umbrella of life insurance you 'll have to do a lot of homework to hunt down a reputable discount broker or a direct policy purchase from the insurance company life insurance requires need the description is vague enough that you can probably still get the account despite being a single male with no apparent heirs to benefit but it raises the question of why you are buying the insurance whole life policies require you to maintain a certain ratio of investment to premium payment and you will likely never be able access all of the money in the account for your own personal usage compare several policies from several brokers and companies read all the critical sources you can about the pitfalls and dangers of commissions fees and taxes eating the benefits of your account verify that the insurance company you buy the policy from is financially stable after the market crash you are paying a commission to pool your money into their investment fund and if your insurer goes under you 'll have to get a portion of your money possibly only the principle back from the state insurance commissioner some companies sold pretty generous policies during the bubble and have cut their offerings way down without fixing their marketing literature and rosy promises   finally let us know what you find it never hurts to see hard numbers and to run multiple eyes over the legalese in these contracts

i do n't know why stocks in some industries tend to have lower prices per share than others it does n't really matter much whether a company has shares selling for $ 100 each or 10,000,000 shares selling for $ 10 each either way the total value is the same companies generally like to keep the share price relatively low so that if someone wants to buy a small amount they can like if the price was $ 10,000 per share than an investor with less than $ 10,000 to put in that one stock would be priced out of the market if it 's $ 10 then if someone wants $ 10 they can buy one share and if someone wants $ 10,000 they can buy 1000 shares as to why energy stocks are volatile i can think of several reasons one in our current world energy is highly susceptible to politics a lot of the world 's energy comes from the middle east which is a notoriously unstable region any time there 's conflict there energy supplies from the region become uncertain oil producing countries may embargo countries that they do n't like a war will at the very least interfere with transportation and shipping and may result in oil wells being destroyed etc two energy is consumed when you use it and most consumers have very limited ability to stockpile so you 're constantly buying the energy you need as you need it so if demand goes down it is reflected immediately compare this to say clothing most people expect to keep the same clothes for years wearing them repeatedly hopefully washing them now and then so if for some reason you decided today that you only need three red shirts instead of four this might not have any immediate impact on your buying it could be months before you would have bought a new red shirt anyway there is a tendency for the market to react rather slowly to changes in demand for shirts but with energy if you decide you only need to burn 3 gallons of gas per week instead of 4 your consumption goes down immediately within days three really adding to number two energy is highly perishable especially some forms of energy if a solar power station is capable of producing 10 but today there is only demand for 9 you ca n't save the unused for some future time when demand is higher it 's gone you can charge a battery with it but that 's pretty limited you can pile up coal or store natural gas in a tank until you need it but you ca n't save the output of a power plant note numbers two and three also apply to food which is why food production is also very volatile

edit after reading one of the comments on the original question i realized that there is a much more intuitive way to think about this if you look at it as a standard pv calculation and hold each of the cashflows constant really what 's happening is that because of inflation the discount rate is n't the full value of the interest rate really the discount rate is only the portion of the interest rate above the inflation rate hence in the standard perpetuity pv equation pv = a r r becomes the interest rate less the inflation rate which gives you pv = a i g that seems like a much better way to get to the answer than all the machinations i was originally trying original answer i think i finally figured this out the general term for this type of system in which the payments increase over time is a gradient series annuity in this specific example since the payment is increasing by a percentage each period not a constant rate this would be considered a geometric gradient series according to this link the formula for the present value of a geometric gradient series of payments is where p is the present value of this series of cashflows    is the initial payment for period 1 i.e. the amount you want to withdraw adjusted for inflation    g is the gradient or growth rate of the periodic payment in this case this is the inflation rate    i is the interest rate    n is the number of payments this is almost exactly what i was looking for in my original question the only problem is this is for a fixed amount of time i.e. n periods in order to figure out the formula for a perpetuity we need to find the limit of the right side of this equation as the number of periods n approaches infinity luckily in this equation n is already well isolated to a single term 1 + + and since we know that the interest rate i has to be greater than the inflation rate g the limit of that factor is 0 so after replacing that term with 0 our equation simplifies to the following note i do n't do this stuff for a living and honestly do n't have a fantastic finance iq it 's been a while since i 've done any calculus or even this much algebra so i may have made an error in the math

entire books have been written on how to get to the end of the month before you get to the end of the money it 's a very broad problem but in your case let me point out that your salary never suddenly disappears unless you 're paid in cash and it blew away or was stolen while you were sleeping you spent it   for a month monitor your spending one approach is to write everything down in a small notebook come up with categories like rent food transportation and look at the totals over time you can estimate what you spend in a normal week or month on these things when you spend much more you can ask yourself why it might be because you just money you did n't have on something you did n't need it might be because something broke and you had n't been saving a small reserve month after month to pay for those repairs when they would be needed it might be because some bills only come once a year or every 6 months and you had n't been saving a small reserve to pay that bill when it came in   once you understand where your money is going and why it sometimes runs out you can work out what to do about that it might involve spending less but that 's not the first step the first step is not to be surprised by sudden that are anything but

you ca n't short a stock unless there is someone willing and able to lend shares to you and there are several reasons why that might not be the case first is a new stock which means that no one has held it very long it 's much easier to short ibm or exxon mobil where there are some long term holders who would like to earn a little extra money lending you their shares but if everyone involved is busy buying or selling the stock there wo n't be many people to lend it that 's not manipulation that 's just the market another reason may be a large short interest that is many others have shorted it before you that 's dangerous for you because if some lenders want to pull their shares off the market they can cause a short squeeze that will drive the price much higher   and stock shortages can be orchestrated by the company or large investors to artificially drive the price higher unless you have a lot of experience do n't try shorting small cap stocks try to gain some experience with large caps like ibm or exxon mobil first those are stocks that people at least ca n't play games with you will win or lose based on the market itself

when you buy something with your credit card the store pays a fee to the credit card company typically a base fee of 15 to 50 cents plus 2 to 3 of the purchase at least that 's what it was a few years back when i had a tiny business and i wanted to accept credit cards big chain stores pay less because they are buying in bulk and have negotiating power just because you are n't paying interest does n't mean the credit card company is n't making money off of you in fact if you pay your monthly bill promptly they 're probably making more off of you because they 're collecting 2 or 3 for a month or less instead of the 1 to 2 per month that they can charge in interest the only situation i know where you can get money from a credit card company for free is when they offer convenience checks or a balance transfer with no up front fee i get such an offer every now and then i presume the credit card company does that for the same reason that stores give out free samples they hope that if you try the card you 'll continue using it to them it 's a marketing cost no different than the cost of putting an ad on television

cheapest is one thing   you can absolutely shop in the market and find the lowest possible price   i can think of three places to shop each with an up and downside i would think that what you really mean is the best price for the service   just like shopping for a car you have to decide what you need vs what is nice to have decide what features you need   do you need long distance   do you need caller i d   do you need to call friends and family find out what you have available to you through associations   often schools work or a club you belong to have deals for service discounts   look at your insurance plan or aaa membership for the crazy discounts decide what kinds of service will meet your needs buy the cheapest service do not enter a contract   even if the price is slightly lower   at least not at first   if you try out your service and love it enter the contract if and only if the total price measured over length of the contract is less   with cell phones especially it is absolutely possible to save money buying month to month vs a 2 year contract   even when you buy equipment for full price up front ask for the bare minimum service from your local phone company because phone companies are often regulated monopolies they might have a bare minimum level of service they are required to offer by the municipality   they probably do n't advertise it or push it but it might exist if you call and ask   you basically get a dial tone price is dictated by a government board so you do n't have to worry about shopping for deals not the cheapest possible solution this is popular plan the youth oriented market but more and more people of all demographics are using their cellphones only   there are downsides 911 etc and shopping for the best cell phone plan can be a full time job but it does offer a way to save money by simply not having home phone service might be possible to score organizational discounts through work or groups you belong to cellphones require batteries and can go dead not good for emergencies voice over internet protocol uses your existing internet connection   you can buy a cheap regular phone and plug it into the voip box and use it like any other phone   voip can either be very inexpensive for all the features you get or just plain inexpensive   there are providers who sell a monthly service yearly service or no service plan at all you buy a device and get service as long as you own the device   taxes to the government are always due so nothing is ever free sometimes the provider is just computer software so a minimalist would like that emergency services are more reliable than cellular if you follow extra steps to set them up can be confusing to buy   some require contracts some special devices some require a bit of technical know how to setup   be sure to evaluate the total cost of ownership when comparing prices

people put conditions on donations all the time they donate to the red cross for a specific disaster the donate money to a church for the building fund they donate money to a hospital to buy a new x ray machine they donate money to the scouts for a new dining hall   it is possible to donate money to a non profit for a specific purpose if the non profit does n't want to accept the money with those strings they can refuse generally these specific projects are initiated by the non profit but there is no requirement that the idea originate with the non profit   it is also up to the non profit and their legal advisers regarding how strictly they view those strings if you donate money for web design and they do n't spend it all can they pay net years hosting bill with the money or must they hold it for a few years for when they need a designer again if the company wants to provide the service they can structure the project to pay their employees for their time they pay employees for $ 100 of labor while the website the pay and benefits reduce profit thus lowering taxes   donating money to the non profit to be given back to the company does n't seem to be the best way to structure transaction at best it is a wash   donating money to a charity and then directing exactly which contractor will perform the service starts to look like money laundering and most charities will get wary

suddenly its not just comparing the current price to the price of the contract or is it sure it is   suppose you bought 100 option contracts each for 100 shares and paid a $ 1 per share premium $ 10,000 total   now those options are trading for $ 1.50 per share   you have an unrealized $ 0.50 gain per share or $ 5,000 the $ 10,000 in options you bought are now worth $ 15,000   it holds whether they were bought to open or close a position or whether they are puts or calls   the only difference is whether you bought or sold the options the arithmetic is just reversed for selling an option but lets say we have an option where the payoff is k where ct is the market price what do you do then your current unrealized p&l is different than the payoff   the payoff only happens at maturity   the current p&l is based on current market prices just like stock   option prices all have a time premium making them worth more than their payoff intrinsic value prior to maturity

this article is interesting but deeply biased the writer manages to write pages and pages on a feature about charney that only tells charney 's story he interviews i think unless he 's always just quoting other sources a few other folks but only ones who think he 's brilliant and was wronged    it was only in the last 25 of a very long article when the author even bothers to reference the criticisms and discussion of sexual harassment and culture of women that was part of what started the blowback from customers and though it says something like you ca n't talk about charney 's story without mentioning the it seems like an afterthought basically a lot of people said charney was a creep and some of them sued him but he says the allegations are false so let 's move on   it was n't just increasingly uncomfortable ads it was also people saying they were coerced into those ads people saying the workplace was almost toxic in it 's sexual charge charney saying stuff like then they should n't work here the fact that people working in the stores were rated on their attractiveness and size that aa would n't make or sell clothes past a certain size because he did n't want large people wearing his clothes the fact that the clothes cost $ 50 for a shirt then fell apart etc    charney certainly has his side of things but i personally think it was irresponsible to write a feature this long without giving more than a paragraph or two of context into why it was n't just a cruel board doing him wrong but that even many of his employees and customers turned away from the brand

here are the few scenarios that may be worth noting in terms of using different types of accounts traditional ira in this case the monies would grow tax deferred and all monies coming out will be taxed as ordinary income think of it as everything is in one big black box and the whole thing is coming out to be taxed roth ira in this case you could withdraw the contributions anytime without penalty source should one want it for further research past 59.5 the withdrawals are tax free in my understanding thus one could access some monies earlier than retirement age if one considers all the contributions that are at least 5 years old taxable account in this case each year there will be distributions to pay taxes as well as anytime one sells shares as that will trigger capital gains in this case taxes are worth noting as depending on the index fund one may have various taxes to consider for example a bond index fund may have some interest that would be taxed that the ira could shelter to some extent while index funds can be a low cost option in some cases there may be capital gains each year to keep up with the index for example small cap indices and value indices would have stocks that may the index by either becoming mid cap or large cap in the case of small cap or the value stock 's valuation rises enough that it becomes a growth stock that is pulled out of the index this is why some people may prefer to use tax advantaged accounts for those funds that may not be as tax efficient the bogleheads have an article on various accounts that can also be useful as 's comment referenced disclosure i 'm not an accountant or work for the irs

your mortgage represents a negative cash flow of $ x for n months the typical mortgage prepayment does n't reduce your next payment but does reduce the length of the mortgage if you look at the amortization table of a 30 year loan you might see a payment of $ 1000 but only $ 50 going to principal so if on day one you send an extra $ 51 or so to the bank you find that in 30 years you just saved that $ 1000 payment in effect it was a long term bond or cd yielding the post tax rate of the mortgage say your loan were 7 at 7 money doubles every 10 years or so 30 years is 3 doubles or if i were to offer you $ 1000 and ask for $ 7500 in 30 years you might accept it with an agreement to buy me out if you refinanced for me that would be an investment just like buying a bond in fact there is a real return as you see the cash flow at the end the payments not made are your payback   those who insist it 's not an investment are correct in the strict sense of the word 's definition but pedantic for the fact in practice the prepayment is a choice to be considered alongside other investment choices when i have a mortgage i am the the bank the mortgagee same as a company issuing a bond the bank holds my bond and i 'm making payments to them they hold my bond as an investment there is no question of that in fact they package these and sell them as groups of mortgages a pre payment is me buying back the last coupon on my mortgage i fail to see the distinction between me buying back $ 10 k in future coupons on my own loan or me investing $ 10 k in someone else 's loans   the real question for me is whether this makes sense when rates are so low at 4 i 'd say it 's a matter of prioritizing any high rate debt and any other investments that might yield more but even so it 's an investment yielding 4   over the years i 've developed the priorities of where to put new money the priorities are debatable i have my opinion and my reasons to back them up in general it 's a balance between risk and return in my opinion there 's something wrong with ignoring a dollar for dollar match on the 401(k in most circumstances others seem to prefer being 100 debt free before saving at all there 's a balance that might be different for each individual as i started the mortgage is a fixed return with no chance to just get it back if needed if your cash savings is pretty high and the choice is a .001 cd or prepay a 4 mortgage i 'd use some funds to pay it down but not to the point you have no liquid reserves

concerning the general problem of short selling and the need to borrow shares to complete the transaction selling short is a cash transaction   unlike a futures contract where a short seller is entering into a legal agreement to sell something in the future in the case of short selling a share the buyer of the share is taking immediate delivery and is therefore entitled to all of the benefits and rights that come with share ownership   in particular the buyer of the shares is entitled to any dividends payable and where applicable to vote on motions at   if the short seller has not borrowed the shares to sell then buyer of non existent shares will have none of the rights associated with ownership the cash market is based on the idea of matching buyers and sellers   it does not accommodate people making promises consider that to allow short sellers to sell shares they have not borrowed opens up the possibility of the aggregate market selling more shares than actually exist   this would lead to all sorts of problematic consequences such as heavily distorting the price of the underlying share   if everyone is selling shares they have not borrowed willy nilly then it will drive the price of the share down much to the disadvantage of existing share holders in this case short sellers who have sold shares they have not already borrowed would be paying out more in dividends to the buyers than the total dividends being paid out by the underlying company there are instruments that allow for short selling of shares on a futures basis   one example is a cfd = contract for difference   in the case of cfds sellers are obliged to pay dividends to buyers as well as other   costs related to financing edit regarding your comment note that borrowing shares is not a market transaction   your account does not show you buying a share and then selling it   it simply shows you selling a share short   the borrowing is the result of an agreement between yourself and the lender and this agreement is off market   you do not actually pay the lender for the shares but you do pay financing costs for the borrowing so long as you maintain your short position edit i realise that i have not actually read your question correctly   you are not actually talking about naked short selling   you are talking about selling shares you already own in a hope of maintaining both a long and short position gross   the problem with this approach is that you must deliver the shares to the buyer   otherwise ask yourself what shares is the buyer actually buying if you want the bought shares to remain in your account if you are not going to deliver your long position shares then you will need to borrow the shares you are selling short for the reasons i have outlined above

there 's many concrete answers but there 's something circular about your question the only thing i can think of is that phone service providers ask for credit report when you want to start a new account but i am sure that could be worked around if you just put down a cash deposit in some cases so now the situation is flipped you are relying on your phone company 's credit   who is to say they do n't just walk away from their end of the deal now that you have paid in full    the amount of credit in this situation is you just have to eat the risk and rely on their credit because you have no credit it does n't matter how much money you have $ 10 or $ 10000 can be out of you equally well if you must always pay for future goods up front you also ca n't use that money month by month now even in low risk investments although they will do exactly that and keep the interest and i challenge your assumption that you will never default you are not a being you live on planet earth ever had to pay $ 125,000 for a treatment because you got a rare form of cancer well you wo n't be able to default on your phone plan and pay for your drug or food if you bankrupt yourself on the drug because your money is already gone i know you asked a simpler question but i ca n't write a good answer without pointing out that no default is a bad model it 's like doing math without a zero element by the way this is realistic it applies to renting in say new york city it 's better to be a tenant with credit who can withhold rent in issue of neglected maintenance or gross unfair treatment than a tenant who has already paid full rent and has left the landlord with little market incentive to do their part

many of the major indices    today because of this news why how    do the rising budget deficits and debt    relate to the stock markets the major reason for the market is the uncertainty regarding the us dollar if the us credit rating drops that will have an inflationary effect on the currency as it will push up the cost of us treasuries and reduce confidence in the usd if this continues the loss of usd confidence could bring an end to the usd as the world 's reserve currency which could also create inflation as world banks could reduce their usd reserves this can make us assets appear overvalued why is there such a large emphasis on    the s&p rating s&p is a large trusted rating agency so the market will respond to their analysis much like how a bank would respond to any change in your rating by transunion consumer credit bureau does this have any major implications    for the us stock markets today in the    short term and in july if you are a day trader i 'm sure it does there will be minor fluctuations in the market as soon as news comes out either of its extension or any expected delays in passing that extension what happens when the debt ceiling is    reached since the us is in a deficit spending situation it needs to borrow more to satisfy its existing obligations in short it pays its debt with more debt as a result if the debt ceiling is n't raised then eventually the us will be unable to pay its existing obligations we would be in a default situation which could have devastating affects on the value of the usd how hard the hit will depend on how long the default situation lasts the longer we go without an increased ceiling after the exhaustion point the more we default on in reality congress will approve a raise but they will drag it out to the last possible minute they want to appear as if they are against it but they understand the catastrophic effects of not doing so

if you mean if i invest say $ 1000 in a stock that is growing at 5 per year versus investing $ 1000 in an account that pays compound interest of 5 per year how does the amount i have after 5 years compare then the answer is they would be exactly the same   as kent anderson says compound interest simply means that as you accumulate interest that for the next interest cycle the amount that they pay interest on is based on the previous cycle balance plus the interest for example suppose you invest $ 1000 at 5 interest compounded annually after one year you get 5 of $ 1000 or $ 50 you now have $ 1050 at the end of the second year you get 5 of $ 1050 not 5 of the original $ 1000 or $ so you now have $ etc stocks tend to grow in the same way but here 's the big difference if you get an interest bearing account the bank or investment company guarantees the interest rate unless they go bankrupt you will get that percentage interest but there is absolutely no guarantee when you buy stock it may go up 5 this year up 4 next year and down 3 the year after the company makes no promises about how much growth the stock will show it may show a loss it all depends on how well the company does

it depends on whether or not you are referring to realized or unrealized gains   if the asset appreciation is realized meaning you 've sold the asset and actually collected liquidity from it then has provided a good route to follow    however if the gains are unrealized meaning only that the current value of the underlying have increased or decreased then you might want to record this under an income unrealized gains account   one of the main distinctions between the two are whether or not you have a taxable event realized or just want to better track your net worth at a given time unrealized    for example i generally track my retirement accounts increase in value sans interest dividends and contributions as income from an income unrealized gains account   i can still reconcile it with my statements and it shows an accurate picture for my net worth but the money is not liquid nor taxed and is more for informational purposes than anything    and no i do n't create an additional expense account here to track losses   just think of unrealized gains as an income account where the balance will fluctuate up and down and potentially even go negative over time

no i did n't write anything about whether we should have invested in the just that comparing a public infrastructure project to private subsidy a tax break has the same economic effect as a direct subsidy more money circulating in the market not tied up in government is not an equal comparison if you really want to push that button i would argue that investment in public infrastructure is a better investment than giving tax breaks to corporations especially corporations like foxconn with a track record of not living up to promises like these

in general the higher the return such as interest the higher the risk if there were a high return no risk investment enough people would buy it to drive the price up and make it a low return no risk investment interest rates are low now but so is inflation they generally go up and down together so as a low risk almost no risk investment the savings account is not at all useless there are relatively safe investments that will get a better return but they will have a little more risk one common way to spread the risk is to diversify for example put some of your money in a savings account some in a bond mutual fund and some in a stock index fund a stock index fund such as spy has the benefit of very low overhead in addition to spreading the risk among 500 large companies mutual funds with a purchase or sale fee or with a higher management fee do not perform any better on average and should generally be avoided if you put a little money in different places regularly you 'll be fairly safe and are likely get a better return if you trade back and forth frequently trying to the market you 're likely to be worse off than the savings account

in 2014 the irs announced that it published guidance in notice 2014 21 in that notice the answer to the first question describes the general tax treatment of virtual currency for federal tax purposes virtual currency is treated as property general tax principles applicable to property transactions apply to transactions using virtual currency as it 's property like any other capital gains if and when you sell are taxed as with any capital gains you 're taxed on the profit you made that is the proceeds how much you got when you sold minus your basis how much you paid to get the property that you sold until you sell it 's just an asset like a house or a share of stock or a rare collectible card that does n't require any reporting if your initial cryptocurrency acquisition was through mining then this section of that notice applies does a taxpayer who mines virtual currency for example uses computer resources to validate bitcoin transactions and maintain the public bitcoin transaction ledger realize gross income upon receipt of the virtual currency resulting from those activities yes when a taxpayer successfully mines virtual currency the fair market value of the virtual currency as of the date of receipt is includible in gross income see publication 525 taxable and nontaxable income for more information on taxable income that is to say when it was mined the market value of the amount generated should have been included in income probably on either line 21 other income or on schedule c if it 's from your own business at that point the market value would also qualify as your basis though i doubt there 'd be a whole lot of enforcement action for not amending your 2011 return to include $ 0.75 technically if you find a dollar bill on the street it should be included in income but usually the government cares about bigger fish than that it sounds like your basis is close enough to zero that it 's not worth trying to calculate a more accurate value since your basis could n't be less than zero there 's no way that using zero as your basis would cause you to pay less tax than you ought so the government wo n't have any objections to it   one thing to be careful of is to document that your holdings qualify for long term capital gains treatment held longer than a year if applicable also as you 're trading in multiple cryptocurrencies each transaction may count as a sale of one kind followed by a purchase of the other kind much like if you traded your apple stock for google stock it 's possible that 1031 like kind exchange rules apply and in june 2016 the american institute of cpas sent a letter asking about it among other things but as far as i know there 's been no official irs guidance on the matter there are also some related questions here see do altcoin trades count as like kind exchanges and assuming 1031 does n't apply to cryptocurrency trading but if in fact those exchange rules do not apply and it is just considered a sale followed by a purchase then you would need to report each exchange as a sale with that asset 's basis probably $ 0 for the initial one and proceeds of the fair market value at the time and then that same value would be the basis of the new asset you 're purchasing using a $ 0 basis is how i treat my bitcoin sales though i have n't dealt with other cryptocurrencies as long as all the usd income is being reported when you get usd i find it unlikely you 'll run into a lot of trouble even if you technically were supposed to report the individual transactions when they happened though i 'm not in charge of irs enforcement and i 'm not aware of any high profile cases so it 's hard to know anything for sure obviously if there 's a lot of money involved you may want to involve a professional rather than random strangers on the internet you could also try contacting the irs directly as believe it or not their job is in fact helping you to comply with the tax laws correctly also there are phone numbers at the end of notice 2014 21 of people which might be able to provide further guidance including this statement the principal author of this notice is keith a. of the office of associate chief counsel income tax accounting for further information about income tax issues addressed in this notice please contact mr. at 202

as someone who works in tech and has seen a thing or two the fallacy of moving to college towns to foster innovation is a farce the whole reason businesses do this is to get an endless supply of cheap labor from new graduates who do n't have families thus will work nights and weekends for free to make a name for themselves once those kids wise up and maybe want to start a family they move to suburbs away from these college towns and leave those companies which leads to high attrition rates for mid level employees this also leads to inferior products from a high technology standpoint because of lack of senior mentors and you end up with shit projects just slapped together that just barely work would you want your ge jet engines designed on the cheap by recent graduates or disciplined engineers i 'm not saying it 's a bad business decision it is totally valid and smart for some markets but it seems like ge has their hands in important technology that should n't be designed like this if they want to reinvent themselves why not make a boston technology center for innovation not move their whole business it just did n't make sense

i recently moved out from my parents place after having built up sufficient funds and gone through these questions myself i live near louisville ky which has a significant effect on my income cost of living and cost of housing factor that into your decisions to answer your questions in order when do i know that i 'm financially stable to move out when you have enough money set aside for all projected expenses for 3 6 months and an emergency fund of 4 10 k depending on how large a safety net you want or need note that part of the reason for the emergency fund is as a buffer for the things you wo n't realize you need until you move out such as pots or chairs it also covers things being more expensive than anticipated should i wait until both my emergency fund is at least 6 months of pay    and my loans in my parents names is paid off to free up money 6 months of pay is not a good measuring stick use months of expenses instead in general student loans are a small enough cost per month that you just need to factor them into your costs when should i factor in the newer car investment how much should i    have set aside for the car do the car while you are living at home this allows you to put more than the minimum payment down each month and you can get ahead that looks good on your credit and allows refinancing later for a lower minimum payment when you move out finally it gives you a sense of the monthly cost while you still have leeway to adjust things   depending on new used status of the car set aside around 3 5 k for a down payment that gives you a decent rate without too much haggling trouble should i get an apartment for a couple years before looking for my own    house not unless you want the flexibility of an apartment in general living at home is cheaper if you intend to eventually buy property in the same area an apartment is throwing money away if you want to move every few years an apartment can depending on the lease give you that how much should i set aside for either investment apartment vs    house 10 20 k for a down payment if you live around louisville ky be very about the price of your house and this gives you the best of everything the biggest mistake you can make is trying to get into a place too early banks pay attention to the down payment for a good reason it indicates commitment care and an ability to go the distance in general a mortgage is 30 years you wo n't pay it off for a long time so plan for that is there anything else i should be doing taking advantage of with my    money during this living at home period before i finally leave the    nest if there is something you want now 's the time to get it you can make snap purchases on furniture motorcycles games and not hurt yourself take vacations since there is room in the budget if you 've thought about moving to a different state for work travel there for a weekend week and see if you even like the place look for deals on things you 'll need when you move out towels furniture and so forth can be bought cheaply and you can get quality but it takes time to find these deals pick up activities with monthly expenses boxing dancing gym memberships and so forth become much more difficult to fit into the budget later they also give you a better credit rating for a recurring expense and allow you to get a feel for how things like a monthly utility bill will work finally get involved in various investments a 401k is only the start so look at penny stocks indexed funds etfs or other things to diversify with check out local businesses or start something on the side experiment and have fun

it is very helpful to understand that free file is not actually by the us internal revenue service irs the irs does indeed offer access to the program through their website but free file is actually a public private partnership program operated and maintained by the free file alliance who is the free file alliance well according to their members list corp. enterprises free tax returns h&r block intuit jackson liberty tax online taxes taxact and why the income restriction well that 's part of the deal the irs struck the program is dedicated to helping 70 percent of american taxpayers prepare and e file their federal tax returns technically the member companies are offering their own software to handle tax preparation and the rule is that 70 of american 's must qualify for at least one product so this adjusted gross income limit changes periodically so that 70 of the population can use it why restrict it at all this was part of the give and take involved in negotiation with the businesses involved if the program was everyone files for free then it is presumed that many reputable businesses that make the program valuable would choose not to continue to participate in other words they want to be able to not give away their services for free to customers who are at least by income definition more than capable of paying them the irs has said it does not want to be in the tax prep software business so they are not offering their own free software to do the job that private companies would otherwise charge for however there are other restrictions to being in the program like the fact that no business in the program can offer refund anticipation loans offer commercial services more than a certain amount of times so they ca n't you to upgrade and so on some businesses were making a killing off these though they are pretty much solely developed to be predatory on people with the lowest incomes and education levels and iq and with cognitive disabilities and basically anyone they could sucker into paying what were effectively absurd rates for short term loans along with inflated filing preparation fees finally free file was partly developed as an initiative to increase the amount of digitally filed taxes and reduce the paper based burdens of accepting and processing turns in other words to cut government costs not to be a government welfare program even if it were one can generally obtain commercial software for $ so the benefit to those above gross income levels is pretty minor yearly costs to file taxes with such software for those payers would be less than 0.001 of their yearly expenses compared to the benefits by households living below the poverty line fighting to cover an extra 5 30 of the population at the potential expense of having the whole program be a failure probably seemed like a more than worthwhile trade off

i see some merit in the other answers which are all based on the snowball method however i would like to present an alternative approach which would be the optimal way in case you have perfect self control given your amount of debt most likely you currently do not have perfect self control but we will come to that the first step is to think about what the minimum amount of emergency funds are that you need and to compare this number with your credit card limit if your limits are such that your credit cards can still cover potential emergency expenses use all of the 4000 $ to repay the debt on the loan with the higher interest rate some answer wrote that others may disagree as it is more efficient to pay down the however if you pay it all of within the year the difference only comes to $ 260 this is bad advice because you will probably not pay back the loan within one year where would you miraculously obtain 20 000 $ for that thus paying back the higher interest loan will save you more money than just next follow 's advice and refinance your debt under a lower rate this is much more impactful than choosing the right loan to repay make sure to consult with different banks to get the best rate reducing your interest rate has utmost priority from your accumulated debt we can probably infer that you do not have perfect self control and will be able to minimize your spending maximize your debt repayments thus you need to incentivize yourself to follow such behavior a powerful way to do this is to have a family member or very close friend monitor your purchase and saving behavior if you can not control yourself someone else must it should rather be a a person you trust than the banks you owe money

what is the formula for calculating the total cost of a loan with extra payments towards the principal the formula you require is the standard one for calculating the time to repay   with larger repayments the time to completely repay the loan is reduced where the total cost of the loan is then n d. explanation calculation the formula for a loan is derived from the sum of the cash flows discounted to present value being equal to the principal   for further info see the section here titled calculating the present value of an ordinary annuity the summation can be reduced to a closed form by induction   rearranging for d and n with the op 's figures the original monthly repayment is $ adding $ 200 each month with the higher repayment the loan is repaid in months instead of 360   of course a bank would simply take a reduced payment in month but the amounts work out the same the saving is $ addendum if the repayments increase was made part way through the term of the loan the summation and formula would be   where then for example if for the first ten years the payments are $ and for the remaining time the repayments are $ the loan is completely repaid in months the saving is plotting over a range of m months

during world war ii the united states us instituted wage and price controls   to attract better employees companies would offer benefits to get around salary limits   health insurance was one of the more successful benefits    at that time income taxes were newer and there were many ways to evade them   companies could generally deduct expenses   so at that time health care was deductible because everything was   and at that time only wages were taxable compensation from employer to employee    since that time many other benefits have become non deductible for employers e.g. housing or the reduced deduction for meals and entertainment   but health care is generally regarded as different as a necessity   while everyone needs to eat not everyone needs to eat at a $ 100 a meal restaurant   people who need expensive health care really need it   people who eat expensive food just prefer it    and of course health care is more intermittent where food is relatively consistent   you do n't need ten thousand calories one day and zero the next   but some families have no health care expenses in a year while another might have cancer or a pregnancy   note that medical care expenses can be deducted for individuals if they are large enough in aggregate and you itemize    and of course both businesses and workers have incentives to maintain the current system with deductibility   health insurance is a common benefit   housing is not although it 's worth noting that travel housing and meals are deductible   so there have been few people impacted by making housing taxable while many people would be impacted by taxable health insurance    you can deduct health insurance costs if self employed   it 's also not true that health insurance is the only benefit with preferential tax treatment   retirement and child care are also deductible   even meals and housing can be deducted in certain circumstances   the complex rules about what and how much is deductible    there have been about the tax treatment of health insurance and medical care but there is a lot of opposition   insurance companies oppose making all healthcare expenses deductible as that reduces their effective benefit   they would prefer only insurance premiums be deductible   traditionally employed individuals oppose making health insurance taxable as that would increase their taxes   so the situation persists   there is n't quite enough support to move in either direction although the current compromise is economically silly

h1b visas are not terrible and i am not against all h1b visas however it is a bald faced lie to suggest the number 1 if not only reason companies use them is to cut labor costs these companies are not advertising they could have hired local talent but chose to provide the job to someone from a poorer region   i think whatever city everybody in the world wants to work or go to school like tokyo or london or paris or boston that is going to have the world 's best talent also if those people go back to their they do n't bring with them the ideas from the city they worked or but rather the best ideas from all over the world   that is n't at all what is happening in technology there are plenty of computer science and electrical engineer majors in the usa out of work and some making six figures with a bs degree and 3 years experience but so many are out of work many of those jobs were outsourced but the talent used was so poor the cost to upkeep or update was so expensive that many companies brought back the jobs to the usa those companies still want to hire the same low cost workers but want them working in the usa for reasons i will spare here the usa talent pool is so full and jobs so scarce it drives down wages not actually because what really happens in the company is toxic to work for and demands 16 hour days 7 days a week for the same great salary that may have once been 40 hours a week with fun and entertainment and space and a gym on site etc   stopping h1b visas would force companies to bring back their on site gyms large break rooms increase work life balance etc   stopping h1b visas mean a lot of billion dollar tech companies would have to pay their shareholders and executives less this year than last year which is outrageous in the race to the bottom

taxes should not be calculated at the item level taxes should be aggregated by tax group at the summary level the right way everywhere is line items summary ps if you 'd charge at the item level it would be too easy to circumvent the law by splitting your items or services into 900 items at $ 0.01 which once rounded would mean no tax this could happen in the banking or plastic industry

do n't compare investing with a roll of the dice compare it with blackjack and the decision to stand or hit or put more money on the table double down or increase bet size based on an assessment of the state of the table and history   a naive strategy of say always hitting to 16 is n't as awful as randomly hitting and standing which from time to to time will draw to 21 fair and square but there 's a basic strategy that gets close to 50 and by increasing or decreasing bet based on counting face cards can get into positive expectations randomly buying and selling stock is randomly hitting   buying a market index fund is like always hitting to 16   determining an asset allocation strategy and periodically rebalancing is basic strategy   adjusting allocations based on business cycle and economic indicators is turning skill into advantage

the short answer is yes paying more towards the loan as soon as a you can will reduce the interest there are calculators or you could work up a spreadsheet using the specialized family of functions pmt my personal view the amount of interest you offset in this manner is going to be fairly small i 'm going to guess less than $ 5 or $ 10 a month but i have n't done the math i would say what is more important is to automate your payments at a comfortable level while making sure your other obligations are taken care of then add an extra payment when you save up a chunk of money to pay towards it make sure you never miss a payment that means making sure you set up emergency fund to cover the payments if you lose your job or need to visit a sick family member for a while or the car breaks down or

the stock market exists for two reasons it lets companies raise money to invest and it lets company owners cash out and get money instead of part ownership of a company when they are ready to do so but to accomplish these goals effectively it needs many more transactions than just those kinds of transaction because you have to be able to find a buyer when you need one and to have a market price so there are also a lot of transactions that are just to try to make short term profit but we need those transactions to provide the market liquidity to let the stock market work properly for its actual purposes

this is my opinion as a car nut it depends on what you want out of a car for your situation paying cash want to keep the car long term but also save money i recommend seriously considering a slightly used vehicle maybe 2 or 3 years old or a certified pre owned vehicle reasons much less expensive than a brand new car because the first two years have the biggest depreciation hit cars come with a 4-year warranty so a 3 year old car will still be in warranty yes a certified pre owned car will have a bit of a premium compared to a private party used car but the peace of mind of knowing it 's in good shape is worth the extra cost considering you want to keep it long term consumer reports will have good advice on the best values in used cars

seems like a good deal to me you are paying less interest over the lifetime of the loan and what i would do is take the difference between the new payments and the old put it into a savings account each month and when the savings account exceeds the balance of the loan pay it off

kid you need to start thinking in thresholds there are several monetary thresholds that separate your class from a more well funded class 1 you can not use margin with less than $ 2000 dollars brokers require that you have at least $ 2000 before they will lend to you 2 in 2010 congress banned under 21 year olds from getting access to credit unless they get cosigned this means that even if you have $ 2000 no broker will give you margin unless you have a good credit history already there was a good reason for this but its based on the assumption that everyone is stupid not the assumption that some people are objective thinkers 3 the brokers that will open an account for you have high commissions the commissions are so high that it will destroy any capital gains you may make with your $ 1000 for the most part 4 the pattern day trader rule you can not employ sophisticated risk management while being subject to the pattern day trader rule it basically limits you from trading 3 times a day its more complicated than that read it yourself if you have less than $ 25,000 in one account 5 non trade or stock related investments buy municipal or treasury bonds they will give you more than a savings account would and are tax free this is n't exactly what i would call liquid though ie if you wanted to access your money to invest in something else on a whim 6 what are you studying if its anything technical then you might get a good idea that you could risk your money on to create value but i would stick to high growth stocks before blowing your $ 1000 on an idea that s not exactly what i would call access to capital 7 arbitrage lets say you know a friend that buys the trendy collectors shoes at discount and sells them for a profit he might do this with one $ 200 pair of tennis shoes and then use the $ 60 profit different to go buy video games for himself if he wanted to scale up he could n't because he never has more than $ 200 to play with in comparison you could do 5 pairs $ 200 x 5 and immediately have a larger operation than him making a larger profit $ 60 x 5 = $ 300 now you have $ 1300 and could do it again with 6 pairs to make an even great er profit not because you are better or worked at it but solely because you have more capital to start with keep an eye out for arbitrage opportunities usually there is a good reason they exist if you notice it the market is too small and illiquid to scale up with or the entire market will be saturated the next day efficient market theory learn about it 8) take everything i just taught you and make a small investor newsletter website with subscribers online sites have low overhead costs

the ruble was is and will be very unstable because of unstable political situation in russia and the economy strongly dependent of the export of raw resources what you can do i assume you want to minimize risk the best way to achieve that is to make your savings in some stable currency euro and swiss franc are currently very stable currencies so storing your surpluses in them is a very good option if you want to keep your money safe to prevent political risk you should keep your money in countries with stable political regime which are unlikely to nationalize the savings of the citizens in predictable future as for your existing savings in rubles it 's a hard deal i assume as the web developer you have a plenty of money which have lost a lot of value if you convert them to euro or francs you will the current value after the loss you 'll safe them ruble falling down but in case the ruble will return to previous value you 'll loose   keeping savings in currencies is however speculation like investing in gold etc so if you can mentally accept the loss and want to sleep good convert them you have also option to invest in properties for example buy an extra appartment it 's a good way to deal with financial surplus in europe in us however you should be aware in it 's connected with the political risk the real estates can be confiscated in any moment by the state and you ca n't run away with it the savings can also be confiscated but there 's a fair chance you 'll manage to rescue them if you act quickly

unfortunately not even if the credit card balance is positive i.e. customer has overpaid the credit card account you can not withdraw cash for free as any cash withdrawal is subject to interest even if repaid in full at the end of the month the clarity credit card is one of the best cards for overseas spending as its load free no fees for purchases abroad and it gives near perfect exchange rates if your balance is positive you start at £ 0 then fund that credit card account from your bank account £ 500 you can then spend on your credit card and when your next bill is due at the end of the month they will use that extra £ 500 sitting in your account first and ask for the remainder from you i.e.     scenario 2 it is better in my opinion to set up a direct debit to always clear out the full amount on your credit card that way you have cash in your bank account for emergencies getting £ 500 back from a credit card will take a few days to process as opposed to having the ability to withdraw cash from the 24/7 and once the direct debit is paid automatically at the end of the month there are no fees voila your credit card is almost like a debit card spend on it when you like it gets paid automatically no hassle no worries this approach does take a careful mindset though as you need to know your credit limits and also you need to ensure your bank account has enough to pay off the direct debit at the end of the month otherwise those darn fees will get you and hurt your credit rating for cash spending you will want to either take cash with you check online here for best rates get the money well in advance to avoid fees also in some countries the exchange rate is better there than in the uk google will help you here if you do nt like the idea of carrying large sums of cash with you can use a prepaid card like which is one of the better ones out there the other well known ones are fairfx and travelex cash passport

for restricted stock i think the vesting date meets the requirements of the second wash sale trigger from irs pub 550 wash sales acquire substantially identical stock or securities in a fully taxable trade i base this on these two quotes from irs pub 525 restricted property any income from the property or the right to use the property is included in your income as additional compensation in the year you receive the income or have the right to use the property until the property becomes substantially vested it is owned by the person who makes the transfer to you usually your employer   so on the vest date the transfer is taxable ownership is transferred to you that seems close enough to a fully taxable trade for me   maybe this changes if you pay the tax on the stock on the grant date see pub 525 restricted property choosing to include in income for year of transfer obviously if this is important you should consult your tax advisor   technicalities aside i do n't think it passes the sniff test you 're getting salable shares when the restricted stock vests if you 're selling other shares at a loss within 30 days of the vesting date that smells like a wash sale to me

alternative minimum tax is based not just on your income but moreso on the deductions you use in short if you have above the minimum amt threshold of income per your link and pay a tiny amount of tax you will pay amt amt is used as an overall protection for the government to say okay you can use these deductions from your taxable income but if you 're making a lot of money you should pay something no matter what your deductions are this extra amt can be used to reduce your tax payment in a future year if you pay regular tax again for example if you have 60k in income but have 60k in specific deductions from your income you will pay zero regular tax because your taxable income will be zero amt would require you to pay some tax on your income above the minimum threshold which might work out to a few thousand bucks next year if you have 60k in income but only 15k in deductions then you would pay some regular tax and would be able to offset that regular tax by claiming a credit from your amt already paid   amt is really a pre payment of tax paid in years when you have a lot of deductions unless you have a lot of deductions every single year in which case you might not be able to get all of your amt refunded in the end wikipedia has a pretty good summary of amt in the us here   if you think amt is unfair and maybe in some cases you might pay it when you think it 's unfair look at the root causes of paying amt listed in that wikipedia article i am not trying to convince you that amt is fair just that it applies only when someone already has a very low tax rate due to deductions if you have straight salary income it would only apply in rare scenarios

to dispute your first point it can be racist if it 's the truth the accuracy of a statement does n't impact it 's    if you were over weight and i called you a fat fuck it may well be true though it 's still mean   in the same way if your mother was dying of cancer and i was to say she is a weight on our social structures and she 's not likely to live long anyway all of those things may be factually correct however it is still malicious for me to say those things in that way    similarly even if what he says is factually is an issue i 'll get to does not change whether what he said and the way he said it was malicious or to a particular race now whether what he said is socially acceptable is a matter of culture you seem to think it 's perfectly acceptable as another said many of his business connections might also i happen to think it 's not acceptable clearly in line with op i 'm not looking to argue about whether it is acceptable to ever be racist because that is a nuanced line though fairly simple to keep away from that has been covered over and over in many other discussions arguments and protests    to the matter of whether or not what he has said is factually correct    i agree with you on this zimbabwe is incredibly rich in resource and is a largely untapped land in the modern seemingly not for long    however i would make the distinction in my argument in the causality is it the fault of the zimbabwe people that they have not fully taken advantage of their resource and if so is that fault in anyway linked to their skin colour    for me even if you the first the 2nd is untenable clearly seen in the rise of asia and of india through the 20th century education medicine social support and infrastructure play a much larger role in the ability of a society to effectively allocate resource than the vain colour of ones skin or the line of ones heritage   not to say the first is entirely true either as the mistakes of yours weigh on your ability as much as their success accelerates you   there are key resources and educations the places such as zimbabwe lacked the made them unable to use   resource historically in the same way as the modern western world water hygiene tool making resource most notably land able to support intensive farming and food storage       instead the cultures would have developed to use the land resources as is most efficient though may not be the cities and farming of europe     further i would argue education and infrastructure as was seen originally with the foundation of the us the america 's resource was untapped without the machinery or knowledge to take advantage of it which comes best from the close quarters of europe    writing also improving the transfer of information by orders of magnitude first created in the middle east taken up by the greeks then the romans therefore much of europe 's success amount other thing s can be credited to to romans and theirs to the greeks and theirs to the    clearly the nor even the romans were white by any pure standard especially noting england 's boom occurred after introduction of roman infrastructure and more recently asia with western international corporation 's     i would argue that the size of a society and it 's economic success which may not be the aim of the society has more to do with the tools available the location and access to trade infrastructure and social support including medicine    these are things that are not linked to the colour of ones skin therefore to say that blacks by virtue of being black lacking any other qualifying information are inherently less able to bring america into economic success than whites by virtue of them being white lacking any qualifying information is not entirely factually correct and is naturally open to criticism    by changing you argument to be less directed at the colour of ones skin and more toward the nature of the society and the capabilities of their technology your argument is made more tolerable though still entirely open to   but as soon as you change your argument to i 'm glad that people of america and bringing to to success did instead of people were n't able to america and bring technology with them the argument becomes somewhat null of course a society whether black white or any other with advanced technology and access to trade such as who had control of many trade lines and much of indian production would be able to and take advantage of resources better than a society which did not have those things control of large trade routes ships ect and these things have less to do with the colour on ones skin and more to do with infrastructure trade and social support    the fact is when the racism is taken out the argument is n't worth mentioning because the ability to speaks to a society that takes effective advantage of trade infrastructure and technology   this fact is and makes any attempt to justify the argument seem a thinly veiled justification for   as if not to be racist what is the argument actually a arguing what does his statement actually say without specifying the colour of ones skin   so to i 'm not entirely against the line of thought nor that the guy said he gets in the good books of his friends what i am against is a society that supports racism the society he is supporting in making that type of statement what i am against is the idea that if something is true it does n't matter how it 's said remember your fat ass mom i 'm what i am against is the use of null arguments to justify a controversial opinion if the controversial aspect of the sentence is able to be taken away and it was would it have any meaning   sorry if i was overly aggressive in this response and for any grammatical mistakes and if you have a response i would appreciate a similar amount of effort and will do my best to my bias   thank you   edit grammar

this is somewhat unbelievable   i mean if you had a business of collecting debts would n't you want to collect said debts   rather than attempting to people with these delinquent debts into paying you have someone volunteering to pay   would you want to service that client   this would not happen in just about any other industry but such is the lunacy of debt collecting the big question is why do you need this cleared off your credit   if it is just for a credit score it probably is not as important as your more recent entries   i would just wait it out until 7 years has passed and you can then write the reporting agencies to remove it from your credit if you are attempting to buy a home or similarly large purpose and the mortgage company is insisting that you deal with this then i would do the following write the company to address the issue   this has to be certified return receipt requested   if they respond pay it and insist that it be marked as paid in full on your credit   i would do this with a money order or cashiers check   done dispute the charge with the credit reporting agencies providing the documentation of no response   this should remove the item from your credit provide this documentation to the mortgage broker   this should remove any they might have optional   sue the company in small claims court   this will take a bit of time and money but it should yield a profit   there was a post on here a few days ago about how to do this   make part of any settlement to have your name cleared of the debt it is counterproductive to fall into the trap of the pursuit of a perfect credit score   a person with a 750 often receives the same rate options as a person with 850   also your relationship with a particular lender could trump your credit score currently i am enjoying the highest credit score of my life over   do you know how i did it   i got out of debt including paying off the mortgage and i have no intentions of ever going into debt for anything   so why does it matter   it is a bit ridiculous

in england currently and for most of the last fifty years the standard length of the mortgage term is 25 years a mortgage can be either a capital and interest mortgage or interest only in the former you pay off part of the original loan each month plus the interest on the amount borrowed in the latter you only pay interest each month and the original amount borrowed never reduces you pay premiums on a life insurance policy additionally which is designed to pay off the original sum borrowed at the end of the 25 years no one in england thinks that a 25 year loan has any drawbacks the main point to appreciate is that the longer the period of the loan the less you need to pay each month because you are repaying the original loan the capital over a longer period of time thus in principle a mortgage is easier to repay the longer the term is because the monthly payment is less if you have a 12 year mortgage you must pay back the original amount borrowed in half the time the capital element in your payment each month is double what it would be if repaid over 25 years i.e. if repaid over a period twice as long only if the borrower is less than 25 years away from retirement is a 25 years mortgage seen as a bad idea by the lender because obviously the lender relies on the borrower having an income sufficient to keep up the repayments there are many complicating factors an interest only mortgage where you pay back the original amount borrowed from the maturity proceeds from a life policy puts you in a situation where the original capital sum never reduces so you always pay the same each month but on a straight repayment mortgage the traditional type you pay less and less each month as time goes by for you are reducing the capital outstanding each month and because that is reducing so is the amount of interest you pay each month as this is calculated on the outstanding capital amount there are to avoid if you can for example some mortgage contracts impose penalties if the borrower repays more than the due monthly amount hence in effect the borrower faces a possibly heavy financial penalty for early repayment of the loan but not all mortgages include such a condition if house prices are on a rising trend the market value of the property will soon be worth considerably more than the amount owed on the mortgage especially where the mortgage debt is reducing every month as each repayment is made so the bank or other lender will not be worried about lending over a 25 year term because if it forecloses there should normally be no difficulty in recovering the outstanding amount from the sale proceeds if the borrower falls behind on the repayments or house prices fall he may soon get into difficulties but this could happen to anyone it is not a particular problem of a 25 year term where a default in repayment occurs the bank will often suggest the mortgage term from 25 years to 30 years in order to reduce the amount of the monthly repayment as a means of helping the borrower so longer terms than 25 years are in fact a positive solution in a case of financial difficulty   of course the longer the term the greater the amount that the borrower will pay in total but the longer the term the less he will pay each month at least on a traditional capital and interest mortgage so it is a question of balancing those two competing factors   as long as you do not have a mortgage condition that the borrower for paying off the loan more quickly it can make sense to have as long a term as possible to begin with which can be shortened by increasing the monthly repayment as fast as circumstances allow in england we used to have tax relief on mortgage payments and so in times gone by it did make sense to let the mortgage run the full 25 years in order to get maximum tax relief the rules were very complex but it tended to maximise your tax relief by paying over the longest possible period but today with no income tax relief given on mortgage payments that is no longer a consideration in this country the practical position is of course that you can never tell how long it might take you to pay off a mortgage it is a gamble as to whether your income will rise in future years and whether your job will last until your mortgage is paid off you might fall ill you might be made redundant you might be mortgage interest rates might rise it is never possible to say that you can pay off the loan in a short time   if you hope to do so the only matters that actually fall within your control are the conditions of the mortgage contract itself get a good lawyer tell him to watch out for early redemption penalties get a good financial adviser tell him to work out what you will need to pay in additional premiums on your life policy if you are considering taking an interest only mortgage try to fix your mortgage rate in the first few years for as long as possible so that in your most vulnerable period with the greatest amount owing you are insulated against unexpected interest rate fluctuations only the initial conditions can be controlled so it might be prudent to take as long a term as possible even though a prudent borrower will leave himself room to reduce that term and a prudent lender will leave room to extend it in case of unpredictable changes in the financial circumstances in england most lenders are in my experience reluctant to grant mortgages for less than 25 years that is simply a policy rightly or wrongly the borrower usually has no choice about the length of the term hence in the uk it can be difficult to find a choice of interest rates based on differing mortgage terms i am aware that the situation in the usa is rather different but if i personally were faced with the choice i would be uncomfortable about taking on a short term mortgage because of the factors i have outlined above

of course but that 's not relevant to my example let me clarify say you hold a highly appreciated $ 10 m position in aapl and you have good reason to believe the next iphone is going to be a flop causing the stock to decline 20 you can sell now to avoid the probable decline but by doing so you will be left with let 's say $ m after paying $ 3.33 m of state and federal ltcg taxes on the appreciation $ 9 m of the $ 10 m because you bought a long time ago   however by simply doing nothing and eating the 20 decline you 'll end up with $ 8 m instead of $   many economists would criticize the tax in this example as it has led to the investor rationally suffering a $ 2 m loss instead of reallocating all $ 10 m of his her capital to a more promising enterprise furthermore if when many investors act that way they can create inefficiency in the equity markets prices not declining by as much as they should to reflect a firm 's reduced prospects

i believe that an understanding of the taxation system can help to understand our place in it and how that impacts each of our personal finances i will try to remain unbiased here but this is a somewhat subjective question so please bear with me if you disagree on any point some of these tax savings are well advertised and can be used by many people such as tax credits for mass transit passes which exists in some countries but some of these tax savings are things you never heard of before until it winds up on the news why do some people seem to get tax savings that you and i can not get and why do those people always seem to have so much more money than us a simplistic answer can show this in three parts 1 the source of one 's income 2 transaction costs and 3 tax loopholes tax savings occur proportionately to one 's income and if the savings apply to investment income they occur proportionately to one 's wealth if someone living paycheck to paycheck with a minimal amount in a bank account saves tax on investment income they might reduce their taxable interest from $ 50 to $ 0 that 's because they simply do n't have any other investment income to reduce all of their income comes in the form of employment which is typically very hard to save taxes on most governments have a very firm grasp on the taxation of employment income because it is a huge proportion of income in the country and therefore has the largest amount of tax associated and because it is very straightforward work for someone = employment income a more cynical person than i might point out that investment income is earned by the very wealthy who can afford to lobby for politicians to pass favourable investment income laws even very straightforward tax saving opportunities may cost money to enable the simplest example would be if a tax saving opportunity is so complicated that an average person ca n't understand it themselves then an accountant lawyer or banker will need to be the one to explain it and that can cost you money if your tax is n't so much to begin with then the transaction costs to achieve the tax savings could be higher than the tax savings themselves for example most countries have tax savings deferrals if you start a corporation these rules typically exist to promote investment in the local economy but someone who earns $ 10k in a side business might not be able to afford the $ 3k in incorporation costs just to save $ 2k in taxes the more income and wealth you have the more these transaction costs become worthwhile i 'm going to generally define tax loopholes for the purposes of this answer as something where a somewhat arbitrary situation allows for taxes that a layman would consider unfair or unexpected this often occurs with good intentions but poor legislation the government tries to provide a benefit to a deserving group or to promote an activity but ends up allowing another group to take advantage   for example in canada there existed until a few years ago tax saving rules about passing on wealth to children at lower tax rates only when a close family member is near death setting up a testamentary trust between a grandparent and a could in some circumstances allow that trust to be created with additional tax brackets meaning more income would be taxed at a less than top tax rate before being distributed to the grandchildren   the rules were put in place with the idea that oh gee a family member has died and the ol' family is so hard they ca n't distribute the wealth to the next generation for a few months on account of all the crying we should make it so that the estate is taxed like a person and if they earn only a little income they have a low tax rate and they only get taxed at the full rate if they have a lot of income seems reasonable enough but if a family is ready to pass on wealth at the same time as someone is the bucket with their foot a morbid discussion with your lawyer and accountant could set your children up for life with forever reduced taxes on massive inheritances   in the case of the panama paradise leaks tax savings are due to all 3 of the above those who have massive wealth and therefore earn the majority of their income from investments instead of employment can afford the transaction costs associated with taking advantage of specific tax loopholes the simplest example of which is just that income earned in a foreign country might have a lower tax rate than income earned domestically this is often a result of cracks in the foreign tax treaties between countries which exist generally to promote business between countries and prevent double taxing individuals who need activity in both countries for whatever reason take for example the apple loophole apple has operations around the world some activity occurs in low tax jurisdictions apple reports a high percentage of the value of r&d as being associated with those jurisdictions those branches in low tax jurisdictions charge the high tax branches such as the us with fees for use of their valuable research so much of apple 's income is reported in those foreign jurisdictions it wo n't be taxed in the us until apple the cash back to the us until then the cash sits in the foreign jurisdiction accruing less tax this and similar rules can be used by individuals wealthy enough to hold corporations in foreign jurisdictions with low tax rates how each particular rule loophole works will depend on the nature of a specific case tax law is complex and the rules between countries are even more so these foreign tax loopholes are closing every year it is getting harder and harder to hide money offshore and it is getting less and less likely that you will be able to find a country with the right loopholes for your own offshore wealth these types of news leaks will only help to expedite those changes

from rich dad poor dad 3 major things with rental real estate in addition to mortgage interest you also deduct property taxes and must claim depreciation cost of house 27.5 years business expenses for example buy a yacht and put it in a charter fleet deduct interest on the loan depreciation of the asset property taxes upkeep of the boat your business earns profit from the boat which if i recall correctly is taxed at a lower rate you get to go sailing for free then there was the concept of the businesses if you own a restaurant create another business to own the property and the equipment used in the company then lease the equipment and rent the land to the restaurant now admittedly i thought this was like the daylight savings plan of tax avoidance i mean now are n't you essentially having two companies paying half the taxes i am sure there are well paid cpas that make the math happen perhaps using insurance plans perhaps each business funds a whole life insurance account and contributes vast amounts into that then you take a loan from your insurance account loans of course are not income so not taxed the third way is to create your own bank banks are required to have reserves of 9 meaning if i have $ 100 dollars the allows me to loan $ i then charge you 20 interest or $ now how much can i loan   well you can see how profitable that is sure you pay taxes but when you print your own money who cares most of this is just from books and government publications but that was my general understanding of it feel free to correct the finer points

whole life in most instances is a very bad plan it 's marketed as a life insurance policy wrapped in an investment but it does neither very well the hidden caveat of whole life is that the investment goes away if you die   say for example i have a $ 100,000 whole life insurance policy and over the years i have paid in enough to have a $ 15,000 cash value on the policy if i die my family gets $ 100,000 and the cash value is lost with term life you can get a substantially higher amount of coverage for a smaller payment if you invest the difference you end up not only with better coverage but a better cash value from the difference if you do n't die which is what we all hope for anyways as said your insurance should be designed around replacing lost income value   you should get 10x your annual income in term life insurance

first what 's your risk tolerance how long is your investment going to last if it 's a short term investment a few years and you expect to break even or better then your risk tolerance is low you should not invest much money in stocks even index funds and defensive stocks if however you 're looking for a long term investment which you will put money into continually over the next 30 years the amount of stock you purchase at any given time is pretty small so the money you might lose by timing the market wrong will also be rather small also you probably do a remarkably poor job of knowing when to buy stocks if you actually knew how to time the market to materially improve your risk adjusted returns you 've missed your calling you should be making six figures or more on wall street

plenty of good answers here but probably the best answer is that the market relies on suckers er investors like you   the money has to come from somewhere it might as well be you so called day traders or short term investors are a huge part of the market and they perform a vital function   they provide capital that flows to the large well equipped institutional investors   thing is you can never be big enough smart enough well informed enough or quick enough to beat the big guys   you may have a run of good fortune but over the long term aggregate you 're a payor into the market not a dividend

the problem is a mixture of private and public   either go full public or full private or the disparate mechanisms of each will clog the other up and it fails   blaming it on bad faith or incompetence on the part of elected officials is a different problem   an incompetent elected government is a product of an incompetent electorate so in effect you 're blaming yourself for hiring morons   the solution is to elect competent people and throwing up your hands at the problem is tantamount to saying the human race is damned and there 's nothing to be done about it

keep in mind there are too many variables to address in a single post i could and might write a full book on the topic one simple way to comprehend your perceived observation in the 25 bracket you have $ 1000 of income and two choices net out $ 750 and deposit to roth or deposit the full $ 1000 to the traditional ira or 401(k sufficient time passes for the investment to grow 10 fold for what it 's worth 8 at 30 years will do that   the roth is now worth $ 7500 tax free the traditional 401(k is worth $ 10000 but subject to tax at 25 we 're at the same $ 7500   for those looking to invest more than a gross $ 18,000 the roth flavor is an effective $ 24,000 as post tax this is $ 18,000 i wrote a bit more on this in the titled the density of your ira this is really a top issue as it takes quite a bit of income for the $ 23,000 combined ira and 401(k limits to be a problem   in my writing the larger case to be made is for taking advantage of the tax rate difference between the time of deposit and withdrawal a look at the 2016 tax rates is in order   let 's stick with 25 while working now at retirement but before social security as that 's another story the couple has $ in standard deduction and exemption and both the 10 and 15 brackets to enjoy   ignoring any other deductions potential credits etc let 's look at a gross $ 80,000 withdrawal    the numbers happen to work out to an average 10 with the couple being in a marginal 15 bracket a full 25 or $ 20,000 tax would be the break even to the same bracket in out analysis so this produces a $ 12,000 benefit   this issue is often treated as if there were 2 points in time the deposit and the withdrawal for most people that may be the case keep in mind current law allows a conversion to roth any time in between this gives an opportunity to make a deposit while in the 25 bracket and convert in any year the marginal rate drops back to 15 for whatever reason   last i ca n't ignore the social security problem simply put when half of your social security benefits plus other income exceed $ 25,000 $ if married filing joint your benefits start to become taxable until 85 of your benefits are fully taxed this issue is worthy of multiple posts by itself it 's not a deal killer just another point to consider a very high income earner might be beyond these levels already in which case the point is moot a low income earner not impacted at all it 's those who are in the range to navigate this that would benefit to take advantage of the scenario i presented above and spend down pre tax accounts while planning to use the roths when social security starts this should make it clear it 's not all or none those retiring with $ 2 m in 100 pretax or $ 1.5 m 100 in roth have both missed the chance to have the optimal mix

if commuting is a big budget item then can you a side job is one way to make extra money but i 'd suggest a home business   if your wife substitute teaches i bet she writes fairly well and in any case you can   write a personal finance blog or just a site with articles   focus on surviving and thriving with in a one income christian household in the suburbs of philadelphia   or if you have a hobby that your furnace write about that   heck do both   the content just stays there and gets traffic day after day that you can monetize my main suggestion would be to start this now because it 's not overnight money   but in the long run it can turn into a nice fairly passive income the big advantage of this is that mommy gets to stay home with the kids and build up a decent business   the cost is $ for the domain per domain and maybe $ 10/month for hosting or if some other legitimate work at home business presents itself go with that   i suggest blogging because it 's what i know but everyone 's an expert in something unique

because the federal government wo n't use the money to buy a car thus generating profits for the car company the aim of cheap loans is to drive sales of cars the difference between the amount of interest paid on the loan and the amount they could have got by investing it elsewhere is simply a reduction in the profit this is true whatever the actual interest rates are

one of the things that you have to be aware of is a little gotcha in the credit utilization rate they or at least the credit company i worked for used the high balance in figuring the credit utilization not the ending balance for example say you had a single card with a $ 2000 credit limit and used it to charge everything during the month say that the high balance was $ 1900 and you paid it down to zero at the end of the month the company would calculate your credit utilization at 95 this is not good and not really fair but that was the way it was done increasing the credit limit helps but you can also usually make interim payments say as a paycheck comes in during the month if you have an online account

the issue is the time frame with a one year investment horizon the only way for a fund manager to be confident that they are not going to lose their shirt is to invest your money in ultra conservative low volatility investments otherwise a year like 2008 in the us stock market would break them note if you are willing to expand your payback time period to multiple years then you are essentially looking at an annuity and it 's market loss rider of course those contacts are always structured such that the insurance company is extremely confident that they will be able to make more in the market than they are promising to pay back multiple decade time horizons

the advantage of using a mortgage is that you pay for a house at today 's price using tomorrow 's money your question suggests that you rightly observed that it was not a good idea around 2006 the last peak in housing that was when prices were at their maximum and had nowhere to go but down some experts think that house prices still have further to go on the downside meanwhile wages have been going nowhere during that time this phenomenon seems to happen about every 40 years or so the 1930s the 1970s and around 2010 at most other times say the 1980s houses are likely to go up for the foreseeable future at those times you want to buy the house at today 's price then pay for it in future dollars when you are earning more money the irony is that what most people observe as teenagers is usually the wrong thing to do when they are say forty in it will probably make sense to have a large mortgage in a bull housing market which is the opposite of what you observed around 2010 so a better rule is to do at age 40 what made sense about the time you were born in your case perhaps the 1990s whereas the people born in the early 1970s that got caught recently observed the bull market of the 1980s and 1990s in their teens and twenties rather than the bear market of the 1970s that took place about the time they were born
