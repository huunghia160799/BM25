the difference between the provincial territorial low and high corporate income tax rates is clear if you read through the page you linked lower rate the lower rate applies to the income eligible for the federal small    business deduction one component of the small business deduction is    the business limit some provinces or territories choose to use the    federal business limit others establish their own business limit higher rate the higher rate applies to all other income emphasis mine essentially you pay the lower rate only if your income qualifies for the federal small business deduction sbd   if you then followed the small business deduction link in the same page you 'd find the sbd page describing active business income from a business carried on in canada as qualifying for the small business deduction   if your corporation is an investment vehicle realizing passive investment income generally that is n't considered active business income determining if your business qualifies for the sbd is n't trivial it depends on the nature of your business and the kind and amount of income it generates   talk to a qualified corporate tax accountant if you 're looking at doing it contracting also pay close attention to the definition of personal services business which would n't qualify for the sbd   your accountant should be able to advise you how best to conduct your business in order to qualify for the sbd   do n't have a good accountant   get one   i would n't operate as an incorporated it contractor without one i 'll also note that the federal rate you would pay would also differ based on whether or not you qualified for the sbd   15 if you did n't qualify vs. 11 if you qualify    the combined corporate income tax rate for a canadian controlled private corporation in ontario that does qualify for the small business deduction would be 11 + 4.5 = 15.5 in 2013 additional reading

i sometimes ask myself this question   but i was totally blown away that you missed the main reasons i think we are in trouble   wall street is a casino and worse than that it is a rigged casino that is more and more dependent on computers making trades   and we are at their mercy   one greedy bank one computer glitch and it 's off to the races we go again   i 'm blown away by what they did in the 2000 's and the fact that they got   away with it totally and completely   you worry about government debt and social security medicare but consider that if wall street banks had n't purposely collapsed the american and world economy for a few quick bucks we would n't be in this recession for almost 6 years now and people businesses   would have paid a lot more taxes    and as far as i can see we are just waiting on   the next bubble that wall street will inflate and pop   we could reduce government debt to zero and wall street could still take the whole thing down again with no fear of   so long as they can make a profit why would n't they   edit removed some choice words made this more readable

actually if you do n't care about paying a bit more either hire an accountant and dump the paper on them or may be cheaper but a bit more work spring for tax software modern tax programs can often download most of your data directly if you do n't care about claiming deductions you can skip a lot of the rest i 'm perfectly capable of doing my taxes on paper or in a spreadsheet but i spring for tax software every year because i find it a lot more pleasant   remember that most of the complexity does come from policies intended to reduce your taxes when you call for simplification you may not like the result it 's better than it was a decade or two ago i used to joke that the battle cry of the next revolution would be no taxation without proper instructions

i think so   i am doing this with our furniture   it does n't cost me any more money to pay right now than it will to pay over the course of 3 years and i can earn interest on the money i did n't spend but know this they are n't offering 0 they are deferring interest for 3 years   if you pay it off before then great if you do n't you will owe all the accumulated interest the key with these is that you always pay it and on time   miss a payment and you get hosed   if you do n't pay on time you will owe the interest that is being deferred   they will also be financing this through a third party like a major bank and that company is now doing business with you which means in the us they can call you and solicit new services   i am willing to deal with those trade offs though plus as you say you can always pay it off why they do it what is in it for them a friend of mine works for a major bank that often finances these deals here is how they work basically banks do this to generate leads for their divisions that do cold calls   if you are a high credit high income customer you go to a classic bank and request cash if you are building credit or have bad credit you go to a financial services branch   if you tend to finance things like cars and furniture you get more cold calls

i concur with pretty much what everyone else said let me break it down in a concrete plan of action   first though note that at least the minimum payments for the credit cards needs to be on this list of fixed expenses also you have $ remaining in a normal month food could be $ 500 or more easily for a family so find out how much   adding in just those 2 things and you 're already at your max and there are other expenses in life    ok cutting from the top gone pure luxury and between netflix hulu and your    internet connection hook your computer to the tv there 's no need    for it $ 80 savings   cell phones you 're already moving in the right direction but not    far enough in a financial crunch why does your stay at home wife have    a cell especially when she could just as easily use google voice for    free both plans gone replaced by one of the $ 105    savings total $ savings   529 plans of course you want to save for your kids college but it    does n't help them for you to drown financially gone until your credit    card debit is too $ 50 savings $ total ok we 're already up to $ in savings just cutting items you do n't need that probably gets you back into the black but why stop there   trimming expenses   electric ok i know it 's summer but can you cut this back is the    thermostat set as high as you can comfortably bear are you diligent    in turning of lights especially incandescent do you turn off your    computer when you 're not using it see if you can get the electric    down by 10 that 's $ savings does n't seem like much but it    adds up   gas same with gas do you have gas hot water if so cut shower    length saves on water too   food this one you did n't list but as i said you could be spending    $ 500 or $ 600 a month easily for a family do you guys plan meals and    thus plan shopping trips if not do it you 'll be surprised how much    you can save either way 10 reduction should be doable that 's    $ 50/month if you do n't plan now 20 is within reach that 's    $ 100/month ok that may have added as much as $ 130 or so if so you 're now up to $ savings that 's like a 15 raise   simply cutting however is only half the plan you want to improve your situation so you can get the back assuming you 'll even want it at that point and the wife 's cell phone for starters   to do that you 've got to nail down that debt i figure you 've got minimum $ in debt payments that 's not including your mortgage and including an assumed $ minimum credit card payments you pay over 21 of your take home to short term and consumer debt   yea that 's why you 're hurting here 's what you do   in both cases apply the extra payments entirely to one balance at a    time pick either the smallest balance psychologically best because    you quickly see a loan it 's payment or the highest    interest mathematically the best roll each regular payment that 's paid off into the extra debt payments you did n't list total debt balances but you did say you had $ 4000 in    credit card debt applying an extra $ to debt out of that    $ savings plus two extra paychecks of $ 1300 each is $    paid off in under a year you could have those credit cards paid off and likely that window loan too start the 529s again but keep going    paying down the rest when you have the car paid off bring back the    wife 's cell you and i both know that 's going to be 1 on the list     then finish off those student loans   then in the extra $ 21 of your income you 'll have in sweet sweet green cash

first decide on your asset allocation are you looking for a fund with 60 stocks risky stuff or 40 or 20 second look for funds that have a mix of stocks and bonds good keywords would be target retirement lifecycle balanced conservative moderate allocation as you discover these funds probably the fund website but at least will tell you the percentage in stocks and risk assets vs. in conservative bonds look for funds that have the percentage you decided on or as close to it as possible third build a list of funds that meet your allocation goal and compare the details are they based on index funds or are they actively managed what is the expense ratio is the fund from a reputable company you could certainly ask more questions here if you have several candidates and are n't sure how to choose for investing in us dollars one can't go wrong choice is vanguard and they have several suitable funds but unfortunately if you spend in then you should probably invest in that currency and i do n't know anything about funds in israel update two other options here one is a financial advisor who agrees to do rebalancing for you if you get a cheap one it could be worth it two is that some 401k plans have an automatic rebalancing feature where you have multiple funds but you can set it up so their computer auto rebalances you that 's almost as good as having a single fund though it does still encourage some mental accounting so you 'd have to try to only look at the total balance not the individual fund balances over time anyway both of these could be alternatives ways to go on autopilot besides a single fund

i expect that the loan documents show both you and your ex partner as jointly and liable for the debt and thus you 're both responsible for it   it does n't really matter what other paperwork you have that says otherwise or what other promises might have been made   certainly the other agreements give you legal ground to go after your ex partner for the money but they give you no leverage with the bank if you end up paying this debt off to save your credit you need to make sure that the account is closed   make sure you have paperwork showing it as closed and showing that it was paid in full and then keep that paperwork forever re 1 i think it will eventually show up on your credit report   you could ask the bank for proof that you owe the money if you like but that will probably just delay the inevitable re 2 his bankruptcy filing really has no bearing on you and your obligation to repay the loan   if he did n't list this debt then he is still liable for it as well and you can still go after him under your other agreements   but either way you 're still on the debt

first you should maintain a monthly expense and find out the burn rate there would be certain expenses that are annual but mandatory school fees insurance premium property taxes etc so the ideal emergency fund depending on your industry should be 3 month to 6 months plus your mandatory yearly payments more so if they come together for example most of my annual payments come out in may and i bank on the bonus payout in april to cater to this spike in expense so if i were to lose a job in march my emergency funds would be sufficient for routine expenses if i do n't provision for additional funds second you need to also figure out the reduced rate of monthly burn and ideally the emergency funds should be for 3 months of normal burn and 6 months of reduced burn

this will be difficult to achieve   it can be done but it 's very rare to have an agreement where your employer is willing to max out your contribution limit unless you are a partner in the business or a family relation in this situation the extra employer money would probably come from a profit sharing contribution if your employer increases your match others are correct that your employer would have to increase the match for everyone not so with a profit sharing contribution this is assuming 2 things though both of those are big if 's and i 'd say 99 of the time it 's not gon na happen for either of those two reasons your chances are better if you do n't own > 5 of the company do n't make over $ and are related to you employer good luck

when a stock is going to become public there 's a level of analysis required to figure out the range of ipo price that makes sense for a company that 's somewhat mature and has a sector to compare it to you can come up with a range that would be pretty close for the recent linkedin it 's tougher to price a somewhat unique company running at a loss in a market rich with cash looking for the next great deal if one gives this any thought an opening price that 's so far above the ipo price represents a failure of the underwriters to price it correctly it means the original owners just sold for far less than the market thought they were worth on day one the day of ipo the stock opens similar to how any stock would open at 9:30 there are bids and asks and a price at which supply the ask and demand bid balance for this ipo it would appear that there were enough buyers to push the price to twice the anticipated open and it 's maintained that level since   it 's possible to have a different system in which a dutch auction is used to make the shares public in theory this can work it 's just not used commonly

the shareholders have a claim on the profits but they may prefer that claim to be exercised in ways other than dividend payments for example they may want the company to invest all of its profits in growth or they may want it to buy back shares to increase the value of the remaining shares especially since dividends are generally taxed as income while an increase in the share price is generally taxed as a capital gain and capital gains are often taxed at a lower rate than income

well they do n't make money in the sense of income but they receive money in exchange for shares of stock more of the company is owned by the public   the warrant entitles the holder to purchase stock directly from the company at a fixed price   it is very much like an open market call option but instead of the option holder buying stock from a third party which does not affect the company at all the holder buys it directly from the company increasing the number of shares outstanding and the proceeds go directly to the company if the holders do not exercise the warrants the company does not receive any cash but they also do n't issue any new shares

there is really much simpler explanation for the interest rate differences in different countries it is the interest rate arbitrage it is a very well explored economic concept so you can look it up on the internet in case you want to know more 1 interest rates for the same currency in different countries basically as one smart person here pointed out there is only one price of money in free market economy it happens because investors can move their money anywhere in the world to capitalize on the local interest rates advantage for instance if i can take a loan in the usa at 3 4 annual interest and receive 5 6 annual income on my dollar deposit in russia i would take a loan in the us and open a deposit in russia to enjoy a risk free interest rate differential income of 2 5 6 3 4 ~ 2 so would any reasonable person however in real world very few banks in russia or anywhere would pay you an an interest rate higher than it can borrow money at it 'd probably lose money if it 'd do so anyways the difference between the risk free rate and interest rate on the dollar deposit can be attributed to the risk premium of this particular bank the higher expected return the greater risk premium if there is a positive difference in the interest rates on the dollar deposits in different countries it will almost entirely accounted for the risk premium it is generally much riskier to keep money in say russian bank than american that 's why investors want greater return on their dollar deposits in russian banks than in american of course if you 'd want to park your usd in russian bank you 'd also have to consider transaction costs so as you may have already guessed there is no free lunch 2 interest rates in different currencies for different countries if we are talking about the interest rates in different sovereign currencies it is a somewhat similar concept only there is more risk if you keep money in local currency risk premium is much higher probably the biggest component of this risk is inflation that is only attributed to the prices in local currency for that reason current interest rates on deposits in russian rubles are at 10 12 but only 1 3 in the us dollars an economic concept that discusses this phenomenon in great detail is interest rate parity   hope this was helpful p.s. it does n't look quite realistic that you can get an 8 annual income for usd deposit in russia with the interest rates in the u.s. being at 1 2 at present moment a 30-year mortgage annual interest rate in the us is at ~2 3 and an annual interest rates for dollar deposits in one of the safest russian banks = very little risk premium is at 1 3 so arbitrage is impossible

yes and no   courts do understand the idea of tyranny of the majority   specifically actions that hurt the company for personal gain is still theft against the minority shareholders   it 's common misconception that this fiduciary duty means that a ceo 's job is to raise the price of their stock   the truth is stock price is a number that has an extremely tenuous relation to actual company health   so it 's entirely possible for a shareholder lawsuit to happen   it 's just typically cheaper and less hassle to sell the stocks for a loss and get out while they can

if your employer does not offer contribution matching and you do n't like the range of investment options provided by the company 401k then you probably are better off investing in your own ira instead   in an ira held at a bank or brokerage you can invest in multiple stocks or funds and move money around within the ira pretty freely in most cases if your company is doing well and is actually sharing profit into the 401k you might consider leaving your 5 contribution to the 401k where it is and put the other 5 you are planning to contribute into a new ira of your own   this straddles the risk of you losing money if your company 401k tanks or profit sharing dries up and your missing out on profit sharing if it continues to pay well

yes rebalancing with new money avoids capital gains taxes and loads although if you 're financially literate enough to be thinking about rebalancing techniques i 'm surprised to hear that you 're invested in funds with loads on the other hand if it 's taking you years to rebalance then a you are not rebalancing anywhere near frequently enough   rebalancing should be something you do every 6 months or 1 year such that it would take only a few weeks or maybe a month of new investment to get back in balance b you will be out of balance for quite a long time while the whole point of the theory of rebalancing is to always be mathematically prepared for swings in the market   any time spent out of balance represents that much more risk that an unexpected market move can seriously hurt your portfolio you should weigh the time it will take you to rebalance the long way i.e. the risk cost of not rebalancing immediately vs. the taxes and fees involved in rebalancing quickly   if you had said that it would take you only a couple weeks or a month to rebalance the long way i would say that the long way is fine   but the prospect of spending years without a balanced portfolio seems far more costly to me than any expenses you might incur rebalancing quickly since it 's almost the end of the calendar year have you considered doing two quick rebalances one this year and another in january   that way half of the tax consequences would happen in april and the other half not until the next april giving you plenty of time to up the money   also even if you have no capital losses this year with which to offset some of your expected capital gains you would have all of next year to harvest some losses against next year 's half of the rebalancing gains

gt a marketing guy who as a teenager invented a color ray tube design that almost beat sony to a patent on the trinitron display   or so the entirely unsubstantiated urban myth claims   except it really does n't hold any water at all sculley was born in    first of all there was a whole host of patents underlying sony 's trinitron the early ones were applied for by physicist lawrence in circa 1960 when sculley would have been 21 and which sony then bought from lawrence in circa 1966 sculley aged 27 when sony really began developing a practical version of what finally became the trinitron display which they then filed multiple other patents on starting in circa 1967 by which time sculley would have been 28 + and by which time he was already out of college bachelor 's and an mba and working for pepsi and moreover there is no way that sculley would have known about sony 's patent application until after it was issued which i believe was in circa 1970 by which time sculley would have been 30 + years old   btw source for sony tech talk semiconductors devices   and if you go with the other version of this story that it was n't a trinitron but rather the original color tv idea well then it becomes even less plausible since first had a working crt based electric electronic color television in patented a refined version in and public demonstrated it in the fall of wiki when sculley would have been aged lt 1 year 2 years old and 5 years old respectively     and of course the fcc was already reviewing of the cbs and color tv systems in august of television broadcasting television monitor tube when sculley would have been age 10   so about the only semi plausible color tv would be the models that were commercially introduced when sculley was actually a teenager either the or the more well known both of which started selling at retail stores in the spring of gawker media image the year when sculley would have just turned 15 in april but which both had rather obviously been in development and having patents filed and planning for several years prior according to filing amp licensing patents since 1946 in other words long before sculley had reached an age that can plausibly be called a teenager   pretty much like the rest of sculley 's claims regarding his technology ideas and inventions it 's all bullshit that was come up with during after his time at apple in order to make him look sound like someone other than a colored sugar water marketing guy   at best he maybe had a crude idea for a color tv tube probably after reading some magazine article on how a plain crt works and maybe there is even some of truth to the fact that his dad not a technical guy either thought it had enough possible merit to warrant visiting a patent attorney who probably wisely informed dear old dad to put his checkbook away and then somehow junior got the idea and maybe even started telling the tale that he had been beaten to the patent office by xx days and of course now as he got older he probably found out how implausible his story was so he had to update revise it and he has since so thoroughly his own memory that the claim would now be that not only was it a color tv idea but it was a better color tv why it was the same as the trinitron alas bullshitting even in such a blatant form is not a crime even gullible people into repeating said bullshit is also not a crime   gt;he also did a pretty good job the mobile amp internet revolution in hindsight it does n't seem impressive   he did n't foresee anything he simply repeated and attempted to claim credit for things that had been in existence or development by a multitude of others while he was busy pushing pop

it depends on the deal and you did n't give any details that said there are some things that stand out regardless and some more specific answers to your questions first mortgage rates at the bank are absurdly low right now like less than 4 for excellent credit you say your credit is ok so unless your landlord is willing to do a deal where they get no benefit beyond the price of the house the bank is the way to go if you do n't have much for a down payment go with an fha loan where you need only 3.5 down   second there is another option in between bank mortgage and rent to own and that is that where your landlord carries the note basically there is a mortgage and it works like a bank mortgage but instead of the bank owning the mortgage your landlord does now in terms of them carrying all of it this is n't really helpful who wants to make 3 4 interest   but there is an interesting opportunity here with your ok credit you can probably get pretty close to 4 interest at the bank if the loan is for 80 ltv loan to value that is 20 equity at 80 ltv you also wo n't have pmi so between the two that loan will be very cheap then your accommodating landlord can carry the rest at say 6 7 interest junior to the bank mortgage meaning if you default the bank gets first on the value of the house under that scenario your over all interest payment is very reasonable and you would n't have to put any money down   now for your other questions    if we rent to own are we building equity not usually like the other posters said rent to own is whatever both parties agree on but objectively most rent to own agreements whether for a tv or a house are set up to screw the buyer sorry to be blunt and i 'm not saying your landlord would do that this is just generally how it is with rent to own you do n't own it till you make the last payment and if you miss a payment they repo the property there is no recourse because hey it was a rental agreement of course the agreements vary and people who offer rent to own are n't necessarily bad people but it 's like one of those payday loan places they provide a valid service but no one with other options uses them if we rent to own can we escape if we have to read ca n't pay    anymore usually sure think about what you 're saying here 's the house back and all that money i paid you keep it it 's a great deal if you 're on the selling side   how does rent to own affect or not our credit it all depends on how it 's structured but really it comes down to are they going to do reporting to the credit bureaus in a rent to own agreement between individuals the answer is no individuals ca n't report to a credit bureau it 's kind of a big deal to be set up to be able to do that

large and well known companies are typically a good starting point that does n't mean that they are the best or even above average good but at least they do n't cheat you and run with your money a core point is someone you pay not the company whose investment he sell you although the latter seems cheaper on first glance it is n't if you pay him his interest is to do good work for you if they pay him his interest is to sell you the product with the highest payment for him that does not imply that they are all that way it 's just a risk there are many good advisers that live from commissions and still do n't recommend you bad investments depending on the amounts you could also read up a bit and open an account with a online investment company it is but i think the cost for an adviser only starts to become worth it if you are deep into 5 digits of money

saying that sales go online does n't mean that a typical jc penny shopper just goes to their site   these people are going to google shopping engines and amazon    upping your online sales is n't that simple   if the majority of shoppers are searching google and your listings do n't show up then that potential customer is going else where    you could pay for ppc ads but return on investment on ppc can suck depending on your market and for products that have a long life cycle return happy customers could be years before they return   even worse if jc penny and sears did want to compete online their prices are n't really all that great either so even if you landed on their site chances are you can find it cheaper else where and their overhead from stores and employees makes it hard to cut prices to compete

i feel that getting money sooner than later is always advantageous if i offered you the choice between getting which option would you take i would take the last option and for the same reason from a purely numbers point of view i would argue that getting paid biweekly is preferable assuming the the annual salary is pro rated fairly and barring any compulsive spending habits your calculations suggest to me that they are trying to answer the question looking at a single year or month or some other fixed amount of time in a vacuum is there any financial benefit to being paid bi weekly over monthly the analysis seems to be focusing on comparing the two pay schedules on a month by month basis noting when one is paid bi weekly some months you get paid more times than the other however one could also compare the two pay schedules on a fortnight by fortnight basis and note that when one is paid monthly many you do n't get paid at all and some you get paid a lot or one could compare the two pay schedules on an hour by hour basis too but in the long run the money adds up to be the same amount i prefer getting it as soon as i can

it depends on the relative rates and relative risk ignore the deduction you want to compare the rates of the investment and the mortgage either both after tax or both before tax your mortgage costs you 5 a bit less after tax and prepayments effectively yield a guaranteed 5 return if you can earn more than that in your ira with a risk free investment invest if you can earn more than that in your ira while taking on a degree of risk that you are comfortable with invest if not pay down your mortgage see this article mortgage prepayment as investment for example the borrower with a 6 mortgage who has excess cash flow would do well to use it to pay down the mortgage balance if the alternative is investment in assets that yield 2 but if two years down the road the same assets yield 7 the borrower can stop allocating excess cash flow to the mortgage and start accumulating financial assets note that he 's not comparing the relative risk of the investments paying down your mortgage has a guaranteed return you 're talking about cds which are low risk so your comparison is simple if your alternative investment is stocks then there 's an element of risk that it wo n't earn enough to outpace the mortgage cost update hopefully this example makes it clearer for example lets compare investing $ 100,000 in repayment of a 6 mortgage with investing it in a fund that pays 5 before tax and taxes are deferred for 10 years for the mortgage we enter 10 years for the period 3.6 if that is the applicable rate for the after tax return $ 100,000 as the present value and we obtain a future value of $ for the alternative investment we do the same except we enter 5 as the return and we get a future value of $ however taxes are now due on the $ of interest which reduces the future value to $ the mortgage repayment does a little better so if your marginal tax rate is 30 you have $ 10k extra cash to do something with right now mortgage rate is 5 ira cd apy is 1 and assuming retirement in 30 years if you want to plug it into a spreadsheet the formula to use is substitute your own values note the minus sign before the cash amount make sure you use after tax rates for both so that you 're comparing apples to apples then multiply your ira amount by to get the value after you pay future taxes on ira withdrawals

as stated tracking fractional transactions beyond 8 decimal places makes no sense in the context of standard stock and mutual fund transactions   this is because even for the most expensive equities those fractional shares would still not be worth whole cent amounts even for account balances in the hundreds of thousands of dollars one important thing to remember is that when dealing with equities the total cost number of shares and share price are all 3 components of the same value   thus if you take 2 of those values you can always calculate the third price shares = cost cost price = shares etc   what you 're seeing in your account 9 decimal places is probably the result of dividing uneven values such as $ invested in a commodity which trades for $ results in shares   most brokerages will round this value off somewhere yours just happens to include more decimal places than your financial software allows since your brokerage is the one who has the definitive total for your account balance the only real solution is to round up or down whichever keeps your total balance in the software in line with the balance shown online

if what you are paying in interest on the debt is a higher percentage than what your investments are returning the best investment you can make is to pay off the debt if you 're lucky enough to be paying historically low rates as i am on my mortgage and getting good returns on the investments so the latter is the higher percentage   the balance goes the other way and you 'd want to continue paying off the debt relatively slowly essentially treating it as a leveraged investment   if you are n't sure paying off the debt should probably be the default

ulip insurance plan ulip is unit linked insurance plan the premium you pay a small part goes towards covering life insurance the balance is invested into stock markets most ulip would give you an option to choose from debt funds 100 safe buy low returns 5 7 or equity high risks returns can be around 15 or a mix of both ulip are not a good way to save money there are quite a few hidden fees that actually reduce the return so notionally even if returns shown are great in effect it is quite less for example the premium you pay in first year say rs 10,000/- rs goes towards commission and say rs 100 goes towards insurance balance rs units are purchased in your account even if these grow by 20 you are still in loss the commissions go down year after year and stop at 5 then there is fund management fees that you do n't get to see there is maintenance fee that is from your balance   thus the entire method of charging is not transparent life insurance from there are broadly 2 types of life insurance plans money back endowment plan the concept here is again same you pay a premium and part of it goes toward insurance the balance invests in safe bonds every year a bonus is declared generally less than bank rate at the end of the plan you get more than what you paid in premium however if you had kept the same in bank fd you would have got more money back so if you die your nominee would get insurance plus bonus if you survive you get all the accumulated bonus pure term plan here the premium is quite less for the sum insured here if you die your nominee would get insurance if you survive you do n't get anything

my taxable income was roughly $ 230,000 in 2012 indeed it is relevant the highest agi limit for deductible ira contributions is so no ira contribution will not help you reducing your tax bill this year the deduction phases out starting from agi limits of $ 10 k in certain cases for married filing separately and phases out entirely for anyone at agi of 112 k for 2012 the table linked describes the various deduction phase out parameters depending on your filing status and will probably be updated yearly by the irs however this is only relevant if your company provides a retirement plan as joe mentioned if your company does n't provide a retirement plan but your spouse 's does then the agi phase out limit is $ if neither you nor your spouse if you have one is covered then there 's no agi limit and you can indeed make an ira contribution before april 15th that would be attributed to the previous year and reduce your tax bill note that provides means the plan is available even if you do n't participate in it any time during the year

because they track an index edited the definition of the word in this case meaning something used or serving to point out a sign token or indication from meaning   3 i presume therefore you are asking what an index is there are many variations of what makes up an index but in short it is a representation of some part of a market an extremely simplistic calculation would be to take a basket of stocks and sum their prices   if one stock moves up a dollar and one moves down a dollar the index has effectively not changed as it is presumed that the loss in one is offset by the gain in the other

compensation information is available in the annual reports 10-k filings which are available from the sec edgar system or generally the company 's website   additionally insider transactions are reported to the sec so you can see when an insider buys or sells stock or exercises options received as compensation background nowadays board and officers seem to secretly steal money from shareholders through options and other ways the stock buybacks that people think should boost the earnings per stock is in reality issued back to the management of the company and is a more stealth way to take money from the company compared to take higher salaries how do you know this is happening if you do n't know where to go to get the data needed to determine whether or not this is happening   do you really think company share buybacks involve just the amount of shares to pay an executive   apple has bought back $ worth of shares from the fourth quarter 2012 through the second quarter 2016 and paid a pretty substantial amount in dividends over the same period   do you really think these shares were simply handed to the executives   the huge pension funds and other huge investors would not let this slide for very long if it were even close to being true do n't come to an unfounded conclusion then seek data to prove your position   look at and analyze data then come to a conclusion

i do n't have a lot of time to keep going back and forth it seems like we differ on a bunch of things but i do want to respect your final question when you ask me what i thought was wrong in that post   you mention things like the government regulating things like water and air those are common goods these can not be in the hands of a corporation man did not put those things there so man can not take ownership of these things bottled water running water oxygen tanks etc those things are man made products or services for a market i can go to a public body of water and swim in it because no one owns it i can go to the shore in my favorite suit and swim in the beautiful ocean water if i so please without needing to pay or trade with anyone for access to the ocean but i can not start pumping water out of the ocean and into a big tank for me to haul away the government needs to step in and put an end to anyone that does that sort of thing same goes for anyone trying to with the water or doing something that is harmful to people or the life living in the water government needs to stop all of that also yes the municipality then and the water and pumps it to your house in public facilities and treats the resultant sewage but are you also claiming that it was the government that created the solution to clean and our water supplies because they sure did n't   as for electricity the way it is delivered and made available to our homes is a commodity electricity is natural but just like how water when bottled becomes a consumer product the generation and delivery of electricity to our homes is a product and service if a company delivering electricity to customers in a city is using public infrastructure then of course they have to share it that makes sense as the electric company does not own the utility poles streets etc the government should regulate that   the government handling trade agreements is a job of the government we need them to do that i believe in an open free and consumer driven market i do n't want a lot of regulation on this such as tariffs that trump has talked about because history shows that could lead to the costs inflating with quality not following suit his rants on jobs fleeing followed by his talks of tariffs on foreign imports would be a terrible idea i want the government to negotiate trade deals as long as it is in the best interest for this country this is what grows an economy imagine if apple could n't import iphones unless they paid a 30 tax since it was assembled in china that would kill sales of iphones because apple would have to pass most if not all of that cost on to the consumer samsung phones for argument 's sake let 's say these are n't made in china i do n't think they are anyway but just saying would begin to take a larger share of the consumer market because prices would be lower since samsung did n't have to pay a 30 tax   as for the coffee pot from china starting a fire in my house no one would by a coffee pot if there was a known fire starting issue with those coffee pots the government telling china that coffee pots need to be a certain specification is really irrelevant the issue would resolve itself because no one would by the coffee pots once this became a known problem stores would take it off the shelves and no longer sell it we have cars that are recalled left and right car seats for and that are recalled every year so on and so forth i know the federal government has a recall process but usually its the manufacturer that will announce the recall first if there is a bad product out there it will die out and no longer be made available for purchase i do n't see the the federal government regulations on car manufacturers that mandate all tires must not fall off of the car while in motion no instead the manufacturer who is in the business of making money which they need to sell cars to make money would create a car where the tires are not likely to ever fall off while a car is in motion or even when idle   the last thing i want to touch on is the obamacare mandate if i do n't want something why am i being forced to pay for it why do you agree with this i am already paying into social security and i wish i was n't i will make my own investments with my income to prepare for retirement why should i pay for health insurance if i do n't want it the government should not be making my life choices for me i have one responsibility on this earth as it pertains to my behavior that is to respect others inalienable rights such as the right to life liberty property and the pursuit of happiness as long as i do not harm someone in an immoral way e.g. steal kill physical harm property damage disclose personally identifiable information etc i should be free to live my life without government interference i am fine with paying into a system for true welfare cases some people fall into bad situations that they could not help some people are born into a terrible situation those people need help but i do n't want to pay for stupid ass things like chuck 's idiotic idea of medicare for people over 55 he wants to lower the medicare age by 10 years this is the insane progressive ideas that literally just worsen societies in 2016 medicare benefit payments totaled $ 675 billion up from $ 375 billion in medicare issue brief the facts on medicare spending and a $ 300 billion increase in just 10 years and that schmuck wants to lower eligibility by 10 years if this were ever signed into law i am plus other american workers going to be forced to pay into this that means less money for me to save and invest for retire or an emergency less for my daughter less for my mortgage less for me to continue my education less on whatever i choose to do with my money that i spend 40 hours week in an office for my time is spent doing something asked of me by a corporation that corporation pays me for my time it 's a mutual agreement resulting in a trade of money for my services i do it because i want to do things and provide for my family i do n't do it because someone decided to spend 4 years for a degree in graphic design and ca n't get a job i also do n't do it for people that have a cash only income both illegal immigrants and legal citizens do this and do n't declare all of their income making them eligible for obamacare and lastly i do not do it for people that decide to live off of the system and are physically and mentally fit to work in some capacity i should not be forced to pay a mandate just because i 'm here breathing   obama just like all progressives normalized this breathing tax it is n't right of course obamacare falls apart if there are n't enough healthy people to subsidize the sick people that 's why the mandate was obviously put in place but just because the mandate is needed to make it work does n't make it right to force on people my mortgage needs to get paid if all my neighbors in $ i could make it work well is it right to force my neighbors to pay my mortgage nope i made the decision to buy my house they did not not to mention with socialized health care services are and that is just sickening big gov oh you 're 80 years old and you need a knew knee well you did live for 80 years so we 're going to deny that request in a system where i pay for my own health care and insurance i can get a new hip and a new knew if i needed it and it would all be done within a week or 2 most likely you have 51 week old charlie who britain and the wonderful eu sarcasm ordered to die he did so just last week even though his parents had the money to fly him here and have a doctor perform a potentially life saving surgery yep when the government owns healthcare they own your health that 's my other big reason for hating obamacare it truly is a bad thing we have world history that can easily show anyone what it looks like if we keep going down this path   i am done for now i am not trying to convince you of anything that usually does n't happen as people are set in their ways if anything this exchange of messages is for the out there that want to learn what is right and what is wrong what liberty is and what it is n't taxing people as a way to redistribute wealth is wrong imposing mandates so people buy a product service is just straight up wrong our income is a representation of our time spent fulfilling the responsibilities of an agreement that we voluntarily made with an employer our money is our time our time is our liberty and if we are n't on the rights of others during our time then the government needs to stay out   catch you later

the big difference for me under the high deductible plan has been that instead of paying the co pay now i am now responsible for the negotiated rate until i reach the deductible limit the hsa is only a way to funnel medical payments through a tax free account the insurance company and the doctor do n't care about the hsa if we go out of network then i am responsible for the full rate but they only count the negotiated rate as a credit against the out of pocket deductible this big difference makes it very important to pick a doctor in network for your example i would have paid $ 50 under the ppo but $ 200 under the high plan if i go out of network i would have to pay whatever the doctor want me to pay but the insurance company would only credit me $ 200 against my deductible i can pull the extra $ 350 from the hsa it is hard to get good pricing information from some doctors but the price difference for me has been so large that in network is the only way to go for prescriptions the high deductible plan has been worse because we pay the full price with no discounts for the medicine until we reach the plan deductible that makes the cost of the prescriptions as much as 10x 's more expensive in fact the annual cost of our prescriptions all but guarantees that we hit the deductible each year

do you now own your new home or are you renting   this is a classic case of a mortgage ready to blow up these interest only would have a low rate say 3 so on $ 200 k the payment is $ 500/mo but no principal paydown even if the rate were still 3 it wo n't be the 23 yr amortization means a payment of $ after the 7 years end at 4 it 's $ 5 $ i would take this all into account as you decide what to do if you now own a new house you should consider the morally questionable walk away i believe you were sold an unethical product mb wrote shoot up considerably this is still an understatement a product whose payment is certain to double in a fixed time is bad bad in the biblical sense you have no obligation to keep any deal with the devil which is exactly what you have   there are some banks offering fha products that might help you i just received an offer from the bank holding a mortgage on my rental property it 's 4.5 for a refinance up to 125 of current value there 's a cost of $ 1800 but i owe so little and am paying it off faster than the time left i 'm not bothering you may benefit from such a program but i 'd still question if you can make a go of a house that even 2 underwater do some math and see if you started now with a 30 year loan how the numbers work out   forgive my soapbox stance on this there are those who criticize the strategic i think you fall into a group of innocent victims who were sold a product that was nothing less than a financial time bomb i am very curious to know the original interest only rate and the index margin for the rate upon adjustment if you include the original balance i can tell you the exact payments based on the new rates pretty easily

an issue with the initial plan was that the house was gifted to you therefore you owned it now two years later you wanted to get a mortgage the irs would look at it as a home equity debt not a home acquisition debt and the interest on the first $ 100,000 of home equity dept is deductible this is from irs pub mortgage treated as used to buy build or improve home    a mortgage    secured by a qualified home may be treated as home acquisition debt    even if you do not actually use the proceeds to buy build or    substantially improve the home this applies in the following    situations you buy your home within 90 days before or after the date you take out the mortgage the home acquisition debt is limited to the home 's    cost plus the cost of any substantial improvements within the limit    described below in 2 or 3 see example 1 later you build or improve your home and take out the mortgage before the work is completed the home acquisition debt is limited to the    amount of the expenses incurred within 24 months before the date of    the mortgage you build or improve your home and take out the mortgage within 90 days after the work is completed the home acquisition debt is limited    to the amount of the expenses incurred within the period beginning 24    months before the work is completed and ending on the date of the    mortgage see example 2 later example 1 you bought your main home on june 3 for $ you paid for the    home with cash you got from the sale of your old home on july 15 you    took out a mortgage of $ 150,000 secured by your main home you used    the $ 150,000 to invest in stocks you can treat the mortgage as taken    out to buy your home because you bought the home within 90 days before    you took out the mortgage the entire mortgage qualifies as home    acquisition debt because it was not more than the home 's cost at two years you would be way outside the 90 day limit the pub also gives example on how calculate the amount of interest you can deduct

wikipedia has a good summary historically branch banking in the united states especially interstate branch banking was viewed by regulatory authorities and this was codified with the enactment of the act of 1927 which specifically prohibited interstate banking over the next few decades some banks attempted to circumvent 's provisions by establishing bank holding companies that operated so called independent banks in multiple states to address this the bank holding company act of 1956 prohibited bank holding companies headquartered in one state from having branches in any other state most interstate banking prohibitions were repealed by the interstate banking and branching efficiency act of 1994 research has also found that anticompetitive state provisions restricted out of state growth when those provisions were more restrictive than the provisions set by the interstate banking and branching efficiency act or by neighboring states some states have also had restrictive bank branch laws for example illinois outlawed branches other than the main office until 1967 and did not allow an unlimited number until 1993

tl;dr sure do your own homework is sometimes a cop out but that does n't mean we should n't do our homework i agree that in many cases this is a cop out by commentators however even if you believe in perfect market efficiency there is benefit in doing your homework for many reasons one of which you already mention in the question different stocks all with the same value might have widely ranging risk another factor that might vary between stocks is their tax consequences high dividend stocks might be a better fit for some buyers than others one stock might be priced at $ 40 because there is a small chance they might get regulatory approval for a new product this might make this stock very risky with a 20 of being $ 150 in 12 months and a 80 chance of being $ 20 another stock might be priced at $ 40 because the company is a cash cow declining in revenues but producing a large dividend of $ 0.40 per quarter low risk but also with some potential tax disadvantages another stock might be priced at $ 40 because it 's a high growth stock this would be less risky than the first example but more risky than the second example and the risk would be more generalized i.e. there would n't be one day or one event that would be make or break the stock in short even if we assume that the market is pricing everything perfectly not all stocks are equal and not all stocks are equally appropriate to everyone sometimes when we hear an analyst say they should have done their homework they are really saying this was a high risk high reward stock they should have known that this had a potential downside and that all assumes that we believe in 100 pure market efficiency which many disagree with at least to some extent for example if we instead subscribe to peter lynch 's theories about local knowledge we might believe that everyone has some personal fields of expertise where they know more than the experts a professional stock analyst is going to follow many stocks and many not have technical experience in the field of the company this is especially true of small and mid cap stocks if you happen to be an expert in led lighting it is entirely feasible at least to me that you could be able to do a better job of doing homework on than the analysts or if you use a specialized piece of software from a small vendor at work and you know that the latest version stinks then you will likely know more than the analyst does i think it is somewhat akin to going to a doctor we could say to ourselves the doctor is more knowledgeable about me than medicine i 'm just going to do what they tell me to do and 99 of the time that is the right thing to do but if we do our homework anyway and research the symptoms diagnoses and drugs ourselves as well we can do get benefits sometimes we just can express our preferences amongst equal solutions sometimes we can ask smarter questions and sometimes we have some piece of knowledge that the doctor does n't have and can actually make an important discovery they did n't know and just like investing sometimes we can also have just enough knowledge to be dangerous and do ourselves harm if we go against the advice of the professionals

security in the merchant services system is mainly handled in two ways 1 before transactions are done the business itself must go through an application process similar but not identical to getting a loan   some high risk businesses must pay higher fees due to the increased likelihood of customer complaints 2 when a customer disputes a transaction that 's a mark against the business   get too many of these disputes and your of accepting credit cards will be revoked meaning you wo n't be able to again it 's in the merchant 's best interest to verify customer 's identity because disputes cost them money directly   it 's in the servicer 's best interest to verify the businesses integrity because fraud drives up the cost for everyone else as a whole it 's quite a reactionary system yet in practice it works remarkably well

most of the bankruptcy is due to taking or building over a period of time a loan that one can not service if the interest rates rise then the amount of money to repay the loan increases when one does nt pay the revised amount and keeps paying less the over all debt keeps shooting through the roof a lower interest rate means that one can continue to pay the same amount and few missed payments do not cause as much as damage as it does when the rates are high

i just wanted to let people know of a strange little way bankruptcy works in society when dealing with individuals and when dealing with businesses   if i as a person declare bankruptcy my credit score goes downhill i find loans have higher interest rates some people wo n't lend the amounts i want and i have to pay more up front   if as a business i declare bankruptcy my individual credit score not business does not suffer at all my business likely will have a harder time getting loans that is unless someone buys me out or i collapse the business and start a new business maybe even the exact same business with the same clients i personally am not held accountable for anything unless i was a sole proprietor of course and did n't incorporate   that to me is the major problem corporations mean never having to say you 're sorry no matter how high up you are you are never individually accountable for your actions   in fact i highly suggest anyone considering bankruptcy simply form a corporation dump their debt assets into it and then have the corporation declare bankruptcy   instant clean credit score and all your debts are paid   just watch out for liability wiki

there is a white paper on the weekend effect of equity options it is a good paper and shows that for the most part option values do lose money from friday to monday which makes sense because it is getting closer to expiration of course this not something that can be counted on 100   if there is some bad news and the stock opens down on a monday the puts would have increased and the calls decreased in value article summary from the authors we find that returns on options on individual equities display markedly lower returns over weekends friday close to monday close relative to any other day of the week these patterns are observed both in unhedged and delta hedged positions indicating that the effect is not the result of a weekend effect in the underlying securities we find even stronger weekend effects in implied volatilities but only after an adjustment to quote implied volatilities in terms of trading days rather than calendar days   our results hold for puts and calls over a wide range of maturities and strike prices for both equally weighted portfolios and for portfolios weighted by the market value of open interest and also for samples that include only the most liquid options in the market we find no evidence of a weekly seasonal in bid ask spreads trading volume or open interest that could drive the effect we also find little evidence that weekend returns are driven by higher levels of risk over the weekend   the effect is particularly strong over expiration weekends and it is also present to a lesser degree over mid week holidays finally the effect is stronger when the ted spread and market volatility are high which we interpret as providing support for a limits to arbitrage explanation for the persistence of the effect christopher s. jones you can read more about this at this link for

to me it looks pretty good 10 per year is a pretty good return lagging behind the indexes is normal it is hard to beat the indexes over a long period of time the longer the period the lesser the chances to succeed however half a year is a relatively short period of time and you should check your investments a little bit deeper i 'm assuming you 're not invested in one thing so you should check per investment how it is performing if you have funds check each fund against the relevant index for that fund if you have stocks check against the relevant industry indexes etc also check the fees you pay to each fund and the plan they come out of your pocket lowering the return

i assume i can will need to file an 83(b election in order to avoid    tax repercussions what exactly will this save me from 83(b election is for restricted stock grants not for stock purchases for restricted stocks you generally pay income tax when they vest for startups the price difference between the time of the grant and the time of the vesting can be astronomical and by choosing 83(b you effectively pay income tax on the value of the grant instead of the value of the vest then you only pay capital gains tax on the difference between the sale price and the grant value when you sell in your case you 're exercising an option i.e. you 're buying a stock so 83(b is irrelevant what you will pay though is the tax on the difference between the strike price and the stock fmv unless the stocks you end up buying are restricted which would have been the case if you exercised your options early but i do n't think is going to be the case now what steps should i take to in the eyes of the law guarantee that    the board has received my execution notice the secretary of the board    is a notorious and can be very unorganized you should read what the grant contract company policy says on that ask the hr manager usually a certified letter with return receipt should be enough but you should verify the format the address and the timeframe

answers to your questions 1 do bank account numbers have a checksum no 2 is it plausible that they found out your number after sending you the money by accident no there is no way to find out who possesses a particular bank account just by the number also how they even know they made a mistake they targeted you and knew who you were and your bank account number before the money was sent 3 and 4 is this a scam yes they never paid you any money they forged a check for a large amount and deposited it in an account then divided it up wiring pieces to multiple people all of whom they investigated beforehand since it is a bank to bank transfer it clears once the forgery is discovered all the transfers will be unwound if you had sent them money you would have lost that money other things to note there is zero chance of a wire transfer going to the wrong person because the sender has to list the name and address on the account as well as the number you basically did the right thing which is to notify your bank that you received an unauthorized transfer into your account never accept money into your account from someone you do n't know if money appears in your account tell the bank it is an error and probably proceeds from a forgery and they will take care of it

you might convert all your money in local currency but you need take care of following tips while studying abroad here are some money tips that can be useful during a trip abroad know about fees when you use a debit card or credit card in a foreign country there are generally two types of transaction fees that may apply understand exchange rates the exchange rate lets you know the amount of nearby money you can get for each u.s. dollar missing any expenses there are sell rates for individuals who are trading u.s. dollars for foreign currency and the other way around purchase rates it 's a smart thought to recognize what the neighborhood money is worth in dollars so you can comprehend the estimation of your buys abroad   sites like x rates offer a currency converter that gives the current exchange rate so you can make speedy comparisons you can utilize it to get a feel for how much certain amount say $ 1 $ 10 $ 25 $ 50 $ 100 are worth in local currency remember that rates fluctuate so you will be unable to suspect precisely the amount of a buy made in a foreign currency will cost you in u.s. dollars to get cash check for buddy banks if you already have an account with a large bank or credit union in the u.s. you may have an advantage   being a client of a big financial institution with a large atm system may make it easier to find a subsidiary cash machine and stay away from an out of system charge   bank of america for example is a part of the global atm alliance which lets clients of taking an interest banks use their debit cards to withdraw money at any alliance atm without paying the machine 's operator an access fee in spite of the fact that you may at present be charged for converting dollars into local currency used for purchases   citibank is another well known bank for travelers because it has 45,000 atms in more than 30 countries including popular study abroad destinations such as the u.k. italy and spain atms in a foreign country may allow withdrawals just from a financial records and not from savings so make sure to keep an adequate checking balance also atm withdrawal limits will apply just as they do in the u.s. but the amount may vary based on the local currency and exchange rates weigh the benefits of other banks for general needs online banks and even foreign banks can also be good options   with online banks you do n’t have to visit physical branches and these institutions typically have lower fees use our checking account tool to find one that ’s a good fit foreign many american debit cards may not work in europe asia and latin america especially those that do n’t have an emv chip that help prevent fraud or some cards may work at one atm but not another one option for students who expect a more extended stay in a foreign country is to open a new account at a local bank this will let you have better access to atms and to make purchases more easily and without as many fees see our chart below for the names of the largest banks in several countries guard against fraud and identity one of the most important things you can do as you plan your trip is to let your bank know that you ’ll be abroad include exact countries and dates when possible to avoid having your card flagged for fraud unfortunately incidents may still arise despite providing ample warning to your bank bring a backup credit card or debit card so you can still access some sort of money in case one is canceled are also critical not just for traveling from place to place but also as identification to open a bank account and for everyday purposes you ’ll want to make two and give one to a friend or family member to keep at home and put the other in a separate secure location just in case your actual passport is lost or stolen

without reading the source from your description it seems that the author believes that this particular company was undervalued in the marketplace it seems that investors were blinded by a small dividend without considering the actual value of the company they were owners of remember that a shareholder has the right to their proportion of the company 's net value and that amount will be distributed both a in the form of dividends and b on liquidation of the company   theoretically eps is an indication of how much value an investor 's single share has increased by in the year of course this is not accurate because accounting income does not directly correlate with company value increase but it is a good indicator this means in this example that each share had a return of $ 10 of which the investors only received $ 1 the remainder sat in the company for further investment considering that liquidation may never happen particularly within the time frame that a particular investor wants to hold a share some investors may undervalue share return that does not come in the form of a dividend this may or may not be legitimate because if the company reinvests its profits in poorer performing projects the investors would have been better off getting the dividend immediately however some value does need to be given to the non dividend ownership of the company it seems the author believes that investors failing to consider value of the non dividend part of the corporation 's shares in question led to an of the company 's shares in the market

well first of all they clawed back 75 of those bonuses paid out so they really did n't get paid that money   second not every executive not even probably more than one executive was even aware this was happening there is one who might have known it was happening but the reality is that a lot of these decisions and plans are implemented several levels down from the executive team the executives do not get involved in day to day shit typically   third those bonuses to executives are paid out in stock options stock options glean their value from the price of the stock if the stock price goes down then their bonuses lose value or become worthless essentially meaning that they get reductions in pay or no bonus when the stock price goes down so if the scandal had no affect on the stock price why would n't they get paid their bonuses the stock is the best indicator of the public 's reaction to the entirety of the bank

the credit and debit terms here is talking from bank 's point of view should n't be a surprise banks are never known to look at things from the customers pov   in accounting a liability loans owners capital etc is a credit balance and asset cash buildings and such is a debit balance   your account is a liability to the bank in accounting parlance that is because they owe you every single penny that is there in your account btw in literal parlance too if you really make their life harder   so when the bank accepts money from you they need to increase their asset cash which they will debit higher debit balance for asset means more assets and at the same time they also have to account for the added liability by crediting the deposited money into your account so when bank says they have credited your account it means you have more money in your account now if you transfer money from your account to another or make a payment through your account your account will be debited and the beneficiary account will be 's liability towards you reduces more or less what everyone else said here but hey i could also take a swipe at banks

there 's not a single answer here as the premium you pay for car insurance depends on multiple factors including but not limited to all these factors contribute to the likelihood of getting into an accident and the expected damage from an accident   so just having an accident and making a claim will likely raise your premium all else being equal but whether or not it will be cheaper in the long run depends obviously on how much your premium goes up which can not determined without all of the facts   your agent could tell you how much it would go up but even making such an inquiry would likely be noted on your insurance record and may cause your premium to go up although probably not by as much however the point of insurance is to reduce the out of pocket expenses from future accidents so the question to ask is how likely am i to have another accident and if i do can i pay cash for it or will i need to offset some cost with an insurance claim   do you risk making a claim and having your rates go up by more than $ 700 over the next 3 4 years the rough time it takes for a surcharge to expire   or do you just pay for the repair out of pocket and keep your premiums lower

as someone that works in and with the ag and commodity markets my understanding is limited but i hope it helps    aside from needing an infrastructure built to maintain the vast amounts of data communication pricing banking information having a closing time for our markets helps to ensure value and fair trade capitalism is centralized around creating a fair value for ventures to sell where prospective buyers opt to purchase or invest for example where i attended university there were many coffee shops close to campus but only one stayed open all night and as such had operational cost much higher than other shops forcing them to charge more for a cup of coffee while this example is crude the idea is the same by hours product or strategies and developments meant to increase projected value are allowed to occur    i imagine that if the markets did not close my coffee prices would skyrocket for an increased demand that of which the supply and farmers would struggle to meet the same would be said of grain salt oils etcetera

i work in analyzing economic development projects in the midwest like this and one of the most frustrating aspects of my job is when people try to distill and simplify complex financing structures for the sake of misleading others and furthering an agenda it 's not uncommon that i see small local blogs write articles saying something to the effect of major development project skips paying the taxes it rightfully owes completely disregarding the fact that in most cases the local government 's options are to either give the developer an incentive and make some additional money or offer nothing and watch the developer walk away from the table for a different site the next county over most governments given the choice would take lowered tax payments and more jobs over no tax payments and no jobs   since i was curious i decided to do a quick back of the envelope calculation of this project using a common economic impact model i used a conservative assumption of 3,000 new jobs the minimum foxconn expects to have by 2020 and well below the maximum capacity of the factory in the audio and video equipment manufacturing code of industry using the entire state of wisconsin as a geography this industry has average annual earnings in wisconsin of $ so i subtracted out $ 3,000 per job to make it in line with the article i also used the liberal assumption that 100 of these jobs will be considered net new or that they wo n't be replacing or destroying any existing jobs within the state    the results    salaries alone will amount to about $ 160 million per year assuming all workers receive the same salary of $ 53,000    indirect effects basically new jobs and spending for other industries used to support and maintain the factory that are n't directly employed by the factory itself will add an additional $ 20 million in earnings annually     finally induced effects the economic impact of new employees spending their salaries within the economy will add an additional $ 80 million    total change in jobs including factory workers maintenance and utility workers and new workers in supply chain industries is estimated as just north of 5,000    this adds up to $ 260 million in additional annual earnings within the wisconsin economy there is a lot more to be considered when looking at a project like this and there are a lot of ways wisconsin or foxconn can fuck this all up but it is n't out of the realm of possibility that attracting this new plant will end up being a worthwhile plan for wisconsin    also this quote   are calling this development he said speaking from the east room of the white house because we believe this will have a transformational effect on wisconsin just as silicon valley transformed the san francisco bay area   sounds like bullshit silicon valley is largely research and development not manufacturing saying that you 'll replicate the success of software engineers earning $ 120k a year by bringing in more $ 50k a year manufacturing jobs is misleading at best

in general stock markets are very similar to that however you can also put in limit orders to say that you will only buy or sell at a given price these sit in the market for a specified length of time and will be executed when an order arrives that matches the price or better traders who set limit orders are called liquidity or price makers as they provide liquidity i.e. volume to be traded to be filled later if there is no counterparty i.e. buyer to your seller in the market a market maker a large bank or brokerage who is licensed and regulated to do so will fill your order at some price that price is based on how much volume i.e. trading there is in that stock on average this is called average daily volume adv and is calculated over varying periods of time we use which is the 30 day average you can always sell stocks for whatever price you like privately but a market order does not allow you to set your price you are a price taker therefore that kind of order will always fill at a market price as mentioned above limit orders will not fill until the price is hit but will stay on book as long as they are n't filled expired or cancelled

hey ly    do you do the standard practice of basically forcing people to go to several random stops like a suit or jewelry shop before taking people to their destination    if so i highly recommend you just charge more and stop doing it tourists should n't have to spend several days of their vacation figuring out they did n't need to waste time from my trips to that area the single biggest factor of using a tuk tuk service was if they made those annoying stops i get it the shops pay for fuel but i 'd rather pay you more it 's still very cheap by $ usd standards than to waste time by making what should have a ride into a ride there 's nothing more valuable to me using vacation or a business visit than my time especially if in running late to something heck i 'd rather overpay a taxi and arrive on time    so my advice if you do those stops make it very clear right when the passenger gets in do n't try to trick them people are n't stupid let them know they can pay less and spend time going to places you 're basically marketing for or pay more and get to their destination right directly

if you have a 20,000 balance and a 8.75 interest rate you should be paying between $ 145 and $ 150 in interest each month with the balance going to principal   and that times 20,000 is as interest is compounded daily it 'll be a little higher than that   if the minimum is below $ 145 then you are not covering the interest i suspect that is what is happening here and they 're reporting interest paid that was n't covered in a prior month assuming you have some months where you only pay the statement minimum which is less than the total accrued interest assuming you 're in the us or most other western countries your loan servicer should be explaining the exact amount each payment that goes to principal and interest   i recommend calling them up and finding out exactly why it 's not consistent what should be happening assuming you pay more than the amount of interest each month is the interest should go down very slowly each month and the amount paying off principal should go up also slowly   eg etc until eventually the interest is zero and your loan is paid off   it probably wo n't go this quickly for this size of loan you 're only paying off a tiny percentage of principal each month $ or so you wo n't make too much headway at this rate    even adding another $ 25 would make a huge difference to the length of the loan and the amount of interest paid but that 's another story    you will eventually at this rate pay off the loan at $ 200 a month for all 12 months this is n't dissimilar to a 30 year mortgage in terms of percent interest to principal in fact it 's better   $ 50 a month times twelve is $ 600 400 payments would take care of it so a bit over 30 years   however as you go you pay more principal and less interest so you will actually pay it off in 15 years if you continue paying $ 200 a month exactly what you may be seeing in your case is a combination of things in months you pay less ie $ 100 say the extra $ 45 in interest needs to go somewhere   it effectively becomes part of the principal but from what i 've seen that does n't always happen directly ie they account it differently at least for a short time up to a year in my experience this is because of tax laws if i understand correctly the amount you pay in interest is tax deductible but not the amount of the principal so it 's important for you to have as much called interest as possible   thus if you pay $ 100 this month and $ 200 next month that total of $ 300 is paying of interest and $ 10 of principal just as if you 'd paid it $ 150 each month if you had any penalties such as for late payments those come out off the top before interest they may sometimes take that out as well all in all i strongly suggest having an enforced minimum on your end of the interest amount at least that prevents you from being in a situation where your loan grows   if you ca n't always hit $ 200 that 's fine but at least hit $ 150 every single month   otherwise you have a never ending cycle of student loan debt that you really do n't want to be in separately on the $ 1000 payment as long as you make sure it 's not assigned in such a way that the lender only accepts a month 's worth at a time which should n't happen but there are shady lenders it should n't matter what is called principal and what is called interest   the interest wo n't go up just because you 're making a separate payment it 'll go down   the portion that goes to interest will go to paying off the amount of interest you owe from the time of your last payment plus any accrued but unpaid interest plus principal   you wo n't have the option of not paying that interest and it does n't really matter anyway it 's all something you owe and all accruing interest it only really matters for accounting and taxes   double check with your lender on the phone and on their website if possible that overpayments are not penalized and are applied to principal immediately or within a few days anyway and you should be fine

the bank depends on the laws of large numbers   they do n't need to make money on every customer just on average there are several ways that zero interest makes sense to them you asked about banks and i do n't think you see this last scheme in use very much by a bank   here 's why    first customers absolutely hate it and when you drop the interest bomb they will warn their friends away blow you up on social media call the tv news consumer and never ever ever do business with you again   which defeats your efforts in customer acquisition   second it only works on that narrow range of people who default just a little bit i.e. who have an auto pay   if someone really defaults not only will they not pay the punishment interest they wo n't pay the principal either   this only makes sense for secured loans like furniture or cars where you can repo that stuff with unsecured loans you do n't really have any power to force them to pay short of burning their credit   you can sue them but you ca n't get blood from a stone

absolutely in fact all stock purchases of more than 5 of a company 's stock must be reported to the sec so assuming a and b are publicly traded companies in the us the purchase would likely be a matter of public record   there are probably special cases where this could cause problems however any case where a 's purchase of b 's stock or vice versa runs afoul of regulation would be one such case for example if company a wants to own a controlling interest in company b and appoint members of its board of directors and both companies were in the same heavily concentrated market regulators may frown on the potential for decreased competition such regulations may apply to any purchase of a controlling interest in a company though

the are a couple of explanations that i can think of though for determining exactly what is different you will want to print out both returns and compare them line by line to see how they differ if the company up your income to account for the taxes on housing possibly by paying the additional withholding you may be just benefiting from them estimating your tax rate this can especially be the case if your only work was the three month internship they would have to assume your salary was for the entire year there is an earned income tax credit for low wage earners that you may have qualified for it would depend your specific circumstances if you meet the criteria but that credit for a range of income actually pays out more the more you earn to encourage working that extra hour instead of reducing benefit because you had another hour of employment as for the housing subsidy itself while the value is quite high the irs considers that to be a taxable benefit that the employer provided you and so it needs to be added to your w-2 wages $ 8k a month seems quite high but i do n't know the quality of the apartment you were provided and what the going rates are in the area given that you said you worked for a major tech company i can imagine that you might have been working in an area with high rents if the employer did gross up your paycheck so as to cover your taxes that $ 24k would also include that extra tax payment e.g. if the employer paid $ 8k in additional taxes for you then the housing cost that they directly paid were $ 16k

this depends on the jurisdiction but such companies are typically subject to regulations and audits that require them to keep the customers accumulated premiums very strictly separated from the company 's own assets liabilities and expenses additionally they are typically only allowed to invest the capital in very safe things like government bonds so unless something truly catastrophic happens like the us government defaulting on its bonds or people in the company break the regulations which would all kinds of serious crimes and require or complete failure of the auditors your premiums and the contractual obligation to you would still be there and would be absorbed by a different insurance company that takes over the defunct company 's business   realistically what all this means is that insurance companies never go bankrupt if they do badly they are typically bought up by a competitor long before things get that bad

your question reminds me of a will rogers quote buy some good stock and hold it till it goes up then sell it if it do n’t go up do n’t buy it there 's no way to prevent yourself from buying a stock that goes down   in fact all stocks go down at some times   the way to protect your long term investment is to diversify which increases the chances that you have more stocks that go up than go down   so many advisors will encourage index funds which have a low cost which eats away at returns and low rick because of diversification   if you want to experiment with your criteria that 's great and i wish you luck but   note that historically very few managed funds meaning funds that actively buy and sell stocks based on some set of criteria outperform the market over long periods   so do n't be afraid of some of your stocks losing if you diversify enough then statistically you should have more winners than losers it 's like playing blackjack   the goal is not to win every hand the goal is to have more winning hands than losing hands

first off the answer to your question is something everyone would like to know there are fund managers at fidelity who will a pay $ 100 million fee to someone who can tell them a safe way to earn interest the first thing to decide is do you want to save money or invest money if you just want to save your money you can keep it in cash certificates of deposit or gold each has its advantages and disadvantages for example gold tends to hold its value over time and will always have value even if russia switzerland and the swiss franc becomes worthless your gold will still be useful and spendable as alan greenspan famously wrote long ago gold is always accepted if you want to invest money and make it grow yet still have the money fluent which i assume means liquid your main option is a major equity since those can be readily bought and sold i know in your question you are reluctant to put your money at the mercy of one stock but the criteria you have listed match up with an equity investment so if you want to meet your goals you are going to have to come to terms with your fears and buy a stock find a good blue chip stock that is in an industry with positive prospects stay away from stuff that is sexy or hyped focus on just one stock that way you can research it to death the better you understand what you are buying the greater the chance of success zurich financial services is a very solid company right now in a nice boring highly profitable business might fit your needs perfectly they were founded in one of the safest equities you will find nestle is another option is another if you want something a little more risky consider fischer anyway what i can tell you is that your goals match up with a blue chip equity as the logical type of investment note on diversification many financial advisors will advise you to diversify for example by investing in many stocks instead of just one or even by buying funds that are invested in hundreds of stocks or indexes that are invested in the whole market i disagree with this philosophy would you go into a casino and divide your money putting a small portion on each game no it is a bad idea because most of the games have poor returns yet that is exactly what you do when you diversify it is a false sense of safety the proper thing to do is exactly what you would do if forced to bet in casino find the game with the best return get as good as you can at that game and play just that one game that is the proper and smart thing to do

gold has value because for the most of the history of mankind 's use of money gold and silver have repeatedly been chosen by free markets as the best form of money gold is durable portable homogeneous fungible divisible rare and recognizable    until 1971 most of the world 's currencies were backed by gold   in 1971 the us government defaulted on its obligation to redeem us dollars by which most other currencies were backed in gold as agreed to by the bretton woods agreement of 1944   we did n't choose to go off the gold standard we had no choice foreign central banks were demanding in gold and the us did n't have enough we inflated too much    i think that the current swell of interest in gold is due to the recent massive increase in the federal reserve 's balance sheet plus the fast growing national debt plus a looming social security medicare crisis   people are looking for protection of their savings and they wish to opt out of the government bail outs government deficits government run health care and government money printing   they are looking for a currency that does n't have a counter party gold is money and nothing else jp morgan in the absence of the gold standard there is no way to protect savings from confiscation through inflation there is no safe store of value if there were the government would have to make its holding illegal as was done in the case of gold if everyone decided for example to convert all his bank deposits to silver or copper or any other good and thereafter declined to accept checks as payment for goods bank deposits would lose their purchasing power and government created bank credit would be worthless as a claim on goods the financial policy of the welfare state requires that there be no way for the owners of wealth to protect themselves this is the shabby secret of the welfare statists against gold deficit spending is simply a scheme for the confiscation of wealth gold stands in the way of this insidious process it stands as a protector of property rights if one this one has no difficulty in understanding the statists toward the gold standard alan greenspan

regular wire transfer from bank to bank would be the easiest safest and likely the cheapest next to carrying cash over the border method get the swift info from the us bank you want the many land in i believe all of the ones you mentioned support swift wire transfers and give it to your family in china they 'll have to find a local bank that supports swift out going transfers might not be as easy as in the us and send it out from there other more expensive options would be western union moneygram or carrying cash over the border which in these amounts can trigger some questioning from the authorities

former wfm team member here about a decade and still have a lot of store management staff as friends   wfm has always wanted to be the tech company of grocery stores but their implementation strategy has been absolutely worthless and piecemeal due to their method of expansion in in the 90s and early 2000s where they would buy up regional organic grocery chains across the nation and pretty much just integrate them into the company as a separate entity   imagine wfm as really 7 different companies that have almost zero in common with each other from policies to product selection to buyers to computer systems so they 've never been able to get the it part of their business to be effective even though they 've desperately wanted to because every region has had different it that was n't entirely compatible with the others   on top of that they tried to upgrade the current systems to a perpetual inventory system that did not work you ca n't just modify current systems to be fundamentally different from what their original intended function was   with amazon coming in hopefully they can gut the system and start over fresh using wfm 's current regional distribution as a hub for expanding their own product offerings honestly i think amazon was looking at its seattle store with no employees as a prototype for what they could achieve with an actual chain   a lot of what 's holding wfm back on the price of their products is that they huge distribution costs they 're relying on which is in my experience not exactly great if amazon can utilize what they do well inventory management shipping technology and business support services i think they can decrease the cost of their products by the 20 25 target they need to hit to remain competitive in natural and organic foods because right now they 're getting absolutely by kroger trader joe 's walmart sprouts and so many others

gt is your time frame any longer than intraday i imagine you would n't want to carry that risk overnight if you 're a broker or selling a route   most brokers these days are executing in an agent capacity so they 're never holding the risk they execute what they can the customer keeps what they ca n't    gt so say for instance you join a bid a few levels down you are n't really get filled you start hitting the offer and eventually you realize you 're competing with someone for the shares offered so you take out the price level and bid on all the exchanges so that you 're first on the bid at that level then repeat until someone that can match your appetite starts to fill you on the bid   lifting the offer hit bids lift offers and i suppose that 's a albeit a somewhat simple one passive routing strategies differ from firm to firm and algo to algo what is your customer going to think if you bid up a new price level only for the stock to rally completely away from it   gt right so say you need 100k shares there are 10k offered at 9.98 25k offered at 9.99 and 65k at 10.00 you might just enter an sweep order of 100k 10 limit and hope that you can get most of the shares off before everyone can cancel i imagine there has to be a lot of bidding it up to attract sellers and then letting people take out your bids all day   bidding it up to attract sellers sounds an awful lot like wiki just a heads up sure though if you want to tighten a spread or create new levels with aggressive passive liquidity that is a strategy the same caveats as i mentioned above apply   anyway if market impact is n't an issue for the customer sure take liquidity until you 're filled do n't forget about getting good size done in the opening and closing auctions moc if you 're too passive you risk the market moving away from you and pissing off the customer if you 're too aggressive you risk moving the market too much and pissing off the customer

will pull your credit report and perform a hard inquiry on your file this means the inquiry will be noted in your credit report and count against you slightly this is perfectly normal just do n't apply too many times too soon or it can begin to add up they will want proof of your income by asking for recent pay stubs with this information your income and your credit profile they will determine the maximum amount of credit they will lend you and at what interest rate the better your credit profile the more money they can lend and the lower the rate   you want financed the price of the car minus your down payment that is the amount you can apply for and in that case the only factors they will determine are 1 whether or not you will be approved and 2 at what interest rate you will be approved while interest rates generally follow the direction of the prime rate as dictated by the federal reserve there are market fluctuations and variances from one lending institution to the next further different institutions will have different criteria in terms of the amount of credit they deem you worthy of   know the price of the car now determine how much you want to put down and take the difference to a bank or credit union or work directly with the dealer dealers often give special deals if you finance through them a common scenario is 1 a person goes to the car dealer 2 test drives 3 negotiates the purchase price 4 the salesman works the numbers to determine your monthly payment through their own bank pay attention during that last process this is also where they can gain leverage in the deal and make money through the interest rate by offering longer loan terms to maximize their returns on your loan it 's not necessarily a bad thing it 's just how they have to make their money in the deal it 's good to know so you can form your own analysis of the deal and make sure they do n't completely bankrupt you   that you can comfortable afford your monthly payment the car dealers do n't really know how much you can afford they will try to determine to the best they can but only you really know do n't take more than you can afford be conservative about it for example think you can only afford $ 300 a month budget it even lower and make yourself only afford $ 225 a month

a trick that works for some folks pay yourself first have part of your paycheck put directly into an account that you promise yourself you wo n't touch except for some specific purpose eg retirement if that money is gone before it gets to your pocket it 's much less likely to be spent us specific note that if your employer offers a 401k program with matching funds and you are n't taking advantage of that you are leaving free money on the table that does put an additional barrier between you and the money until you retire too in other countries look for other possible matching or tax advantaged savings programs for that matter there are some other possibilities in the us from education savings plans to discounted stock purchase that you could sell immediately for a profit i probably should be signed up for that last

so how often do investors really lose money the short answer is every day let 's first examine your assumptions if the price of the share gets lower the investor can just wait until    it gets higher what are the chances that it wo n't forever or for    years there are many stocks whose price goes down and then down further and then to zero the most apparent example is of course enron the stock went from about $ 90 per share to zero in about 18 months for it to have been sold at $ 90 obviously someone had to buy it almost no matter where they sold it they lost money if they did n't sell it when the stock was worthless they lost money there are more modern examples of companies that are declining in a rapidly changing market for example sears holdings is getting beat down by amazon and many other on line retailers i suspect that if you buy it today and wait for it to go higher you will be disappointed the more common way to lose money is to either not have a plan or not stick to the plan disciplined investors typically plan to buy quality stocks at a fair price and hold them long enough for increasing sales and profits to bring the stock price up if later he hears a bit of bad news about his stock and decides to sell out of panic or fear and become a trader instead of keeping to the plan to remain a disciplined investor he is likely to lose money he will lose because no one can predict accurately that a stock is going down and will never recover nor can he predict accurately when a stock is going up and will never falter the chance of bankruptcy especially for huge companies like apple is    really low as i see it but i may be wrong thousands of people lost billions of dollars thinking that about enron too i too believe apple is a fine stock with excellent prospects but technology changes and markets change twenty or thirty years from now it may be a different case

paying weekly to be able to have maneuver room under your credit limit is a way to handle low credit limits doing it to boost your credit score when you have no immediate need for a loan is wasting energy   a few months in advance of buying a car or house you can start to worry about your utilization rate when you apply for the loan they will pull your credit file and that will lock in your utilization rates then make sure that you pay the balance quickly and if you need to make a big purchase pay the bill before the account closes for the month keep in mind that if you pay the balance every month the highest utilization rate will occur the day the payment is due this is because it not only has all the purchases from the previous bill but all the purchases you have made since that bill closed for example if you have a credit limit of 10 k and you spend 2 k a month on the credit card on the day the payment is due it is not unusual to see the total owed to be above if they pulled your file on that day your utilization rate would appear to be above 30

you can charge a fee to accept checks although i think the better solution might be to offer a small discount for early payment of your invoices   as some people here have suggested why not add a small bit to your fees to begin with to cover your inconvenience in the case they choose to pay by check    i often will give clients a small discount of 1.5 for paying my invoices within 10 days which does motivate some to pay sooner depending on the client and the amount of the invoice   if you 've already added a small amount to your fees in the first place then providing the discount is good public relations that does n't actually cost you anything you can always add a convenience fee for accepting checks but this is a more negative approach as though you 're penalizing the client for paying by check rather than electronically   some people do see it this way despite any efforts you make to explain otherwise as to your question about adding fees for accepting credit cards be very careful   there are sometimes state or local laws on this and you could find yourself in trouble very quickly if you run afoul of one   here 's a good article to read on the subject adding fees for accepting credit cards from site i hope this is helpful good luck

you seem to be assuming that etfs must all work like the more traditional closed end funds where the market price per share tends based on supply and demand to significantly deviate from the underlying net asset value per share the assumption is simplistic what are traditionally referred to as closed end funds cefs where unit creation and redemption are very tightly controlled have been around for a long time and yes they do often trade at a premium or discount to nav because the quantity is inflexible yet what is generally meant when the label etf is used despite cefs also being both exchange traded and funds are those securities which are not just exchange traded and funds but also typically have two specific characteristics a that they are based on some published index and b that a mechanism exists for shares to be created or redeemed by large market participants these characteristics facilitate efficient pricing through arbitrage essentially when large market participants notice the price of an etf diverging from the value of the shares held by the fund new units of the etf can get created or redeemed in bulk the divergence quickly as these participants buy or sell etf units to capture the difference so the persistent premium sometimes dear or discount sometimes deep one can easily witness in the cef universe tend not to occur with the typical etf much of the time prices for etfs will tend to be very close to their net asset value however it is n't always the case so proceed with some caution anyway both cef and etf providers generally publish information about their funds online you will want to find out what is the underlying net asset value nav per share and then you can determine if the market price trades at a premium or a discount to nav assuming little difference in an etf 's price vs. its nav the more interesting question to ask about an etf then becomes whether the nav itself is a bargain or not that means you 'll need to be more concerned with what stocks are in the index the fund tracks and whether those stocks are a bargain or not at their current prices i.e. the etf is a basket so look at each thing in the basket of course most people buy etfs because they do n't want to do this kind of analysis and are happy with market average returns even so sector based etfs are often used by traders to buy or sell entire sectors that may be undervalued or overvalued

as long as you can be trusted with a credit card i find that if you have a setup that uses three accounts 1 your credit card 2 2 a high interest internet account most of these accounts do n’t have fees 3 a savings account   the method that works for me is 1st i calculate my fixed monthly bills i.e rent and utilities and then transfer it into my high interest account   for the month whenever i make a purchase i transfer the money into the high interest account this way i can keep a running balance of what money i have left to spend in the month then when the credit card bill comes i transfer the money out of the high interest account across to pay off the credit card this way you generate interest on the money which you would have spent throughout the month and still maintain $ 0 of interest from the credit card over a year you can generate at least enough money in interest to go out for dinner on one of free flights

there are no on line banks in israel there were various attempts to create something that would look like an online bank comes to mind did something similar recently but that essentially is a branch of a brick and mortar bank and respectively that allows you online management and phone service instead of walking into a branch not a replacement for a traditional bank thus there are no significant operational savings for the banks through which they could have afforded higher savings rates i agree with the other that the banking system in israel is very well regulated but i agree with you also it is not competitive at all that said at the current inflation rate and the current strength of the currency the that you have is actually pretty good israel has no interest in paying high rates on incoming money since its currency is too strong and it hurts exports so do n't expect much at home on this issue opening an account outside of israel poses a different problem tax reporting you 'll have to file an annual tax return and pay your taxes on the interest you earn something most israelis never have to do that will cost you and will probably eat up much if not all of the gain also currency fluctuations will hurt you as no one will open an account in outside of israel and you 'll have to convert back and forth in fact the first thing to happen when the rates in israel go up would be for the currency to go down so whatever you might gain abroad will disappear when you actually decide to move the money back and you will still be taxed on the interest income ca n't deduct capital loss from interest income your options as i see them are either the stock market or the bonds market or more likely a mix in israel the bonds similar to the us t bills short term bonds are called and you can either invest in them directly or through mutual funds these are traded at and can be held for free banks are not allowed to charge you for holding them they 're taxed at lower rates than capital gains 15 vs 25 during the times of low interest these may provide much better alternative than bank savings

to your secondary question appropriately consider all estimated numbers involved with keeping the house compared to your closest estimate of what the home could sell for weigh out the pros and cons yourself as a stranger will not be able to 100 appreciate what you value and dislike   remember to include insurances taxes and the actual mortgage payment depending on how you also plan to rent out the property include whichever utilities you intend to cover if any   there will also be costs for property management and upkeep as things will break overtime and tenants will not hesitate to get you or your management to fix them either way that means you are paying i would also keep in mind while homes typically appreciate in value there is a higher risk with tenants for the value to depreciate to damages and poor upkeep   there are increased legal risks to renting so be sure you have properly vetted whichever management you are going with   in extreme circumstances you also could be required to retain an attorney to defend yourself again litigation because whichever management team you hire will most likely defend themselves and not include you in that umbrella   my family lives in the la area as well and a judge refused to throw out an obvious frivolous suit when my parents attempted to rent out a house   the possible renters after signing the main paperwork never showed to finish a second set of documents for renting   parents immediately declined to rent to these people as they missed something so important without any explanation and they sued claiming racism emotional damages and some other really crazy things despite my parents never having met them first meeting was between property management and renters only personally and professionally i would only suggest renting our the place and not selling if you can turn a profit after all the above mentioned costs if renters are only paying to keep the property in the black you have yourself a non earning asset which will be damaged over time and require repairs which will come out of your pocket   also while the property is you also must remember it is not earning at that time much of this may sound obvious etc i simply wish to provide my family 's experience to help you in making your decisions    best of luck with your endeavor edit   also you will be required to report all earned rental income on your taxes they will fall under the schedule e and possibly k-1 area   i would strongly recommend consulting with an actual accountant about the impacts to you

in my experience financial advisors do not normally assist with budgeting and personal everyday finance there certainly are people who do that but you would normally only consult them when you have financial difficulties especially debt the more common find of financial advisor is mostly focussed on advising you about savings and investments a lot work for banks and investment companies they will usually advise you for free the downside being that they will only recommend their company 's products this may or may not be a bad thing depending on the company others will charge you a commission on purchases and their advice will be more neutral this question will also be interesting are all financial advisors compensated in the same way

if you think you can manage the risk and the spread is ultimately worth it to you there 's nothing stopping you i know in the u.s. in ca specifically you need to have $ 85,000 annual income or net worth over some threshold to be able to loan more than $ 2,500 via peer to peer loan investing   i 've had an account at prosper since around 2010 it does pretty well   it 's made my taxes a bit more complicated each year but it 's been profitable for me   i would n't lever up on it though my prosper experience my experience with prosper has generally been positive   my real motivation for starting the account was generating a dataset that i could analyze here 's some of that analysis i started the account by trickling $ 100 in to buy four $ 25 loans   any payments received from these loans were used to buy more $ 25 loans   i 've kept my risk to an average of about a- aa a b c d e hr are the grades though the interest rates have reduced over time   at this point i have a few hundred loans outstanding in various stages of completion   in calendar 2015 i had a monthly average of 0.75 of my loans charged off and about 3 of loans at some stage of delinquency    i receive about 5.5 of my principle value in receipts on average each month including loan pay offs and charge offs   interest and other non principle payments comprise just shy of 20 of my monthly receipts   prosper 's 1 maintenance fee translates to about 8 of my monthly non principle receipts   it 's all a pretty fine line it would n't take many defaults to turn my annual return negative though in 5 years it has n't happened yet   considering only monthly charge offs against monthly non principle receipts i had two net negative months in 2015   i made about a net 4.5 annual return on my average monthly outstanding principle for calendar 2015   when i log in to my prosper account it claims my return   is closer to 7.5 i 'm not sure how that number is calculated the key is diversifying your risk just like a bank would   i do n't know how the other services function at a nuts and bolts level   with prosper i choose which loans to fund which means i determine my risk level   i assume the other services function similarly    regarding collection of charged off loans   i do n't know how much real effort is by prosper   i 've had a few notes sold for about 10 of the outstanding balance and i do n't know who they were sold to   comically i have loan that 's made more payments in collections than when it was in good standing   there is definitely more to this than handing over $ 15,000 and receiving 6 on it

it depends on the size of the payroll not on the number of employees   probably you need to file form 941 quarterly under this scenario   you may or may not need to deposit taxes more frequently   if you must deposit then you need to do it electronically i this from the instructions for form 941 if your total taxes line 10 are less than $ 2,500 for    the current quarter or the preceding quarter and you    did not incur a $ 100,000 next day deposit obligation    during the current quarter you do not have to make a deposit to avoid a penalty you must pay the amount in full with a timely filed return or you must deposit the amount timely if you are not sure your total tax liability for the current quarter will be less than $ 2,500 and your liability for the preceding quarter was not less than $ 2,500 make deposits using the or monthly rules so you wo n't be subject to failure to deposit penalties if your total taxes line 10 are $ 2,500 or more for the    current quarter and the preceding quarter   you must    make deposits according to your deposit schedule see    section 11 of pub 15 circular e for information and rules    about federal tax deposits i would say that probably for two employees you need to deposit by the 15th of each month for the prior month but you really need to check the limits above and the deposit schedule in pub 15 as referenced above based on your actual payroll size note that if you have a requirement to deposit that must be done either through or by wire transfer   the former is free but requires registration in advance of your first payment they mail you a pin that you need to log in and it requires that you get your payment in by the night before   the latter does not incur a charge from the irs but your bank will likely charge you a fee   you can do the wire transfer on the due date however so it 's handy if do n't get into in time this is all for federal   you may also need to deposit for your state and then you 'll need to check the state 's rules

the finance buff discusses why the roth 401k is often disadvantaged compared to a traditional 401k in the article the case against the roth 401k including the following reasons paraphrased contributions to the 401k come from the top of your highest tax bracket rate but withdrawals fill in from the bottom   for example suppose you are in the 28 tax bracket   every marginal dollar you contribute to the traditional 401k reduces your tax burden by cents   however when withdrawing the first $ of income is tax free from standard deduction and exemption 2014 numbers $ for married couples joint filing   the next dollars are at the 10 tax bracket and so on   this is an advantage for the traditional 401k only if you earn less when withdrawing than you did when contributing a reasonable assumption avoid high state income tax there are many states that have low or no state income tax   if you live in a state with a high income tax paying tax now through the roth 401k reduces the benefit of moving to a state with a lower income tax rate avoid triggering credit many tax credits e.g. student loan interest child tax credit hope credit roth ira eligibility etc begin phasing out as your income increases   contributing to the traditional 401k can help you realize more of those credits when you starting running up against those limits as described in the article if these items do n't apply contributing to the roth 401k can be a valuable component of tax diversification

since you mentioned £ there 's a good chance you 're in the uk the uk is something of an anomaly in the world in so much as you do n't need to use because you can spread bet the principle is ultimately the same you 're making a bet that the price will change in your favour as others have said this is n't investment and is n't a good idea if you do n't know what you 're doing it 's a possibly risky way into the field because your losses can exceed your deposit it 's generally pretty short term and so is highly susceptible to unpredictable temporary market fluctuation real investing is usually longer term and so based on the general trend of the market which is generally less difficult to predict that said half way decent spread betting companies will check you out pretty thoroughly before you start they 'll offer a demo account where you can trade with fake money ie you make no deposit and can make no withdrawals until you 're comfortable some do training courses and seminars too when you first start trading for real you 'll need to put a stop loss on every trade and thus mostly avoid the problem of losing more than you it 's still possible to lose more than you with a stop loss but in most cases your excess loss wo n't be just eye watering i worked for one such spread betting company a good honest one at that we once had an internal competition using demo accounts the aim was to make as much money as you could in a two week period i think we started with £ 10,000 each a couple of people made a decent looking amount of money in that time but dozens more of us lost at least all of the money it is possible to make money but there 's a far far greater chance you 'll lose all you 're prepared to stake and maybe more also using a demo account is very different from using real money no matter how much you tell yourself it is n't

the ideal world index fund of any asset class is a perfect percentage holding of all underlying assets with immediate rebalancing that aligns to every change in the index weighting while trading in a fully liquid market with zero transaction costs one finance text book that describes this is introduction to finance markets investments and financial management see chapter 11   practically the transaction costs and liquidity make this there are several deviations between what the ideal world algorithm the algorithm says you should do and what is actually done each of these items addresses a real world solution to various costs of managing a passive index fund and they are good solutions however any deviation from the ideal index fund will have a risk an investor evaluating their choices is left to pick the lowest fees with the least deviation from the ideal index fund it is customary to ignore whether the results are in excess or deficit to the ideal so your formula is this is also described in the above book

tl;dr there is no silver bullet you have to decide how much to invest and when on your own   averaging down definition definition of average down the process of buying additional shares in a company at lower prices than you originally purchased this brings the average price you 've paid for all your shares down breaking down average down sometimes this is a good strategy other times it 's better to sell off a beaten down stock rather than buying more shares   so let us tackle your questions at what percentage drop of the stock price should i buy more shares ex should i wait for the price to fall by 5 or 10 to buy more it depends on the behaviour of the security and the issuer is it near its historical minimum how healthy is the issuer there is no set percentage you can maximize your gains or your losses if the security does not rebound investopedia the strategy is often favored by investors who have a long term investment horizon and a contrarian approach to investing a contrarian approach refers to a style of investing that is against or contrary to the prevailing investment trend   on the other side of the coin are the investors and traders who generally have shorter term investment horizons and view a stock decline as a of things to come these investors are also likely to espouse trading in the direction of the prevailing trend rather than against it they may view buying into a stock decline as akin to trying to catch a falling knife your second question how many additional shares should i buy ex initially i bought 10 shares should i buy or 20 that depends on your portfolio allocation before and after averaging down and your investor profile risk take care when putting more money on a falling security if your portfolio allocation shifts too much that may expose you to risks you should n't be taking you are assuming a risk for example if the market bears down like 2008 averaging down or doubling up works well when the stock eventually rebounds because it has the effect of magnifying gains but if the stock continues to decline losses are also magnified in such cases the investor may the decision to average down rather than either exiting the position or failing to add to the initial holding   one of the pitfalls of averaging down is when the security does not rebound and you become too attached to be able to cut your losses and move on also if you are bullish on a position be careful not to slip the i down and add a t on said position invest with your head not your heart

banks work pretty hard to make themselves a big part of your life with bill pay auto deposit loans and other services   you need to carefully unwind each one and be on the lookout for fees   if you close a savings account will your checking account suddenly have fees   if you stop auto deposit will there suddenly be a fee do you have a business that deposits money   a google ad sense account   paypal or the equivalent   these all might be tied to your bank accounts wait a couple of months leaving enough cash in the old back to prevent fees if possible   if two months go by and there is n't any activity on the account you can probably close it after you are sure all the written checks have cleared go to the back and get a counter check for the balance of the account    you could alternately just write yourself one more check for the remaining balance and call the bank to close the account   you could electronically transfer the funds if you wanted too   however it is important to be careful of the timing the last thing you want to do is write a check or transfer the money after the account is closed per dilip sarwate if you do the check and phone call thing make sure you do it in a short enough period of time that you do n't incur a fee having and closing regular bank accounts wo n't have any tax implications in the us

your questions in the world of technical analysis is candlestick charting an effective trading tool in timing the markets it depends on how you define effective but as a standalone and systematic strategy it tends not to be profitable see for example market timing with candlestick technical analysis using robust statistical techniques we find that candlestick trading rules are not profitable when applied to djia component stocks over period neither bullish or bearish candlestick single lines or patterns provide market timing signals that are any better than what would be expected by chance basing ones trading decisions solely on these techniques does not seem sensible but we can not rule out the possibility that they compliment some other market timing techniques there are many other papers that come to the same conclusion if used correctly how accurate can they be in picking turning points in the market technical analysts generally fall into two camps i those that argue that ta ca n't be fully automated and that interpretation is part of the game ii those that use ta as part of a systematic investment model automatically executed by a machine but generally use a combination of indicators to build a working model both groups would argue for different reasons that the conclusions of the paper i quoted above should be disregarded and that ta can be applied profitably with the proper framework psychological biases it is very easy to get impressed by technical analysis because we all suffer from confirmation bias whereby we tend to acknowledge things that confirm our beliefs more than those that contradict them when looking at a chart it is very easy to see all the when a certain pattern worked and miss the when it did not work and not missing those is much harder than it sounds conclusions

who sets the prices effectively the market does like basically all openly traded things the greek government could well have said 5 is as high as we will go   as a result investors may not have chosen to buy the securities   the global bond market is highly liquid and investors who have a choice could well then choose to go elsewhere the reasons could well be varied but primary among them would be that investors view greek investments as more than 5 risky   if i can get 5 from a country that i deem less risky than from greece my choice is clear   therefore to be compensated for loaning them my money i am expecting a return of 7 because there is the possibility that they will default as for not selling them at all if they could avoid issuing bonds most governments would   they may not have had much of a choice   if they just print more money that does other potentially bad things to the economy   the government needs funds to operate if they are not collecting enough in taxes for example and do not want to print money as i mentioned then bonds are one other common way to raise cash notwithstanding that in your example you are referring to the interest rate not the price the principal is the same

no there is no asset associated with your short position so there 's nothing to gift the short position in the stock is purely a liability when you note that you have a profit in the position what you mean is that the cash you made when you shorted the stock is more than enough to cover the short position the only asset in this picture then is the cash you made when you entered the short position

in the other question the op had posted a screenshot circa 2010 from transunion with suggestions on how to improve the op 's credit score   one of these suggestions was to obtain retail revolving accounts   by this they are referring to credit accounts from a particular retail store   stores have been offering credit accounts for many years and today this usually takes the form of a store credit card   the credit card does not have the visa or mastercard logo on it and is only valid at that particular store   for example target has their own credit card that only works at target stores   the revolving part simply means that it is an open account that you can continue to make new charges and pay off as opposed to a fixed retail financing loan such as you might get at a high end furniture store where you obtain a loan for a single piece of furniture and when it is paid off the account is closed the formula for credit scores are proprietary secrets   however i have n't read anything that indicates that a store credit card helps your credit score more than a standard credit card   i suspect that transunion was offering this tip in an attempt to give the consumer more ideas of how to add credit cards to their account that the consumer might not have thought of   but it is possible that buried deep in the credit score formula there is something in there that gives you a higher score if you have a store credit card as an aside the op in the other question had a credit score of and was trying to make it higher   in my opinion this is pointless   remember that the financial services industry has an incentive to sell you as much debt as possible and so all of their advice will point to you getting more credit accounts and getting more in debt

agreed with the ceo that it is cases like this encouraging people to live beyond their means that popped the housing bubble    but we ca n't mention that without also mentioning the what maybe thirty year stupid profits people were making off the underlying financial tool of packaging sub prime mortgages together and selling them as securities and the eventual derivatives of that foundational and ultimately bubble causing tool    i 'd say it was a good model to all the hundreds of thousand of people that profited from it and the thousands who each individually made hundreds of millions of dollars and the many people that got out of the bubble on the way down    that being said and the obvious connotation that from their perspective long running bubbles like the specific one mentioned are in aggregate good for the institutions that use them then simply using tools that cause bubbles to burst is n't in itself bad and is usually good for the reasons i stated on average    the that it 's also a blog wow very almost machine learning sophisticated i really like this piece from that perspective i mean doctor oz is a sophisticated but this is possibly better nah doctor oz is a better con    i 'm going have to look up the criticism by those two newspaper heads you mentioned and yes good publicity from multiple angles this is a sophisticated weighted algorithm thing    finally you know the negative of this thing also work to it 's benefit it 's a formula i 've studied in mass marketing where you can rely on the law of large numbers the things that are slightly increase efficacy once you see it you might well be horrified like when you study or the human in all it 's magnificent    the example walt mickey mouse seth this fact when he literally pulled the gloves off a similar cartoon mouse like character    i saw it on a box of too it was in barney eyes

you can always trade at bid or ask price depending if you are selling or buying market price is the price the last transaction was executed at so you may not be able to get that if your order is large then you may not even be able to get bid ask but should look at the depth of the order book ie what prices are other market participants asking for and what is the size of their order usually only fast traders will trade at bid ask those who believe the price move is imminent if you are a long term trader you can often get better than bid or ask by placing a limit order and waiting until a market participant takes your offer

you should hire a lawyer the fact that they told you your personal information shows that they actually had it and are not which is a good thing the fact that they mislead you means that their intentions are not pure which is not surprising coming from a collection agency of course when dealing with collections or any matter of significance for that matter do n't rely on their recording of the call because they can always conveniently lose it make sure to write down every single detail discussed including the date and time of the call and the id name of the person on the other side if possible make your own recording notifying them of it of course it 's too late to record the calls now but do try to as much information as possible to provide to your lawyer to deal with it in the end of the day they will either provide you with the recording and then you might be surprised to hear that what they said was not in fact what you thought they said and it was just your wishful thinking it is very possible to be indeed the case or claim we lost it and then it will be a problem to either of you to prove who said what but they 'll have the better hand having better lawyers in convincing the court that you 're the one trying to avoid paying your debts that is why proper representation at all stages is important as to the bankruptcy it wo n't help for student loans student loans is one of the very few types of debts you ca n't really run away from you have to solve this the sooner the better get a professional advice for the future and for the other readers you should have gotten the professional advice before defaulting on these loans and certainly after the first call

in some cases perhaps but in others not   several homes near me were sold over and over again during the bubble years at incrementally higher and higher sale prices the last owners in nearly all cases defaulted and the banks after dragging their feet for a couple of years finally foreclosed and sold the homes off cheap   in all but one of the distressed sale cases the people buying the houses now are in fact moving into them as their primary home the exception being a current resident who bought the adjacent home with the intentions of fixing it up amp renting it out i believe at least initially to a family member but in all cases in no small part due to the fact that they were able to purchase the properties cheap these new owners are investing substantial money into fixing them up new roof amp gutters new windows amp doors paint and/or siding often all new some landscaping etc   also from the perspective of our homeowners association all of these new people think our annual hoa fees are a bargain whereas the previous bubble era homeowners if having invested almost nothing they could truly be called that did nothing but whine and complain well and once they began defaulting on their mortgages they also defaulted on their hoa fees   so it 's a win win for our neighborhood we 're getting good solid residents who are planning on taking care of their properties the exact opposite of what you are claiming    the house flippers you decry were the ones buying with no money down during the bubble era and they nearly killed the neighborhood

# 322049
i think this question is very nearly off topic for this site but i also believe that a basic understanding of the why the tax structure is what it is can help someone new to investing to understand their actual tax liability the attempt at an answer i provide below is from a canadian us context but should be similar to how this is viewed elsewhere in the world first note that capital gains today are much more fluid in concept than even 100 years ago when the personal income tax was first introduced to pay for wwi a capital gain was viewed as a very deliberate action the permanent sale of property capital gains were not taxed at all initially in canada until 1971 under the view that income taxes would have been paid on income earning assets all along through interest dividends and rent and therefore taxing capital gains would be a form of double taxation this active permanent sale was also viewed as an action that an investor would need to work for therefore it was seen as foolish to prevent investors from taking positive economic action redistributing their capital in the most effective way simply to avoid the tax however today because of favourable taxation on capital gains many financial products attempt to package and sell capital gains to investors for example many canadian mutual funds buy and sell investments to earn capital gains and distribute those capital gains to the owners of the mutual fund this is no longer an active action taken by the investor it is simply a function of passive investing the line between what is a dividend and what is a capital gain has been blurred by these and similar advanced financial products to the casual investor there is no practical difference between receiving dividends or capital gain distributions except for the tax impact the notional gain realized on the sale of property includes inflation consider a rental property bought in 1930 for $ 100,000 and sold in 1960 for $ 180,000 assuming inflation between 1930 and 1960 was 70 in 1960 dollars the property was effectively bought for this means the true gain after accounting for inflation is only $ 10k but the notional gain is $ 80k meaning a tax on that capital gain would be almost entirely a tax on inflation this is viewed by many as being unfair as it does not actually represent true income i will pause to note that any tax on any investment at all taxes inflation interest for example is taxed in full even though it can be almost entirely inflationary depending on economic conditions a tax on capital gains may restrict market liquidity a key difference between capital gains and interest rent dividends is that other forms of investment income are taxed annually if you hold a bond you get taxed on interest from that bond you can not gain value from a bond deferring tax until the date it matures at least in canada you are deemed to accrue bond interest annually even if it is a 0 coupon bond   however what if interest rates have gone down increasing the value of your bond and you want to sell it to invest in a business you may choose not to do this to avoid tax on that capital gain if it were taxed as much as regular income you might be even more inclined to never sell any asset until you absolutely have to thus restricting the flow of capital in the market i will pause here again to note that laws could be enacted to minimize capital gains tax as long as the money is reinvested immediately thus reducing this impact   political inertia lobbying from key interests has a significant impact on the tax structure for investments the fact remains that the capital gains tax is most significantly an impact on those with accrued wealth it would take significant public support to increase capital gain tax rates for any political party to enact such laws when you get right down to it tax laws are complex and hard to push in the public eye the general public barely understands that their effective tax rate is far lower than their top marginal tax rate any tax increases at all are often viewed negatively even by those who would never personally pay any of that tax due to lack of investment income therefore such changes are typically made quietly and with some level of bi partisan support if you feel the capital gains tax rules are illogical just add it to the pile of such tax laws that exist today

a lot may depend on the nature of a buyout sometimes it 's is for stock and cash sometimes just stock or in the case of this google deal all cash    since that deal was used we 'll discuss what happens in a cash buyout if the stock price goes high enough before the buyout date to put you in the money pull the trigger before the settlement date in some cases it might be pulled for you see below   otherwise once the buyout occurs you will either be done or may receive adjusted options in the stock of the company that did the buyout not applicable in a cash buyout typically the price will approach but not exceed the buyout price as the time gets close to the buyout date if the buyout price is above your option strike price then you have some hope of being in the money at some point before the buyout just be sure to exercise in time you need to check the fine print on the option contract itself to see if it had some provision that determines what happens in the event of a buyout   that will tell you what happens with your particular options    for example joe taxpayer just amended his answer to include the standard language from cboe on it 's options which if i read it right means if you have options via them you need to check with your broker to see what if any special exercise settlement procedures are being imposed by cboe in this case

you ca n't defer reporting of the rrsp purchases   the financial institution will report those purchases to cra and the cra expects to see you report those purchases on your return   if they do n't match expect to be audited and to pay penalties   however you can defer the tax deduction of those purchases until later years that means you but you must have the rrsp contribution room available in the year you make the purchase   so if you have $ 50 000 of contribution room you can contribute $ 50 000 all at once and deduct $ 16 in the next 3 years   however if you only have $ 20 000 of contribution room cra will make your life very unhappy if you contribute $ 50 000 all at once   in that case your best bet is to contribute enough to use all your contribution room and repeat each year as you get more contribution room also you have a $ 2000 lifetime overcontribution limit   that means whatever contribution room you have you can contribute $ 2000 more   but you wo n't be able to deduct that amount and you do n't get more overcontribution space each year

contrary to muro 's answer which strangely shows a graph of the fed 's balance sheet and not the money supply the supply of us dollars has never doubled in a few days   this graph from wikipedia shows m2 which is the wider measure of money supply to have doubled over approximately 10 years the answer to whether gold has a higher chance of experiencing big devaluation has to do with forces outside anyone 's control if a big new mine of gold is discovered that could affect prices but also if the economy turns around it could lead investors to pull out of gold and back into the stock markets the usd on the other hand is under control of the policy makers at the fed who have a dual mandate to keep inflation and unemployment low the fed seems to have gotten better over the last 30 years at controlling inflation and the dollar has not experienced big inflation since the 70s inflation as measured by core cpi has been maintained at less than 4 for the last 20 years and is currently coming off record low levels below 1

although this is n't related to homes directly as an it professional i know that wind power tends to be cost effective to the point that many data centers the massive buildings holding the servers that are the backbone of the internet actually invest in their own wind turbines to slash costs since servers tend to be power as far as going off the grid that ultimately depends on how much wind sun you 're getting at your residence but if you look at places like dallas pa ca and other areas where   the major hosts place centers they 're typically in areas where there 's plenty of sunlight or wind going back to small scale thinking however one of my contacts actually leases a building in pa where he has a few server racks and while he currently has electric there he also owns a couple of turbines which have been < 60 of the demand and he 's actually planning to add solar and also feed that back to the grid at a profit so overall wind solar definitely has the potential for a decent roi at both large and small levels but performance will vary greatly from area to area   i know that lowes actually started advertising about carrying solar panels so going in and asking about the performance and if you can arrange an audit of your home might be a good place to start if you google green audits i 'm sure you can find a trillion companies specializing in green power but as with any sales rep including at lowe 's i 'd do some due diligence so you do n't get taken for a ride and also to check references because i do n't think green audit companies have any official certifications standards

a debenture is a security document this means that the bond is secured over assets under english law you can issue bonds which if defaulted upon you can enforce your security against the issuer i.e. the company which means you can attempt to get your money back by getting hold of the company 's assets    as for a floating charge i 'll first explain what a fixed charge is say you 're a bank a lender and you lend £ 1000 to x. you take security by way of a fixed charge over x 's photocopy machines x is unable to dispose of the machines without the lender 's consent this means that if x can not pay up the loan you can enforce security by taking possession of the photocopy machines sell them and hopefully get enough money back to cover the default   a floating charge works the same way but over assets which fluctuate e.g. x 's stock of potatoes x sells potatoes to supermarkets all the time so you ca n't just take a fixed charge over it for practical reasons you ca n't just ask the lender each time you want to sell a potato when an event of default occurs i.e. you do n't pay back the loan or breach a condition of the loan agreement the floating charge and becomes a fixed charge thus enabling the lender to sell the potatoes to get their money back   random examples but makes sense   source future english solicitor

gt because the cost in the past was still going to keep most people out of university   trust me anyone with excellent grades got in the university for free or almost for free back then and if they had to take a loan i doubt it the costs of universities was much much less than today no major debt   gt finishing high school was never as hard as you suggest and did n't guarantee you any sort of job   there is no way no way that today 's high school kids can pass math and english tests from 20 30 or before that no way   gt overall high school graduation rates in 1968 were 5 lower than they were in 2004   because there was discipline in 1968 and if you graduated you really got education discipline manners focus and the desire to work hard to get results   do you really believe that today 's high will survive a 1968 high school yes or no   do you doubt what i said that 30 + years ago you did not need a ba degree to get a job as a teller in the bank   in 1968 a warehouse worker could support a large family with the wife being a try it today am i right   in 1968 with a ba degree with almost no exception you are guaranteed a very well paying job and excellent career prospects am i right

it looks like there 's some confusion about the purchase price and vat you should pay your supplier the total amount £ 10 + vat in this scenario so £ 12 look for this figure on the invoice or receipt the supplier does n't normally expect you to work this out for yourself so i 'd be a little surprised if it 's not on there as dumbcoder 's said you 'd then be able to claim the vat back from hmrc if you were vat registered but seeing as you 're not then you do n't need to worry about claiming it and as for selling the product without vat you can and probably should increase the unit price to cover the extra cost otherwise you 'll be operating at a loss hope this helps

the belief that you need elites to set rules for you safety nets to protect you men with guns to discipline you and that its ok to use violent force to enforce your rules is self hatred at its very fundamental level   you may need all those things i do not

gt soooo those and happening on a daily basis are irrational fear because it did n't happen to you right   those and are an irrational fear because it is incredibly improbable   the fire alone will likely kill more people than terrorism in the uk for the past 20 years combined 79 dead and climbing vs 89 deaths to terror since 2000   terrorism is a more complex problem than a shouting ban all muslims if that 's not utilizing fear i do n't know what is especially since white terror attacks are conveniently ignored by trump

i just returned from overseas and for the most part it is n't tsa that s the worst part its the other parts that get added on in comparison if i fly through to another country in europe my items are checked through i 'll wait 15 minutes to get my passport stamped and stand in line for my plane if you land in america from international you have to wait through customs i just waited 1.5 hours but i know that s not standard then i had to get my bags and them through the airline and finally i had to go through security yet again except this time instead of having to take things out of my pockets i had to remove my shoes take everything out of my pockets and then get a complete body scan not sure how i feel about those yet though i know many on here hate them    it really is just more inconvenient and seemingly unnecessary

netflix is targeting 50 in house content within the next few news content original programming   it says right now it is about 1/3 of the way there which to me works out to about 16.5   so maybe rarely was n't the right word but a large majority of the content it streams is not in house

finance at the phd level requires a pretty complete understanding of linear algebra calc vector calc stochastic calc diff eq and numerical analysis   as someone who had math for one of his majors for undergrad it 's not about the intuitive understanding but the abstract as well   most of the finance professors that i had and researched under were originally undergrad for math   very few of them actually started out in business roles degrees

there seems to be a common sentiment that no investor can consistently beat the market on returns what evidence exists for or against this first off even if the markets were entirely random there would be individual investors that would consistently beat the market throughout their lifetime entirely by luck   there are just so many people this is a statistical certainty   so let 's talk about evidence of beating the market due to persistent skill i should hedge by saying there is n't a lot of good data here as most understandably most individual investors do n't give out their investment information but there are some ok datasets   there is weak evidence for instance that the best individual investors keep outperforming and interestingly that the trading of individual investors can predict future market movements   though the evidence is more clear that individual investors make a lot of mistakes and that these winning portfolios are not from commonly available strategies and involve portfolios that are much riskier than most   would recommend is there really no investment strategy that would make it likely for this investor to consistently outperform her benchmark there are so many papers many reasonable even out there about how to outperform benchmarks especially risk adjusted basis   not too mention some advisers with great track records and a sea of questionable websites   you can even copy most of what buffet does if you want remember though that the average investor by definition makes the average market return and then pays fees on top of that   if there is a strategy out there that is obviously better than the market and a bunch of people start doing it it quickly becomes expensive to do and becomes part the market   if there was a proven easy to implement way to beat the market everyone would do it and it would be the market so why is it that on this site or elsewhere whenever an active trading strategy is discussed that potentially beats the market there is always a claim that it probably wo n't work to start with there are a large number of clearly bad ideas posed here and elsewhere   sometimes though the ideas might be good and may even have a good chance to beat the market   like so many of the portfolios that beat the market though and they add a lot of uncertainty and in particular for this personal finance site risk that the person will not be able to live comfortably in retirement there is so much uncertainty in the market and that is why there will always be people that consistently outperform the market but at the same time why there will be few if any strategies that will outperform consistently with any certainty
